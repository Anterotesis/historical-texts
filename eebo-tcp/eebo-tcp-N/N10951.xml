            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE poiſons which have lately been too la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly ſcattered among you, call aloud for an antidote; and by their operations they appear to be of ſo deadly a kind as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the immediate counteraction of ſome powerfully efficient recipe; till ſuch an one is produced, a leſs forcible preſcription may, by ſtopping their progreſs, be found ſalutary.</p>
            <p>Of late two pamphlets have appeared, the authors of which the contending parties of this country ſeem to conſider as the invulnerable champions of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent principles and intereſts, and each has therefore naturally attracted the attention of its friends and oppoſers; but the zeal of the whigs, in diſperſing abroad their boaſted and favourite production, has far outſtripped that of the tories, who perhaps, not conſidering an appeal to the head as ſo adapted to the purpoſes of party as one to the heart, have not inſerted the Friendly Addreſs in a News-Paper;—have not conſiderably reduced its price; or ſent it abroad gratis, as a ſtimulus to their friends<note n="*" place="bottom">It is obſervable in theſe impreſſions, deſigned for general uſe, it has been thought adviſeable to omit one of the beſt turned and beſt deſerved compliments to an officer of high rank, that, in the compaſs of a ſmall reading, I as yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have ſeen:—Such inſiduous arts, and ſuch want of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor are inex<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

being the honours which party has conferred on the ſtrictures on that performance, it may not be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſing or unprofitable to examine on what founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this boaſted bulwark of faction is erected. This writer, like a true diſciple of the noble author of the Characteriſtics, tries every thing by the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of ridicule; but does he know that it can place all ſubjects, even the ſacred precepts and myſteries of our holy religion, in the ſame point of view; and like the jaundiced eye, ſeeing through a tainted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, reduce all objects, however varied in colours, to its own loathſome hue? He commences with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſcovery from unerring ſigns, of his antagoniſt's profeſſion; but I much query if any one, from his ſubſequent obſervations, would be induced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him a ſoldier.</p>
            <p>The friends of Britiſh government in America are, I truſt, not ſo contemptible as the picture of this ſtricturer would ludicrouſly diſplay them; many have already declared their attachment to its cauſe, and fifty times their numbers, at preſent overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by popular fury, would in the day of trial avow it: I wiſh not to ſee <hi>royal ſtandards erected or ſwords flaming in the front and in the rear,</hi> but alas! the melancholy face of affairs on this continent too ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indicates it; and then I am convinced the regular troops would not on experience be found ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible as he endeavours to repreſent them; or that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony forces could be ſo eaſily raiſed and diſciplined as he aſſerts: A <hi>ſimplification</hi> of manoeuvres that can be learnt in <hi>three months,</hi> will not bring you, Americans, to that ſteadineſs, that you ſhall with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and compoſure, like the Engliſh troops at Fontenoy, evolute in the face of a victorious and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior army: For my part, I will go further than
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013863_0005_0F925D414500BF18"/>
even this rapid inſtructor, and engage to teach ſchool-boys, with wooden guns on their ſhoulders, <hi>to form and reduce from a line of fire to a line of impreſſion</hi> in half an hour; but to train men for war requires la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, experience and time; and to reduce them to perfect ſubmiſſion to every ſuperior, is with difficulty effected in legal eſtabliſhments, never in popular and tumultuous aſſociations; deprived of that coerſive power which in the former produces obedience, their leaders in vain ſeek by attentions and courteſies that compliance with their commands which the others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from eſtabliſhed undiſputed authority.</p>
            <p>A yeomanry like the American, the moſt happy and comfortable of any in the world, are but ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſupport the fatigues, dangers and wants of long campaigns; they would ſoop miſs thoſe ſolaces which domeſtic tranquility afforded them, and would revert to their priſtine avocations and delights; their acquaintance with the uſe of implements of husbandry would ſtand them in but little ſtead, for to what purpoſe ſhould they employ them? It has long been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a principle in war, that irregulars are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for defence, but attack; their vigour and intrepidity may bear down all obſtacles to the latter, but too ſurely they will fail in that patience and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance which is indiſpenſably requiſite for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. When the New-England provincials, under General Pepperrell, in the year forty-five, attacked Louisbourg, they laughed at the regular methods of approach propoſed to them, and by a concurrence of fortunate circumſtances, united to valour, carried that important fortreſs; this is a fact which many of them can vouch, and moſt if not all the reſt of them have heard repeatedly from their fathers, when recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the archievements of their youthful days; and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013863_0006_0F925D432DED0A78"/>
they muſt then have alſo told them, that the petulance of their brave countrymen was more than once on the point of giving up that glorious enterpriſe.—Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore, I adjure you, by thoſe ties and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which endear life, and ſtrow flowers along the rugged path of its pilgrimage; conſider, before you engage in an attempt of ſo ſerious, ſo hazardous a nature, as the oppoſing a royal and long conſtituted army, what may reaſonably be expected from forces ſo liable to defections as the unreſtrained and haſtily levied troops of theſe colonies muſt ever be: Your numbers are alſo held forth to you as powerful and unconquerable, and I do not deny that on ſo extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a continent as this many armies of forty-thouſand each might, in the various operations of a war, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage be employed; but ſuppoſing it poſſible for this even to be the caſe, what muſt be its unavoidable conſequences? All your peaſantry being engaged in martial expeditions, the land would want its culture, and a dearth in a very few months muſt infallibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, which would deprive your ſoldiers of even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſuſtenance<note n="*" place="bottom">To ſtrengthen this obſervation, Germany laſt war afforded melancholy proofs to what diſtreſs a country is reduced, when occupied by contending armies.</note>, for they muſt forego at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement every idea and wiſh for their accuſtomed luxuries: Are you yet to be told that there are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes which are endemic to a camp, and that when famine with "baneful ſmile" ſtalks through its ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſhe will add freſh poignancy and malignancy to its inſeparable diſorders? From moſt of theſe evils your opponents will be free; from long practice their conſtitutions are habituated to the fatigues of the moſt rigid diſcipline, they may feel diſtemper but they are better enabled to repel it than you, unuſed to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013863_0007_0F925D43A01885B0"/>
ſhips, can poſſibly be; nor will they be haunted by the ſmalleſt dread of want; your ports, blocked up by the navy of England, though denying you relief, will afford them plentiful ſupplies, and in caſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat a moſt ſure retreat till augmented by numerous and powerful reinforcements; for remember, that Great-Britain, during laſt war, did at one time carry conqueſt through every quarter of the globe, and that you aſſiſted her only in this.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, Americans, I have only pointed out to you the inſtability of your own force; it behoves you as you have examined how far you can rely with ſafety on it to change the ſcene, and ſee how it ſtands oppoſed to that of your antagoniſts, and here the proſpect is different, taught to conquer by diſcipline, they firmly confide in what they know is irreſiſtable; and not diſtracted by jarring principles and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; with them every part of the machine acts in harmony and concord, and every ſpring and every wheel conſpires to produce its neceſſary efficient force.</p>
            <p>It matters not of what perſons armies are compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince the profeſſion has a natural tendency to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in them new principles and ideas of fortitude, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and reliance on the wiſdom and experience of their ſuperiors: Your informant has told you the Britiſh troops are made up of <hi>"the moſt debauched weavers prentices, the ſcum of the Iriſh Roman Catholics who deſert upon every occaſion, and a few, very few Scotch who are not ſtrong enough to carry packs."</hi> I have cultivated an acquaintance with the moſt ſenſible of the military gentlemen, and have found them men of candour and worth; from their information and my own obſervation, I will now in theſe particulars lay before you a true and impartial

ſtate of the Britiſh army<note n="*" place="bottom">The writer of the Strictures in ſtating the number of the Britiſh infantry, has, either through negligence or purpoſely, committed an error, by not including the marines: Their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment is, I think, upwards of four thouſand. This corps, though exiſting under a different act of Parliament, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be denominated an addition to the marching regiments, as in the expeditions of laſt war it frequently co-operated with them, and by its vigour and intrepidity contributed to their memorable ſucceſſes. This is only produced as an inſtance of what occurs in every page, unfair reaſoning from miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed facts; for a trifling peace eſtabliſhment is not to be comput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the force of Britain,—it is founded on a plan, recommended by Marſhall Saxe for the French army, of having many batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions with more officers to each than requiſite for the number of private men, that in caſe of neceſſity, new levies might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted on them, and by that means a conſiderable body of troops, fit for actual ſervice, be almoſt inſtantaneouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</note>: If that part which Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land affords is only <hi>the moſt debauched weavers prentices,</hi> whence ariſes the great intereſt which the friends of many of them have with the country gentlemen, and which is often powerfully employed in ſoliciting their diſcharges? And by what arts have ſo many apprentices, without detection, deſerted their maſters, and broke their indentures? But all recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers, and I ſuſpect the Stricturer can affirm it, know that it is the country and not the towns which completes their battalions, that they beat up only on market-days when peaſants not mechanics reſort to them; and you can all of you judge from the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe recruits which have been brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they were the produce of villages or cities. <hi>The ſcum of the Iriſh Roman Catholics,</hi> he tells you, forms the proportion from that country, but unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately two ſtrong circumſtances militate againſt this aſſertion, for the legiſlature of Ireland, from fatal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, jealous of the Roman Catholics, has, under

            <p>In order to induce in you a belief of his military principles and knowledge, he produces an inſtance in proof from the conſtitution of the King of Pruſſia's army, but even was it, which I have the greateſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt, literally as he has ſtated, it cannot then, I apprehend, be brought as a precedent in this caſe, for there is no ſimilarity between the connected and abſolute power of that monarch over all his dominions and the diſtinct and widely ſeparated colonies of North-America: Between ſupporting the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the lawful Sovereign and rebelling againſt him.</p>
            <p>He tells you alſo, that <hi>no inferences can be drawn</hi> from the conqueſt of Quebec by the army under Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Wolfe, but believe me he is much miſtaken, for laſt war will afford abundant proofs to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:

After having with many arguments and more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour taught you to deſpiſe the armies of Britain, he proceeds and attempts with the ſame weapons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of ſecurity from invaſion by foreigners, and tells you of a convention of the empire in the year 1764; but <hi>does he not know</hi> that the reſolves of that body have ever been held in deriſion by its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from the time that the Landgrave of Heſs and Prince Maurice of Saxony laughed at the decrees of the Aulic Council, and the Emperor Charles the Fifth, more powerful than any of his ſucceſſors, till his Majeſty of Pruſſia and the Elector of Hanover, ſtood unmoved, and ſuſtained the thunders of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial ban? In fact it is not more regarded than a papal bull when it oppoſes the inclinations of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.—You all of you know what in England, France and Spain was formerly the power of the Lord Paramount over his Feudatories, and ſuch is preciſely the preſent ſtate of the Germanic body; and therefore I do not ſee, why the Landgrave of Heſs, if it ſuits his convenience, may not ſend over as many of his troops as required; and ſhould they ever be ſolicited, I dare aver, that an idea of their not returning will never occur to him or his miniſters to prevent their being diſpatched, nay that they would lack faith even though our Stricturer, in the ſpirit of vaticination, has predicted it<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>This is perhaps the moſt prepoſterous idea that ever was hatched in a diſtempered brain;</hi> but I beg pardon, perhaps this author is intruſted with the purport of the Obſervator on the Boſton Fort Bill's embaſſy, and can tell that he is ſent to divulge to the Landgrave of Heſs this amazing ſecret.</note>; but how the Elector of Hanover, backed by the power of Britain to enforce his commands, ſhould want credit to procure a few thouſands of his own ſubjects, is what I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend<note n="*" place="bottom">Britain has another reſource, which has perhaps not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to the Friendly Addreſſor or his critic: She is in the ſtricteſt alliance with Ruſſia, whoſe troops, come from ravaging the extenſive provinces of Turkey, would overrun this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent with the ſame facility they paſſed the Danube, ſtill carrying conqueſt in their front, and ſwept before them unnumbered fortreſſes.</note>:

It is as myſterious to me that Great-Britain, when divorced from her colonies, ſhould be deſtitute of every requiſite for ſupporting her navy, though ſhe poſſeſſes the northern and ſouthern extremities of this continent, and her trade to Ruſſia and the Baltic is open and free, and ſhe can from thence ſupply her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all the materials for ſhipbuilding on at leaſt as reaſonable conditions as ſhe does now from Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>This lively writer has amuſed you with many hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical alluſions, but, alas! they are ſeldom in point; that by which he marks out the facility of forming <hi>excellent officers</hi> is a moſt ſtriking inſtance of this, for to what pitch muſt military knowledge have arrived in the times of the civil war, when two large armies were for three days marching within ten miles of each other, and both remained ignorant of their enemies ſituation?—In this caſe it was chance or numbers that muſt decide, for each was unacquainted with diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; and if there were faction and agitators in the parliament army, the noble hiſtorian of thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and he would have wiſhed to conceal it, tells us that the royal forces were not leſs inſeſted by diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, party and private opinion; if therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which in the ſtrictures is drawn from this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common and tempeſtuous period, is juſt, let every man of candour, reading and underſtanding deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>

The laſt <hi>conſideration,</hi> Americans, <hi>which he thinks it is his duty to offer you,</hi> is, whether or no you ſhall demoliſh his Majeſty's forts and barracks: I conſider not by whom they were erected, or for what purpoſe, but, beyond doubt, the property of all ſuch public buildings and of all public military ſtores is, for the ſecurity of the realm, veſted in the crown; and to attempt to ſeize, retain, or deſtroy them, is by the law declared to be high-treaſon: His propoſition therefore is, whether you ſhall at once plunge your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into open rebellion and thereby incur its penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or not: To what a precipice would this author lead you? When I look down my ſenſes forſake me, and at the proſpect my blood ruſhes tumultuouſly to, and retreats from its citadel, the heart. Yes, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and infatuated citizens, with anguiſh I am forced to acknowledge, that ſuch violences as he recommends have in part been committed. O righteous God! do thou avert the juſtice of the empire, and, by inſpiring its governing powers with thy milder attribute of mercy ſnatch this deluded people from the imminent calamities, dangers, ruin, and deſtruction which await them!</p>
