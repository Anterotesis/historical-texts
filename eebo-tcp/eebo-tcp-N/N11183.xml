            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THOUGH I am at preſent on a journey of buſineſs in America, yet, being one of the people of Great-Britain, to whom you addreſs yourſelves in congreſs, I thought it my duty to peruſe your addreſs with as much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion as the nature of my preſent buſineſs would permit; and having ſo done, I beg leave to addreſs you in anſwer to it. But as the nature of my buſineſs will not permit me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote ſo much time to it, as would be neceſſary to tranſcribe your particular paſſages, verbatim, and then to anſwer them at large; I would requeſt that your addreſs to us may lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, while you read what I ſhall write on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>When a nation, led to greatneſs by the hand of liberty, turns advocate for ſlavery, there, doubtleſs, muſt be great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect, either, that virtue is fled, or that negligence in the appointment of rulers has crept in; but I muſt not be ſo haſty as to charge Britain with this, till I proceed farther into your addreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:014159_0003_0F9333BC887DEB70"/>Our anceſtors, in almoſt every age (if you mean ſince they have been a diſtinct kingdom) have indeed, during both foreign and civil wars, maintained their independence (if you mean with reſpect to any other ſtate in point of government) and I am happy in agreeing with you, that they tranſmitted their rights and liberties to us their poſterity: Neither am I ſurprized, that you, who are deſcended from the ſame anceſtors, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the ſame rights,
<q>ſhould refuſe to ſurrender them to men, who found their claim on no principles of reaſon, and who proſecute them, with a deſign, that by having your lives and property in their power, they may with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er felicity enſlave us.</q>
The cauſe of America, is indeed an object of univerſal attention; and it is really become very ſerious; but I am in a great meaſure unacquainted with the oppreſſions, abuſes, and miſrepreſentations, which you ſpeak of; and though you aſſure us, that you are led to addreſs us, by a dutiful reſpect for our general welfare, yet, till I get fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on in your addreſs, I ſhall not join with you in thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of ſlavery, which you ſay is intended for you and for us.</p>
            <p>I, and I believe, all my fellow-ſubjects in Great-Britain, conſider, that you are, and ought to be as free as us, and that you are entitled to all the benefits of Engliſh ſubjects, a trial by jury, and a hearing in your defence. I think, with you, that the legiſlature of Great-Britain, is not authorized to eſtabliſh an impious religion, or an arbitrary form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but till I have advanced farther, I cannot join with you that theſe ſacred rights have been ſo frequently and flagrantly violated.</p>
            <p>The proprietors of the ſoil of Great-Britain, are, indeed, lords of their own property, ſubject only to the regulations of the legiſlature; but the legiſlature has power to diſpoſe of any part or all of it, without the conſent of the owner; and this power they do exerciſe, when they judge it neceſſary for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good; had they not, we never ſhould have had that elegant avenue to Black Frier's bridge, or the numerous navigable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals made, and now making, all through the kingdom; but I would not be underſtood to ſay, that they ever exerciſe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving the owner its honeſt value, unleſs he be obſtinate and will not receive it, which I might ſay is ſometimes, tho' not very often, the caſe.</p>
            <p>The proprietors of the ſoil of America, are no leſs lords of their property than we are of ours, neither is there any reaſon that you ſhould ſubmit it to the diſpoſal of our parliament, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014159_0004_0F9333BD233949C8"/>
our parliament be not your parliament alſo. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of the ſea that divides us, can in my opinion cauſe no diſparity of rights, neither can any reaſon be given, why Engliſh ſubjects who live three thouſand miles from the Royal Palace, ſhould enjoy leſs liberty than thoſe who live three hundred miles from it; and, <hi>vice verſa</hi> (for it cannot be a good rule unleſs it works both ways) no reaſon can be given, why they ſhould enjoy more.</p>
            <p>Reaſon looks with indignation on ſuch diſtinctions, and as I am a freeman I cannot perceive their propriety. But yet you ſay, that the parliament aſſerts, that it has "authority to bind you in all caſes without exception, whether you conſent or not." I grant that it does aſſert that it has full power and authority to bind you in all caſes whatſoever. And now let us conſider on what this aſſertion is founded.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the parliament conſider you to be a part of the Britiſh empire or ſtate: Entitled to all the privileges of Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, capable of holding any office of profit, truſt, or honour, in Great-Britain, and of ſetting in parliament: Entitled to the protection of the Britiſh fleets and armies, and to every benefit which accrues to members of that ſociety.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, the parliament conſider themſelves to be the legiſlature of that empire, (conſequently to be our parliament, and your parliament, and the parliament of every other Britiſh ſubject,) whoſe duty it is to make laws, to regulate the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that empire, for the common good of the whole, and to affix and determine for each of the reſpective parts, ſuch orbs, as that the motion of one part, ſhall not retard the motion of another part; and to make proviſion out of the whole, for the ſupport and maintenance of a ſufficient force, to protect, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and defend, every of the reſpective parts, in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive orbs, againſt the force of all its enemies, whether foreign or domeſtic, ſo that the whole ſhall form one regular, ſtrong, and laſting ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>It would be abſurd to ſuppoſe, that an empire compoſed of ſeveral parts, ſhould be without an imperial legiſlature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate and bind the whole; for without ſuch a legiſlature, the whole could not be conſidered together, and regulated as one empire. To ſuppoſe then that America is not to be bound by the ſtatutes of the Britiſh legiſlature, and that too in all reſpects, muſt confound every idea of its being part and parcel of the Britiſh empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt invalidate your claims to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which accrue to members of that empire or ſociety; and totally deſtroy your title to the protection of the Britiſh <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and armies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:014159_0005_0F9333BDDCA9C8A8"/>It is true, it might nevertheleſs be a part of the dominions of the King (but not of the imperial crown) of Great-Britain, in which caſe you would be in the ſame ſtate (with reſpect to our ſociety) as his Majeſty's ſubjects in Hanover are; but give me leave to aſk, are his Majeſty's Hanoverian ſubjects entitled to partake of the benefits of the Britiſh ſociety in any reſpect whatever? Surely not.</p>
            <p>Would you ſay, that your Royal charters give you the rights and privileges of Engliſh ſubjects, and declare that you ſhall always be eſteemed as members of the Britiſh ſociety? But even if the King's charter was ſufficient for ſuch a purpoſe, each of you, as are not in charter-governments, could not make this plea.—But let me aſk again, is it in his Majeſty's power to give his foreign ſubjects (for inſtance his Hanoverian ſubjects) the privileges of Engliſhmen? Surely not: He may, it is true, give them privileges among themſelves, ſimilar to thoſe which are enjoyed by his Britiſh ſubjects, but cannot make them partakers of the privileges of the Britiſh ſociety. He cannot make them capable of holding any office in Britain, or of ſitting in the Britiſh parliament, neither can he entitle them to the protection of the Britiſh forces. Nothing but the legiſlature can give them thoſe privileges, or receive them into that ſociety; nor could any thing be more abſurd, than to ſuppoſe, that any perſon ſhould be capable of ſitting in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſuch as are a part of that ſociety, over which the parliament preſides. That the Americans do both claim and enjoy this privilege, I could give many inſtances, but I ſhall mention only two, viz: Mr. Beckford and Mr. Trecothick, both of which ſerved the office of Lord Mayor of the city of London, 1770, and both were Repreſentatives for the city of London in parliament, both thoſe Gentlemen were Americans. Seeing therefore, that the Americans are capable of ſitting in parliament, they muſt be a part of that ſociety, over which the parliament preſides.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, it appears, that your title to thoſe privileges does not flow from your charters in the leaſt degree, but is in fact this; you were a part of the Britiſh ſociety previous to your emigration; you emigrated under the ſeal of the em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pire, or imperial ſeal of that ſociety (which ſurely could not be of any the leaſt validity in Hanover, or elſewhere out of the empire;) nor did you emigrate to form a new ſociety, but to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a part of that ſociety, to which you had ever belonged; and ſuch of you as emigrated from other nations, were received into the Britiſh ſociety by virtue of an act of parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014159_0006_0F9333BEDE67C870"/>Seeing then that you were at that time under the authority of parliament, and that you have ever remained a part of the ſame ſociety; and ſeeing alſo, that the parliament never relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed its authority over you, how is it poſſible that you can be exempt from it now? Would you ſay, that you emigrated to a country over which the parliament or imperial legiſlature had no authority? But this, as I ſaid before, deſtroys every idea of its being part and parcel of the Britiſh empire:—For, to be a part of the empire, lying out of the juriſdiction of the imperial legiſlature, would be a moſt palpable abſurdity, fairly affronting to common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider whether the authority of the parliament, or imperial legiſlature ſhould in reaſon extend hither or not— The legiſlature at the expence of the nation, fits out a fleet, and ſends it on diſcoveries: They diſcover a new country, and take poſſeſſion of it in the uſual manner, by hoiſting the flag of the nation thereon:—Quere, then does it become the private domains of the King? or does it become a part and parcel of the imperial dominions, the ſame as though it had not been ſeparated from the old dominions by the ſea? Surely the latter. The intervention of the ſea can cauſe no deſparity, reaſon would look with indignation on ſuch diſtinctions.— Should it be obtained by conſent from a foreign nation, (which was the caſe with ſeveral of the colonies) the only difference would be that the expence muſt be the greater.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid, that the Engliſh conſtitution is ſuch, that the ſubject ſhall not be bound by any laws, or pay any taxes, without his conſent, given either by himſelf, or his repreſentative, by him choſen for that purpoſe: That America has no vote in ſuch elections, and therefore cannot be conſtitutionally bound by ſuch laws.</p>
            <p>But in this the Engliſh conſtitution is groſsly miſrepreſented: The Engliſh government being a mixed one differs from a monarchy (or any other ſingle conſtitution of government,) only in this, that in a monarchy, the Prince is in himſelf the ſupreme legiſlature, (as is the Nobles in Ariſtocracy, and the elected in a Democracy,) and in our mixed government, the ſupreme legiſlature is compoſed of all three, viz. the King, the Lords, and the Commons in parliament; and the conſtitution is this, that the two firſt of theſe branches ſhall be hereditary, and that the third ſhall be choſen, by and out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: To wit, that the counties of Middleſex, Surrey, &amp; ſhall ſend two members each, which ſhall be elected by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of ſuch of the freeholders of the county, as chooſe to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014159_0007_0F9333BF5985FB38"/>
attend and vote at the election. That ſuch and ſuch cities and towns ſhall ſend two members each (the city of London ſends four) which ſhall be elected by a majority of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ſuch city or town: That ſuch and ſuch towns ſhall ſend two members each, which ſhall be elected by the majority of the corporation in ſuch town; and here give me leave to obſerve, that ſome towns which contain ſeveral thouſand inhabitants, have not twenty voters; and many large towns (of which Birmingham, Sheffield and Mancheſter are three, the ſmalleſt of which is larger than the largeſt city or town in America) ſend no members at all; and a large part of South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, whoſe houſes were pulled down by authority of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make that elegant avenue to Black-Fryars bridge, is alſo without the privilege of voting; and upon the whole, there is not one thirtieth part of the people of Great-Britain, that are entitled to vote in the elections. This is the Engliſh conſtitution, with reſpect to the commons repreſentatives in parliament, notwithſtanding the many miſrepreſentations of it among the common people of America.—Neither do theſe commons repreſent that part in which they are elected, more than they do any and every other part of the empire:— Forty of them make a houſe of parliament; and the King, the majority of the lords, and the majority of commons repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, are by our conſtitution the repreſentatives of the whole empire, and by that conſtitution are empowered to make laws, which ſhall be binding, on every part of the empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not only on every ſubject of the empire, but alſo on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King, and on the Imperial-Crown itſelf.—For how came we by our preſent gracious ſovereign? by an act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which placed the crown on the head of his royal anceſtors.</p>
            <p>Here we ſee that upwards of twenty-nine thirtieth parts of the people of Great-Britain are in the ſame ſituation as you are, with reſpect to election, and repreſentation. —They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent no more to the laws which are made, or to the taxes which are laid by parliament than you do,—The only thing to which they in reality give their conſent, is this, they conſent to be Britiſh ſubjects, —To be conſidered as a part of the Britiſh ſociety, and to be governed according to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution thereof: Which is, in effect, conſenting to be governed by ſuch laws as ſhall be made, and to pay ſuch taxes as ſhall be laid, by thoſe whom the conſtitution has empowered to make the laws, and to lay the taxes. And this kind of conſent is as much given by you as by us. Shall we ſay then, that this is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014159_0008_0F9333C14FE8EBF8"/>
unconſtitutional? Surely not. It is the very conſtitution itſelf. That this part of the conſtitution might be altered for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I would very readily grant, and I ſhould be happy in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an equal repreſentation of the commons of the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in parliament; but I could never ſuppoſe it conſiſtent with reaſon or the common good, to be without a ſupreme ſovereign legiſlature over the whole, which ſhould have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to bind every part of the empire; for without that, it would be impoſſible that the whole ſhould be regulated for the common good, which is the moſt eſſential point in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—This equal repreſentation, however, cannot be had without an alteration in that part of the preſent conſtitution: and by the bye, a conſtitution of an empire is too great a thing to be tampered with.—Alterations in a thing of ſuch vaſt importance, ſhould never be made, but with the greateſt and cooleſt conſideration, and never attempted while the heats of party prejudices actuates the mind, leſt, inſtead of being mended, it ſhould be made far worſe.</p>
            <p>It is alledged too, that if the Parliament have authority in America, they can, if they will, lay on ſuch burdens as would inevitably enſlave you;—but ſurely it is time enough to complain, when they lay on you more than your propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which none of you have ever yet pretended to accuſe them of.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of your Buccaneers, will furniſh you with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple accounts of the piracies in your ſeas formerly;—What elſe but the Britiſh fleets protects your trade now from thoſe pirates? Or what elſe protects your coaſts in time of war from the enemy?—A time of peace is the only time to prepare for war;—What kind of title then would you have to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our fleets in time of war, unleſs you pay a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the expence of the preparations which are made in time of peace? Would it not be extremely unjuſt, that the Parliament ſhould lay taxes on us, to build ſhips, or to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a fleet, to protect your trade from pirates in time of peace, or to defend your coaſts from the enemy in time of war, was it not that you were a part of our ſociety, under their authority and protection, and that they laid a part of the expence on you alſo?</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, the Parliament could, if they were ſo evil minded, deſtroy or enſlave you:—But what kind of reaſoning is this?—So alſo if a man be permitted to walk about at large, he could, if he was ſo evil minded, kill another man that he might meet with:—If, therefore, it be ſaid, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014159_0009_0F9333C18B247E48"/>
ought not to have authority, leſt it ſhould miſ-uſe it; it will follow, by the ſame rule, that every man ought to be kept pen'd up in ſome little apartment by himſelf, leſt he ſhould fall foul on his neighbour. Strange times theſe! But let us for a moment ſuppoſe both theſe abſurdities to happen (for the one is juſt as reaſonable as the other) who, in the firſt caſe is to regulate the ſtate? and in the ſecond caſe, where in the name of good luck do we find the gaoler?</p>
            <p>But let us enquire, whether you did not always, till of late, conſider yourſelves to be under the ſupreme authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and whether the Parliament did not alſo conſider you in the ſelf ſame light?</p>
            <p>The firſt colonization patent worth notice, was (if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member right) granted by King James the firſt, to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia company, in the year 1606, which covered all the lands from Carolina to Nova-Scotia; and though that Prince would willingly have been abſolute over thoſe countries, yet ſo far were the then Houſe of Commons, from ſuppoſing that the parliamentary authority did not extend to Virginia, that we find the Virginia affairs in that Houſe ſo early as the year 1614; wherein the Commons firmly aſſerted the authority of Parliament over thoſe countries, and only three of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who made the leaſt doubt of its authority, and theſe quickly altered their opinions.—So great an unanimity is ſcarcely ever to be found in that Houſe.—And ſo far were the firſt ſettlers from ſuppoſing themſelves to be out of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament, that we find in the Houſe of Commons, a petition to Parliament from the inhabitants of Virginia, ſo early as the year 1621.—But as this, and the next reign, is generally ſpoken of with diſlike in many parts of America, eſpecially in the New-England governments, I will look into the Common-Wealth Parliament, under Oliver Cromwell, in the time of the great rebellion. In this Parliament we find in act paſſed in the year 1650<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declaring, to all intents and purpoſes the authority of the Parliament over the colonies; and ſo far were the people of New-England from denying their authority, that (though the ſouthern provinces declared for King Charles the ſecond) they (in New-England) joined with the Common-wealth's-men; and even to this day, many of them, (who are now moſt inveterate againſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſpeak of Cromwell with the higheſt veneration and eſteem.—In the charter for Pennſylvania, which was granted about two years after the Reſtoration of King Charles the ſecond, the King gives up the idea of abſolute dominion (which his grand-father in all probability aimed at, in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia)
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014159_0010_0F9333C24425DFD8"/>
but he expreſsly reſerves the power of taxing them, with either "the conſent of the Proprietor, or chief governor, or Aſſembly, or by act of Parliament in England."—In this reign, nay, in the firſt ſeſſion of Parliament after the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we find an act regulating the ſhipping trade of the colonies, in which the words "Engliſhmen and Engliſh ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping," are explained to mean all the ſhipping and all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Britiſh empire, in Europe, Aſia, Africa, and America.—And in the twenty-fifth of this reign, an act was paſſed, laying duties in the colonies on ſugar, tobacco, cotton-wool, indigo, ginger, logwood, &amp;c. So far were theſe Parliaments from doubting their authority over America. But as this reign is ſpoken of by ſome of the people here, with no great eſteem, I will leave it, and look into the reign of King William and Queen Mary, after the glorious Revolution; a reign which is generally ſpoken of, with the higheſt approbation in America.—In the ſeventh and eighth of this reign, we find it enacted, that every ſeaman, in every of the ſhips belonging either to his Majeſty, or any of his ſubjects, in any of his dominions, ſhall give ſix-pence per year out of their wages, to the revenue of Greenwich Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; which tax has been ever ſince, and now is, levied in the colonies, by virtue of this act.—In the act "for preventing frauds and regulating abuſes in the plantations," which paſſed the ſame year, all former acts reſpecting the colonies are renewed and enforced, and the ſhips in the colonies are ſubjected to the ſame regulations as the ſhips in the ports of England, and the revenue-officers have the ſame powers to to viſit and ſearch ſhips, as the officers of the cuſtoms in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the like aſſiſtance is given to them, with power to give this or other cuſtom acts in evidence, and the judges to allow thereof.—Owners of land too, are by this act, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitted from ſelling them without licence from his Majeſty, to any other perſon than a natural born ſubject.—But the main matter expreſſive of the authority of Parliament in all caſes, is the ninth ſection of this act, which ſays,
<q>All laws, by-laws, uſages or cuſtoms, at this time, or which hereafter ſhall be in practiſe, or endeavoured or pretended to be in force or practice, in any of the ſaid plantations, which are in any wiſe repugnant to the before mentioned laws or any of them, ſo far as they do relate to the ſaid planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or any of them; or which are any ways repugnant to this preſent act, or to any other law hereafter to be made in this kingdom, ſo far as ſuch law ſhall relate to,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014159_0011_0F9333C32A720338"/>
and mention the ſaid plantations, are illegal, null and void, to all intents and purpoſes whatſoever.</q>
—So far was this highly and juſtly eſteemed Prince, and the other branches of his Parliament, from doubting their authority over the colonies.—I might mention other acts, in this, and every ſubſequent reign: among others, the act for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the poſt-office, which is expreſsly declared to be for the purpoſe of raiſing a revenue in America, and which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, met with high approbation here:—The acts laying duties on wine, ſugar, molaſſes, &amp;c. which alſo met with no oppoſition.—In ſhort, there is ſcarce a ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Parliament ſince William and Mary's reign, to the preſent time, but what contains more or leſs of the ſupreme authority over the colonies; but I forbear ſaying any more of the acts or opinions of the Parliament, and ſhall next conſider the opinions of the colonies, ſo lately as the year 1755.—The colonies were at this time, under the moſt direful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of being deſtroyed by the French.—The Aſſembly of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, in a meſſage to Governor Shirley, the fourth of January, 1754, ſay (among other things) that the French have made ſuch encroachments, and taken ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<q>as threaten great danger, and perhaps in time, even the entire deſtruction of this province, (without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his Majeſty) notwithſtanding any proviſion we can make to prevent it.</q>
—The Aſſembly of Virginia too, in the ſame year, addreſs his Majeſty, informing him, that they have raiſed ten thouſand pounds;—that that ſum is not ſufficient, but that they are unable to raiſe more, and therefore pray his Majeſty to extend his royal beneficence.</p>
            <p>Here we ſee the inability of America to defend herſelf againſt the French and Canadians (excluſive of the ſea-coaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which muſt be defended by fleets) and now let me aſk, how could his Majeſty give them any aſſiſtance, without his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? And would it not be the higheſt injuſtice, for the Parliament to take our money, and give it to the King, for your uſe, provided you was not a part of us, and equally with us, under their authority and protection?</p>
            <p>The Maſſachuſetts Aſſembly in another meſſage to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Shirley, in April 1754, ſay,
<q>It evidently appears, that the French are far advanced in the execution of a plan which hath been laid more than fifty years, for extending their ſettlements, &amp;c. and for ſubjecting the whole conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the crown of France.—That the French have but one intereſt, and keep one point in view.—That the Engliſh
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014159_0012_0F9333C3FA684158"/>
governments have different intereſts, are diſunited, ſome of them have their frontiers covered by their neighbouring governments, and not being immediately affected, ſeem unconcerned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Congreſs, from the ſeveral colonies which met at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, in July 1754, among other things ſay,
<q>That the ſaid colonies being in a divided diſunited ſtate, there has never been any joint exertion of their forces or councils to repel or defeat the meaſures of the French, and particular colonies are unable, and unwilling to maintain the cauſe of the whole.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have not time to tranſcribe theſe pieces at large, but I would humbly recommend my readers to procure and peruſe them.</p>
            <p>Here we ſee an example of the abſolute neceſſity of there being in every empire, a ſupreme power that ſhall command the whole; but the main matter which I ſhall mention, as declaratory of the opinions of the colonies, with reſpect not only of the authority of parliament to bind you, but alſo of the neceſſity of putting that authority in execution, we ſhall find in the proceedings of the convention of Committees from the ſeveral provinces, who met at Albany in the year 1755. Governor Shirley (who was held in the higheſt eſteem, not only by his province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, but by the other colonies alſo) preſented a plan to theſe Committees, propoſing a proportionable aſſeſſment on their ſeveral colonies, and in order to compel all the colonies to comply, he propoſed as part of his plan, that application ſhould be made to parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for an act to empower the Committees of the ſeveral colonies, to tax the whole, according to their reſpective pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions; and to this the Committees agreed. And I find in the journals of the New-York Aſſembly, March 27, 1755. When this plan was laid before a Committee of each of their houſes, they reſolved, that governor Shirley's ſcheme was well conceited, and that (if his Majeſty's general ſhould approve thereof) that colony joined therein; and when the Committee reported it to the houſe, the houſe reſolved the ſame, <hi>Nemine Contradicente.</hi> So far were theſe Committees, and this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, at that time, from ſuppoſing that they were out of the authority of parliament.</p>
            <p>Thus my fellow ſubjects have I conſidered the grounds, on which the parliament founded thoſe aſſertions, which you ſo much diſlike: I have ſhewn the abſolute neceſſity of there being a ſupreme power to bind the whole empire; not only
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014159_0013_0F9333C6D800C298"/>
on doctrinal principles, but alſo by giving a proof of it, in a matter, which has within your own memory, happened among yourſelves; and which in all probability may happen again, and often: I have ſhewn alſo, that that ſupreme power muſt be in the Britiſh parliament, ſo long as you are a part of the Britiſh empire: I have alſo ſhewn, that the parliament ever claimed it, from the firſt ſettlement of the colonies until now, and that they have ever exerciſed it, in ſome point or other; and I have alſo ſhewn, that you were of the ſame opinion with them, even ſo lately as the late war; from whence your claim of exemption is but of a very ſhort date. I muſt therefore conclude, that their declarations can by no means be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as "hereſies in Engliſh politics."</p>
            <p>Though I ſo firmly aſſert the authority of parliament, yet I perſuade myſelf, that when the heats and prejudices of the preſent times abate, you will not accuſe me of being an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to America. I could heartily wiſh to ſee (as I ſaid before) an equal repreſentation of the commons of the whole empire in parliament. I ſhould be happy in ſeeing repreſentatives from Birmingham, Sheffield and Mancheſter, &amp;c. and the old depopulated boroughs ceaſe to ſend. I could alſo wiſh to ſee members from America, in both houſes of parliament, ſo that America might have its ſhare in the general legiſlature, which revolving often into the hands of the electors here, would give you the ſame ſecurity for your liberties, as your fellow ſubjects in England have; but your unhappy caſe in 1754-5, was there nothing elſe to be conſidered, would be ſufficient to convince one of the abſurdity of being without a ſupreme legiſlature to command the whole.</p>
            <p>After this equal repreſentation, I ſhould even then, be far from wiſhing the parliament to exerciſe her authority in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal taxation. If I might wiſh it, they ſhould only regulate the ſtate, and (appoint Committees if they were not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted themſelves,) to aſcertain the proportion which each colony ought to pay, and make laws, compelling the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Aſſemblies to raiſe it, and on failure thereof (but not otherwiſe) to empower officers to aſſeſs it, in ſome certain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which they ſhould judge moſt meet, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond plan which governor Shirley in the year 1755, propoſed for that purpoſe; and then the Aſſemblies ſhould raiſe it in any manner they ſhould think beſt. My reaſons for this, is, that the parliament could not (at leaſt would not be ſo likely to) know on what to lay an internal tax, ſo as that it might be the leaſt burthen poſſible on thoſe who are to pay it; which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014159_0014_0F9333C7C991A178"/>
is the moſt eſſential thing to be conſidered in laying a tax.— But with reſpect to commercial duties, theſe cannot be laid with judgment, by any other than the general or ſupreme legiſlature, becauſe no other can ſee how to regulate commerce in ſuch an extenſive commercial empire, ſo that it ſhall on the whole, produce the greateſt trade and advantages; which is alſo the moſt eſſential thing to be conſidered in laying thoſe duties.</p>
            <p>Though the latter end of the late war, conducted under the able Earl of Chatham, was exceedingly victorious, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive the peace to have been ſo inglorious a one, as ſome may imagine. It might perhaps have been made more beneficial to this empire, if the war had been continued longer; but the fate of war is ſo uncertain, that there was a <hi>perhaps alſo,</hi> that it might have turned out otherwiſe. You well know that the war was extremely expenſive and long, and the burthens of it began to be very ſenſibly felt.</p>
            <p>I have made diligent ſearch for the plan, which you ſay was at this time formed for enſlaving America, but I have not been able to find, that it ever had any exiſtence, but in ungenerous imaginations.</p>
            <p>Prior to this Aera, it is true, nothing but ſmall duties on merchandize, had been laid in America, but as the riches of any part of the empire increaſes, ſo alſo ought their taxes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, that all parts may pay towards the common ſecurity, in proportion to their wealth.</p>
            <p>I remember your loyalty in the laſt war, and if you will take the trouble to read the pieces I before alluded to, you will find, that you then declared, that all the ſtrength of this vaſt continent (as you now expreſs it,) was inſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect your own frontiers, let alone your coaſts!—You prayed Britain to aſſiſt you, and to remove your enemy from your backs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She, like a tender and affectionate parent, heard your complaints, and granted your requeſts. She protected your coaſts. She ſent you part of her fleets and armies to join your ſtrength, and to remove your enemy. Nor was ſhe ſparing in her aſſiſtance, but finally they were, and are removed.</p>
            <p>Many (though not all) of your provinces, (I ſay it with reſpect) exerted themſelves with that loyalty which did them honour, and though their ſtrength was ſmall, yet it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew their willingneſs.</p>
            <p>When the war was ended, and the enemy removed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſums you had contributed, were but a ſmall part of the expence which attended your own ſecurity and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014159_0015_0F9333C9CDE25A10"/>
yet ſeeing that you had advanced more than what was proportionable to your abilities, with reſpect to ours; the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament conſidering you as a part of us, and equally under their protection and authority, refunded the overplus of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, as you frankly acknowledge. This, my fellow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, I conceive to be proof, and that too, a very high one, of the principles, the equity, and the honor of that nation, and its legiſlature, which you now treat with the utmoſt ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and contempt.</p>
            <p>I have already given it as my opinion, that it would be moſt proper that the Aſſemblies of the ſeveral provinces, ſhould lay their internal taxes themſelves. Among theſe the Stamp-act might be reckoned; but though I ſhall not be an advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the Stamp-act, but on the other hand, ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the execution of it, might have been prejudicial to the new ſettlers in your interior countries, who, from their ſituation, could not have opportunity of getting ſtamps, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting themſelves much more than the tax could do the crown good; yet, give me leave to obſerve, that an act like that within proper reſtrictions, might be a means of much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to many parts of America, by contributing to leſſen a moſt vile deſtructive ſpirit of litigation, under the oppreſſion of which, the New-England governments fairly groan.</p>
            <p>The Stamp-act, however was repealed, and that too (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) upon the principle of its being likely to be prejudicial to particular parts, which Doctor Franklin explained to the houſe of commons.</p>
            <p>The duty on Paint, Glaſs, &amp;c. was perfectly conſiſtent with Doctor Franklin's own arguments, while he was ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the repeal of the Stamp-act. The Doctor (whom I much eſteem on many accounts, though I cannot agree with him in all things) at that time, declared to the houſe of commons, that the parliament had an equitable and juſt right to lay a duty on the merchandize, which was carried acroſs the ſeas, becauſe (as he told them) it was their fleets, at their expence, which kept the ſeas clear of Pirates, and maintained the ſafety of the carriage. For the truth of this, I refer you to Doctor Franklin's examination before the houſe of commons, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed about the time of the repeal of the Stamp-act.</p>
            <p>Another main argument uſed by Doctor Franklin, and by moſt people in America, to wit
<q>that no man ſhould pay a tax to which he does not conſent, either in his own perſon, or by his repreſentative;</q>
would remain in its fulleſt force, without the leaſt infringement, by this mode of raiſing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014159_0016_0F9333CADC9C6EB0"/>
(unleſs indeed the duties ſhould be laid on the abſolute neceſſaries of life;) becauſe every man is left to his own choice whether he will purchaſe the dutiable articles or not, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cannot pay the duty without his own conſent in perſon. Did not this fully prove that the grand legiſlature of the empire was willing, nay was deſirous, and determined, to adopt ſuch meaſures only, as they had the greateſt reaſons (from the mouth of your agent) to believe, would not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to your own ſentiments? And this was no all, they repealed this act too, ſo far as it related to what may be called conveniences, viz. Paint, Glaſs, &amp;c. and left unrepealed in this act, only a very ſmall duty on tea, which is ſurely one of the ſuperfluities of life. So far were theſe their proceedings from deſerving thoſe aſperſions, which you ſo ungenerouſly throw out againſt them, of being unjuſt, unconſtitutional, &amp;c. that they were perfectly agreeable with every of your then arguments.</p>
            <p>How inconſiſtent then, how repugnant to your former words and declarations, has your late ungrateful conduct been!— Surely a ſpirited nation cannot put up with ſuch inſults. But behold you now make new arguments, which were not at that time thought of, and which have nothing but abſurdity for their foundation. Unhappy! extremely unhappy indeed, ſhould we all be, if the legiſlature were like you, ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally changing with the wind!</p>
            <p>How any of the revenues here are applied, I know not, but thus much I know, that your trade is ſtill protected from Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates by the Britiſh fleets, and theſe muſt be ſupported from ſomewhere, nor have I any reaſon to doubt, but theſe reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues are applied for that or ſome ſimilar purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Though I am ready to believe that you have generally raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed money for the ſupport of your particular, internal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet I muſt take the liberty of obſerving, that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is not true in all reſpects. The Maſſachuſetts aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly refuſed to make the neceſſary proviſion for the ſupport of their fortreſs, notwithſtanding they eſteemed it both their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and their duty, and were urged to do it very ſtrongly by many of their members;) or elſe Caſtle William in the bay of Boſton, would not (in all probability) have been taken into the hands of the King; neither do they alledge any thing for their reaſon, but the exerciſe of what they themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to have been the legal prerogative of the governor, in adjourning the aſſembly to Cambridge. I could mention other failures, but it is unneceſſary. How much you would
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014159_0017_0F9333CB9D4F9210"/>
do for the ſtate (if left to yourſelves) is uncertain, your own affairs in 1754-5, pretty evidently ſhow, that you would not agree in it, be the exigences ever ſo great.</p>
            <p>The laws reſpecting the revenue are much the ſame (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) as they are in England; be they what they may, the fair trader is not endangered by them; but many of our towns are ſo addicted to ſmuggling, that they ſhrink not at vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the moſt ſacred obligations, to anſwer ſelfiſh purpoſes; and the inward conviction of your guilt, I take to be the only reaſon why you ſo highly dread the rod. Your other laws too, I ſuppoſe, are much the ſame as ours.</p>
            <p>The carrying offenders from here to England for trial, would doubtleſs be extremely bad, was it to be uſed as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practice; but ſurely you will allow that there may be caſes wherein it may be neceſſary; and the acts you complain of expreſsly reſtrict the exerciſe of it to ſuch caſes only. If you ſay, that you are out of the realm, there is a law for it as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the reign of King Henry VIII; and if you ſay, that you are not out of the realm, you muſt allow the validity (at leaſt) of the late acts; ſo that, be you within or without the the realm, it is not againſt law: And where people are in a violent heat with party prejudices, every one will grant that a fair trial cannot be expected; therefore, in ſuch caſes, it is not againſt reaſon. That this is now the caſe in particular parts of America, I can aſſert of my own certain knowledge, and therefore I ſhall not condemn the act; but if it ſhould be made uſe of, where there is no danger of a fair trial, then, and not till then, will I condemn the exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>An Engliſh Jury will never be actuated by the face of a neighbour, or the appearance of a ſtranger, neither will they be moved by party prejudice, nor national reſentment, nor will the wealth or the poverty of the offender, contribute in the leaſt to his acquittal or condemnation at their tribunal.</p>
            <p>I am ſurprized, exceedingly ſurprized indeed, that you ſhould offer to palm upon us for truth, ſo notorious an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, as that your refuſal and deſtruction of the tea, was to prevent a preſident of taxation. The Poſt-Office, the duties on Wine, Sugar, Molaſſes, &amp;c. were ſurely preſidents of the ſelf ſame nature. Theſe you continued to pay; and this ſame duty on tea too, you had heretofore paid. How falſe! how ridiculous then, are your pretenſions! The true reaſon (I have been aſſured by a reformed ſmuggler, who now reflects on it with horror) was this, the ſmugglers knowing that the India-Company's tea, would have ſupplied the country, ſo much
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014159_0018_0F9333CC0AEF6C58"/>
better and cheaper than they were heretofore ſupplied; and knowing of conſequence, that their exorbitant profits (produced by perjury and falſe ſwearing) muſt inevitably fall, unleſs they could blind and deceive the people; they therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to miſlead and inflame the minds of the populace againſt the tea, and ſucceeded in their baſe deſign.</p>
            <p>I cannot but drop the tear of pity for ſuch as are innocently ſuffering in the town of Boſton, and I hope they will have compaſſion ſhown them. But as his Majeſty's ports, are like his highways, free for all his ſubjects; when that freedom is with impunity deſtroyed, it (in my opinion) becomes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible duty of the legiſlature to pronounce, that till it can be free for all, it ſhall not be free for any. The main out cry now is, that they were condemned unheard, but it is granted by moſt people, that the poſitive information and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the deſtruction of the tea, and of the inhuman treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Perſon of the King's officer, was ſufficient to ſhut the Cuſtom-houſe (and conſequently the port) till the town ſhould be heard in their defence. If therefore, the act had ordered, that the port ſhould have been opened again, when their innocence ſhould have appeared on fair trial; or as ſoon as they had made ſatisfaction, provided they ſhould be found guilty, then this objection would have been obviated; and let me humbly aſk the people of Boſton, who beſt know the circumſtances, what benefit would have accrued to them from that clauſe, more than as the act now ſtands. However, I wiſh the former part had been inſerted in the act, if that would have made them eaſier. But though it was not, I ſhall not conclude that juſtice and humanity are fled, nor can I perſuade myſelf that theſe proceedings were ſo irreconcileable to the genius and temper of our laws and conſtitution, as the proceedings of the Congreſs were, to the title by which they call themſelves his Majeſty's dutiful and loyal ſubjects.</p>
            <p>When the populace in any country ſo far miſinterpret and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe their form of government, as to collect and aſſemble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Taylors, and the Coblers, and the Ploughmen, and the Shepherds, and there treat and reſolve, about matters of the higheſt importance of ſtate,—matter which can never be acquired but with the greateſt ſtudy and expence, and which they, from the very nature of things muſt be ignorant of, as of the languages of the Eaſt; when theſe things, I ſay, are carried ſo far as, to break out in open defiance to both law and juſtice, ſo that neither perſon nor property can be protected from the hands of violence, nor the offenders brought to puniſhment;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014159_0019_0F9333CCDEE07EC8"/>
which if permitted to rage long muſt inevitably breed a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſorder in the ſtate, if not in time overturn the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; it is ſurely high time that the form of government ſhould be changed, to ſuch an one as cannot be ſo deſtructively miſinterpreted, and abuſed. This (I am very ſure) has for a conſiderable time been the caſe in the Maſſachuſetts Bay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you would endeavour to deceive my brethren in the parent country, by ſaying it was only becauſe a treſpaſs had been committed on ſome merchandize in one of their towns.</p>
            <p>Your wicked governors, &amp; I cannot ſay much about; I might have given you ſome credit as to this, ſeeing I am not acquainted with it, had I not found other ungenerous and falſe aſperſions; but to be honeſt with you, as the caſe ſtands, I doubt much whether this may not be like ſome of the reſt.</p>
            <p>You ſtrangely betray your geographical underſtandings if you conceive the dominions of Canada, to be extended beyond its ancient limits! The preſent province of Quebec is far, far ſmaller than what that government always claimed by the name of Canada. Neither is the laws which you ſpeak of, near ſo unfavourable for the ſubject, as the laws of every of your colonies were in their infancy. Pray turn your eyes to the Floridas and ſee what thoſe new colonies now are. Look into the Virginia charter, which comprehended all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try between Carolina and Nova-Scotia, (under which charter New England firſt ſettled,) and you will find that the officers of that government, were appointed by a council of proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors reſiding in England, and had by the charter,
<q>full and abſolute power and authority, to correct, puniſh, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, govern and rule, &amp;c. according to ſuch orders, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, conſtitutions, directions, and inſtructions, as by our ſaid council as aforeſaid, ſhall be eſtabliſhed; and in defect thereof, in caſe of neceſſity, according to the good diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid governor, and officers reſpectively, as well in caſes capital as civil, both maritime and others.</q>
This, my fellow ſubjects, was your conſtitution once, but happily (ſince your circumſtances are altered) this as well as the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts charter is aboliſhed. Is not the preſent government of Quebec ten thouſand times more ſecure for the ſubject than this was? nor is there any reaſon to doubt, but as ſoon as a conſtitution can be more properly adapted to the nature and circumſtances of thoſe people, than the preſent is, the mode of government in the province of Quebec will be altered alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:014159_0020_0F9333CD86424F68"/>You pretend to complain of the French laws, but give me leave humbly to aſk, how you could try the French titles by the laws of England?—The Engliſh titles are not affected.— And the French eſtates are releaſed from all that is diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the French tenure, to wit, the owner has power to give them by will to whom he pleaſes.—The criminal law is that of England,
<q>both in the deſcription and quality of the offence, and in the method of proſecution and trial.</q>
Have they not the benefit of their Habeas Corpus then in criminal caſes? And what reaſon have we to ſuppoſe that they have not their Habeas Corpus in civil caſes? Many of you enjoy it only by virtue of his Majeſty's inſtructions to his Governors, and may not Governor Carlton have thoſe inſtructions as well as the other Governors?</p>
            <p>I am aſtoniſhed that you ſhould conceive that any other than the church of England, eſtabliſhed in the firſt year of Queen Elizabeth, was the eſtabliſhed church of any part of the empire!—How is the church of Rome eſtabliſhed in Quebec? Let us read the clauſe in the act—
<q>And for the more perfect ſecurity and eaſe of the minds of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſaid province, it is hereby declared, that his Majeſty's ſubjects profeſſing the religion of the church of Rome, of and in the ſaid province of Quebec, may have, hold and enjoy, the free exerciſe of the religion of the church of Rome, ſubject to the King's ſupremacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and eſtabliſhed by an act made in the firſt year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, over all the dominions and countries, which then did, or hereafter ſhould belong to the imperial crown of this realm.</q>
—Does this eſtabliſh the church of Rome? Nay, does it not declare, that the eſtabliſhed church of the whole empire is that of which the King is ſupreme head, which was eſtabliſhed in the firſt year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth; but let us read on,
<q>and that the clergy of the ſaid church may hold, receive and enjoy, their accuſtomed dues and rights, with reſpect to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ONLY, as ſhall profeſs the ſaid religion.</q>
—Is it this part of the clauſe that eſtabliſhes the church of Rome? This ſurely not only leaves every individual who now profeſſes that religion, at his liberty to turn Proteſtant, but declares, that that moment the church of Rome ſhall loſe that part of her revenue.—So that this gives the individuals of the laity them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, full power and authority either to continue in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of that religion, or totally to extinguiſh both it and its revenues, juſt as they ſhall think proper.—How, and on
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014159_0021_0F9333CE4B146530"/>
what foundation then, in the name of common ſenſe, is the church of Rome eſtabliſhed?—This kind of ESTABLISHING is ſo much like being a part of the empire, lying out of the juriſdiction of the imperial legiſlature, that common ſenſe itſelf is affronted at the expreſſion.—Will you ſay this act made proviſion for the clergy of that church? I deny it.— The proviſion was made long before.—But you will perhaps ſay, this act does not take it away from them; no,—it takes it away from them no faſter, than the laity renounce that church,—but it does juſt ſo faſt tho'; and that too, to enable his Majeſty to provide another church for them, as the act expreſſes it.—But previous to the paſſing of this act, every Proteſtant who held an eſtate, which was heretofore granted under France, was liable to the payment of the revenues to the church of Rome; nor could any thing leſs than an act of Parliament exempt them from it.—Yet you ſay, by this act the church of Rome is eſtabliſhed! O ſhame! Shame to your underſtandings! rather (I ſhould ſuppoſe) ſhame for your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to miſlead the ignorant!—Had theſe revenues been taken away ſooner, what ſhould have been done with it in the opinions of theſe good Chriſtians? Should it have been applied to the laity? Why to them more than to anybody elſe? It was always reſerved for the ſupport of religion.— Should it have been given to the Proteſtant Clergy? But let us ſee how this rule would work in New-England: Suppoſe the proviſion for the maintenance of their clergy, was to be given to the church of England,—what would they ſay? They would immediately ſay it was arbitrary, unjuſt, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. many hard names they would give it.—It is a bad rule that will not work both ways,—ſurely then the Canadians might have ſaid ſo had it been their caſe.</p>
            <p>I am ſtill more aſtoniſhed at what you tell us of the fruits of their religion.—Religion of all kinds ought to bring forth good fruit.—Far be it from me to be ſo uncharitable as to diſlike any perſon or body of people on account of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſentiments, if they will not impoſe their opinions on others.—My opinion in religious matters is this,—That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all men are anſwerable to their God, and to their God only, for their religious opinions; ſo all men ought to enjoy them, and to have the liberty of worſhipping their God in what manner they themſelves ſhall think beſt; provided they moleſt no other perſon or body of people, whoſe opinions are different from theirs.—But, if the actions of the different ſects in religion are enquired into, we ſhall find, by turning over
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014159_0022_0F9333CF3B3E90A0"/>
the ſad hiſtoric page, that it was the — ſect (I forget what they call them, I mean the ſect which is ſtill moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in New-England, and not the ſect which they ſo much deſpiſe) that in the laſt century deluged our iſland in blood! That even ſhed the blood of the ſovereign, and diſperſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, bigotry, ſuperſtition, hypocriſy, perſecution, murder and rebellion through every part of the empire!—Neither would that ſect, during a ſeries of years, in which they held the power they had uſurped, ſo much as ſuffer the members of the eſtabliſhed church of England, to call upon their God in their uſual manner!—Yet notwithſtanding this treatment, the eſtabliſhed church when (after the reſtoration) it reaſſumed its former power, and ſhone forth again in its former luſtre, it gave this very ſect immediate toleration!</p>
            <p>Moreover, we find, thet even long after the reſtoration, the Maſſachuſetts not only perſecuted the induſtrious ſons of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs and peace called Quakers, unto death; but neither would they ſuffer any perſon to celebrate a day in commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the birth of our bleſſed Redeemer; but by an act of Aſſembly of that province, any perſon who ſhould preſume to keep Chriſtmas-day, was fined in an exceſſive ſum! And in ſome parts of New-England, even to this day, the members of the eſtabliſhed church of England, who reſide among them (even if there be no church of England within an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles) are not allowed the benefits of the ſacraments, either of baptiſm, or the ſupper of the Lord, altho' they are largely fined if they omit conſtant attendance on their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons!—They are alſo to this day, both in Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut (whether reſidents or ſtrangers) prohibited (under a pretence of purity and piety) from walking or riding out, to view the ſacred and adorable works of the great Creator on Sunday! Though that moſt aſſuredly contains as much real religion as the hearing of the ſacred word: And an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent tything man or conſtable, is empowered to interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and (in Connecticut eſpecially) either with or without a precept, to ſeize and impriſon any Gentleman who does not yield immediate obedience to his tyrannical commands! Is this, my fellow ſubjects, I ſay, is this liberty and religion? Surely not.—It is vile tyranny and ſuperſtition, bigotry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, perſecution, and hypocriſy; (let us remember what is ſaid by the Prophet Iſaiah, in a ſimilar circumſtance) —<hi>It is an abomination unto me, ſaith the Lord, I cannot away with it.</hi>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:014159_0023_0F9333CFEB542DA8"/>This, my fellow ſubjects, is a ſtrange kind of liberty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! But it is no more ſtrange than true, that theſe high and mighty ſons of liberty, will allow no liberty either civil or religious, to any but themſelves.</p>
            <p>But let not the hiſtory of the actions of this ſect, create too extenſive a prejudice in the minds of my readers, againſt the people or religion of New-England.—Let no man be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpected for the country in which he lives, or from whence he came; nor for the religion which he profeſſeth;—men may be a diſgrace to their country, or to their religion; but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or religion, can, in my opinion, diſgrace no man.—If the perſon himſelf be an upright man, that is ſufficient, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his country or religion be the ſame as mine, or whether it be not. And I have found many individuals in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, both of the clergy and laity, profeſſing this religion, who are as good men as any on the earth;—are free from bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry and uncharitableneſs,—allow members of the church of England to partake with them in their ſacraments, and as highly deſpiſe the actions which I have mentioned, as any people in the world.—Neither is there any that wiſh more heartily than ſome of them do, to ſee ſuch hypocriſy, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, bigotry and uncharitableneſs, totally rooted out from among them.—Let therefore, the rigid alone take the effects of their bigotry to themſelves, and let the free and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them, be treated with that reſpect and eſteem which upright men of every ſect are worthy of.</p>
            <p>Behold! my fellow-ſubjects! while you are telling us, that your liberties are endangered by the religion of the Canadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, you in your addreſs to them ſay quite the contrary, and bring ſwift arguments to prove it!—O ye diſſemblers! Both Britain and Quebec muſt be blind indeed, if they do not ſee your double dealing at the very firſt glance! Surely, that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, juſtice and public ſpirit of the nation, to which you appeal, will treat ſuch deceitful chicane with the contempt it deſerves. But I hope the guilty alone will receive it; I am a little acquainted with ſome of the New-York Delegates, and am pretty well perſuaded that it ſprung not from them.</p>
            <p>Our union we eſteem as well as you, neither do we want that you ſhould be leſs free than ourſelves; we want not that you ſhould be either hewers of wood, or drawers of water; we want only that you ſhould behave like fellow ſubjects; but ſeeing your riches are encreaſing, and that you can already afford a little, you may not expect that we ſhall bear all the burthen of protecting you, that we did previous to the late war.</p>

It appears to have been calculated with the ſole view of exciting a general ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion throughout the empire! but you may rely on it, you will loſe your diabolical aim. Your former non-importation ſcheme was ſcarcely felt in England, though it reduced many of yourſelves almoſt to poverty. And the few labourers in England, who may perhaps, (and perhaps not) be out of their uſual employ by this aſſociation can ſtill be employed to great profit, in cutting canals to improve our internal navigation, and ſave the heavy expence of land-carriage. In ſhort, if your trade with us was ten times as large as it is, all the labourers who would be out of their uſual employ, till we ſought out other markets for our manufactures, might be employed this way to very great advantage.</p>
            <p>When you were painting out to us, the diſputes to which the town of Boſton was reduced, by removing the ſea only a few miles from her; you ſhould have conſidered that your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation, will reduce all your ports into a much worſe ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor will it be felt by the ports only, but by every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious farmer, in the country, who, for want of markets, for their produce, muſt be bereft of their farms, to pay ſuch debts as neceſſity itſelf will oblige them to contract. Neither will the farms themſelves under theſe circumſtances, ſell for a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their value. There will be therefore innumerably more ſufferers by your aſſociation, than were puniſhed innocently in the town of Boſton; thouſands of whom (to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) hold your aſſociation in the higheſt deteſtation and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. Your proceedings, therefore, are much more tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and unjuſt than thoſe you complain of! yet, they are to be enforced by your committee! who in the name of common ſenſe, among the thouſands that are averſe to your aſſociation, will conceive it any leſs arbitrary, to have the ports block'd up by your committees, than by a man of war?</p>
            <p>I promiſe you, that was I a reſident in America, and your committees ſhould offer to impoſe your tyrannical aſſociation on me, they ſhould have good luck to get off whole.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but the magnanimity of the nation has by this time, furniſhed a parliament of ſuch wiſdom, independence, and public ſpirit, as will cool your fiery diſpoſitions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore harmony throughout the empire. Perhaps they may oblige you to keep your word with reſpect to your aſſociation, though you would not keep your words (delivered by Doctor Franklin) with reſpect to duties on merchandize, which croſſed the ſea.</p>
