            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>

               <q>
                  <hi>And the Souldiers likewiſe demanded of him, ſaying. And what ſhall we do?</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Uſefulneſs of Souldiers in this preſent world of Sin and Luſts, Together with the Honour and Dignity of that Employment, is a thing almoſt all Nations Acknowlege and Approve. But then by how much the more Nations are Civilized and become Polite, by ſo much the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004193_0004_1003F7A2584D92A8"/>
more is the Martial Art Improv'd and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: And by Conſequence, becomes ſo much the more Honourable and Uſeful; Improves and Enobles the Minds of men: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as its Improvements and Uſe is of great Advantage to mankind, ſo it is both Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Laudable for men to Endeavour to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh themſelves with Military Knowlege and Skill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DAVID</hi> that man after God's own heart, As he confeſſes, Pſal. CXLIV 1. <hi>God had taught his hands to War, and his fingers to fight;</hi> So has be made and Dedicated one of his beſt Poems, To and upon, Military Employment; I mean that which is uſually ſtiled David's Elegy, or Mourning over the Death of Saul and Jonathan, Recorded II <hi>Samuel, Chap.</hi> I.</p>
            <p>The Poem (as one<note n="‖" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. <hi>Symmes,</hi> in his <hi>Lovel</hi> Lamented.</note> Expreſſes it) is a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Poem; 'Tis written with a truly Martial ſpirit and life; The Subject is entirely Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; And as it diſcovers the Greatneſs of David'<hi>s</hi> ſpirit; ſo no words can more Commend the true Grandure of a Military Life, or ſet forth the Honour of thoſe that Excel in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Knowlege; ſuch as Saul &amp; Jonathan were.</p>

Nor is the Buſineſs of a Souldier Inconſiſtent with the Life or Character of a Chriſtian; Thoſe that are the profeſs'd Subjects of the Kingdom of Peace; yet are many times called forth into the Field to hear the <hi>Confuſed noiſe of Battle and have their Garments Rolled in blood.</hi> God has not therefore been unmindful of them; Such is the Excellency and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Nature of God's Word, that therein even a Souldier may learn much of his Duty; and how to Conduct himſelf as to be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of GOD <hi>and be Acceptable in the midſt of his</hi> Brethren.</p>
            <p>A Souldier is not a perſon Exempted from the Laws of Reaſon or Religion; nor left to live at an Ungoverned and Lawleſs manner; (Tho' too often they give themſelves too large a Liberty in this Reſpect.) But the Laws of Honour, Juſtice and Sobriety are Equally obliging upon them, as on other men. God has therefore Taught them what he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them, &amp; what it is they ought to Do. Our Text and Context, has an Immediate and Direct relation hereunto; They <hi>Demand, What ſhall we do?</hi> And John gives them a brief, but very Comprehenſive Direction what their Duty is; Thus, <hi>The Souldiers alſo Demanded, And what ſhall we Do?</hi>

I ſhall not at this time trouble you with any Critical Obſervations upon the Text; Either who theſe Souldiers<note n="†" place="bottom">I am ſenſible by Souldiers here. Expoſitors in general <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

But as we Read, <hi>Luke</hi> XXII 52. of the Captains of the Temple; and as it is Evident there were ſome of the Prieſts or Levites, whoſe Employment was to be a Guard upon the Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as John'<hi>s</hi> as well as our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR'<hi>s</hi> Miniſtry, ſeems to be much Confined to the Loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael; It mayn't ſeem altogether Improbable theſe Souldiers were of this ſort. But of which Number ſoever (Either Jews or Romans) they were, ſeems of no great moment to our preſent purpoſe.</note> were; or concerning the Perſon of whom the Demand is made, who was John Baptiſt, the forerunner of Chriſt; It may ſuffice in General to ſay, That among the many that came to hear John's Miniſtry, and Enquire their Duty, the Souldiers came alſo to him and <hi>Demanded of him, What ſhall we do?</hi> The whole of the Account is perfectly Souldier-like; The Enquiry is expreſs'd with the very Air and ſpirit of a Souldier in it; They Demanded; They ſpeak as men of true Greatneſs of mind, as perſons who were not accuſtomed to be Demed. 'Tis Recorded of the other perſons, that came before to John, that they Aſked,—But the Souldiers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004193_0007_1003F7E622ABBF68"/>
And what ſhall we Do? And by John's gentle and pious Anſwer and Directions to them, 'Tis abundantly plain, that as he no ways Diſapprov'd of their Calling, ſo a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier may be Taught what he ſhould do from the Laws of Religion.</p>
            <p>From whence in general we may make theſe Two Remarks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Remark,</hi> That the Employment of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is what both GOD and the Goſpel, do Allow, Countenance and Approve of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Remark,</hi> A Preacher of Chriſt, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going beyond the bounds of his Duty, Preach to and Inſtruct Souldiers in their Duty.</p>
            <p>But what I ſhall at this time Inſiſt upon and ſpeak unto from the words, I ſhall caſt into this method, under Three Doctrinal Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>I. 'Tis a Duty, and what a People of God ſhould take care of, That there be among them thoſe Train'd up in the Knowlege &amp; Buſineſs of Souldiers; as that they may become Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Souldiers to fight the Lord's Battles, and be Couragious for themſelves, for their Land and for their Families.</p>
            <p>II. Conſider what Influence &amp; Countenance the Word of God does afford, to Excite and move perſons to faithful &amp; ſincere endeavours to Accompliſh themſelves as good Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004193_0008_1003F6CDEE6FB200"/>
III. Both Reaſon &amp; Experience diſcover it is the Duty of Souldiers to Endeavour eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to become Skilful, in thoſe Methods of Martial Knowlege, as may furniſh them to be, and in the beſt manner make them a Defence to their Country &amp; anſwer the Ends of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>We begin with Conſidering,</p>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>'Tis a Duty, and what a People of God ſhould take ſpecial care of, that there be among them thoſe Trained up in the Knowlege &amp; Buſineſs of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as that they may become Valiant Souldiers, to fight the Lord's Battles, and be Couragious for themſelves, for their Land and for their Families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Employment and Buſineſs of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers is Countenanced and Approv'd, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, ſeems to me plain from our Text. Had it been againſt the mind of God, that men ſhould have been thus Employ'd in this Buſineſs, doubtleſs John, whoſe miniſtry was that of Repentance, would have roughly and ſeverely Reproved them and forbidden it.</p>
            <p>And both the voice of Experience &amp; Reaſon, which in this caſe is the voice of God, diſcover the Neceſſity thereof, and plainly dictate how much it is a Duty for men to become Expert and Valiant Souldiers: that they may be able to anſwer that noble Exhortation of Joab to the Souldiers of Judah, 2 Sam X 12. <hi>That they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004193_0009_1003F7EE67FAB9D8"/>
be of good Courage and play the men for their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and for the Cities of their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not come up into the Pulpit to teach the Arts of War. This is not the buſineſs of a Miniſter of the Kingdom of Peace. But as Souldiers may demand of ſuch, <hi>And what ſhall we do:</hi> So as the Goſpel deſcends to conſider men in every Condition and Station they are placed in Providence. As it Inſtructs them to be Faithful in the Calling in which they are, ſo it abundantly Countenances &amp; Encourages perſons being Train'd up in Martial Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; and that thoſe that have Abilities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, endeavour to furniſh &amp; accompliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as good Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever may hereafter be in the world, as yet we know and ſee the Time is not come, that men beat their Swords into Plough ſhares, or their Spears into Pruning-hooks; that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould not riſe up againſt Nation, nor the people learn War any more. And however Peaceable the principles and deſigns of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may be, yet they don't Conquer men to an entire Subjection to them, So but that a people are ſometimes Call'd to the Sword, even to Defend the Enjoyment of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Goſpel. And ſo it is likely that Wars and Fightings will be, as long as Satan's Malice and Mens Luſts are ſo Powerful in the world. Nor is a Martial ſpirit Inconſiſtent

with the Profeſſion of Religion, The beſt of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>This Land of Chriſtians has in a peculiar manner found the Advantage thereof. Under GOD, our Lives, our Religion, our Liberties are owing to the Valiant &amp; Martial Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe of our Fore-fathers, who were mighty in Battle. Elſe to all Humane proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, they would have been ſwallowed up at once, as it were, by the Vaſt Numbers of their Indian Enemies, <hi>whoſe tender mercies are Cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know the Common-place Objections againſt Military Exerciſe; Why our Enemies are all Deſtroyed, It don't look likely we ſhall ever be engag'd in War. Beſides, we live in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world, as it were, and none will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves about us. The World ſeems to be alſo all at Peace; and 'tis needleſs and unneceſſary to trouble our ſelves in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

As by him Kings Reign, ſo he cuts in ſunder the ſpirits of Princes, ſcatters their Counſels, &amp; diſappoints their wiſeſt Meaſures, and overturns the moſt peaceable &amp; prudent Meaſures; ſo that whatever fair proſpects of Peace may ſeem to appear, through the wiſe and prudent Counſels of our Gracious KING, yet what Changes may be in the Right Hand of GOD Moſt High, none can ſay; and all Endeavours for Peace be blaſted and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and we called to hear the Alarum of the Trumpet, and the Noiſe and confuſed Sound of Battle—.</p>

Lamentable how much a true Martial ſpirit is laid aſide; And men are not only Careleſs and unconcerned about it;—as if they had no Buſineſs,—As if they had no Lives, worth Fighting for,—No Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worth a Saving. But ſpeak of it and too often Treat it with Contempt. And thus by weakning the Hands of their Neighbours, they diſcourage all becoming and Honourable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to attain the Skill. Shall we thus loſe our Name, and Expoſe all that is Dear and Valuable together! Ignorance in Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary affairs is the Mother of Cowardiſe, and tends to make men of a Little and fearful ſpirit and Soul. Men indeed may Talk very High, and vent themſelves in Big ſwelling Words before hand; and make a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and fair Shew: But certainly a perſon of Reaſon and Conſideration, who comes into the Field ignorant of Military Exerciſe, muſt feel ſomething (tho' with a much worſe ſpirit) like David, in an Armour he had not proved.</p>
            <p>Knowlege &amp; Experience makes men Hardy and inſpires with Courage—.

Beſides, Were not theſe things ſo; Yet there is ſo much true Manlineſs and Grandure in Military Exerciſe: It inſpires the Mind with ſuch Juſt, Honourable and Exalted Notions and diſpoſitions: It ſo much tends to baniſh Littleneſs and meanneſs, and fill men with Greatneſs of ſpirit. (For, a truly Valiant Souldier would diſdain to Kill even his Enemy in a little Under-hand and ſneaking manner.) I ſay, were it upon theſe Conſiderations only, Every perſon who has any Reliſh for what is Juſt, Manly and Honourable, would labour to maintain it for the good of Mankind.<note n="*" place="bottom">Its obſervable of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> as a martial ſpirit Decay'd among them, in proportion Luxury pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd; and conſequently Effeminacy and a Train of Vices overſpread them, Which as it ſunk their Reputation, ſo by degrees Ended in the Ruine of their Country. And 'tis uſually found True, where a Generous &amp; Military ſpirit ſinks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, Luxury—and Wickedneſs that brings a people Low, overflows as a Flood, Even againſt the Reſtraints and under all the Advantages of Religion.</note>

            <p>War is one of the Heavy Judgments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God puniſheth a wicked and Backſliding People.

we are grown up to in Sin; the Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Decay of Religion that is pure and undefiled before God; When we conſider how little of a ſpirit of Repentance and Amendment is to be found among us, after ſo many repeated Threatnings and Warnings from GOD in his Word,—From His Miniſters, the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this his Jeruſalem,—And by his Judgments. Can we expect any other but that he will Judge us for theſe things, and Avenge his Soul on ſuch a People, whom in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſenſe <hi>He has Known above all the Families of the Earth,</hi> By ſending the Sword to Devour, as well as other Judgments to Conſume and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us.</p>
            <p>But thus much may ſerve to Illuſtrate and Confirm the firſt Truth propoſed. I ſhall therefore now proceed briefly to Conſider,</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>What Influence and Countenance the Word of God does afford to Excite and move perſons to faithful and ſincere Endeavours, to Accompliſh themſelves as good Souldiers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I might begin and tell you, 'Tis the Title and Character the Great GOD takes to Himſelf, That he is the LORD of Hoſts, the GOD of Armies. And ſtill more to the purpoſe; Moſes in the firſt Song Recorded in Scripture, thus ſpeaks of him, <hi>The LORD is a

            </p>
            <p>I might alſo add, 'Tis the Stile and Character wherein our LORD JESUS CHRIST, the Captain of our Salvation Repreſents himſelf, <hi>The Captain of the Hoſt of the Lord,</hi> Joſh. V. 14. The Angels are his Hoſt. <hi>Michael,</hi> i. e. Chriſt, <hi>

            <p>It may be obſerved alſo, Satan is a ſkilful Warriour, and has Slain his Ten Thouſands: And that in order to oppoſe him Succeſsfully, To Engage againſt <hi>Principalities and Powers and the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt wicked Spirits in high places,</hi> which is the buſineſs of Chriſtians; it may be of good Advantage for men to Know ſomething of the buſineſs of Warring.</p>
            <p>I might alſo reckon up and ſet before you a Catalogue of thoſe Worthies which in ſacred Scripture are Renown'd for their Martial Skill, as well as Singular Piety. What a Name did Abraham the Father of the Faithful gain to himſelf by his Val<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004193_0017_1003F7079EA609F0"/>
David that Excellent King, the man after God's own Heart, was alſo Remarkable for his Military Skill and Warlike Actions; and that not only in his Younger years, when he ſlew the Phil<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ian Champion Goliah; but alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when God Rais'd and ſet him at the Head of his Eſpouſed Iſrael. It would be too Tedious to reckon up and tell you of Gideon, Jephtha and Sampſon, of Joſhua &amp; the Judges, of Jehoſhaphat, Afa, Hezekiah, and the good King Joſiah, who was Slain and loſt his Life in Battle</p>
            <p>I might add in the laſt place, The Life of a Chriſtian is called a Warfare. As ſuch we are to put on the whole Armour of God, To fight the good fight,—To endure Hardneſs as good Souldiers; So ſays the Apoſtle Paul, Fight I not as one that beateth the Air, I <hi>Cor.</hi> IX. 26. So the Church of Chriſt in her greateſt preſent Glory, is Compared unto and Repreſented by, An Army with Banners. Which all are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd Similitudes from the buſineſs of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>But what I ſhall principally Inſiſt upon, shall be under theſe Three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Military Skill and Knowlege is what the Bible does Direct and Require we ſhould labour to Attain. That this is Countenanced and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in God's Word, I have before obſerved to you; and that in our Text—. But ſtill
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004193_0018_1003F7BEA66D0D28"/>
this is what we are therein Directed &amp; required unto—. This I gather from that noble Martial Poem of David'<hi>s,</hi> upon the Death of Saul and Jonathan, Wherein we find he left this Command. 2 <hi>Sam l.</hi> 18 To Teach, the Children of Iſrael the uſe of the Bow. The Bow is here Expreſs'd by being the chief War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Inſtrument then in uſe: Eſpecially that wherein the Philiſtines, their then preſent and moſt terrible Enemies, were Expert in the uſe of,<note n="*" place="bottom">I forbear mentioning here, that well known place, Rom. XIII. 1. <hi>The Powers that be are of God.</hi> Since it may, perhaps be thought a ſtretching the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's ſenſe too far—: But when we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, The general Latitude of the Expreſſion. <hi>The Powers that be.</hi> When alſo we Conſider, The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperors Borrowed this Name from the Army, as Chief General; perhaps the Apoſtle's Expreſſion may fairly enough Extend to Military Officers,—or Powers; as well as Civil Power properly ſo called.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now I can't but conſider this Command as ſtill in Force among God's Spiritual Judah. Martial Knowlege being ſtill as neceſſary, and as uſeful, as it was in David'<hi>s</hi> time: And where the Reaſon and Nature of things continue the ſame, our Obligation thereunto ſeems alſo to be binding upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:004193_0019_1003F8029215D648"/>
And from this Example of David, to me it appears, Our chief Military Officers ſhould ſee to it, and uſe all proper Endeavours, that Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Skill and Knowlege ſhould be Encouraged and promoted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Again,</hi> That Military Employ is Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced in God's Word, appears from the many grand and diſtinguiſhing Characters that are given to Souldiers that are Valiant and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert. Thus they are call'd, The Excellency or Beauty—The Glory of a People. When therefore David Employs his pen in that noble manner to Lament Saul &amp; Jonathan, He begins and ends his Poem, thus; The Beauty of Iſrael is ſlain,—How are the Mighty fallen!—And can words be thought of more ſtrongly,—or more greatly to deſcribe the Excellency and Glory of Valiant Souldiers?—<hi>They were ſtronger than Lions—They were ſwifter than Eagles.</hi> Saul, tho' perhaps he was a wicked man, yet was a noble Souldier; God gave him another Heart, the Heart or ſpirit of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Valiant Souldiers, are under GOD, the ſupreme Refuge and Defence, the Security and Safety of a People. Upon ſuch does very much the Earthly Security, Peace &amp; Happineſs of a People depend: As they are an Awe and Guard againſt Encroaching Enemies; or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt thoſe that Invade and Spoil them.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004193_0020_1003F7C029E92040"/>
A People or Land without ſuch men, is in ſome ſort like the Vineyard of God—<hi>Whoſe Hedge is taken away, and its Stone-wall &amp; Tower, broken down,</hi> and lies open a Prey for the wild Beaſts of the wilderneſs to devour and deſtroy it. David therefore who well knew the Safety of making God his Truſt, and that this was his principal Defence; yet bleſſes God who taught his Hands to fight and his Fingers to war.</p>
            <p>And to Repreſent this ſafety and Defence to us, the Church, under Chriſt, is thus deſcribed, Cant III. 7, 8 <hi>Behold, his bed, which is Solomon's: Threeſcore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Iſrael They all hold Swords being expert in War: Every man hath his Sword upon his thigh,</hi>—</p>
            <p>But I proceed briefly to ſay;</p>
            <p>PROP III. <hi>Both Reaſon and Experience diſcover it is the duty of Souldiers, to Endeavour, eſpecially to become Skilful in thoſe methods of Martial Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, as may furniſh them to be, and in the beſt manner make them, a Defence to their Country, and anſwer the End of Souldiers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need, and ſhall ſay little under this Head. The Propoſition being Evident from thoſe that are foregoing, and the End and Deſign of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Let me juſt Obſerve to you; Almoſt every Country have their differing ways of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War upon their Neighbours. And almoſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004193_0021_1003F70C23BC4508"/>
every Country, or Age, makes ſome alterations in the Inſtruments of Methods of War. The preſent is very Different from the former Age, and that from the ancient ways of Warring. Beſides, there are many Stratagems &amp; Methods of making War that are very uſeful &amp; neceſſary to be Known by Souldiers—: Now then as the Buſineſs, End and Deſign of Souldiers principally, is to be a Defence and Safety to their Country, it highly becomes ſuch, eſpecially thoſe that would be Expert, and in the beſt manner anſwer the End thereof, to labour to Know and underſtand every thing that may Enable them in the beſt manner to Attack and Oppoſe Battle, and Vanquiſh the Enemies they are or may be called to Encounter.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to make ſome brief <hi>IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROVEMENT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here in the firſt place,</p>
            <p>USE, I. <hi>Is it as we have heard? Then we may Infer, The Art Military is what every Perſon ſhould Labour to Encourage and Countenace.</hi> I would not here be underſtood, nor do I mean, That every man ſhould himſelf labour to be a Souldier. God has diſtributed his Gifts to men Variouſly, as pleaſes Him. One is a good Tradesman—, Another is Skilful in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks—; On another has he beſtowed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004193_0022_1003F7CA066832A0"/>
the ſpirit of a Souldier, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such then ſhould Endeavour to Accompliſh themſelves for that Buſineſs; And all ſhould promote &amp; Encourage it.</p>
            <p>And this ſhould be the Rule for Souldiers in Chuſing, or others whoſe buſineſs it is in Appointing and Commiſſionating of Military Officers, Even thoſe that are moſt Expert and Valiant and furniſhed with a Martial ſpirit. Every good man is not neceſſarily a good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, or qualified for Military Poſts &amp; Power.</p>
            <p>I know 'tis too much the Humour of people not to Regard this very much;—And if men Labour to furniſh themſelves with Military Knowlege; Preſently, He is an Ambitious and aſpiring man,—He ſhan't be promoted to any place. An unjuſt and ſhameful Principle where it prevails.</p>
            <p>As thoſe that are moſt knowing and Skilful, are the propereſt perſons for ſuch Employ, ſo ſuch Induſtry and Endeavours ſhould be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged &amp; Rewarded, by the proper Honours that belong thereunto.</p>
            <p>USE II. <hi>Is it ſo—? Then hence, Souldiers ſhould Endeavour by all proper and neceſſary Methods to gain and furniſh themſelves with the Knowlege of every part of Military Skill.</hi> It is not Enough, That they Underſtand the Buſineſs of the Training Field, the Exerciſe of the Gun, or
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004193_0023_1003F80726724900"/>
Spear, or other Military Inſtruments, to Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh the Sword, and conduct themſelves grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in every part of Exerciſe; 'Tis not eno', That they underſtand the words of Command, and know how to March Regularly; <hi>Keep their Ranks and Files;</hi> That they are acquainted with the proper Facings, and make good their Ground.</p>
            <p>But they ſhould Obey the Commands of their Officers Chearfully, and underſtand the ſeveral beats of the Drum, that great Warlike Inſtrument; They ſhould learn the reviving and animating Sound of the ſhrill Trumpet, that noble &amp; reviving Sound; The Trumpet, that great Reſemblance of the Alarum to the final Judgment.</p>
            <p>They ſhould alſo learn how to Charge their Enemies Succeſsfully; How to make Choice of the moſt Advantagious Ground; when to Advance; and how to make a regular, ſafe and Advantagious Retreat.</p>
            <p>Moreover, It becomes them to Endeavour to learn the Art of Encamping—, How to Defend themſelves by Entrenchments and the methods of Circumvallation—: How to Fortify and Defend our Coaſts, or Borders, by Caſtles, Forts &amp; Garriſons; How to Beſiege our Enemies; to Batter down or Scale their Walls; Break their Ramparts, and force them to Surrender.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004193_0024_1003F7CB91DEBCD0"/>
How alſo to purſue a Victory Succeſsfully when it is gained, And all ſuch Stratagems and ways in uſe in Times of War and which Accompliſh a Souldier.</p>
            <p>In a word, How to be and how to Endure Hardneſs as good Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I can't but think it part of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Souldiers, to underſtand the ways of Fighting by Sea; in which ſo much of the Engliſh Strength lies; and in which they have been ſo Superior and Succeſsful. That they be not Strangers to the various ways of Enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in ſuch Battles; Boarding their Enemies, and Maſtering their Oppoſers. Together with heaving of Bombs, thoſe terrible Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Deſtruction; and all other parts of that way of Warring.</p>
            <p>I might add, 'Tis a Souldiers Duty and Buſineſs, To ſee to it and take ſpecial care their Arms be kept in good Order, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves well furniſhed with Armory, and they ever fit for Service. And be ſure never enter into or appear in the Field, unleſs in every part they are Accompliſhed and Furniſhed for Souldiers.</p>
            <p>How Ridiculous does a man appear in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, when but Half Dreſs'd? Or like David'<hi>s</hi> Meſſengers, with their Beards half Shaved; or their Garments cut off by their Skirts?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:004193_0025_1003F711F0E2D4E0"/>
As much Ridiculous &amp; Unſeemly is it, for a Souldier to appear in the Field without every part of his Armour well Ordered. And I think Officers ſhould be both Exemplary and very Careful in this point. But I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>USE, III. <hi>Is it as we have heard? Then we may alſo learn, 'Tis a Laudable &amp; Worthy Undertaking when men lay themſelves out and Endeavour to make themſelves Accompliſhed Souldiers, and gain all the neceſſary Knowlege &amp; Skill therefor.</hi> When their Martial ſpirit is warmed and takes fire; and their hearts are animated to Endeavour to Acquire that Martial Knowlege as may fit them to ſerve GOD and their Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Its certainly a Glory to a People; and then a Defence upon all that glory, when a Country has many men Skilful in War. And to me, it appears a Reproachful Negligence that Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Knowlege &amp; affairs are ſo much neglected and Diſregarded; Eſpecially by thoſe of the Military Order: That Guns and Swords muſt lie and be Eaten up with the Ruſt—; Or what is worſe, Men have none at all. And Souldiers appear, Rather as if they were going to ſome mean and ſneaking Employ, they are aſham'd of, than into the Field.</p>
            <p>If pride &amp; Gay Attire is any where Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or may be Allowed, it ſeems to be in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004193_0026_1003F6E8700FECB0"/>
Souldiers: And without ſomething of this, the Employ &amp; the Perſons become Contemptible and mean.</p>
            <p>I would more Eſpecially Direct my ſelf <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>der this Uſe, to You, SIRS, at whoſe Deſire I appear in the Pulpit at this Time; who have Demanded of me, <hi>And what ſhall we do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what I have ſaid, You are ſenſible, how Honourable, Uſeful, Beneficial &amp; Manly a thing Souldiery is to the World; And how much it is the Duty of all who have a Martial ſpirit, to Accompliſh themſelves with Martial Knowlege.</p>
            <p>I truſt it is with a Deſign for GOD's glory, and a View of rendring your ſelves Uſeful in your generation, you now undertake this Buſineſs; and not with a Vain ſpirit, ſeeking only Applauſe from men and to make a ſhew,—</p>
            <p>Let me then preſs you to Conſider, You are under the Eye of GOD Almighty; And He expects whatſoever we do, we do it faithfully. Engage then in it as your Duty, and ſteadfaſtly purſue your Deſigns. Believe, Military Skill is not Born with men; nor is it a Reproach for men to lay out themſelves to Acquire it: <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is Manly, Honourable and Uſeful.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004193_0027_1003F80D4F9D8348"/>
Study then to Accompliſh your ſelves with all the parts of Military Knowlege &amp; Exerciſe: Give Diligence and application thereunto; and let your profiting appear to all. Don't become like a man going about to build a Tower, but ere he has gone thro' is unable to go any further; and men begin to mock him. Count up the Coſt: and be faithful in this Calling.</p>
            <p>You ſhould ever Conſider, GENTLEMEN, You are Voluntiers; and the World expects it is from a Love to the Art Military—, and a Deſign to render your ſelves Capable &amp; Uſeful, you undertake this—.
