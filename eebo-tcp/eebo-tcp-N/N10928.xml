            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE common uſe of Spirituous liquors diſtilled from molaſſes, grain, fruit, &amp;c. is a matter that calls for the particular attention of every lover of mankind.</p>
            <p>Several phyſicians of note, <note n="*" place="bottom">Doctors Hoffman, Cheyne, Short, Lind, Buchan, &amp;c.</note> have given it as their ſentiments, that thoſe diſtilled ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits when taken inwardly, even tho' mixed with water, deſtroy the human frame; being burning ſpirits, the uſe of which bring on many fatal diſeaſes, ſuch as fevers, jaundice, dropſies, conſumptions, and whereby multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are daily deſtroyed. That they parch up and contract the ſtomach to half its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſize, like burnt leather, and rot the entrails, as is evident, not only by opening the bodies of thoſe perſons who are killed by drinking them; but alſo by what Doctor Hoffman ſays, was obſerved of the effects which the cauſtic fiery remaining waſh of the diſtillers, has on the guts of thoſe hogs which in ſome places are fed by it, which are thereby ſo tendered, that puddings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made in them: Wherefore all people, who have any regard to their health and lives,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:013831_0002_0F91B180E63FB3C8"/>ought to tremble at the cravings for ſuch poiſonous liquors, which ſhorten and deſtroy the lives of ſuch multitudes of people. It is farther obſervable, that the free uſe of thoſe Spirits, deprave the morals of thoſe who addict themſelves thereto; the feelings of their minds are gradually benumbed; an inſenſibility to the healing influences of grace prevails, and many become prophane and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of their duty to God and Man.</p>
            <p>Doctor Cheyne in his Eſſay of health and long life, ſays, "All people, who have any regard to their health and lives, ought to tremble at the firſt cravings for ſuch poiſonous liquors. The maladies begot by them bring forth neceſſity upon neceſſity of drams and gills; till at laſt, a kind dropſy, nervous convulſion, flux, if not a fever, or phrenſy ſets the poor ſoul free. It has often raiſed in me, ſays the Doctor, the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly reflections, to ſee the virtuous and ſenſible, bound in ſuch chains and fetters, as nothing leſs than omnipotent grace or the unrelenting grave could releaſe them from."</p>
            <p>It is pretended, that drams comfort, warm, and defend from the ſeverity of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to which men are ſometimes expoſed; without which they ſay, they ſhould periſh with cold; which is probably, in a great meaſure, true of thoſe who are habituated to drink them; the blood of ſuch being thereby ſo much improveriſhed, that it is
<pb n="3"
                   facs="unknown:013831_0003_0F91B181C46FD188"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>well known many of the drinkers of drams are cold and lifeleſs in the midſt of ſummer, without frequent repetitions; this is what ſome of them have owned. But on the other hand, how much more able are ſober perſons to endure cold and hardſhips; their vital heat not being extinguiſhed by intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, does by its kindly genial warmth, more effectually ſecure them from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemency of the weather, than the falſe flaſh of a dram. Beſides, it is well known, that men did not periſh in the coldeſt countries for want of drams formerly, when they were not to be had, of the undoubted truth of this, Captain Ellis gives a full proof in the account of his voyage to Hudſon's bay, page 199: Where he obſerves, "That the natives of the very cold coaſt of that Bay, to whom the French are kinder than to ſell diſtilled ſpirituous liquors, are tall, hardy, robuſt and active; whereas thoſe of them that are ſupplied with drams from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, are a meagre, dwarfiſh, indolent people, hardly equal to the feverity of the country and ſubject to many diſorders. And as to the pernicious effects of ſpirituous liquors in very hot climates, (as on the coaſt of Guinea) it is obſerved, that the French and Portugueſe, who do not indulge in diſtilled ſpirits, are healthy compared with the Engliſh; who, drinking freely of ſpirits, &amp;c. die faſt."</p>
            <p>The unhappy dram-drinkers are ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely bound in ſlavery to theſe infernal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013831_0004_0F91B182676FDB10"/>that they ſeem to have loſt the power of delivering themſelves from this worſt of bondage. How much then is it the bounden duty of thoſe, who have it in their power to withhold this deſtructive man-bane, either as parents, maſters, or rulers to the people committed to their truſt. This is a caſe ſo calamitous to mankind, that to have a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſenſe of it, and yet not to remonſtrate, nor earneſtly caution againſt it, is certainly as criminal as it is unfriendly not to warn a blind perſon of a dangerous precipice or pit. Yet, alas how unconcerned are the greateſt part of mankind at this enormous ruin of multitudes! In trials for life, what diligence is uſed to find the occaſion of the loſs of one ſubject. What care will not a faithful Phyſician beſtow for the preſervation of one life. How did the wiſe Romans honour him, who ſaved the life of one Roman citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. But in the preſent caſe it is not one, nor one hundred, nor one thouſand, but probably no leſs than a million that periſh yearly.</p>
            <p>The miſtaken uſe and grievous abuſe of rum and other diſtilled ſpirits, in no caſe appears more palpably than at the time of harveſt, a buſineſs which the people under the Moſaic diſpenſation were enjoined to carry on with humiliation and thankſgiving; but which amongſt us, through the free uſe of ſpirituous liquors, is made an occaſion of a greater abuſe of the creatures and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013831_0005_0F91B1845C681070"/>of the Creator; this ariſes in many, from a miſtaken perſuaſion that hard labour, particularly that of the harveſt field, cannot be carried on without uſing a quantity of rum or other diſtilled ſpirits. In ſupport of this opinion, we are frequently told of the many people who have died at thoſe times through the extream heat and fatigue, and it is ſuppoſed that many more would die, if a plentiful uſe of ſpirituous liquors was not allowed; but this is a miſtaken notion, it being much more likely that the free uſe of rum occaſioned the death of thoſe people, the quantity they had ſwallowed down, ſending a great flow of ſpirits into the head in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſtrength of their body, cauſed them to ſtrain their ſtrength beyond what nature could bear; and in general the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated large quantities of ſpirit commonly drank during the whole time of harveſt, keeps up the blood in ſo continual a ferment and fever, that people cannot have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſtorative ſleep; their conſtitutions are thereby enervated, their lives ſhortened and an unfitneſs for religious impreſſions gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prevails.</p>
            <p>Theſe weighty conſiderations have induced ſome well minded people to endeavour to induce, by their examples, their friends and neighbours into a contrary practice; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe attempts experience has made it manifeſt that very little or no ſtrong liquor is neceſſary at thoſe times; indeed they have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013831_0006_0F91B184B5873770"/>been convinced that the harveſt, and other laborious work, can be very well managed without making uſe of any ſpirituous liquors at all. If ſuch labour was carried on with ſteadineſs and proper moderation, there would certainly be no need of a recruit of ſtrength being ſought for by that means; more frequent intervals of reſt, with a little food oftener allowed the reapers, and ſmall drinks, ſuch as molaſſes and water, either alone or made more agreeable with a little cider, ſmall beer, or even milk and water would fully enable them to perform their work to their employer's ſatisfaction and their own advantage, and the overplus wages they would receive to the value of the ſpirits uſually given them, might be ſufficient to purchaſe bread for their families. Several perſons who from a perſuaſion that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon method of giving ſpirituous liquors to labourers was exceeding hurtful, have made it a condition with thoſe they have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to uſe any ſpirituous liquors in their fields; theſe have had their work performed to good ſatisfaction and without any damage enſuing to their labourers. Nay, where they have remained any conſiderable time with ſuch employers, they have generally acknowledged themſelves ſenſible of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit ariſing from having thus totally refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the uſe of thoſe liquors.</p>
            <p>Should this practice take place, it would prove a great bleſſing, particularly to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013831_0007_0F91B18580B4E0B0"/>people, one half of whom (a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of this country hath given as his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent) die ſooner than they otherwiſe would do, ſolely by the uſe of ſpirituous liquors. Beſides that, it would diſcourage the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of rye and other grain; a practice which is not only a great hurt to the poor in raiſing the price of bread, but muſt alſo be very offenſive to God the great and good father of the family of mankind, that people ſhould, in their earthly and corrupt wiſdom, pervert their Maker's benevolent intention, in converting the grain he hath given to us as the ſtaff of life, unto a fiery ſpirit, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the human frame and attended with the other dreadful conſequences alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mentioned. Here it may be noted, that any quantity of good molaſſes will by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, yield more than the ſame quantity of proof ſpirit. And that a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of molaſſes if taken with bread at one time, as the Indians will ſometimes do, will not intoxicate, the ſpirituous parts in the molaſſes being properly united, by our good and wiſe creator, with the earthy and balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick parts, ſo as to make it quite friendly to our nature; but when by diſtillation the ſpirituous parts are ſeparated from the other parts, that meaſure of ſpirits proceeding from the ſame quantity of molaſſes, becomes a fiery liquid, deſtructive of the human frame. Doctor Buchan in his Domeſtic Medicine, or Family Phyſician, a book which has gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013831_0008_0F91B1865AE62F48"/>ſo much eſteem as to be twice publiſhed in this city, at page 71 of the Engliſh Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſays, <q>many imagine that hard labour could not be ſupported without drinking ſtrong liquors. This, tho' a common is a very erroneous notion, men who never taſted ſtrong liquors are not only able to endure more fatigue, but alſo live much longer than thoſe who uſe them daily. <note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Smollet, in the account of his travels, ſpeaking of the bad effects even of fermented liquors, obſerves, ' The longer I live, the more I am convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that wine and all fermented liquors are pernicious to the human conſtitution, and that for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of health and exhileration of the ſpirits, there is no beverage comparable to ſimple water.</note> But ſuppoſe ſtrong liquors did enable a man to do more work, they muſt never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs waſte the powers of life, and of courſe occaſion premature old age. They keep up a conſtant fever, which waſtes the ſpirits, heats and inflames the blood and prediſpoſes the body to numberleſs diſeaſes. At page the ſame author tells us, that all intoxicating liquors may be conſidered as poiſons. However diſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is their real character, and ſooner or later they will have their effect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt the ſeveral prejudices in favour of the miſtaken uſe of ſpirituous liquors, there is none gives it a greater ſanction or ſupport, than the prevailing opinion, even with perſons of reputation, that what they term a moderate quantity of rum mixed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013831_0009_0F91B186E8182518"/>with water, is the beſt and ſafeſt liquor that can be drank; hence confirming the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſpirit in one form or other is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. To ſuch who have not been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and think they cannot habituate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to drink water, there may appear to be ſome kind of plea in this argument, eſpecially to travellers, who often meet with beer, cider, or other fermented liquors that are dead, hard, ſour, or not properly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, which tend to generate air in the bowels, producing colicks, &amp;c. But if thoſe perſons ſuffered the weight of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the encouragement they thereby give to the uſe of thoſe deſtructive ſpirits, to take proper place with them, it might ſuggeſt the propriety, if not neceſſity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing a more ſalutary practice.</p>
            <p>That pure fluid (water) which the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent father of the family of mankind, points out for general uſe, is ſo analogous to the human frame, that people might with ſafety gradually uſe themſelves to it. Dr. Cheyne obſerves, that without all doubt, water is the primitive original beverage, as it is the only ſimple fluid fitted for diluting, moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cooling; the ends of drink, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by nature, and he adds happy had it been for the race of mankind, if other mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and artificial liquors had never been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. Water alone is ſufficient and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual for all the purpoſes of human want in drink: Strong liquors were never deſigned
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013831_0010_0F91B187A32C7C70"/>for common uſe. Speaking of the effect of wine, which he ſays to have been ſo much in uſe at the time he wrote, that the better ſort of people ſcarcely diluted their food with any other liquor, he remarks, <q>That as natural cauſes will always produce their proper effects, their blood was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed in gout, ſtone, and rheumatiſm, raging fevers, pleuriſies, &amp;c. Water is the only diſolvent or menſtruum, and the moſt certain diluter of all bodies proper for food.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor Short, in his diſcourſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward uſe of water, ſpeaks much in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. He ſays, we can draw a very convincing argument of the excellency of water, from the longevity and healthfulneſs of thoſe who at firſt had no better liquor, and the health and ſtrength of body and ferenity of mind, of thoſe who at this day have no other common liquor to drink, of this the common people amongſt the Highlands of Scotland, are a ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, amongſt whom it is no rarity to find perſons of eighty, ninety, yea an hundred years of age, as healthy, ſtrong and nimble, as wine or ale bibbers are at thirty ſix or forty. The Doctor ſays, There is a ridicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maxim uſed by drinkers, that water makes but thin blood, not fit for buſineſs. I ſay, ſays he, it is water only that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce its drinkers with the ſtrongeſt bodies and moſt robuſt conſtitutions, where execiſe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013831_0011_0F91B188CD8F4870"/>or labour is joined with it, ſince it beſt aſſiſts the ſtomach and lungs to reduce the aliments into the ſmalleſt particles, that they may better paſs the ſtrainers of the body, which ſeparates the nutritious parts of the blood to be applyed to the ſides of the of the veſſels, and exerciſe invigorates the fibres and muſcles; whereas the rapid motion of blood exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by drinking ſpirituous liquors, cannot fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prejudicial to the body, it will cauſe the watery parts to diſſipate, and the remaining to grow thick and tough, and the event be obſtructions, inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, impoſthumations, &amp;c.—and tho' ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors afford a greater flow of ſpirits for a ſhort time, yet this is always followed with as much lowneſs of ſpirit; ſo that to gain a neceſſary ſtock of ſpirits, the perſon is obliged to repeat the ſame force, till he learns a cuſtom of drinking drams. In this we are confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we conſider the great ſtrength and hardineſs of poor ruſticks in many parts of the world, whoſe proviſions is moſtly vegetable food, and their drink water. The Doctor adds, that it often happens that perſons of tender, weakly, crazy conſtitutions, by refraining from ſtrong liquors and accuſtoming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to drink water, make a ſhift to ſpin out many years.</p>
            <p>After deſcribing the many diſtempers produced by drinking malt or other fermented liquors he adds, that ſeeing conſtitutions differ, it is not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſpirituous liquors ſhould produce all the ſame ſymptoms in one and the ſame perſon, yet that all drinkers have ſeveral of them; and if they come not to that height, it is becauſe they afterwards uſe great exerciſe or hard labour, with ſometimes thin diluting liquors, which prevent their immediate hurting.</p>
            <p>And with reſpect to ſuch well diſpoſed people, who ſtill retain a favourable opinion of the uſe of ſpirits mixed with water, ought they not, even from love to mankind, to endeavour to refrain from it,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013831_0012_0F91B18941674C78"/>on account of the effect their example may have in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging others in the uſe of ſpirituous, liquors, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the example left us by the apoſtle Paul, 1. Cor. viii. 13. <hi>If meat make my brother to offend I will eat no fleſh white the world ſtands, leſt I make my brother to offend.</hi> How much more ought they to refrain from that which tends to eſtabliſh mankind, in a practice ſo generally deſtructive, more eſpecially when they conſider the danger themſelves are in of encreaſing the quantity of ſpirit with their water, as it has been obſerved, that the uſe of this mixture is particularly apt, almoſt imperceptible to gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that uſe it, ſo that many otherwiſe good and judicious people have unwarily to themſelves and others, fallen, with the common herd, a ſacrifice to this might devourer.</p>
            <p>A very eminent phyſician has given the following direction, for the benefit of thoſe who have not wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom enough left at once to abandon the odious and pernicious practice of drinking diſtilled ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, <hi>viz.</hi> By degrees to mix water with the ſpirit, to leſſen the quantity every day, and keep to the ſame quantity of water, till in about the courſe of a week, nothing of the dram kind be uſed along with water. By this means the perſon will ſuffer no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency, but reap great benefit upon leaving off drams or ſpirits as has been tried by many. If any gnawing be left in the ſtomach upon quite leaving it off, a little warm broth, weak tea, or any thing of that kind, will be a ſervice. The appetite always increaſes in a few days after leaving off drams, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by the too long continuance of them, the tone of the ſtomach is deſtroyed. And when the ſtomach is thus affected a cup of carduus, camomile, worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood or centaury tea, every morning faſting and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evening will be found a good remedy.</p>
