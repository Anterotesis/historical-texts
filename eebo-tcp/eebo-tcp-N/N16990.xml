            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INFANT BAPTISM vindicated, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SOME time ſince, a ſmall pamphlet was publiſhed, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the title of, <hi>Conferences on baptiſm.</hi> In anſwer to this, another has been publiſhed, entitled, <hi>Remarks on a late</hi> WRITER <hi>on baptiſm, by</hi> SAND NILES. To evade the arguments for infant baptiſm, contained in the firſt publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Mr. N, as others have been, was obliged to deny, That the covenant of grace was ever made with mankind, and that circumciſion was a <hi>ſeal</hi> of the covenant, between God and his people;<note n="†" place="bottom">See Remarks, p. 3, 4, 5.</note> ſenſible that theſe, if admitted, would form an inſuperable argument for infant baptiſm. This reduces the controverſy to this ſingle point: If God has not inſtituted the covenant of grace, and does not tranſact with mankind in it, the baptiſm of infants is an human invention, and they who inculcate it, <hi>teach for doctrine the commandments of men;</hi> but if God has inſtituted it, they who deny it, reject an ordinance of God, and neglect a uſeful part of chriſtian practice. This ſhews the importance of the preſent ſubject.</p>
            <p>As it may aſſiſt the reader in underſtanding the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, I will hazard a general conjecture concerning Mr. N's ideas on theſe ſubjects: if it be not accurately juſt, the error will be pardonable, as he has not explicitly conveyed them.</p>
            <p>Mr. N. ſuppoſes, if I underſtand him, That in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Abraham, God promiſed and ſecured the land of Canaan, with many temporal favours, for a poſſeſſion to his ſeed. In connection with this, he inſtituted many religious rites, which were typical of Chriſt and ſpiritual bleſſings. When, therefore, the poſterity of Abraham inherited the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed land, and Chriſt, who was eminently the ſeen promiſed, came and completed the work of redemption, the covenant
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021898_0003_0FB5EC0501CF8BF8"/>with Abraham was fulfilled—the end of thoſe religious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions attained, and that whole diſpenſation diſannulled.—Conſequently, no viſible covenant ſubſiſts between God and his people, under the goſpel diſpenſation; nor are baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper, ſeals of any federal tranſaction between them; but duties, in common with others, which believers are to perform, in obedience to the commands of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Others conſider the covenant with Abraham, as being the covenant of grace, and a perpetual inſtitution to the people of God; in which they tranſact with him, in a viſible and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic manner; and divine ordinances, as confirming tokens or ſeals of this tranſaction. This expreſſes the difference, and introduces the propoſed ſubject, which is, To explain or define the covenant of grace.</p>
            <p>That diſtinct and clear ideas of this ſubject may be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſhould be premiſed, That covenants ſuppoſe parties, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conditions, and are adapted to the end deſigned by them. It may be further obſerved, That the ſcriptures ſpeak of two covenants, without giving either of them any diſtinguiſhing name or title. One of theſe, was eternally made between the father and the ſon: the other ſubſiſts between God and his people. To prevent confuſion of thought and language,<note n="*" place="bottom">Either not attending to this diſtinction, or not admitting it, appears to be the ſource of the confuſion and abſurdity, ſo apparent in Mr. N's deſcription of covenants, p. 5, 6, 7.</note> the former has been denominated, <hi>The covenant of redemption:</hi> having been concerted between the Father and the Son, with reſpect to the redemption of the human race. In this, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our conception, the Father, viewing the human race as fallen, propoſed the incarnation and death of the Son, as the way and means of their recovery. To induce him to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, he <hi>et before him,</hi> in connection with that dazzling glory which this would reflect on the divine character and government, the honour and <hi>joy,</hi> of redeeming an inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of miſerable ſinners, from wrath and hell, and exalting them to a ſtate of dignity and bleſſedneſs in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly kingdom. Theſe appeared to the Son ſo important,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021898_0004_0FB5EC07E023B4F8"/>glorious and deſirable, that for the ſake of obtaining them, he cheerfully conſented, <hi>humbled himſelf and became obedient unto death, even the death of the</hi> CROSS. The other has ſubſiſted between God and men, and been termed, <hi>The covenant of grace;</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from the covenant of works, made with man in his innocent ſtate: and expreſs the infinite condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and grace of God, in forming it, and receiving man into it, and the important and valuable bleſſings, he <hi>graciouſly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon him in it. To explain and underſtand this, it ſhould be conſidered, That God made a covenant with man, at leaſt implicitly, in his primitive ſtate: promiſing him the continuance of his favour, and everlaſting bleſſedneſs in his preſence, as the conſequence and reward of perfect obedience to his commands; but threatned to puniſh diſobedience with eternal death. By violating this covenant, he ſecluded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his race, from all divine favours, upon the baſis of law and deſert, incurred the divine diſpleaſure, and involved himſelf and his poſterity in an abyſs of miſery. In this ſtate of horror and deſpair, God intimated to him, his gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of redeeming and ſaving him through the interpoſition of a mediator. He then propoſed a <hi>new</hi> covenant, in which perſonal merit was excluded, and the atonement of Chriſt was the baſis of his favour and acceptance. He promiſed pardon and eternal life, as acts of meer grace, to all true believers in Chriſt Jeſus. The proſecution of this <hi>glorious device of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſinners through a mediator, in the external application and uſe of wiſely adopted means and mercies, is the</hi> DISPENSATION, <hi>and the promiſe of eternal life to believers in him, is</hi> THE COVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT OF GRACE. For a ſeries of ages, God treated with mankind upon this covenant, externally acquainting them with it, by the miniſtry of holy men, to whom he revealed it, and by whom he invited them into it; but he tranſacted it, with thoſe who complied with the terms of it only ſpiritually and perſonally, without preſcribing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

I. The parties, God and men.</p>
            <p>If it be ſuppoſed, that the exceeding guiltineſs of man, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits all federal connection, between him and his God,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Mr. N. is very confident in denying, That the covenant of grace could have been made with Abraham. To demonſtrate the impoſſibility of it, he has expreſſed the ingredients of a covenant, and having compared the ability of Abraham with them, inferred, that it was impoſſible, that the covenant of grace could have been made with him.</p>
                  <p>He ſays, p. 5, 'The following things are neceſſarily included in a covenant.' For the ſake of brevity, I make no remarks on the three firſt, though juſtly obnoxious to cenſure, and examine only the two laſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. 'Merit on both ſides'—ſo where there is no merit, no worth or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, as he appears to explain merit, there can be no covenant, conſequently there can be no covenant between beings totally depraved. But this article implies, that a covenant may ſubſiſt between parties, if there be merit on both ſides. God is poſſeſſed of infinite worth: Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham is a partaker of God's image, the ſum of all excellency, therefore God and Abraham may be parties in the ſame covenant. Yet he ſays, 'Abraham nor any of his poſterity, can ever boaſt of this, becauſe by the fall, he loſt all the excellency there ever was in man, in this happy ſtate.' But I cannot comprehend, how Abraham and his poſterity, who were born totally depraved, <hi>fell</hi> and <hi>loſt</hi> their excellency. That they fell and loſt all the excellence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ever was in man, in his happy ſtate, when Adam fell and loſt it, two thouſand years before they were born, has really ſo much of the myſterious in it, I ſhall not attempt to explain it.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <q>5. And laſtly, neither party ought to be under prior obligations reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the conditions of the covenant; but Abraham was never free from being under the ſtrongeſt obligation,</q> that is, to love and honour God, 'and therefore, could not poſſibly be a party in the covenant.' Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this, perſons cannot be parties in a covenant, who are under previous obligations to each other. If, therefore, pious perſons are under obligations to love and delight in one another, before they covenant toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they cannot be parties in a covenant, or enter into church ſtate. If angels are obliged to honour and love one another, they cannot tranſact in a covenant together: and if the father and ſon, as diſtinct perſonalities in the God-head, were under eternal obligations to love, honour and delight in each other, they were eternally diſqualified from covenanting together. The want of merit or worth, in the preceding article, diſqualified wicked men and devils, from covenanting with one another; and according to this, the merit or worth of the holy, diſqualify them from being parties in a covenant: and thus, according to the two laſt things 'neceſſarily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a covenant,' it was impoſſible, that a covenant ever could have taken place, or ever can, between the good in heaven, or on earth; or between the wicked on earth, or in hell.—Yet he ſays, <q>The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tranſaction of the covenant of grace, was <hi>only</hi> between the Father and the Son, and that before all worlds.</q> But in contradiction to this, and all he has ſaid to prove, that the covenant of grace could not have been made with Abraham, he ſays, p. t, 'This,' (the covenant of grace) <q>Abraham had a diſcovery of, was intereſted in, and was <hi>renewed</hi> to him from time to time, till the covenant of circumciſion was annexed to it.</q> So according to theſe two propoſitions, the covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, which was made with Abraham, was annexed to the covenant of grace, which was <hi>only</hi> made between the father and the ſon, before all worlds!</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>How natural it is for mankind that would ſupport error, to ſtrain all their faculties, and almoſt do violence to ſcripture and reaſon, in order to propagate a ſcriptureleſs tenet.</q> See Mr. N's remarks, p. 19.</p>
               </note> it will be removed by conſidering the <hi>medium,</hi> through which all tranſactions take place, between an holy God and ſinful creatures: <hi>through</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>a bleſſed centre of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and communion.</hi> The union of the divine and human nature, in his perſon, or as the ſcriptures expreſs it, <hi>The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the God-head dwelling in him bodily,</hi> perfectly qualifies him for the important office, of mediating between an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God and guilty ſinners. In him, <hi>God is reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> propoſing the moſt merciful terms and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and perſuading to a compliance, by the moſt affecting conſiderations. An apprehenſion and ſenſe of theſe, exiſting in the mind, expel from it that horror and dread, which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of ſin and guilt produce, allure and conſtrain it to a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021898_0006_0FB5EC1197A5C5A0"/>cordial acceptance. Thus, in Jeſus Chriſt, God and men meet and unite: they contract with each other, and walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as thoſe who are agreed, in all the endearing expreſſions of harmony and love.</p>

II. The Terms.</p>
            <p>In the covenant which God has inſtituted, he propoſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the great good, the bleſſed portion and reward, to be poſſeſſed by thoſe who accede to his terms, and enter into covenant with him. This compriſes in it, all that protection, grace and comfort, which ſhall beſt ſubſerve the intereſts of God's kingdom and their own good in this world, and the enjoyment of God forever, in the world to come. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent comfortable, and the future eternal enjoyment of God, as the all-ſufficient, ſatisfying portion of the ſoul, is that bleſſed motive which he propoſes, to induce man to comply with the terms or conditions on his own part.</p>
            <p>The requiſitions or terms on the part of man are, That for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking all other as the objects of his reſpect, deſire and purſuit, he ſhould make choice of God for his ſupreme good and chief end, obey his commands and ſeek his glory, confiding in his grace, through Jeſus Chriſt, for pardon and acceptance. Theſe are implied in the words addreſſed to Abraham, <hi>I am thy ſhield and thy exceeding great reward—I am God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; walk before me and be thou perfect. As for me, behold my covenant is with thee, and thou ſhalt be a father of many nations:</hi>

The ſame good to be enjoyed, <hi>God, over all bleſſed forever</hi>— Poſſeſſed through the ſame medium, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous;</hi> and enjoyed in the ſame way, <hi>the way of holineſs,</hi> or univerſal obedience to the commands of God. In ſucceeding ages, when God gave the Iſraelites the ten commandments, engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on tables of ſtone, theſe were called <hi>the tables of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. 9.</note> When, in addition to theſe, he preſcribed particular laws and ordinances, which were inſerted in a book, it was called, <hi>The book of the covenant.

            </p>
            <p>Similar to the terms on which God covenanted with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and the Iſraelites, were thoſe preſcribed by Chriſt, to his apoſtles, for the admiſſion of members to their communion. They were to preach <hi>repentance for the remiſſion of ſins in his name;</hi> and to teach them, <hi>to obſerve all things, whatſoever he had commanded them:</hi> and they who complied with theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, who profeſſed faith in Chriſt, and ſubjection to his goſpel, ſuſtained the ſame relation to Chriſt, that the poſterity of Abraham did to God, were the covenant people, <hi>the Iſrael of God,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 11.2.</note> under the new-teſtament, as they were under the old.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. 6.16.</note> Let us now conſider</p>
            <p n="3">III. The token or ſeal of it.</p>
            <p>It may be obſerved, That the terms, token, ſign and ſeal, are of the ſame import, and are uſed in the ſame ſenſe. This is evident from Gen. 17.11. compared with Rom. 4.11. God ſaid to Abraham, <hi>It,</hi> circumciſion, <hi>ſhall be a token of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between me and you.</hi> This the apoſtle calls, <hi>The ſign of circumciſion,</hi> and ſays, it was <hi>a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:021898_0010_0FB5EC1CD0E90290"/>The conſiſtency of theſe various terms will appear, only by conſidering, That the ſeal of any engagement or contract, is only the completing ſign or token of it. When God made a covenant with Abraham, he appointed circumciſion to be the token of it. This ſeal of the covenant, by his particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, was to be affixed to all the males of his family, <hi>both thoſe which were born in his houſe, and thoſe which were bought with money.</hi> As this injunction was connected with the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the covenant, if it can be proved, That the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant exiſts and operates under the goſpel diſpenſation, it will be equally evident, that children are the ſubjects of the ſeal of it.—This brings me to obſerve</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That this was a perpetual inſtitution.</p>
            <p>That ſuch a covenant ſubſiſted between God and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeed of Abraham, is not diſputed by any. But as Mr. N. denies and I affirm, that it had reſpect to the diſpenſation of the goſpel, and ſhould be equally obligatory on the ſpiritual, as it had previouſly been on the natural ſeed of Abraham: the proof of it ſhall now be attempted. Not to inſiſt, as Mr. N. obſerves, That the covenants made with Noah and Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, are expreſsly declared to be <hi>everlaſting covenants:</hi> and we have occular demonſtration, that the covenant with Noah yet exiſts, as we obſerve the token of it, <hi>The bow in the cloud;</hi> and as the covenant with Abraham is expreſſed in the ſame terms, we may rationally infer, that it is of equal duration, <hi>An everlaſting covenant,</hi> and according to the original inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, operates equally with the covenant of Noah, in the preſent,<note n="*" place="bottom">That a compliance with the invitations of the goſpel, is the ſame as entering into covenant with God, is evident from Iſa. 55.3.—<hi>Hear, and your ſoul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David:</hi> which may be explained by that <hi>everlaſting covenant,</hi> which he made with him, which was ordered in all things and <hi>ſure</hi>—2 Sam. 23.5. If a compliance with the goſpel imports the ſame as tranſacting in a covenant with God, then a public profeſſion of it, is the ſame as a public covenant tranſaction with him.</note> I would obſerve</p>

1. This is plainly implied in the predictions of the prophets.</p>
            <p>Holy men of old made the goſpel diſpenſation a glorious ſubject of their prophecy. One of the events which they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, as pertaining to it, was that of other nations uniting themſelves with the Jews, as the covenant people of God. From thoſe paſſages which expreſs this, I ſelect only two, which teach it very plainly, (Iſa. 44.5.) <hi>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lord's, and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand to the Lord, and ſurname himſelf by the name of Iſrael.</hi> (Zech. 8.23.) <hi>In thoſe days it ſhall come to paſs, that ten men ſhall take hold out of all</hi> languages of the nations, <hi>even ſhall take hold of the ſkirts of him that is a Jew, ſaying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</hi> That theſe prophecies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to goſpel times, and the converſion of the gentiles, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident from their contexts: and it is equally manifeſt, that they contain two diſtinct propoſitions:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) They do very plainly imply, That the poſterity of Abraham ſhould exiſt, under the goſpel diſpenſation, as the viſible people of God. This is agreeable to the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted prophecy of Iſaiah, (chap. 54.1.) in which he ſtiles the gentiles, <hi>the deſolate,</hi> and terms the Jews, <hi>the married wife:</hi> which the apoſtle quotes, (Gal. 4.27.) and applies to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles termed, <hi>the deſolate,</hi> and the Jews, whom he repreſents as having <hi>an huſband.</hi> This doctrine, which is thus ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the prophecies of the old teſtament, is plainly implied, and clearly expreſſed in the obſervations of the new. It is implied in the words of Chriſt, <hi>Other ſheep I have, which are not of this fold:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John 10.13.</note> which evidently refers to the Jews: for he was <hi>not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 15.27.</note> The deſcription of the apoſtle, very forcibly implies, That the <hi>commonwealth of Iſrael</hi> then exiſted, and that the Jews were <hi>the body,</hi> or people of God.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eph. 2. and 3—6.</note> It is implied in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, SOME <hi>of the branches were broken off—Blindneſs in</hi> PART <hi>is happened to Iſrael.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Rom. 11.17—27.</note> The apoſtle denies, in the moſt emphatical terms, the total rejection and extirpation of the Jewiſh church. <hi>I ſay then, Hath God caſt away his people?</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:021898_0012_0FB5EC2392BC6AD0"/>GOD FORBID—<hi>God hath not caſt away his people which be foreknew. Wot ye not what the ſcripture ſaith of Elias? How he maketh interceſſion to God againſt Iſrael, ſaying, Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars: and I only am left alone, and they ſeek my life. But what ſaith the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of God unto him? I have reſerved to myſelf ſeven thouſand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</hi> EVEN SO <hi>them at this</hi> PRESENT TIME ALSO, <hi>there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">(2). That the proſelyted, or converted gentiles, ſhould enter into covenant with God, and unite themſelves to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as his people. This is, evidently, the meaning of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>One ſhall ſay I am the Lord's, and call himſelf by the name of Jacob, ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand to the Lord,</hi> as ſigning a written covenant, <hi>ſurnaming himſelf by the name of Iſrael, and taking hold of the ſkirt of him that is a</hi> JEW. This agreeable to thoſe prophecies, <hi>Alſo the ſons of the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which join themſelves to the Lord—and take hold of my covenant. The Lord God which gathereth the out-caſts of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, ſaith, Yet will I gather others to</hi> HIM, <hi>beſides thoſe that are gathered to him.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. 56.6—8.</note> The words of Chriſt are of a ſimilar ſignification, <hi>Other ſheep I have which are not of this fold, them alſo muſt I bring in, and there ſhall be one fold, and one ſhepherd.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">John 10.13.</note> The deſcriptions of the apoſtle ſuggeſt an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of theſe predictions.

               <note n="§" place="bottom">Rom. 11.</note> He deſcribes the gentiles, who were aliens from the common wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of promiſe, as becoming FELLOW-CITIZENS with the ſaints, and of the houſhold of God: as being FELLOW-HEIRS, and of the SAME body; and the gentiles, thus united and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Jews, as being FITLY FRAMED <hi>together,</hi> forming a

            <p>If any addition can be made to theſe ſcripture illuſtrations of this argument, it may be from theſe words of the apoſtle, <hi>Before faith came we were kept under the law, ſhut up to the faith, which ſhould afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our ſchoolmaſter to bring us to Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith. But after faith is come, we are no longer a ſchoolmaſter.—Now I ſay, that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a ſervant, though he be lord of all; But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. Even ſo we, when we were children, were in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under the elements of the world: But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his ſon o redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons— Wherefore thou art no more a ſervant but a ſon.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. 3.21—23. and 4. 1—8.</note> It is very manifeſt from the context, that the apoſtle, in this paſſage, is conſidering the ſtate of the church, before the coming of Chriſt and after it. This he compares to that of a child, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and trained up for the privileges of manhood and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and poſſeſſing an eſtate: and if the ſimilitude of the apoſtle be juſt, it is as evident, that the church under the old teſtament diſpenſation and the new, is <hi>the ſame church,</hi> as that the child, grown from a ſtate of infancy to that of manhood, is the <hi>ſame perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The terms, or conditions of covenanting, are the ſame to believers under the new, that they were to the Jews under the old-teſtament diſpenſation. The Iſraelites were to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no true God, but the God of Abraham, and to obey all his ſtatutes: and there was <hi>one law to the home-born and to the ſtranger.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Exod. 20.3. and 12.49.</note> Chriſt made theſe the terms, on which proſelytes ſhould be received into the number of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. 28.20.</note> All the difference which can be ſuppoſed, is rather of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021898_0014_0FB5EC26A708B8B8"/>words, than ideas. Between the Jews and the heathen, the diſpute was about the deity. The Iſraelites would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no true God, but their own. The heathen acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged many other divinities. So the diſciples acknowledged Chriſt to be the only true Meſſiah. Their oppoſers denied their doctrine and rejected their faith. This appears evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have been the ſame diſpute; eſpecially when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that Chriſt was the God of Iſrael:<note n="*" place="bottom">That Chriſt was the God of Iſrael, to refer to no other paſſages, is evident from the words addreſſed to Moſes, Exod. 33.23.—<hi>And I will cover thee with my hand while I paſs by. And I will take away my hand and then ſhalt ſee my</hi> BACK PARTS.—From which it is evident, that the God with whom Moſes converſed, put on, viſibly, an <hi>human</hi> form; but this was peculiar to the ſecond perſon in the Trinity. And probably, he made this, and other ſimilar appearances, as pledges of his future incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to familiarize that myſterious event, and excite as earneſt expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it in the mind. The ſentiment is further confirmed by the words of Stephen, who ſpeaking of Moſes, ſays, Acts 7.38. <hi>This is be that was in the church in the wilderneſs that ſpake with the Angel in the mount Sinai.</hi> But the term ANGEL Or <hi>meſſenger,</hi> though frequently applied to the Son, can be with no propriety, nor is it ever applied to the Father. If Jeſus Chriſt were the God of Iſrael, then the Jewiſh and Chriſtian church had the ſame head—And if the ſame head, why is it not, muſt it not be the ſame body? And if the ſame body, does it not conſiſt of the ſame members?</note> which will make the diſpute between the Iſraelites and the heathen, and the diſciples and their oppoſers, to have been, Whether Chriſt were the only true God and Saviour, or not?—As the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites received none into their communion, but thoſe who abandoned all other deities, acknowledged their God, to be the only true God, and conformed to their rules of his worſhip: ſo the apoſtles, as is evident from the inſtance of Philip and the eunuch, admitted none to their fellowſhip, but thoſe who profeſſed their faith in Chriſt, and promiſed obedience to his commandments. This ſhews that the requiſitions of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for admiſſion to their number, were the ſame with thoſe the Iſraelites exacted of ſtrangers, for admiſſion to their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges: and that they were of the ſame nature with their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into covenant with God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſame religious ordinances were common to Jews and Chriſtians.</p>

Circumciſion among the Iſraelites, was the token or ſeal of complying with the terms, and entering into covenant with God: and the paſſover, of their deliverance from the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and oppreſſion of Egypt. So baptiſm is the ſeal of our diſcipleſhip to Chriſt: and the Lord's-ſupper of redemption by him. That baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper, are of the ſame ſignificancy with circumciſion and the paſſover, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from this, that they are called by the ſame name. This is manifeſt from the words of the apoſtle, <hi>In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the body of ſins by the circumciſion of Chriſt.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Coloſ. 2.11.</note> That by the circumciſion of Chriſt, the apoſtle deſigned baptiſm, is evident from the parallel paſſage, Rom. 6.2.

               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. 5.7, 8.</note> From which it is evident, that baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper, under the goſpel, are the ſame ordinances with circumciſion and the paſſover among the Jews: or in other words, are the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an circumciſion and the chriſtian paſſover: and therefore ſeals of the ſame covenant.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <p>This is according to the common acceptation; yet ſtrictly ſpeaking, circumciſion only, was the ancient ſeal of the covenant between God and his people. The paſſover did not obtain, until ages after the inſtitution of the covenant; and was particularly deſigned to commemorate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing mercy of God to the Iſraelites, in ſparing, or <hi>paſſing over</hi> their firſt born, when he ſlew thoſe of the Egyptians; and delivering them from the yoke of Egypt. So Chriſt inſtituted baptiſm as the ſeal of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipleſship, and the obligations of chriſtians, <hi>to take up their croſs and follow him, or to die unto ſin and live unto righteouſneſs.</hi> But he inſtituted his ſupper, as a memorial of his dying love, or redemption by him, and as an happy medium of exciting the faith, and promoting the holineſs and comfort of believers.</p>
                  <p>It may here be obſerved alſo, That as it was the God of Abraham, of Chriſt, who inſtituted the covenant with him, eſtabliſhed the ſeal of it, and preſcribed the ſubjects to which it ſhould be affixed: ſo it was he only, who could repeal or change thoſe ſtatutes: as therefore, when he reviſed thoſe laws, and introduced a new diſpenſation, he judged it expedient, only to alter the ſeal, and ſubſtitute baptiſm in the place of circumciſion, the ſtatute requiring the application of it to children, remained in its ancient ſtate, irrepealably eſtabliſhed, as it were, by a new edict, and will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in force, until it ſhall be abrogated, by a new diſpenſation from heaven.</p>

The whole diſpenſation of the new-teſtament is a fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the covenants, made with Noah and Abraham.<note n="††" place="bottom">It has been obſerved, That the covenant with Noah was made through Chriſt, externally repreſented by the ſacrifices which he offered to God, and therefore was the covenant of grace. As it may be queſtioned, Whether this were the covenant of grace, ſince only temporal deliverances and bleſſings are contained in it, it may be ſatisfactory to remark, That it is worthy of particular obſervation, That the firſt intimations of divine mercy to mankind, were only implied in promiſes of deliverance from evil, and from thoſe evils which had previouſly involved them in the greateſt diſtreſs. Thus the firſt parents of mankind, foiled by the ſubtilty of the ſerpent, deprived of their purity and bliſs, and under terrible apprehen ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of greater ſufferings, were comforted with the promiſe, <hi>That the ſeed of the woman ſhould brake the ſerpent's bead;</hi> but this implicitly promiſed, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt.—So Noah and his family, ſaved from the general deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which had overſpread the world, and under fearful apprehenſions, that the ſame terrible calamity would be repeated, were relieved by a gracious promiſe and covenant, confirmed by a viſible token, <hi>That the earth ſhould no more be deſtroyed by the waters of a flood:</hi> and a divine ſecurity of the perpetual enjoyment of the fruits of the earth. As the deluge was an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting emblem of the eternal deſtruction of the wicked, and the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Noah in the ark, of the ſalvation of believers through Chriſt: ſo the promiſe of deliverance from another flood, obtained through the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered to God, implied the promiſe of deliverance from that eternal perdition, and that everlaſting ſalvation of which they were figures, through Chriſt the great ſacrifice.—This is as natural, as that heaven ſhould be contained in the promiſe to Abraham, that his ſeed ſhould poſſeſs the land of Canaan; or that the deſtruction of ſatan's kingdom ſhould be denounced, and ſalvation contained in the promiſe to Adam and Eve, That ſome one of their poſterity ſhould bruiſe the head of the <hi>ſnake.</hi>
                  <p>As the covenant with Noah contained a grant of temporal bleſſings: ſo the covenant with Abraham contained a grant of religious privileges—and thus theſe two covenants comprehended all the temporal mercies, religious privileges and eternal bleſſings implied and ſecured in the covenant of grace.</p>

Future events relating to the government of the world and of the church, were revealed to the apoſtle John, who lived in the beginning of this diſpenſation, and are deſcribed by him in the revelation. Theſe deſcriptions are generally expreſſed in the terms and figures of the old-teſtament; and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to examine their origin, to aſcertain their true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In his viſion he heard a voice, ſaying, <hi>Come up hither, and I will ſhew thee the things which ſhall be hereafter.

So John <hi>ſaw a mighty angel clothed with a cloud and a</hi> RAINBOW <hi>upon his head.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. chap. 10.</note> This angel, from the deſcription of him, was Jeſus Chriſt: He ſtood with <hi>his right foot upon the ſea and his left upon the land,</hi> to denote his abſolute dominion over them; <hi>all things being put under his feet.

            <p>It is equally evident, That the diſpenſations of providence are agreeable to the nature and a fulfilment of the covenant made with Abraham. This is implied in the words of the apoſtle, <hi>This I ſay, that the covenant which was before</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIRMED <hi>of God in Chriſt.</hi>

And can it be ſuppoſed, that Chriſt ſhould vacate it when it was CONFIRMED <hi>in him?</hi> That he ſhould diſſolve that covenant on earth, which was confirmed in him, in heaven? This is illuſtrated by another aſſertion, <hi>This I ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt was the miniſter of circumciſion, for the truth of God, to confirm the promiſes made unto the fathers.</hi> By circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion we muſt underſtand, either the Jewiſh nation or church which was termed, <hi>The circumciſion,</hi>

               <hi>fellow-heirs</hi> with the Jews, and <hi>partakers of his promiſe by the goſpel.</hi> It is therefore as inconſiſtent for a gentile believer to affirm, that the covenant with Abraham is diſannulled, when he enjoys the bleſſings of the goſpel in conſequence of it, as it would have been for an Iſraelite to have aſſerted it, when he was eating the <hi>grapes of Eſchol,</hi> or <hi>the milk and honey, of Canaan.</hi> So that the new-teſtament is ſo far from diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling and abrogating the covenant with Abraham, that it teaches us, that Jeſus Chriſt, the author of it, is the grand officer of confirming and eſtabliſhing the contents of it, and that under his adminiſtration it is brought to its moſt proper iſſue and effect.—We may therefore infer, that the work of Chriſt and his univerſal government of the church and world, are a fulfilment of the covenant which God made Abraham— As Jeſus Chriſt is the agent of fulfilling the covenant with Abraham, and this is the end of his government and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, ſo we are taught, that in officiating as the ſupreme Judge of the world, he will make this the rule by which he will diſtribute rewards and inflict puniſhments.—This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſuggeſted in the deſcription of the general judgment— When the apoſtle in his viſion, <hi>ſaw the dead judged, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and ſaints rewarded, and the wicked deſtroyed, The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God was opened in heaven, and there was ſeen the Ark of his teſtament or covenant,</hi> (deſcribed Exod. 25.10.) <hi>and there were lightnings, and voices, and thundring, and an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and great hail.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 11.15.</note> Thus repreſenting Jeſus Chriſt, as judging quick and dead, agreeably to the covenant made with the Iſraelites in the wilderneſs, and attended with all the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful appearances, the ſame terrible exhibitions of divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, which he diſplayed on mount Sinai when he made it.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Exod. 19.16—18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is manifeſt from the general obſervations, That the terms and language of the covenant which God made with his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient friend, run through the old and new-Teſtament, and that according to the univerſal repreſentation of ſcripture, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſpenſations of divine providence, relative to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
