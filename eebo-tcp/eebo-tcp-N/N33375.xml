            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

When we came to Shemongo, the Indians were ſo wild and fierce, I thought that I and my fellow priſoners ſhould certainly be ſlain; now death was a terror to me, but I think I did in ſome meaſure take ſanctuary in God; ſometimes it troubled me to think of being killed or dying in a heathen land, but one time I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in particular, it ſeemed to me I were as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die now and in this place as I ever ſhould be at any future time or any other place; it was my earneſt deſire to know my duty in all reſpects, and to be rightly diſpoſed to all beings. When I come to the log-houſe where I lived three days, my firſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was to find a place of convenient retirement, and by the ſide of the lake under a high clift of rocks, ſpent much of the three days; ſo when I come to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletown, ſpent much of my time along the woods, I had no book of any kind, endeavouring to ſpend the firſt Wedneſday in every month in private faſting, prayer and meditation when my health and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would admit. Some time in November, one Michael Showers gave me a bible, which was a great comfort to me, I hope I had a diſpoſition of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, for that as I thought then, as it really is the moſt bleſſed book in this world, I took great ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When I thought of running away from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, as I made ſeveral trials, I was very ſolicitous as know my duty, that I might not through ſelf love throw away my life fooliſhly; on the whole conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was my duty, if I could with ſafety and when I had clean eſcaped the guards, to fall on my knees and return thanks, and to aſk for future preſervation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
