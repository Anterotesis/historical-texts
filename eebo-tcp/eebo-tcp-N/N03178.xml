            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We may be uſeful to their Souls, by good Inſtruction, and good Example. We may be helpful to their Bodies, by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hungry, cloathing the Naked, and preſcribing eaſy Remedies to the Sick: We can aid them in their Fortunes, by encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging

of Induſtry, by relieving the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt, and doing all the kind Offices we are able, to our Neighbours. Theſe are the ſeveral Ways of improving the Talents our Maker has entruſted us with; and we muſt every one expect, hereafter to give an Account, how we have employ'd them.</p>
            <p>I WISH it were in my Power, to ſerve Mankind, more than I do, in each of theſe Particulars; but the gracious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Widow's Offering, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages me alſo to caſt my MITE into the Treaſury. I publiſh this ſhort Treatiſe, to lead the Poorer Sort into the <hi>pleaſant Paths of Health;</hi> and when they have the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be <hi>ſick,</hi> to ſhew them the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and eaſieſt Ways of <hi>getting well</hi> again.</p>
            <p>OUR Country is unhappily ſubject to ſeveral very ſharp Diſtempers. The Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Marſhes, Swamps, and great Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſend forth ſo many Fogs, and Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that the Air is continually damp with them: This, in Spight of our Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is apt to ſhut up the Pores all at once, and hinder inſenſible Perſpiration. From hence proceed FEVERS, COUGHS, QUINSIES, PLEURISIES, and CONSUMPTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS, with a diſmal Train of other Diſeaſes,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003843_0003_10026338F27F17F0"/>
which make as fatal Havock here, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our Number, as the PLAGUE does in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>IN the mean Time, this is a cruel Check to the Growth of an Infant Colony, which otherwiſe, by the Fruitfulneſs of our Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the great Number of Recruits, ſent from our Mother Country, would, in a few Years, grow populous, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conſiderable.</p>
            <p>IT is impoſſible to ſee theſe Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties return every Year, without the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Commiſeration. Certainly nothing can be more melancholly, than to have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor People periſh, purely for want of uſing timely Means for their Preſervation. One Miſchief is, moſt of our Inhabitants have ſuch an unreaſonable Averſion to <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> (even where they may have it from their charitable Neighbours for nothing,) that they neglect to take any, 'til their Caſe is grown deſperate, and Death begins to glare them in the Face. They conſider not, that a moderate Skill may recover a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the Beginning of a Diſtemper, while he has Strength to go thro' all the neceſſary Operations, when the whole <hi>College</hi> would not be able to ſave him, after his Spirits
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003843_0004_10026370B939B050"/>
are ſunk, and all the Principles of Life ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>THIS unhappy Temper occaſions a great deal of Mortality: And what makes the Misfortune the greater, is, that it falls heavieſt on the Younger Sort, who are moſt liable to hurrying Diſtempers. Indeed, ſome would be glad of Aſſiſtance, if they did not think the Remedy near as bad as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: For our <hi>Doctors</hi> are commonly ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant in their Fees, whether they kill or cure, that the poor Patient had rather truſt to his Conſtitution, than run the Riſque of beggaring his Family.</p>
            <p>THESE Conſiderations made me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a Work of great Charity and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirit, to communicate to the poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Colony, a ſafe Method of curing themſelves, when they ſhall be ſo unhappy as to fall into any of our common Maladies. And for their greater Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, the Remedies I ſhall preſcribe, may be procured with little Trouble and Expence, being, for the moſt Part, ſuch as grow at their own Doors, or may be eaſily propagated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003843_0004_10026370B939B050"/>
PROVIDENCE has been ſo good, as to furniſh almoſt every Country with Medicines proper for the Diſtempers inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Climate; and ſuch Domeſtick Remedies are always ſufficient for the Poor, who live upon homely Fare, and for the Temperate, who make a right Uſe of GOD's Bleſſings. Their Caſes are ſeldom compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and proceed, for the moſt Part, from Cold, or ſome ſlight Tranſgreſſion. In ſuch Ailments, the Symptoms cannot eaſily be miſtaken, nor is the <hi>Cure</hi> difficult; all the <hi>Secret</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>taking the Diſtemper in Time:</hi> And this will be the more neceſſary, becauſe moſt Diſeaſes that happen from Cold, are excedingly violent, and call aloud for ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>I MUST therefore conjure my dear Country folks, to begin with themſelves as ſoon as they can diſtinguiſh what Sickneſs they have, while Nature is ſtrong, and able to co-operate with the Medicines they take. Nor can we hope, that Heaven will aſſiſt us in our Calamities, unleſs we endeavour, at the ſame Time, to aſſiſt ourſelves.</p>
            <p>IN ſetting down the following Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I have been cautions of talking like
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003843_0005_10039777120F17B8"/>
an <hi>Apothecary;</hi> that is, of uſing hard Words, that perhaps neither my Patient, nor my ſelf underſtand. Nor have I taken them lightly upon Truſt; but am able to recommend moſt of them upon more than Twenty Years Experience; and for the reſt, I have credible Authority. In the mean Time, I hope, none will object, like <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> to the Eaſineſs of any of theſe Remedies; but rather rejoice, that they can have the greateſt of all Bleſſings ſo very cheap. And in Truth, People muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ove Difficulty extremely, to ſlight Health, as they would a Miſtreſs, for being gain'd with little Trouble.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I mention the <hi>Cure,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to deſcribe the <hi>Symptoms</hi> of each Diſtemper, in ſo plain a Manner, that any Perſon may be Maſter of his own Caſe, if he will but attend carefully to what he feels; otherwiſe he might miſtake his Illneſs, and apply an improper Remedy. I ſhall alſo recommend the <hi>Diet</hi> fitteſt to be uſed in each Caſe; which often contributes more to the Patient's Recovery, than his <hi>Phyſick:</hi> At the ſame Time, he ſhall have my beſt Advice, to prevent every particular Ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which will be happier for him, than to know how to cure it.</p>

I SHALL begin with the moſt fatal of all our Diſtempers,<note place="margin">Pleuriſy.</note> a PLEURISY; which diſcovers it ſelf by a brisk Fever, and ſharp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pain, pretty low in one of the Sides, ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now and then into the Breaſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quite back into the Shoulder-Blades: It is uneaſy every Time the Patient draws his Breath, and more ſo when he coughs; which is generally the Caſe in this Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>THE Moment any Perſon finds theſe Tokens upon him, he muſt, without Loſs of Time, take away 10 Ounces of <hi>Blood,</hi> and repeat the ſame three or four Days ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, if the Pain go not away before. On the third Day, he may vomit with 80 Grains of <hi>Indian Phyſick, (Ipecacuania,)</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Night, drink 7 Spoonfuls of <hi>Pennyroyal Water,</hi> or the Decoction of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moderately ſweeten'd. In the mean Time, let him, every three Hours, take Half a Spoonful of <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Linſeed Oyl,</hi> mixt together. He ſhould alſo ſtrew <hi>Indian Pepper,</hi> upon <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyroyal Plaiſter,</hi> and apply it very hot to the Place where the Pain lies, and be ſure to keep himſelf warm, and abſtain from cold Water: Tho' it the Diſtemper ſhould prove obſtinate, you muſt apply a <hi>Bliſter</hi> to his Neck, and one to each Arm, on the fleſhy Part above the Elbow.</p>

THE Patient's <hi>Diet</hi> ſhould be light, and cooling; and his conſtant Drink, either <hi>Linſeed</hi> or <hi>Bawm Tea,</hi> a little ſweeten'd.</p>
            <p>THE beſt Way to prevent this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, will be, to <hi>bleed</hi> in the Beginning of any great Hoarſeneſs, or Cough, which are often the Forerunners of it; and alſo to forbear ſwilling great Quantities of Water, or Small Beer, in ordinary Life.</p>
            <p>SOMETHING a-kin to this,<note place="margin">Fever, Pain in the Head, Breaſt, Eye, or Ear.</note> is a FEVER, and PAIN IN THE HEAD, OR BREAST, or both; and now and then, an Inflammation, and Pain in the EYE, or EAR. In theſe Caſes, you muſt, without Loſs of Time, <hi>bleed</hi> 10 Ounces. The next Day, <hi>purge</hi> with the <hi>Decoction of Mallows,</hi> and 3 Spoonfuls of <hi>Syrup of Peach Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms.</hi> If the Pain ſhould continue, you muſt <hi>bleed</hi> again the third Day, and the Morrow following repeat the <hi>Purge:</hi> And if the Pain be ſtill obſtinate, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new both <hi>Bleeding</hi> and <hi>Purging</hi> a third Time. In the very Beginning, apply the following <hi>Poultis</hi> to the Part where the Pain lies: Boil the Leaves of <hi>Sage, Wormwood,</hi> and <hi>Rue</hi> together, and having beat them ſoft, grate Nutmeg thick upon them, and

bind them on warm, renewing the ſame Night and Morning: And in Caſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe hold out againſt all this, your laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge muſt be a <hi>Bliſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOUR <hi>Diet</hi> ſhould be moiſt, and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch as <hi>Thin Hominy, Chicken-Breth,</hi> or <hi>Water-Gruel;</hi> and your Drink, <hi>Linſeed,</hi> or <hi>Ground-Ivy Tea,</hi> moderately ſweeten'd.</p>
            <p>THIS Diſeaſe will be alſo beſt prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Bleeding</hi> in any violent Cold.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Diſtemper,<note place="margin">Quinſey.</note> conſequent to a Cold, is a QUINSEY, known by a Fever, with an Inflammation of the Glands about the Throat, and of the <hi>Uvula,</hi> to that Degree as to render all Swallowing difficult, and painful. For this, <hi>bleed</hi> immediately 10 Ounces, rather in the Jugular Vein, than in the Arm; and if the Caſe be urgent, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Bliſter</hi> to the Neck. If the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhould continue, <hi>bleed</hi> again next Day. The Morning after, take a <hi>Purge</hi> of the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Mallows,</hi> with <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Peach Bloſſoms,</hi> repeating the ſame 3 ſeveral Times, reſting one Day between. From the Beginning, <hi>gargle</hi> with Dr. <hi>Papa</hi>'s Liquor hereafter deſcrib'd; and if the <hi>Uvu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> be much relax'd, drink Half a Pint of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003843_0007_1002635C90697638"/>
the ſame, Night and Morning, when you don't purge.</p>
            <p>BUT in Caſe it prove no more than a common SORE THROAT,<note place="margin">Sore-Throat.</note> 
               <hi>purge</hi> only once, and <hi>gargle</hi> with <hi>Papa</hi>'s Liquor.</p>
            <p>IN both Caſes, your <hi>Diet</hi> ought to be moiſt and cooling; and your Drink, <hi>Cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foil Tea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN order to prevent theſe Complaints, remember to waſh your Neck, and behind your Ears, every Morning, in cold Water; nor muffle up your ſelf too warm, either Night or Day.</p>
            <p>NEXT follows a CONSUMPTION,<note place="margin">Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> a Diſtemper flow and ſure, that is lately grown very common amongſt us. Here Young People are more in Danger than their Elders, becauſe more liable to Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. It is uſher'd in by a Cough of long Continuance, which by Degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames and ulcerates the Lungs, brings on a Hectick Fever, with a Spitting of bloody and corrupted Matter, and is generally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a Hoarſeneſs, and Night-Sweats. In the mean Time, the Patient will waſte in Strength, and in Fleſh, while
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003843_0007_1002635C90697638"/>
perhaps he may eat rather more than he uſed to do when he was well.</p>
            <p>AFTER the Ulcer comes to be formed in the Lungs, it will be difficult for inward Remedies to reach it. They may before that, perhaps, cool the Inflammation, as well as ſweeten and diminiſh the ſharp De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, ſo as to prevent an Ulcer, but can rarely heal it. So likewiſe, <hi>Bliſters</hi> and <hi>Iſſues</hi> may revulſe the Humour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Miſchief, if ſeaſonably made uſe of.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, all the Good we can hope for, in this melancholly Caſe, muſt be done while the Conſumption is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended only, and not actually begun. I would then recommend <hi>Bleeding</hi> 2 or 3 Ounces every third Day, with a conſtant Riding about on Horſeback, and Change of Air. This will help Nature to throw off the Evil that threatens her, by calming the Blood, opening the Pores, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting inſenſible Perſpiration. It may alſo enable her to make a vigorous Effort, by Means of a ſeaſonable Boil, or Impoſthume, on the outward Parts of the Body. For that Intention, I would alſo adviſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, to <hi>ſhave</hi> under the Arms, and apply
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003843_0008_10020429B6DBE260"/>
               <hi>Poultiſes,</hi> in order to draw the Miſchief, if poſſible, that Way. And for inward Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, let him only chew <hi>Saſſafras Root</hi> every Morning faſting. I would likewiſe intreat him, before he goes to Bed, to take 3 <hi>Pills,</hi> made of <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Deers Dung,</hi> in equal Quantities: And, beſides theſe, let him once a Week take a <hi>Purge</hi> of <hi>Mallows,</hi> and <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Peach Bloſſoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET his <hi>Diet</hi> be without Meat, and mixt with abundance of <hi>Turnips, roaſted Apples, Raiſins,</hi> and <hi>Liquorice;</hi> and let his Drink be, Beer brew'd with <hi>Ground-Ivy;</hi> avoiding ſtrong Liquors of every Sort, as he would Poiſon.</p>
            <p>THE Way to prevent this waſting Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, is never to ſuffer a Cough to dwell upon you; but <hi>bleed</hi> in Time, and <hi>purge</hi> gently once a Week. In the mean while, eat not one Morſel of Meat, nor drink any Thing ſtronger than a little ſound <hi>Cider:</hi> And, to make the Game ſure, ride every fair Day, and breath as much as poſſible in the open Air.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER miſchievous Diſtemper,<note place="margin">Bloody-Flux.</note> is the BLOODY-FLUX; the Signs of which are, a ſmall Fever, and grievous Griping.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003843_0008_10020429B6DBE260"/>
The Patient will alſo void ſlimy Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſtreak'd with Blood; and at the ſame Time, be cruelly tormented in his Bowels.</p>
            <p>UPON the firſt Appearance of theſe Symptoms, part with 8 Ounces of <hi>Blood.</hi> The next Day take 80 Grains of <hi>Indian Phyſick,</hi> by Way of <hi>Vomit,</hi> and work it well with 2 Quarts of warm Water. The third Day, take 70 Grains of the ſame <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Phyſick,</hi> in hot Broth, made pretty ſalt; and then 'twill go off by Way of Stool, and ſtrengthen the Bowels.</p>
            <p>IN the mean Time, let the Food he takes, be either <hi>poach'd Eggs, Mutton,</hi> or <hi>Chicken-Broth,</hi> and his conſtant Drink, a <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>calcin'd Deers Horn,</hi> with a <hi>Plantain Leaf</hi> boil'd in it.</p>
            <p>TO prevent this Diſeaſe, avoid ſleeping on the cold Ground, and wading in the cold Water: Never eat immoderately of any Sort of Fruit, nor venture to drink new or foul Cider, by any Means.</p>
            <p>AND becauſe ſome People, by fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Diſtemper catching, are fearful of going near thoſe unhappy Perſons that have it, by which they often want the Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003843_0009_1002635756B5D3D8"/>
that is neceſſary; I may venture to aſſure them, their Apprehenſions are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and the Reaſon this Diſeaſe goes ſometimes round a Family, is, becauſe they live on the ſame Diet, and breath in the ſame Air; and then no Wonder if they fall into the ſame Diſorders, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any Manner of Infection.</p>
            <p>THERE is alſo a Kind of WHITE-FLUX,<note place="margin">White-Flux.</note> that will hurry a ſtrong Man out of his Life in a ſhort Time. In this Caſe, the Stools are frequent, without Gripes, or Blood, but flowing from the Patient like Water, and having a ſmall Fever attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>LOSE no Time in this haſty Diſeaſe, but <hi>vomit</hi> with <hi>Indian Phyſick,</hi> and <hi>purge</hi> the next Day with the ſame. In the mean while, you will do well to wear ſome Skin girt tight on your Stomach and Belly, with the Furr next you, or elſe a Piece of ſoft Flannel.</p>
            <p>LET your Food be <hi>Haſty-Pudding, Panada,</hi> or <hi>Broth thickened with Flower,</hi> and grate <hi>Nutmeg</hi> into every Thing you eat; and let your Drink be, a <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Deers Horn,</hi> made with a Leaf of <hi>Plaintain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:003843_0009_1002635756B5D3D8"/>
IN order to prevent this Diſorder, avoid Walking and Riding in the Night Air, guz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling huge Draughts of cold Water, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring unreaſonable Quantities of Fruit, eſpecially of that which is not ripe.</p>
            <p>A COMMON LOOSENESS needs no Deſcription;<note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſeneſs.</note> and may be eaſily ſtop'd in the Beginning; tho' ſome People husband it ſo well, as to keep it running for many Years: So that all the Humours of the Body taking that Turn, make it difficult to cure.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, to check this Ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Time, you muſt <hi>vomit</hi> with <hi>Indian Phyſick;</hi> then live three or four Days upon <hi>new Milk, boil'd thick with Flower,</hi> or <hi>Tuckaho,</hi> and drink the abovementioned <hi>Deers Horn Decoction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEN, to prevent it, eat not intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately; nor drink windy, or ſoul Liquors, or too much cold Water.</p>
            <p>BUT in Caſe of an ordinary GRIPING in the Belly, or WIND in the Stomach, drink a Gallon of <hi>warm Whey,</hi> and if that cannot be had, a Gallon of <hi>warm Water,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:003843_0010_1002634260DB5C98"/>
as faſt as you can well ſwallow it: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>purge</hi> with <hi>Mallows,</hi> and <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Peach Bloſſoms,</hi> once or twice.</p>
            <p>FOR a few Days, content your ſelf with a moderate and eaſy <hi>Diet;</hi> and let your Drink be <hi>Bawm Tea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT may be prevented, by keeping your Back-door open, abſtaining from windy Meats, and fermented Drinks, and being always careful not to overload your Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
            <p>THE COLICK is lately grown a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common Diſtemper,<note place="margin">Colick.</note> and begins, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, with a grievous Pain in the Bowels; and, by being neglected, fixes at length in the Pit of the Stomach, where it ſeems to bore like an Augre: The Patient frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vomits every Thing he ſwallows, and can hardly go to Stool, even with the Help of purging Medicines.</p>
            <p>PEOPLE thus afflicted, are apt to fly to Drams for Relief; but with lamentable Succeſs. Theſe may eaſe a Fit ſometimes; but are ſure to add Fuel to the Fire, and make the Diſeaſe return with more Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Beſides, theſe Cordials have another
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003843_0010_1002634260DB5C98"/>
bad Conſequence; they are apt to make People, ſoberly enough inclcin'd, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, grow too fond of their Phyſick. To cure all which bad Effects at once, I would recommend this certain and eaſy Remedy: Let him leave off all ſtrong, windy, and fermented Liquors, and drink nothing but <hi>Water,</hi> enrich'd with a very brown Toaſt.</p>
            <p>BUT if this Remedy ſhould be eſteem'd worſe than the Diſeaſe, I would, however, for the eaſing a particular Fit, recommend 2 or 3 Quarts of <hi>warm Water.</hi> And to force a Paſſage, you muſt take 2 or 3 Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of <hi>Bears Oyl,</hi> which will ſeldom fail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe drink a Quarter of a Pint of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction</hi> of <hi>Peach Leaves,</hi> with 2 Spoonfuls of <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Peach Bloſſoms:</hi> And this <hi>Purge</hi> you ought to repeat 2 or 3 Times, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry off all Remains. But if you would root out the Diſtemper for ever, take the ſame Medicines every full Moon; and drink every Morning, for ſome Time, <hi>Saſſafras Tea;</hi> and at Night, take as much <hi>Snakeroot Powder</hi> as will lie upon a Sixpence, in <hi>Mint-Water,</hi> or <hi>Decoction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Food proper in this Diſtemper, is, <hi>Chicken,</hi> or <hi>Mutton Broth;</hi> and the Drink, <hi>Bawm Tea,</hi> ſweeten'd with <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Mallows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:003843_0011_10026353D0B7D4B8"/>
AND, to prevent it, eat ſpearingly, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing every Thing that is ſalt, and windy; and never drink Spirits, one Drop of Green Tea, or brew'd Liquor of any Kind.</p>
            <p>THE DRY GRIPES are now (bleſſed be God,<note place="margin">Dry Gripes.</note>) grown much rarer than formerly. This is the cruelleſt Kind of <hi>Colick,</hi> called in <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Colick</hi> of <hi>Poitiers;</hi> though here it might be called the <hi>Caribbee Colick,</hi> becauſe very common in thoſe Iſlands: And I wiſh we may not have deriv'd it from thence, by too liberal a Uſe of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
            <p>IT makes it ſelf known by a moſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Pain in the Pit of the Stomach, and the adjacent Parts. The Guts feel as if they were twiſted, and all Motion down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is interrupted: By this Misfortune, the unhappy Patient is inclin'd to vomit up every Thing; inſomuch, that ſometimes his very Excrements are caſt out at his Mouth. In the firſt Place, a Thoroughfare muſt by all Means be attempted, by 3 Spoonfuls of <hi>Bears Oyl,</hi> or by the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Peach Leaves,</hi> above mentioned. If theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies ſhould fail, you muſt ſubmit to a <hi>Tobacco Gliſter,</hi> perform'd by blowing the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003843_0011_10026353D0B7D4B8"/>
Smoak through a Pipe into the Fundament. And if the firſt Operation ſhould happen to fail, it muſt be repeated. At the ſame Time, make a ſtrong Infuſion of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and therewith anoint the lower Region of the Belly.</p>
            <p>AFTER the Paſſage is perfectly clear'd, your <hi>Diet,</hi> for ſome Days, ought to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mutton,</hi> or <hi>Chicken Broth,</hi> in which <hi>Mallows</hi> have been boil'd; and your Drink, <hi>Pawm Tea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOME have unadviſedly, in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, ventur'd alſo to drink Rum, and other Spirits, to eaſe their Pains; but this has coſt them dear, by taking away the Uſe of their Hands; and other <hi>Paralytick</hi> Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; to cure which, the ſame Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies muſt be uſed, as are preſcrib'd hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the PALSEY.</p>
            <p>THE beſt Way to prevent the DRY-GRIPES, is, to get rid of <hi>Agues,</hi> and <hi>Colicks,</hi> as ſoon as you can; to eat ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Fruit, and forbear all foul and windy Liquors; nor meddle with Rum, or other Spirit, after it has been poiſoned with foul Sugar, and Lime-juice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:003843_0012_1002633B9D9F1588"/>
A PALSEY comes ſuddenly upon us, with dreadful Symptoms,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Palſey.</hi>
               </note> not eaſy to be miſtaken. We are bereft of Senſe, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either in one, or more Parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; or at leaſt, we find them numb'd and diſabled: And where the Diſeaſe is extreme, one Side is taken quite motionleſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible.</p>
            <p>AT the firſt Appearance of theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Tokens, <hi>purge</hi> with <hi>Indian Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> every other Day, for 3 Times. The Mornings you don't <hi>purge,</hi> cauſe your ſelf to be plung'd over Head and Ears into cold Water; and this ſhould be repeated thrice every Week, for 3 Months together. You are alſo to mix equal Quantities of <hi>Spirit of Scurvy-graſs,</hi> and <hi>Hungary Water,</hi> and dipping a ſtiff Comb-bruſh therein, cauſe your Head, being cloſe ſhav'd, to be well bruſh'd with it ſeveral Times a Day: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let the Palms of your Hands, the Soles of your Feet, and Nape of your Neck, be often rubb'd with the ſame Mixture. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this has put ſome Senſe and Motion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Limbs, beat <hi>Roſemary</hi> in a Mortar, and make a little Ball of it, which you muſt roll and work about in your Hands conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, renewing the ſame every Day: Now
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003843_0012_1002633B9D9F1588"/>
and then too, put Tobacco up your Noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trils, letting it lie there for ſome Time, in order to derive the clammy Plegm from your Brain. Theſe eaſy Remedies will, by the Grace of GOD, do great good in the Beginning of this Diſeaſe, by reſtoring the Nerves to their natural Tone, and giving new Vigour to the Animal Spirits, which have been clogg'd and obſtructed.</p>
            <p>THE Patient's Food ſhould be dry, and of eaſy Digeſtion, with <hi>Muſtard</hi> and <hi>Horſe-Radiſh</hi> mixt with it; and let <hi>Sage,</hi> or <hi>Bawm Tea,</hi> be his conſtant Drink.</p>
            <p>TO prevent this Diſtemper, feed ſeldom on ſalt, or high ſeaſon'd Diſhes; nor eat much Milk, or other flegmatick Food: Never ſleep in the dangerous Dew, or on the moiſt Ground, or continue long in a Cellar, or other damp Situation. Uſe much Exerciſe, and let your Motion be always nimble, in order to quicken the Circulation, and frisk your ſluggiſh Spirits.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Diſeaſe of the Head,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epilepſy.</hi>
               </note> is, an EPILEPSY, or FALLING SICK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS, not unuſual in this Country. It diſcovers it ſelf by very terrible Symptoms: The unhappy Perſon falls down ſuddenly,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003843_0013_1002636349FD6750"/>
depriv'd of all Senſe and Underſtanding. No ſooner is he fallen, but he's immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaken with ſtrong Convulſions, grinds his Teeth, rolls his Eye-balls, and foams at the Mouth in a moſt frightful Manner. So ſoon as the Fit is over, his Senſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but commonly a Pain in the Head, and great Depreſſion of the Spirits, remain upon him for ſome Time after. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of theſe melancholly Fits is uncertain, tho', for the moſt Part, they come near the Full, or change of the Moon.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt Place, Care ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to calm the Spirits of the Patient, and keep them from running Riot in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Manner. For that Intention, <hi>bleed</hi> him, and then burn Feathers often under his Noſe, or elſe Leather, or the Hoofs of any Animal.</p>
            <p>FOUR Days before the Full Moon, let him take a <hi>Vomit</hi> of <hi>Indian Phyſick;</hi> and 4 Days after the Full Moon, let him take a <hi>Purge</hi> of the ſame; and be ſure to do the like again, before and after the Change: And this muſt be repeated for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Months together. On the Mornings when he takes no Phyſick, he muſt ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as much <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Miſleto,</hi> as will

            </p>

            <p>LET the Patient's Head be ſhaved, and a Plaiſter made of the Juice of <hi>Rue, Sage,</hi> and <hi>Pennyroyal,</hi> worn on the back Part of it.</p>
            <p>LET him often put <hi>Tobacco</hi> up one of his Noſtrils, keeping it there as long as it has any Strength, to clear the Head of cold and clammy Phlegm. And let him now and then, beſides, chew a Stick of <hi>Miſleto, </hi> and ſwallow the Juice.</p>
            <p>THESE Directions muſt be purſu'd Seven Months, or more, to cure any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon intirely of this Diſtemper; and, if it be taken in Time, there will be great Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Succeſs, at leaſt in young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

            <p>WOULD you prevent this boiſtrous Illneſs, forbear all Kind of Surfeiting and Exceſs, never expoſing your ſelf to be wet to the Skin, if poſſible.</p>
            <p>I MUST not omit a FEVER AND AGUE,<note place="margin">Fever and Ague.</note> which is an Epidemick Diſtemper in this moiſt and variable Climate. 'Tis true, it ſeldom kills now a Days; but if neglected too long, corrupts all the Juices of the Body, and ends either in a <hi>Jaundice, Dropſy, Dry Grypes,</hi> or <hi>Cachexy:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conjure all my good Patients, as they tender their Health, and their Looks, to diſpoſſeſs this <hi>Devil</hi> as ſoon as they can.</p>
            <p>AN AGUE returns either every Day,<note place="margin">Ague.</note> every third, or every fourth Day; and the Way to know which of theſe any Perſon hath, is, only to abide 2 Fits.

Phyſick,</hi> and 2 Days after that, repeat the ſame again. This muſt be followed, by taking, every Morning and Evening, 20 Grains of the <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Saſſafras-root,</hi> mixt with 10 Grains of <hi>Snake-root,</hi> in 2 Spoonfuls of the <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Wormwood.</hi>

However, take the <hi>Powders</hi> after this Operation for ſome Time, that you may make ſure Work of it.</p>

IT would be difficult to preſcribe Rules to prevent a Diſtemper, to which our Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is ſo unhappily ſubject: However, Prudence may be uſeful, even in this Caſe. Ride therefore a great deal in the hot Months, to ſweat out all ill digeſted Humours; and don't chill your Bowels too much with cold Water. Avoid, as much as may be, being abroad in the Rain, or in the Dews of the Night. Be cautious too, of ſleeping on the Ground, or with your Windows, or Doors open, to let the Wind blow upon you.</p>
            <p>IN Caſe of a CONTINUAL FEVER,<note place="margin">Continual Fever.</note> 
               <hi>bleed</hi> immediately 10 Ounces. The Day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>vomit</hi> with <hi>Indian Phyſick;</hi> and the Morning after, <hi>purge</hi> with the ſame. And if you ſhould be light headed, be convuls'd, or incline too much to Sleep, lay a large <hi>Bliſter</hi> to the Neck, and to the fleſhy Parts of each Arm; and take a <hi>Gliſter</hi> every Night, of <hi>Mallows,</hi> and <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Peach Bloſſoms,</hi> to abate the Heat of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>IT matters not how little People eat in one of theſe <hi>Fevers,</hi> becauſe the Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for Digeſtion, are employ'd in ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003843_0016_1002634BE7D66CE0"/>
with the Diſeaſe: But what little Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance they do take, ſhould be moiſt, and cooling; and their Drink, a <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Cinquefoil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO prevent this furious Malady, avoid all Exceſſes of ſtrong Drink, eſpecially of Spirits, which inflame the Blood, at the ſame Time that they vitiate the Ferment of the Stomach; upon which all Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently all Health, depends.</p>
            <p>BUT there is a SLOW FEVER,<note place="margin">Slow Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to manage than all the reſt, which is the true SCORBUTICK FEVER. The Signs of it are, a low, but quick Pulſe, a conſtant Thirſt, a Falling away of the Fleſh, and a ſallow Complexion. There will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too, a hard Swelling on one Side of the Belly, that ſeems to move about.</p>
            <p>AS this lurking Diſorder comes by a long Courſe of ill Management, ſo it will need ſome Time to root it out. For that End, take a <hi>Vomit</hi> of <hi>Indian Phyſick,</hi> and the next Morning, a <hi>Purge</hi> of the ſame; which <hi>Purge</hi> ought to be repeated once a Week, for 6 Times at leaſt. The Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings you don't take <hi>Phyſick,</hi> drink conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Quarter of a Pint of <hi>Saſſafras Tea,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:003843_0016_1002634BE7D66CE0"/>
faſting; and every Night, as much <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of <hi>Snakeroot</hi> as will lie upon a Shilling, in 3 Spoonfuls of <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Dittany.</hi> And if you ſhould be coſtive, take a <hi>Gliſter</hi> every other Day, of <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Mallows,</hi> with <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Peach Bloſſoms.</hi> This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, faithfully purſued, for 2 Months, with moderate Riding, and a proper <hi>Diet,</hi> will go near to finiſh the Cure.</p>
            <p>IN the mean Time, eat no Milk, nor any Thing salt, or hard of Digeſtion: But let your Sauce be <hi>Muſtard, Garden Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and <hi>Horſe-radiſh</hi> in abundance; and your beſt Drink will be, found <hi>Cider,</hi> with a hot Iron quench'd in it, or Beer brew'd with <hi>Sorrel Tree Leaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEN, to prevent this Illneſs, you muſt indulge no ſloathful Inclination; but ſtir about your Buſineſs briskly, and ride as often as you can: Never drink more than a Pint of Water, or other Drink, in 24 Hours. Breath as much as poſſible in the open Air, in the Day Time, and avoid it in the Night.</p>
            <p>THERE is beſides,<note place="margin">Worm-Fever.</note> another Kind of FEVER, hard to be diſtinguiſh'd, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally among children; and that is a WORM-FEVER.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003843_0017_10026336383A2A40"/>
There will be a quick Pulſe, and often a Pain in the Side, in the Stomach, or Bowels, and all occaſioned by Worms. Now and then too, there will be the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the <hi>Flux,</hi> and even Convulſions; ſo that, like the Devil, it appears in all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Shapes. The only Way I know, of diſcerning it, is, by a ſwell'd Belly, a taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Breath, or a greedy Appetite, beyond what is uſual in other feveriſh Diſorders.</p>
            <p>GIVE a <hi>Vomit</hi> of <hi>Indian Phyſick</hi> one Day, and a <hi>Purge</hi> of the ſame the next. Beat the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem Oak,</hi> and take a Spoonful of it, mixt with the <hi>Juice</hi> of <hi>Rue,</hi> or <hi>Wormwood,</hi> for 3 Mornings. From the Beginning, ſoak a cur'd <hi>Leaf</hi> of <hi>Tobacco</hi> in <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and apply it warm to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or Belly; and it will make the Worms much ſicker than it doth the Patient.</p>
            <p>LET his Food be ſeaſon'd with a great deal of Salt; and his Drink, Beer brew'd pretty bitter, with <hi>Wormwood</hi> inſtead of <hi>Hops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is difficult to hinder Worms from hatching, and harbouring in our Bodies, becauſe we ſwallow their Eggs almoſt with every Thing we eat; eſpecially ſuch as live
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003843_0017_10026336383A2A40"/>
much upon <hi>Pulſe,</hi> and <hi>Indian Corn,</hi> will be full of them. So that I may venture to ſay, Three Fourths of the Children that die in theſe Parts of the World, die of <hi>Worms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE beſt Way to prevent them, is, to make uſe of a great deal of <hi>Pepper</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> with your daily Food, and as little <hi>Vinegar</hi> as poſſible, which is full of ſmall <hi>Inſects,</hi> not to be ſeen without a Glaſs.</p>
            <p>I TOOK Notice,<note place="margin">Cachexy.</note> that a CACHEXY was one of the Conſequences of letting a <hi>Fever</hi> and <hi>Ague</hi> continue too long; tho' the ſame is produced likewiſe by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome <hi>Diet,</hi> by a ſloathful Habit, and drinking abundance of cold Water. The Signs of it are, a ſlow Fever, of the <hi>Hectick</hi> Kind, a continual Thirſt, a Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Breath, and very cadaverous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
            <p>FOR the Cure of this lazy Diſtemper, you muſt proceed in the ſame Method as is directed in the Caſe of <hi>ſlow Fevers:</hi> Only I would adviſe the Patient, over and above, to take every Day, at 10 in the Morning, and 4 in the Afternoon, a Dram of <hi>Rum,</hi> wherein the <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Tops</hi> of <hi>Centory</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:003843_0018_1002635119EB25A8"/>
have been infus'd; and, during the whole Courſe of the Cure, the Patient muſt by all Means, ſhake off his lazy Diſpoſition, riſe early in a Morning, and ſtir about as brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as his Strength and Breath will permit.</p>
            <p>HIS Food ſhould be freſh, and eaſy of Digeſtion; and his Drink. Beer brew'd with <hi>Wormwood,</hi> and the <hi>Leaves</hi> of the <hi>Sorrel Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO prevent falling into it, never ſuffer <hi>Agues,</hi> or <hi>ſlow Fevers,</hi> to taint your Blood; be nimble in your Motion, and drench not your ſelf with cold Water, between Meals.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER bad Effect of keeping an <hi>Ague</hi> too long,<note place="margin">Yellow-Jaundice.</note> is, the YELLOW JAUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICE. This diſcovers it ſelf by the yellow Hue of the Face, and other Parts of the Body: Nay, the Whites of the Eyes, and Urine, will be alſo ting'd with it.</p>
            <p>FOR this Illneſs, take a <hi>Purge</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Phyſick,</hi> and repeat it the third Day again. After that, drink every Morning, and Evening, for 6 Weeks, a Quarter of a Pint of <hi>Decoction</hi> of the <hi>inner Bark</hi> of <hi>Elder,</hi> and the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Saſſafras,</hi> in Equal Quantities. In the mean Time,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003843_0018_1002635119EB25A8"/>
force your ſelf to ſtir about, and ride on Horſeback every fair Day.</p>
            <p>LET all your Victuals be light, and temperate; and your Drink, Beer brew'd with <hi>Sorrel Leaves, Pine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ops, Root</hi> of <hi>Aſh,</hi> and a little <hi>old Iron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO ward off this ungracious Diſeaſe, cure your <hi>Agues</hi> in the Beginning, lingring <hi>Fevers</hi> as ſoon as poſſible, and uſe Agility in your Motion.</p>
            <p>BUT the moſt fatal Conſequence of keeping an <hi>Ague,</hi> or <hi>Jaundice</hi> too long, is, a DROPSY. This dire Calamity befals an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient People ſometimes, by Means of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Decay; and ſometimes, thoſe that are young, when they have made too bold with their Conſtitution. 'Tis alſo apt to follow too great a Loſs of Blood, or too long a Familiarity with Opiats.</p>
            <p>A DROPSY firſt ſhews it ſelf,<note place="margin">Dropſy.</note> by the Swelling of the Legs about the Ancles, in ſuch a Manner as to retain the Impreſſion of your Finger. The Swelling appears moſt at Night, and is uſually attended with a Shortneſs and Difficulty of Breath, ever moſt troubleſome when the Patient lies down.</p>
            <p>

HE muſt therefore reſolve upon proper Remedies, before the Waters riſe high enough to drown him: And, if he have but the Gift of Self-denyal, he may, by God's Help, get the better of this mortal Enemy; provided there be no univerſal Decay, no Depravation of the Liver, or other Organs, neceſſary for Blood-making.</p>
            <p>NOW I can't recommend the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for this Diſeaſe better, than by giving Three remarkable Inſtances, of Perſons of an advanc'd Age, who have been perfectly cur'd by them.</p>
            <p>THE Firſt was, Sir <hi>Thomas Millington,</hi> an eminent Phyſician, who fell into a <hi>Dropſy,</hi> at near 70 Years of Age. After draining the Water, by 2 or 3 ſmart <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> he perform'd the reſt of the Cure by a reſolute Self-denyal. He eat nothing but what was light, and nouriſhing; and for his Drink, confin'd himſelf rigorouſly to a Quarter of a Pint of <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wine in 24 Hours: (And hard <hi>Cider</hi> would have done the Buſineſs as well.) The firſt Week, his Thirſt was hardly to be endured; but after that, grew more tolerable. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined this Courſe for 2 Months, and recover'd compleatly.</p>

            <p>THE Laſt Inſtance, is an <hi>Ancient Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> who truſted to the Remedies of our own Country, with the like happy Effect.

            <p>OF theſe ſeveral Remedies, you may pleaſe to take your choice: Or, inſtead of <hi>Saſſafras,</hi> you may hold the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary of Spain</hi> in your Mouth, which will ſalivate ſtill more powerfully.</p>

THE reſt of the Cure muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated with reſtorative Meats, and a very ſhort Allowance of Drink. For your <hi>Diet,</hi> I would recommend <hi>Poach'd Eggs, Thin Hominy, Hoggs Feet, Cow Heel,</hi> and <hi>Jel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Broth:</hi> all which will renew, and enrich the Blood, without provoking too much Thirſt: And for Drink, uſe none, but <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel Beer,</hi> or ſound <hi>Cider,</hi> wherein a <hi>hot Iron</hi> has been quench'd ſeveral Times.</p>
            <p>TO guard your ſelf againſt this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſtemper, be cautious of ſcorching your Liver, with Spirits, or Exceſs of other ſtrong Drink. In Caſe you be troubled with <hi>Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſtop it as ſoon as you can.

In one Word, ſhe has no Reliſh for any thing, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually out of Humour, ſhe knows not why, and out of Order, ſhe knows not where.</p>
            <p>THIS is certainly a miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how much ſoever it may be ridicul'd, as whimſical and imaginary; and 'tis the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003843_0022_1002042EACE174C8"/>
more ſo, becauſe the Weakneſs of the Nerves makes the Cure exceeding difficult.</p>
            <p>BECAUSE the <hi>Stomach</hi> is ſuſpected to be much in Fault, I wou'd have That cleans'd in the firſt Place, with a <hi>Vomit</hi> of <hi>Indian Phyſick:</hi> The next Day, purify the <hi>Bowels,</hi> by a <hi>Purge</hi> of the ſame; which muſt be repeated 2 Days after. The reſt of the <hi>Cure</hi> muſt be perform'd by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Obſervation of the following <hi>Rules.</hi> Endeavour to preſerve a cheerful Spirit, putting the beſt Conſtruction upon every body's Words, and Behaviour: Plunge, 3 Mornings every Week, into cold Water, over Head and Ears; or if you have no Convenience for that, it will have the ſame Effect, if you ſuffer your ſelf to be whip'd with ſmart little Rods. It can't be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd how this will brace the Nerves, and rouze the ſluggiſh Spirits, (as ſome grave Gentlemen find, when they try it for a merrier Purpoſe.) Obſerve a ſtrict Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and Temperance in your <hi>Diet;</hi> and ride, every fair Day, ſmall Journeys, on Horſeback. Stir nimbly about your Affairs, quick Motion being as neceſſary for Health of Body, as for Diſpatch of Buſineſs. In the mean while, I abſolutely forbid all ſorts of <hi>Drams,</hi> which will raiſe the Spirits

only to ſink them lower; nor do I allow her one Pinch of <hi>Snuff,</hi> or one Drop of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hea-Tea,</hi> tho' it were to ſave her Longing.</p>
            <p>HER <hi>Food</hi> muſt be freſh; and eaſy of Digeſtion, neither ſalt, nor windy; nor may ſhe eat one Morſel of <hi>Beef,</hi> which affords a groſs Nouriſhment, and inclines People, too much, to hang themſelves. And for her <hi>Drink,</hi> ſhe muſt forbear <hi>Beer,</hi> with all windy and fermented Liquors; and ſtick to <hi>Bawm-Tea</hi> intirely.</p>
            <p>TO eſcape this Diſorder, ſhe muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer none of the idle Diſturbances, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments of an empty World, to prey upon her Mind, or ruffle her ſweet Temper. Let her uſe juſt Exerciſe enough to give a gentle Spring to her Spirits, without Waſting them; and let her be cheerful, in Spite of a churliſh Husband, or cloudy Weather.</p>

HEAVEN be prais'd,<note place="margin">Stone in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> there is little Occaſion to ſay any thing of the STONE IN THE BLADDER, there being few Inſtances of it in this Colony.

            <p>THE Symptoms of the BLIND PILES,<note place="margin">Blind Piles.</note> are, little painful Swellings, appearing juſt without the Fundament. They are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the ſlowing of corrupted Blood

A RUPTURE is a common Misfortune,<note place="margin">Rupture.</note> eſpecially among <hi>Children.</hi> The Tokens of it are, a painful Swelling and Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Codds, occaſion'd by a Fall, or other Violence, that forces down the Guts into that Part, and is moſt painful when the Accident firſt happens.</p>
            <p>FOR this, let the Patient immediately have a <hi>Truſs</hi> made, that may hold the Part ſuſpended. Then apply freſh <hi>Cow-Dung,</hi> which muſt be renewed Night and Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till the Pains are aſſwaged. After that, put on another <hi>Poultis,</hi> made of the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Swamp-Lillies,</hi> and <hi>Sumack Berries,</hi> boil'd, and beat well together; which muſt alſo be refreſh'd twice a Day, till the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling diſappears. From the Beginning, let him gird a Belt tight about his Loins, and wear it continually, 'til the Bowels are drawn up to their natural Situation.</p>
            <p>Let his <hi>Diet</hi> be cooling, and eaſy of Digeſtion; and his conſtant <hi>Drink,</hi> a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction</hi> of <hi>Garden-Creſſes,</hi> ſweeten'd with <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Quinces.</hi>

            <p>THE YAWS,<note place="margin">Yaws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> or COUNTRY DISTEMPER, is very hard to cure perfectly, eſpecially when grown inveterate. This is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Kind of <hi>Scurvey;</hi> and the Symptoms of it are, eating Ulcers in the Throat, or Palate, and filthy Sores in other Parts of the Body, having near Reſemblance to thoſe of the <hi>Pox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS unclean Diſeaſe often yields to Dr. <hi>Papa'</hi>s Remedy; or, at leaſt, may be kept under by it.</p>
            <p>TAKE. 1 Ounce of the Bark of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac Root,</hi> 1 Ounce of the <hi>inner Bark</hi> of <hi>Pine,</hi> and 2 Ounces of the <hi>inner Bark</hi> of <hi>Spaniſh Oak;</hi> boil theſe together in 2 Quarts of <hi>Water,</hi> 'til the <hi>Decoction</hi> be very ſtrong. Of this Liquor drink a full Pint, Milk-warm, and immediately after it, Half a Pint, quite cold; and it will give you a powerful <hi>Vomit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE next Morning, take Half a Pint of the ſame <hi>Drink</hi> warm, and the ſame Quantity again in the Evening; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo doing, for 6 Weeks, or 2 Months;
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:003843_0026_1002633E18F5EC50"/>
only the <hi>Vomit</hi> muſt be repeated every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day. In the mean Time, <hi>gargle</hi> your Throat, and waſh all your Sores, and Ulcers with the ſame warm <hi>Liquor,</hi> which ought to be made freſh every 2 Days. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, you muſt chew the <hi>Sumac Root</hi> very often, and ſwallow the healing <hi>Juice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVERY Night, before you go to Reſt, take 2 <hi>Pills,</hi> made of <hi>Turpentine, and Deers Dung,</hi> in equal Quantities.</p>
            <p>THE Pox may be cured exactly in the ſame Manner:<note place="margin">Pox.</note> And, becauſe the Symptoms are much the ſame, it is very probable, the one was a Graft of the other. The pious <hi>Spaniards</hi> catch'd it from their <hi>Negro</hi> Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of propagating it from thence to all the reſt of the World.</p>
            <p>IN both Caſes, confine your ſelf alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from eating Fleſh, from ſtrong Drink, and be very careful of catching Cold.</p>
            <p>TO avoid theſe Misfortunes, eat ſeldom of freſh Pork, which breeds very groſs Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; live not too near a Swamp; nor ever venture upon ſtrange Women, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon <hi>Ethiopians.</hi>

ANOTHER woful Caſe, is, a CAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CER, which ſome deſpairingly imagine to be incurable; tho', bleſſed be GOD, there have been ſome Inſtances of Succeſs, by the Method hereafter mentioned. In the mean Time, it uſually begins with little hard Lumps, or Swellings, in the Breaſt, Lip, or other glandulous Part of the Body.

            <p>IN this Caſe, the Patient muſt ſubmit, in the firſt Place, to have the hard Lump cut clean out, ſo ſoon as he is convinc'd it is a <hi>Cancer.</hi> And, for curing the Wound, he can't do better than make Uſe of the following <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

LET him drink <hi>Saſſafras Tea</hi> every Morning, live temperately, upon light and innocent Food; and abſtain intirely from ſtrong Liquor.</p>
            <p>THE Way to prevent this Calamity, is, to be very ſparing in eating Pork, to forbear all ſalt, and high ſeaſon'd Meats, and live chiefly upon the Garden, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and the Hen-houſe.</p>
            <p>I SHALL cloſe this black Liſt of Diſeaſes with the GOUY,<note place="margin">Gouy.</note> which I obſerve with Pleaſure, to be grown leſs frequent in the Country, than in the Time of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It makes it ſelf known with a Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, by a painful Inflammation in ſome of the Joints; eſpecially of the Hands and Feet.</p>
            <p>IT would be great Preſumption, after ſo many vain Attempts, for me to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any other Remedy for this obſtinate Diſtemper, than a ſtrict and ſevere Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, both in Eating, and Drinking. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I am not ſo hard-hearted, as to deny my Patient any Kind of freſh and plain Food, that agrees with his Stomach: All I intreat of him, is, to confine himſelf
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:003843_0028_10026344198C1D88"/>
religiouſly to a moderate Quantity. Nor can he do better, than to follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Cornaro,</hi> a noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> who tied himſelf down to 12 Ounces of Eata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, including Bread, and 14 Ounces of Drink, in the 24 Hours. He ſtuck cloſe to this ſhort Allowance, uſing moderate Exerciſe; and, from being a Cripple by the <hi>Gout,</hi> recovered his Health, and his Strength, to a Wonder: And having found ſo much Benefit by theſe Rules, purſued them ſtrictly to the End of a very long, and happy Life.</p>
            <p>NOR are theſe Weights ſo ſcanty as they may ſeem to be, to ſome keen Stomachs; but, upon a fair Trial, they will be ſound ſufficient, to give Strength to the Body, Chearfulneſs to the Heart, and Vigour to all the Faculties of the Soul. And, beſides theſe happy Effects, they will do more: They will place you above the Influence of the Stars; and make you able to ſubdue your Paſ ſions, to the Empire of a cool, and unclouded Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>THE ſame Temperance that cures this Diſtemper, will certainly not fail to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; make you live a great while, and very eaſy while you do live.</p>
            <p>

            <p>IN the mean Time, it may ſeem ſtrange, that, among the Remedies I have preſcrib'd, no Mention is made of <hi>Mercury, Opium,</hi> or the <hi>Peruvian Bark,</hi> which have almoſt obtain'd the Reputation of <hi>Specificks.</hi> I acknowledge the powerful Effects of theſe Medicines; but am perſwaded, they ought to be adminiſtred with the greateſt Skill, and Diſcernment.
