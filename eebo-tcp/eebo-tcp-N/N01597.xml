         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Folly</hi> of UNGOVERNED ANGER: which certainly is, <hi>To dy as a Fool dieth!</hi> 'Tis UNGOVERNED AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GER that has brought all this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. UNGOVERNED AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GER; How <hi>Fatal</hi> a <hi>Folly!</hi> And yet, how <hi>Frequent</hi> a <hi>Folly!</hi> This is that <hi>Error</hi> againſt which, in the Lamentable Circumſtances of this poor Man, <hi>Lo, GOD ſends forth his Voice, and it is a mighty Voice.</hi> Oh! Let it have a due Attention from us: Let all <hi>Iſrael Hear and Fear,</hi> and let that <hi>Fooliſh Paſſion</hi> be no more indulged among us.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould ſay, That the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of the leaſt Good Thing in the World, unto UNGOVERNED ANGER, is the <hi>Sacrifice of a Fool,</hi> I have read unto you a Text from whence the Aſſertion would be Juſtified.</p>

Such a <hi>Lodging</hi> that it is ready to make its Appearance upon the leaſt Occurrence that can be; Such a <hi>Lodging</hi> that it Abides, it Remains, it is not Eafily parted with.

We are to be Eaſy, when Abuſes are offered unto <hi>our ſelves.</hi> And this from a Principle of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Submiſſion</hi> unto GOD. At the ſame Time, when
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001898_0012_0FB9D3B1C32E50D8"/>Abuſes are offered unto our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous GOD, Now a Certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of <hi>Zeal</hi> ſhould-be raiſed in us. <hi>Now</hi> we ſhould be <hi>Zealous,</hi> be Troubled, be grieved. <hi>Now</hi> with an Holy <hi>Anger</hi> we ſhould let it be ſeen, <hi>Things are not, as we ſhould have them to be!</hi> A <hi>Meek</hi> Man ſhould ſay, <hi>In aliis Manſuetus ero; at in Injuriis contra Chriſtum non ita.</hi> No <hi>Injuries</hi> but what are offered unto GOD, ſhall make any Impreſſions on my <hi>Manſuetude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly. 'Tis praeſcribed, Eph. IV. 26. <hi>Be Angry, but do not Sin.</hi> The Rule for this would be, <hi>Be Angry at nothing but Sin.</hi> I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, That this may be fairly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as the <hi>Golden Rule</hi> of <hi>Meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> If you would not <hi>Sin</hi> in your <hi>Anger,</hi> let nothing but <hi>Sin</hi> be the Object of your <hi>Anger.</hi> If <hi>Anger</hi> begin to boil, Examine, <hi>Is there any Sin against GOD committed, in what I am going to be Angry at?</hi> If there be None, it will be <hi>Meekneſs of Wiſdom</hi> to throw away no <hi>Anger</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001898_0013_0FB9D3B508DED020"/>upon it. That ſo a <hi>Gracious Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> may adorn us;</p>
               <p>Firſt. We are to make our <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> and <hi>Reſignations,</hi> unto the Holy SPIRIT of GOD our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR; to obtain the Grace of <hi>Meekneſs</hi> from Him. It was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned of old, <hi>Seek ye the Lord, All ye Meek of the Earth.</hi> 'Tis now to be the Injunction laid upon us all, <hi>Seek ye the Lord, That ye may be made the Meek of the Earth</hi> Yea, <hi>Seek Meekneſs,</hi> is the Thing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly directed to. When <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is called for, there is that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection given for the obtaining of it; Jam. 1.5. <hi>If any of you lack Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, let him ask of GOD, and it ſhall be given him;</hi>—The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to ſteer clear of UNGOVERNED ANGER, with a <hi>Spirit of Meekneſs.</hi> My <hi>Angry</hi> Brother, Carry that <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Heart</hi> of thine unto the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly SPIRIT of GOD thy SAVIOUR, and plead, <hi>O my GOD, I have the Heart of a fierce Tyger in me, but thou canſt change my Heart, and make
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001898_0014_0FB9D3B7CAF71160"/>me as meek as a Lamb. I put my Heart into thy Hand; O do Thou take poſſeſſion of it, and keep down and put out thoſe Helliſh Fires, that are too Eaſily kindled there!</hi> When <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> imagined, that <hi>Job</hi> was too fretful, he told him, <hi>I doubt, Thou Restrainest Prayer.</hi> Certainly, If our <hi>Fretting</hi> don't kill our <hi>Praying,</hi> our <hi>Praying</hi> will do much to Cure our <hi>Fretting.</hi> We are bidden, to <hi>Liſt up Holy Hands without Wrath.</hi> Let us do it <hi>Againſt Wrath,</hi> and anon we ſhall not only <hi>Pray without Wrath,</hi> but alſo <hi>Live without</hi> it.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly. Having ſo <hi>ſought Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> let us now proceed unto the <hi>Exerciſes</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>You are aware; That <hi>Meekneſs</hi> does not propoſe to <hi>Deſtroy</hi> our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001898_0015_0FB9D3B94F55BC48"/>
                  <hi>Anger,</hi> but only to Govern it. It may ſometimes be not only <hi>Lawful,</hi> but alſo <hi>Needful,</hi> to be <hi>Angry.</hi> That moſt Conſummate <hi>Pattern</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>all Goodneſs,</hi> our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR Himſelf, when he had ſome Sinful People about Him, we read, Mar. III. 5. <hi>He looked round about on them with Anger. Goodneſs</hi> it ſelf may have <hi>Anger</hi> in it; <hi>Meekneſs</hi> it ſelf may be <hi>Angry.</hi> But then, Firſt; <hi>Meekneſs</hi> muſt <hi>Govern</hi> our <hi>Anger,</hi> as to the Reaſons of it. You muſt be <hi>well-adviſed</hi> by <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> of being, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry without a Cauſe;</hi> Leſt you be <hi>pleaſed</hi> no otherwiſe than,—you know how! Particularly; Be ſure, To be <hi>Angry</hi> at <hi>a Good Thing;</hi> This cannot be Good. When the words of GOD in <hi>Sound Doctrines,</hi> or in <hi>Just Reproofs</hi> are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, 'tis a Wicked Thing to be <hi>Angry</hi> at them. A Wickedneſs exemplified by the Hearers of our <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>; Act. VII. 54. <hi>When they heard theſe thing, they gnaſhed on
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001898_0016_0FB9D3C19BD993E0"/>him with their Teeth.</hi> Nor is it any Better to be <hi>Angry</hi> at the <hi>Works</hi> of GOD, either in our own <hi>Adverſity,</hi> or in the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of others, or ſuppoſe, the Accidents of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſappointing of us. <hi>Jonah</hi> has the leaves of his <hi>Alcherva</hi> failing him; And now, <hi>Doſt thou well to be Angry,</hi> Jonah? Huſh; Do not ſay, Thou Doſt! But then, I will go on with my Limitations, Take theſe Two; Be not <hi>Angry for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> and, Be not <hi>Angry for Every Thing.</hi> Both of theſe are Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances. Your <hi>Anger</hi> ſhould not be <hi>for Nothing.</hi> If you are <hi>Angry</hi> you ſhould be Able to give a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and a ſignificant Account, <hi>why you are ſo!</hi> Not fret and fume for you know not what your ſelves: Nor upon a meer miſtake, a meer Fancy, and ungrounded ſuſpicion; ſome wrong Information.

                  <hi>Anger</hi> be <hi>for Every Thing.</hi> What? For the Landing of every little Skiff, to ſet the Becons on Fire? By no means. To be <hi>Angry,</hi> for every Trifle: Upon the breaking of a Glaſs, the ſpilling of a <hi>Cup,</hi> every little Blunder of a <hi>Servant,</hi> ſome ſmall Diſreſpect ſhown to our <hi>Character,</hi> preſently an uprore to be made in our Souls! By no means. About your <hi>Anger</hi> take that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; Jam. I. 19. <hi>Let every Man be ſlow to ſpeak, ſlow to wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>Meekneſs</hi> muſt <hi>Govern</hi> our <hi>Anger</hi> as to the <hi>Seaſons</hi> of it. If you are <hi>Angry out of Time,</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, your Spirit is out of <hi>Tune.</hi> You make wretched <hi>Jars,</hi> if you don't <hi>keep Time</hi> in your <hi>Anger.</hi> There are Two Cautions to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred you.</p>
               <p>One Caution is this; You muſt not be <hi>Angry</hi> too <hi>Soon.</hi> What a Reprimand have our ſhort-winded, haſty, huffy People, given to them! In Prov. XIV. 17. <hi>He that is ſoon Angry, dealeth fooliſhly.</hi> Syrs, My
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001898_0018_0FB9D3C6168CDB90"/>propoſal is worth hearkening to; Never be <hi>Angry</hi> without firſt <hi>Pauſing</hi> a little, and Thinking, <hi>Will my Anger be proper here?</hi> There was an Heathen Emperor, who would not permit his <hi>Anger</hi> to break forth at any thing, until he had made ſuch a pauſe, as to recite the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Alphabet.</hi> There was a Chriſtian Emperor, who would not permit the Indignations of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> at any thing to boil within him, until he had made ſuch a pauſe as to recite, <hi>The Lords Prayer.</hi> Thus the Brave Men, that had <hi>Rule over other Men,</hi> in this gave a Demonſtration that they could <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> themſelves</hi> alſo. A Glorious <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and that without which, Be it known to you, O Men of Quality, No <hi>Dominion</hi> will be Glorious. A <hi>Delay</hi> of <hi>Anger,</hi> until the fitteſt minute for the working of it; How Profitable, how Serviceable, would it be; what <hi>Praecipitations</hi> would it ſave us from! The <hi>Diſcretion of a Man,</hi> is never more Conſpicuous,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001898_0019_0FB9D3C905E59520"/>than when he <hi>Deferreth his Anger.</hi> I queſtion, Whether any Man ever found himſelf a <hi>Loſer</hi> by doing ſo. This I am ſure of; <hi>He that is ſlow to Anger is better than the mighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Caution is this; You muſt not be <hi>Angry</hi> too <hi>Long.</hi> It is the Apoſtolical Charge; Eph. IV. 26. <hi>Let not the Sun go down in your Wrath.</hi> I hope, you would not have the <hi>Sun</hi> carry ſuch a ſtory of you, to the People of the other Haemiſphaere, <hi>That you are Implacable.</hi> Our <hi>Anger,</hi> like the <hi>Manna</hi> of old, will ſtink, if it be kept until the next Morning: But in this thing otherwiſe than the <hi>Manna,</hi> That it <hi>Stinks</hi> worſt of all, when kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> We ſhould not give ſuch an <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> leave to ſtay a Night under the Roof with us. The Apoſtle in this paſſage, may allude unto the Law; <hi>If a Man have Committed a Sin worthy of Death, and he be put to Death, and they hang him on a Tree, his Body ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main all night upon the Tree; thou
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001898_0020_0FB9D3CA97B54A48"/>must bury him in any wiſe that very Day.</hi> Even ſo; If a Man have Committed a Sin worthy of thy <hi>Wrath,</hi> yet thy Angry Reſentment thereof, muſt not <hi>remain all night;</hi> Thou ſhalt <hi>bury</hi> it <hi>in any wiſe, that very Day.</hi> Yea, There is a <hi>Curſed Carcaſe</hi> hanging in thy Soul, as long as <hi>Anger</hi> is diſcompoſing of thee. Syrs, I have another propoſal, which will be worth hearkening to; going to <hi>Rest,</hi> every Night, make it a <hi>Rest</hi> indeed, by being able to ſay, <hi>There is no body in the World, but what my mind is in an Eaſy Frame unto!</hi> This I will <hi>affirm Constantly.</hi> An <hi>Immortal Anger</hi> very ill becomes <hi>Mortal People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly. <hi>Meekneſs</hi> muſt <hi>Govern</hi> our <hi>Anger,</hi> as to the <hi>Meaſures</hi> of it. If we muſt be <hi>Angry,</hi> yet, why <hi>Raving?</hi> Why <hi>Frantick?</hi> Why like a ſlated Houſe on Flame, ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that there ſhall be no coming anear you! If <hi>Angry,</hi> yet what need of being Tranſported into a <hi>Fury?</hi> and Flinging Things to and fro,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001898_0021_0FB9D3CFEB5A9260"/>as if you were mad? Fy, for ſhame! Why muſt you fall to <hi>Railing,</hi> why to <hi>Revenge,</hi> on the Perſon whom your <hi>Anger</hi> is pointed at? I'l ſhow you a picture of this <hi>Anger!</hi> 'Tis in I Sam. XX. 30. <hi>Then Sauls Anger was kindled againſt Jonathan, and he ſaid unto him, Thou Son of the Perverſe, Rebellious Woman!</hi> What a <hi>madman</hi> is here? He calls his own Son, <hi>A Whores-bird?</hi>— The <hi>Anger</hi> is <hi>unbounded,</hi> when it breaks forth into <hi>Reproaching,</hi> into <hi>Reviling,</hi> into <hi>Taunts</hi> and unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly Expreſſions. But what, when into <hi>Blows,</hi> from a <hi>Fist of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Blows;</hi> and it may be a poor <hi>Beaſt</hi> muſt feel them too. <hi>Brutiſh, Anger,</hi> and ſuch as degrades the <hi>Man</hi> down into the very <hi>Claſs</hi> that he quarrels with! So <hi>Balaam;</hi> his <hi>Anger was Kindled,</hi> and he <hi>Smote the Aſs with a Staff!</hi> An <hi>Anger</hi> that will ſpend it ſelf in outrages upon an <hi>Horſe,</hi> upon a <hi>Dog,</hi> upon a <hi>Tool</hi> that fails us; how worſe than <hi>C<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001898_0022_0FB9D3D424F862D0"/>is their Anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel!</hi> One thing more is to be ſpoken. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of making any <hi>Vows,</hi> in your <hi>Anger; Vows</hi> dictated by <hi>Anger;</hi> The worſt Counſellor in the World! <hi>Vows,</hi> wherein the <hi>Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> is horribly Violated ! And, Oh! Beware of all <hi>Angry Imprecations;</hi> All <hi>Wiſhes</hi> that carry <hi>Curſes</hi> in them: All <hi>Wiſhes</hi> of any Damage to your ſelves or others.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> Oh!
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001898_0023_0FB9D3D570C15A90"/>What a <hi>Golden Curb,</hi> would it keep upon us?</p>
               <p n="2">II. There are ſome <hi>Wiſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> with which we are to check the <hi>Follies</hi> of UNGOVERNED AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GER; Things which <hi>Well-Conſidered</hi> would lay the <hi>Eaſy Yoke</hi> of <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> upon us. The Truth is, <hi>Angry</hi> People, are always <hi>Inconſiderate. Anger</hi> would be mavellouſly allay'd, if <hi>People</hi> would but <hi>Conſider</hi> a little more. But there are ſome <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,</hi> which are ſpecial <hi>Anger-Quellers;</hi> They are <hi>Specificks</hi> for the Cure of the Maladie; Singular, Adapted, Potent <hi>Febrifuges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt. There are ſome <hi>Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> purely <hi>Reaſonable,</hi> which would be of ſome uſe to Allay the <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Heats</hi> of our <hi>Anger.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Anger</hi> is frequently an <hi>

                  <hi>Conſider</hi> this; <hi>Rarely is any thing done ſo well in Anger, but what would have been done much Better out of it.</hi> If a Man would have any Thing done, it will ſooner be done by <hi>Fair Words,</hi> for the moſt part, than by <hi>Fierce Ones.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, <hi>The Words of Wiſe Men are heard in Quiet;</hi> Go <hi>Quietly</hi> to Work, and your <hi>Words will be heard;</hi> your Buſineſs will be moſt Comfortably and Effectually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.

A <hi>Soft Tongue,</hi> will manage a <hi>Man of Bone;</hi> a Man as hard and ſtiff as a <hi>Bone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would Eſpecially enter this Caveat, againſt the Infliction of a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> upon Faulty <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> while the Fit of <hi>Anger</hi> is yet burning in the Hearts of their Superiours.

He was a <hi>Prudent</hi> Man, though a <hi>Pagan,</hi> who ſaid unto his Man that Vexed him; <hi>I would ſtrike thee now, but only that I am angry with thee.</hi> Some will ſay, <hi>But if I put off the Execution of my Diſcipline, till the Heat of my Anger is over, I can't find! in my Heart then at all to Execute it.</hi> Then I ſay, Thou art a <hi>Fool;</hi> And it is the Wrath of Heaven againſt thy poor <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> that has put them into the Hands of ſuch a <hi>Fool!</hi> I do particularly move it for the <hi>School,</hi> as well as for the Houſe. Becauſe the <hi>Strokes</hi> ought not furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be thrown away; They ſhould be reſerved, either for <hi>Greater Faults,</hi> or for <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> in <hi>Leſſer Ones.</hi> But the <hi>Strokes</hi> ought always to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a ſerious Diſcourſe unto the Sufferer, ſhowing him, the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, that has been ſinn'd againſt; Showing him the <hi>Sin</hi> that is now ſuffered for.</p>
               <p>There is a Word, which Oh! That it were more thought upon!
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001898_0026_0FB9D3D973CFB3D0"/>That word; Jam. 1.20. <hi>The Wrath of Men Works not the Righteouſneſs of GOD!</hi> Things done <hi>Wrathfully,</hi> how ſeldom are they done <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly!</hi> How ſeldom done, as GOD would have them to be?</p>
               <p>Again; An <hi>Angry</hi> Man will do well to <hi>Conſider</hi> this; <hi>What are they that have incurred, my Anger; and what was it they intended, when they did it?</hi> Upon the <hi>Quality</hi> of them, with whom we are <hi>Angry,</hi> methinks the Reflections of <hi>Seneca,</hi> have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, <q>Is it a <hi>Good Man</hi> that has <hi>Injured</hi> thee?

               <p>There is a weight in ſuch <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</hi> But after all, Very Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the Complaint of the moſt Learned Roman; That the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> of their <hi>Philoſophy</hi> were very Fine Things; and yet whatever the matter were, he knew not; when they came to be <hi>Practiſed,</hi> they ſtill fail'd of procuring what they pretended for.</p>
               <p>We muſt then betake our ſelves unto <hi>Christianity,</hi> for higher <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations</hi> to ſuppreſs the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which UNGOVERNED ANGER will fall into.</p>
               <p>Secondly. Let us then Repair to <hi>Religious Conſiderations,</hi> which alſo are of all, the moſt <hi>Reaſonable;</hi> and by them let the <hi>

                  <hi>Anger</hi> be Extinguiſhed. RELIGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON is the Engine, that muſt be brought and wrought, for the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the <hi>Fire,</hi> which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens unknown Confuſion unto us.</p>
               <p>Accordingly; Firſt; It may check our <hi>Anger,</hi> if we will <hi>Conſider</hi> this; <hi>Whoſe Eye is upon me when I am Angry, and upon all the motions of my Anger!</hi> Syrs, Are you not always in a <hi>Preſence</hi> which you owe a Reſpect unto? I'l propound this. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> of our GOD; Theſe have their Eye upon us; They Rejoyce, when they ſee us behave our ſelves, as becomes the <hi>Heirs of Salvation;</hi> They do not ſo, when we misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves. It was urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Raſhneſs;</hi> Eccl. V. 6. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay thou before the Angel, it was an Error.</hi> It may be urged againſt <hi>Anger,</hi> which very ſeldom is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> in it; <hi>Why ſhould an Angel ſee thee in an Error?</hi> When an <hi>Angel</hi> ſtood in the way of the <hi>Angry</hi> Prophet, he would ruſh no
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001898_0029_0FB9D3E4C7FC5F60"/>further in his <hi>Anger.</hi> My Friend, In thy <hi>Anger</hi> thou art ruſhing out of the way. But, <hi>what if</hi> there ſhould be an <hi>Angel</hi> ſtanding by thee, with a <hi>Flaming Sword</hi> in his hand? Oh! put up the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wrath,</hi> and be n't ſo <hi>Angry</hi> leſt <hi>he</hi> take notice of it. But there is a more <hi>conſiderable</hi> thing than this; and a thing ſo certain, that there is no room for a <hi>What if?</hi> upon it. Ah, <hi>Vexed Parence, Wilt thou not Endure, ſeeing Him that is Inviſible?</hi> Syrs, Remember, The Eye of the great GOD Himſelf is upon you; A <hi>Preſence,</hi> which Certainly you owe Reſpect unto! 'Tis very Ill manners to <hi>Chide,</hi> and <hi>Scold,</hi> and <hi>Brawl,</hi> and much more to <hi>Smite</hi> with <hi>Anger,</hi> in the Company of <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> and much more of our <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> 'Tis an Affront unto the Company. When you are <hi>Angry,</hi> then call to mind, <hi>I am in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the glorious GOD; The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious GOD looks upon me!</hi> Surely, This will bring you to ſome <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:001898_0030_0FB9D3E62E0C0278"/>If a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> or but a <hi>Constable,</hi> or indeed any Perſon of <hi>Gravity</hi> comes in, with a, <hi>What's to do here?</hi>—it uſes to quiet <hi>unruly Fellows.</hi> And will it not quiet our <hi>unruly Angers,</hi> for the Almighty GOD Himſelf to come in upon them! It was ſaid; Jer. V. 22. <hi>Fear ye not me? Saith the Lord: Will not ye Tremble at my Preſence? Which have placed the Sand for the Bound of the Sea; that though the waves thereof toſs themſelves, they cannot prevail; though they rore, yet they cannot paſs over it.</hi> Oh! could we ſet our ſelves as in the <hi>Preſence</hi> of the Lord, One would think, This might ſet a Bound unto the foaming Sea of our <hi>Anger!</hi> To <hi>Strike</hi> in the <hi>Preſence</hi> of the King; How Intolerable! How Inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! A whole People once, were in ſuch a Temper of <hi>Anger,</hi> that they were going to ſtone the beſt Friends they had in the World; The <hi>Rage reached up to Heaven!</hi> But we read, <hi>The Glory of the Lord appear'd,</hi>—
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001898_0031_0FB9D3EDB02BB210"/>And then all the murmur of the <hi>Raging waves of the Sea</hi> — ſtop'd at once. Truly, When we are <hi>Angry,</hi> may the <hi>glorious Lord appear</hi> unto us, it would <hi>Calm</hi> us won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully!</p>
               <p>Secondly. It may check our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> if we will <hi>Conſider</hi> this; <hi>Who is it that makes me Angry, and from whoſe Hand come the Accidents, on which I place my Anger?</hi> 'Tis very probable, There may be the <hi>Hand of Joab</hi> in all this; I mean, That there may be an <hi>Hand of Satan</hi> in Contriving to make you <hi>Angry;</hi> For he knows, That when you are <hi>Angry,</hi> he has you, at wondrous Diſadvantages, to drive you into ſome <hi>Snare</hi> that he has been laying for you. When we are <hi>Angry,</hi> let us call to mind; <hi>It may be, that I am now put into this Agitation, by Satan ſiſting of me! But now let me not Hamour Satan, by diſcovering abundance of Bran in the ſifting.</hi> What ſays the Proverb of <hi>Iſrael?
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001898_0032_0FB9D3EE79175F28"/>He that hath no Rule over his own Spirit, is like a City that is broken down, and without Walls?</hi> We are beſieged by the Devil, in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, that alarm our <hi>Anger.</hi> If now we are <hi>like a City that is broken down, and without Walls,</hi> what, what will become of us? There was a Wicked Man among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by whom our Apoſtle was <hi>buffeted,</hi> as <hi>Micajah</hi> had formerly been, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a moſt Intimate Communion with the Heavenly World. But the Man of GOD ſays of him; 2 Cor. XII. 7. <hi>There was given me a Meſſenger of Satan, to buffet me, leſt I ſhould be Exalted above meaſure.</hi> Syrs, The Cauſe why you are ſo <hi>Angry,</hi> is Becauſe that ſomebody <hi>Buffets</hi> you. Now think; <hi>It may be, that Satan ſets them on!</hi> And he may ſet them on for this very purpoſe; To throw you into the Diſorders of <hi>Anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! <hi>Be not Ignorant of his Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces!</hi> —But I am certain, There is a more <hi>Conſiderable</hi> Hand than <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:001898_0033_0FB9D3F00053B998"/>without which no Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Occurrent whatſoever could accoſt you. Whatever the <hi>Man</hi> be that offends you he is but an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in the Hand of GOD; The great GOD is the Eternal, Sovereign, <hi>First Cauſe</hi> of all; and you may ſay unto that Man, <hi>Thou couldest have no Power against me, except it were given thee from Above.</hi> Oh! That our <hi>Anger</hi> might learn that Language; Pſal. XXXIX. 9. <hi>I'm Dumb, I open not my mouth; For tis what thou hast done,</hi> O Lord. A <hi>Job</hi> will not be Intemperately <hi>Angry</hi> at a <hi>Caldaean,</hi> when he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, <hi>'Tis the Lord, who has taken away.</hi> A <hi>David</hi> will not be Intemperately <hi>Angry</hi> at a <hi>Shimei,</hi> when he Remembers, <hi>The Lord has bidden him.</hi> Child of GOD, I hope, thou canſt ſay, <hi>I can take any thing well at my Fathers Hands!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly. Excellent <hi>Examples</hi> of a WELL-GOVERNED ANGER well <hi>conſidered</hi> with us, may be of

               </p>

                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:001898_0035_0FB9D3F8EC1E76D0"/>
But after all, I will rather ſay <hi>Run with Patience, looking off unto JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,;</hi> A JESUS, <hi>Fairer than the Children of Men!</hi> An Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wrote on the Walls of his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, thoſe words of our Incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble SAVIOUR; LEARN OF ME, FOR I AM MEEK AND LOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY IN HEART. I have read of ſome, that when the Rage of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> was upon them, they would ſet before them a <hi>Lamb,</hi> which would bring all to rights. But this is the Thing, that is now preſſed for; O <hi>Angry</hi> People, Set before your ſelves the JESUS, who is the <hi>Lamb of GOD,</hi> and who was always <hi>as Meek as a Lamb;</hi> and who when <hi>he was oppreſſed, and was afflicted, yet opened not his mouth; as a Sheep before the Shearers is dumb, ſo he opened not His mouth.</hi> We are ſo inſtructed, 1 Pet. II. 21, 23. <hi>CHRIST Suffered for us, leaving us an Example, that ye ſhould follow His Steps; Who, when He was Reviled, Reviled not again.</hi> Truly, Never,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001898_0036_0FB9D3F9C03E58F0"/>Never was there ſuch a Pattern of <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> as our moſt amiable and admirable JESUS. I beſeech you, let us have that <hi>Pattern</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before us, and <hi>ſet the Lord always before us!</hi> Church-Hiſtory mentions a Man of Great Figure who had been a very <hi>Paſſionate</hi> Man, and a Man of ſuch violent <hi>Anger,</hi> that he made himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy to all the World: But all the World at length took notice, that he became one of the <hi>Meekest</hi> Men upon Earth: and when ſome asked him, what it was that had produced this change upon him; he replied, <hi>I am come to this, by keeping my Thoughts very much on the Meekneſs of my Lovely SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R.</hi> Syrs, when you feel the <hi>Fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> of <hi>Anger</hi> faſtning on you, fix your Eye on your Lovely SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR. 'Twill have a Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Efficacy.</p>
               <p>Our SAVIOUR who is <hi>God-Man,</hi> anon carries us up into the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001898_0037_0FB9D3FB4A94A610"/>Infinite GOD; A GOD in whom, Oh! what an Example of <hi>Long-Suffering</hi> have we to be amazed at! A GOD, in whom theſe Two Things are celebrated; Pſam. GIII. 8, 9. <hi>He is ſlow to Anger,</hi> and <hi>He will not always chide.</hi> Alas, How many Millions of Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are put upon the Omnipotent GOD, and this every Day! The Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>He is provoked every Day.</hi> We may wonder that He has not Long ago made this whole World an entire <hi>Sodom,</hi> and laid it in Aſhes! A World, that is ſill'd with His <hi>Adverſaries.</hi> 'Twere an eaſy Thing, and no unjuſt one, for Him to dart hot Thunderbolts down upon the Heads of all His <hi>Adverſaries.</hi> But He <hi>Suffers their Manners.</hi> He beſtows—Thouſands of Mercies and Comforts on them from Day to Day. A <hi>Patient</hi> GOD now ſays to an <hi>Angry</hi> Man, <hi>Doſt thou well to be what thou art?</hi> Oh! Let us Imitate the <hi>Long-Suffering</hi> of our Heavenly Father. Eſpecially,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001898_0038_0FB9D3FCAE330E90"/>when we think, what <hi>Experience</hi> of His <hi>Long-Suffering,</hi> we our ſelves have had, in His Dealings with us!</p>
               <p>Fourthly. Will this do nothing to <hi>Govern</hi> our <hi>Anger?</hi> Impartially <hi>Conſiter, What our Anger is;</hi> and <hi>What we are in our Anger;</hi> and <hi>What we do by our Anger?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you take a View of <hi>Exceſſive Anger,</hi> will it not appear an Odious, an Unhandſome, a Deformed ſort of a Thing? Some of the Ancients adviſed an <hi>Angry</hi> Man, to take a View of his own <hi>Face</hi> in a <hi>Glaſs.</hi> Look in a <hi>Glaſs,</hi> my Friend, and ſee, and ſay, How it looks to have ſo much of <hi>Cain</hi> in the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance! Methinks, The View may turn the <hi>Anger</hi> into <hi>Bluſhing,</hi> and make thee more <hi>Angry</hi> at thy ſelf, than at any One elſe. <hi>Turpis Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectus; Quid Animus?</hi> If <hi>Anger</hi> in the <hi>Face</hi> be ſo ugly, what is it in the <hi>Soul?</hi> 'Tis a very Good Rule in Converſation; For a Man to Mind how his own <hi>Indecencies</hi> look, when
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001898_0039_0FB9D403941F4E60"/>he ſees them in other Men. Why, That Outrageous <hi>Anger,</hi> in which thou doſt indulge thy ſelf, how doſt thou like it in other Men, when thou ſeeſt them ſtorming with ſuch Outrages?</p>
               <p>But more than ſo; O UNGO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNED ANGER, From thee we ſuffer <hi>great Diſquietments,</hi> and very Hurtful Things are done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, by thy <hi>Praecipitancies!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Anger;</hi> Alas, it unfits a Man for every Thing in the World. It mingles a <hi>ſtrange Fire</hi> with our <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> Our <hi>Devotions</hi> are all Spoilt, if they be not <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out VVrath.</hi> If we cannot <hi>Bear much,</hi> we ſhall never be <hi>Pillars in the Houſe of GOD,</hi> nor be very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in any <hi>Society</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Blemiſh</hi> unto a Man; it lays him low, in the eſteem of the Neighbourhood. An <hi>Angry</hi> Man may keep the Neighbours in ſome Awe; But little doth the think, their <hi>Secret A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> for him; and how much
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001898_0040_0FB9D40676E3AE78"/>they bear in mind, his Abuſive uſage of them. Such <hi>Anger,</hi> it makes a Man unfit for any <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Art thou a <hi>Froward</hi> and a <hi>Furious</hi> Man? The Bible forbids us to enter into a Cloſe <hi>Friendſhip</hi> with ſuch a Man. If thou art not ſo much as fit for a <hi>Friend,</hi> what elſe canſt thou be good for? Such a Man is a meer <hi>Nabal,</hi> to all that are about him.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>Anger</hi> may cauſe a Man to fall under <hi>Anger.</hi> Thy <hi>Anger,</hi> O Man, may lay thee open to the <hi>Anger</hi> of GOD. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>Angry,</hi> he broke both of the Two Tables, on which the <hi>Law</hi> was written by the <hi>Finger of GOD.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, an <hi>Angry</hi> Man will ſoon break <hi>both Tables</hi> of the Law; Yea, He will <hi>Abound in Tranſgreſſion.</hi> And GOD will <hi>Distribute Sorrows in His Anger,</hi> to the Tranſgreſſor. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Anger</hi> of People, will boil out in ſuch <hi>VViſhes,</hi>—as the <hi>Anger</hi> of GOD will bring about, in
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001898_0041_0FB9D40746CEB4D0"/>aſtoniſhing <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> upon them. Whether it be ſo or no; our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious JUDGE, has given us an awful Intimation, That our <hi>Anger</hi> has nothing leſs than <hi>Murder</hi> in it! — O Dreadful; — Nothing leſs than <hi>Murder</hi> in it! He ſays, Mar. V. 22. <hi>Whoſoever is Angry with his Brother without a Cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the Judgment; and, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſay to his Brother, Raca, ſhall be in danger of the Council; But, whoſoever ſhall ſay, Thou Fool, ſhall be in danger of Hell-fire. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Conceived</hi> is like the Crimes, which fell under the Cognizance of the middle Judicatory of the Twenty three Judges among the <hi>Jews. Anger <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ttered,</hi> is like the Crimes of which the Higheſt Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty</hi> among them took the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance 'Tis like a <hi>Capital Crime;</hi> The Commandment which forbids <hi>Murder</hi> is that which has forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it. <hi>Anger</hi> ſoon gets on to <hi>Hatred; Hatred</hi> what is it but <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:001898_0042_0FB9D408ADF620E8"/>And verily, 'Tis to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, that <hi>Angry</hi> People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no more actual <hi>Murders</hi> than they do! There is much of <hi>Hell</hi> in it; and <hi>Hell</hi> will be the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is very ſure; By this <hi>Anger</hi> of ours, we ſhall <hi>grieve</hi> the <hi>Dove-like Spirit</hi> of our SAVIOUR, Exceedingly. Thoſe Two Things are joined; Eph. IV. 30, 31. <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of GOD; let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, be put away from you.</hi> But, will you <hi>Grieve</hi> that <hi>Spirit of Goodneſs?</hi> Oh! How <hi>Evil,</hi> How <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> will be the Conſequences! Chriſtian, 'Tis thy <hi>Glory</hi> to be a <hi>Temple</hi> of GOD. When thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveſt <hi>Anger</hi> glowing in thy Soul, now think; <hi>What? ſhall I ſet a Temple of GOD on Fire?

               </p>
               <p>And now, What ſhall be the Iſſue of all the Meditations.</p>
               <p>May we from this Time, One
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001898_0043_0FB9D4109B680590"/>and all, Study that <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> which is a <hi>Thing of great Price in the ſight of GOD!</hi> Oh! may the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our Meditations and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications be this; That we ſhall be the <hi>Meek,</hi> whom the Goſpel has pronounced the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> Ones, and of whom it is promiſed, That they ſhall be <hi>Beautified</hi> with the <hi>Salvation</hi> of GOD. Concerning a Continual Study to ſuppreſs UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GOVERNED ANGER, I will ſay unto you, what was of old ſpoken to one who was diſſwaded from it; 1 Sam. XXV. 31. <hi>This ſhall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of Heart;</hi> It will not be <hi>Repented</hi> of! I ſpeak this, the more Sollicitouſly, becauſe the Time is coming on for the Accompliſhment of that Prophecy, <hi>The Nations were Angry.</hi> The <hi>Anger</hi> of People againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is like to make fearful Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies. At this Time, <hi>O ſeek Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ye may be hid in the Day of the Anger of the Lord;</hi> And that ye may admit no <hi>Wrath,</hi> but
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001898_0044_0FB9D411DB8699B0"/>what ſhall <hi>praiſe the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Remainder of the Wrath,</hi> you may ſtill <hi>Restrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Above others,</hi> it is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Concern of Perſons in <hi>Superiour Stations,</hi> to be on their Guard, leſt UNGOVERNED ANGER get the upper hand of them; leſt they who are to <hi>Govern</hi> others be themſelves <hi>Geverned</hi> by the worſt of Leaders. Truly, a <hi>Little</hi> of this <hi>Folly,</hi> will be an unknown Damage, to a Man of <hi>Reputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Syrs, If you are Men in Publick. Circumſtances, and eſpecially, if you are Men of Projection to <hi>Do Good</hi> in the World; You will have your Conduct often blamed with Vile <hi>Miſrepreſentations</hi> of it. You muſt meet with many Prodigies of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,</hi> and People will heap <hi>Injuries</hi> upon you, at the very time when you are heaping of <hi>Kindneſſes</hi> upon them. You ſhall perhaps encounter with unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001898_0045_0FB9D41343FFF4D0"/>Defamations, and in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Country <hi>hear the Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of many</hi> in wretched Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, invented and fomented by them that <hi>Love and make a Lye.</hi>— But now,—<hi>Oh! Take heed unto your Spirit.</hi> Not a Word! Not ſo much as a Word, but what ſhall become a Meek Servant of GOD! Only ſay, <hi>Lord, Put not thy Servant away in Anger, and let me not have the mark of one put away, by Anger gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon me!</hi> Even a <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, by <hi>Speaking unadviſedly with his Lips</hi> on ſuch <hi>Provocations,</hi> may incur this; <hi>GOD ſhall be Wroth with him!</hi>— Oh!

               <p>A Miſerable Man here in the Chains of <hi>Death</hi> before you, Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſires it of me, That all People may be warned againſt UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GOVERNED ANGER, from the ſad Experience of what he has him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf therein been left unto. Yea, The Holy GOD ſhews him unto
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001898_0046_0FB9D414B3720370"/>the Congregation, and ſays unto us, <hi>Govern your Anger, or, little do you think, what it may bring you to!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Charitable deſires at the ſame time, for this Miſerable Man, what can they be?—But that a Gracious GOD would affect his Heart, with a ſenſe, not only of the <hi>Follies</hi> he has by his UNGO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNED ANGER been ſo often betray'd into; <hi>Follies</hi> that have En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled againſt him the <hi>Anger</hi> of GOD; Eſpecially that Crime of <hi>Killing</hi> one whom he ought to have <hi>Loved,</hi> for which he muſt now <hi>haſten to the Pit;</hi> but alſo make him truly ſenſible of all the <hi>Sin</hi> which hath ſo incenſed Heaven, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reached unto but about Three or Four and Thirty years of Age, he muſt be <hi>Cut off,</hi> and come to a <hi>fearful End:</hi> That all the <hi>Sin</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has <hi>denied the GOD that is Above,</hi> may appear unto him, as it is, the moſt <hi>Odious Evil</hi> in the World; That a CHRIST, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001898_0047_0FB9D41C2CFC47F8"/>SAVIOUR from <hi>Sin,</hi> may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear inexpreſſibly <hi>Precious</hi> unto him, and <hi>fulfil</hi> on him and for him, <hi>all the Good Pleaſure of his Goodneſs;</hi> And, that having made the Flight of a lively <hi>Faith</hi> unto the <hi>Blood which cleanſes from all Sin,</hi> he may feel his Heart at the ſame time filled with the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD and of His <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and a Concern to <hi>do all the Good</hi> that he can at his leaving of the World. Ah! Poor FEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WICK, in purſuance of this Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for thy approaching <hi>Death,</hi> now the <hi>Sorrows of Death compaſs thee, and the Pains of Hell get hold on thee,</hi> 'tis high time for thee to <hi>call upon the Name of the Lord, and ſay, O Lord, I beſeech thee, Deliver my Soul!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! See to it, that the Work of <hi>Repentance,</hi> which now ſeems to be hopefully beginning upon you, prove a <hi>Sincere,</hi> and a <hi>Real,</hi> and a <hi>Thorough</hi> Work, and an <hi>Hope that will not make aſhamed.</hi> The rather,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001898_0048_0FB9D41D8BAEB900"/>Becauſe a work of <hi>Repentance</hi> in Circumſtances like to yours, will have many things to bring a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion upon the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of it. They that never <hi>Seek</hi> to GOD, until they feel Him <hi>Slaying</hi> of them, do uſually <hi>flatter Him with their mouth,</hi> and <hi>Lye to him with their Tongue.</hi>

            <head>THE Dying Speech OF <hi>Jeremiah Fenwick,</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Who, after he had at the place of Execution, leſs audibly ſpoken the ſubſtance of theſe Things, then gave the enſuing Inſtrument as a more full Declaration of his <hi>Dying Sentiments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Conſider my ſelf as a dying, Man, and I deſire to dye giving Glory to God, before whom I am now to make my Appearance. I offer up my Praiſes unto God who has granted me ſuch a ſpace of Repentance, and ſo many helps and means to bring me to it</p>
            <p>I hope, the Faithful Servants of God, will with ſome comfort ſee
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001898_0051_0FB9D426B77670C8"/>ſome Harveſt of the great pains they have taken for my Good.</p>
            <p>To all the other Sins of a Wicked Life, I have added this; That I have too much delayed my Repentance, even ſince my Impriſonment, while the Sentence againſt my evil work, was not yet certain to be Executed. Though I have hereby ſo affronted and provoked the good Spirit of Grace, that He might juſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw for ever from me, yet ſuch has been his Free and Rich Grace, as to continue ſtill to viſit me with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences; and bring on a work of Repentance in my Soul.</p>
            <p>I heartily mourn for all the Sins of my Life; and above all for the Fountain of all Sins, which I have in an Heart that is deſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I moſt particularly confeſs and bewail my Blood Guiltineſs. I owe my Life to Juſtice, for having wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taken away the Life of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom I ought to have loved as my ſelf. I own the Juſtice of the Government in their Proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. <hi>But, Lord, there is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:001898_0052_0FB9D429CCFF4158"/>
I behold the Infinite Mercy of a God ready to Pardon; and my Soul is amazed at it. I behold a great Saviour, ſhedding his Blood, which cleanſes from all Sin. And I hear him ſaying to the chief of Sinners, <hi>Him that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> With a diſtreſſed Soul I fly to him, to be reconciled unto God, and to be led into Paths of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. I am not without Hope. And one fruit of my Hope, is, that it cauſes me to look on my Sins with more Sorrow for them, and Hatred of them; which till I had this Hope, I did not care or dare to think upon. Another fruit of it, is, that my Heart is melted, and filled with Deſires to Glorify God.</p>
            <p>And I know not how to glorify God more, than by ſolemn warnings unto all People to take heed of ſuch Sins, as have brought me to ſuch a Ruin as is now come upon me.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that lies heavy on my Heart is, My Prophanation of the Lords Day, and my frequently &amp; needleſly neglecting the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. A Sin, which let all that love their Souls be afraid of.
<pb facs="unknown:001898_0053_0FB9D42C65940E60"/>I have wounded my Soul ſometimes by exceſſive Drinking. A Sin that leads to many others I have been very vile in Swearing and Curſing. <hi>Lord, ſend me not among thoſe whoſe Language I have been uſed unto!</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed Anger has brought my Death. Beware, my Friends, of this deadly Evil. But I would eſpecially bewail my Prayerleſs Life. I had no Prayers with my Family, nor in my Retirement, in the Morning of the Day, when I was leſt unto the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Neighbour. O my Friends, In the Day, which you don't begin with Prayers unto God, little do you know what God may leave you to.</p>
            <p>Thus, I would as in the Preſence of God, and as I am now in a ſhort Time to appear before my great Judge, there to give up an Account of my Actions done in the Fleſh, ſolemnly exhort and warn all that ſhall ſee or hear of my Tragical and Untimely End; But more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maſters of Families, that they do not neglect Prayers in their Families, and a due Attendance on the Publick Worſhip of God, on his Holy Day,
<pb facs="unknown:001898_0054_0FB9D42D8DCA9038"/>and all other Duties required in Gods Holy Word, as I to my great Grief have done. I deſire all, that they look back on their paſt life, and ſeek to God, thorough Jeſus Chriſt for Repentance, while there is a ſpace given to them, leaſt they mourn at laſt, and ſay, <hi>how have I hated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</hi> and leaſt God in His Holy Juſtice ſhould ſay to them, <hi>when I called upon you, you would not hear, now you cry to me, I will not anſwer you.</hi> I deſire yet more eſpecially, to warn all young Perſons, to ſeek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in their Youth and in the Morning of their Days, as believing that their whole Life is but a ſhort Time to prepare for Eternity; and to live in an holy walk with God, leſt they ſhould provoke God to leave them to fall into the ſame Sins which have been my Ruin. Pray, let my Advice to you never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by you, but take Example from <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Neighbour, that you may not run on in ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bleſſed God, but that you may take warning by me, and may hearken to the Calls of God in the

Thus lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you to the Mercy of the great God, as I do my ſelf likewiſe, I hope through the Merits of my dear Redeemer, we may have a happy Meeting in the great Day of the Lord. Take theſe warnings of a dying Man.
