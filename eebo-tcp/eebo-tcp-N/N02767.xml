         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Piece, occasion'd by the setting up a <hi>Printing-Press</hi> in <hi>Williamsburg,</hi> justly claims a Title to some Share of Your Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Subject-Matter of it, the Art of <hi>PRINTING,</hi> owes to You its Patronage and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; whence, by a natural Deduction, this ought as necessarily to follow the Fate and Fortune of that, as Effects do their Causes.</p>
            <p>IF upon the Prospect of a great many Advantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-peradventure likely to accrue to this Colony, from an ART so long wanting among us, I have not been able to restrain my own Inclinations to write the ensuing Trifle, (the first Essay of this Kind attempted here,) I hope this at least will make it the less inexcusable, that I have said nothing herein, which, I am confident, will not be readily assented to, by all who have the Happiness to live under the present Administration, in this Colony: Unless, perhaps, this Exception be taken, that where a disinterested and unprejudic'd PATRIOTISM,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003298_0003_0F692649B8F498D0"/>
(for I will not be asham'd of the Word) of a Governor to his People, and a reciprocal Affection and Obedience of them to Him is to be describ'd, the Author of this Piece may have wanted a Scale of Thought and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension equal to the Height of the Merits <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the One, or the cordial Duty of the other; and that on such a Subject it were better to be silent, than to say too little. I must confess there is some Weight in the Argument; but I seek not to palliate my Imperfections of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, lest I should be answer'd with the same sarcastic Question as <hi>Albinus,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Author, was by <hi>Cato,</hi> on the same Occasion, <hi>Whether any one had compelled me to write</hi>?</p>
            <p>BUT, to obviate this Objection, I would only have Recourse to the Sense of this whole Colony, so often and so heartily express'd in their several Addresses; which I hope will freely remit me to the Moderation of ONE, whose Judgment, tho' it must censure the Weakness, whose Modesty, tho' it must tax the Boldness, yet His Candor will excuse the Endeavours of so humble a Talent as mine, who could propose no other to myself by this present Undertaking, than to manifest with what Sincerity of Observance and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
