            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE writer of this diſcourſe is perſuaded, that many years ago, when he firſt began the ſtudy of the Scriptures, and for ſome time afterwards, he ſhould have conſidered it as an exceeding great benefit if theſe truths had been unfolded to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding as he has now declared them. And this is his reaſon for making them public; that others may receive that benefit which he ſhould have ſo highly eſteemed during his great embaraſſment when he was trying to underſtand them.</p>

                  <p>"Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved? And they ſaid, believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy Houſe."</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE are two ways of Salvation menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Scripture.</p>
            <p>One is. by a perfect unceaſing obedience:</p>
            <p>The other is by truſting in the mercy of God, through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt is called the Covenant of works.</p>
            <p>The ſecond that of Grace or the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The firſt is an impracticable way: the ſecond is poſſible.</p>
            <p>If it be aſked why the firſt ſhould ever be propoſed, ſeeing it is impracticable, the anſwer is, it leads the way to the ſecond, which is the only poſſible way.</p>
            <p>The more ſtrict the firſt covenant is the more it leads men to ſee that they are ſinners, and under condemnation; and when they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under condemnation, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032050_0004_0FF107EBD4955538"/>
come up to the terms of the firſt covenant it leads them to ſeek for ſhelter under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>The terms of the ſecond covenant are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the words of the text.—"Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved." which is a plain and ſimple condition, and whoever does that, comes up to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard which the goſpel requires; including this in the idea of believing on the Lord. i.e. To believe on him and continue to believe—to truſt in him and continue to truſt—for to believe on the Lord is to truſt in him, as when we believe in a man, we truſt in him, in his word or promiſe.</p>
            <p>As God, in his holy word, is ſaid to be lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every man, and his mercy is over all his works, and he will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, we might ſuppoſe that in ſending his goſpel for the ſalvation of men, the terms of it would be made as plain as poſſible, and at leaſt as plain as the terms of the firſt covenant—and ſo they are. Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a plain direction. And this is not an arbitrary condition. It is a neceſſary one. For by faith the door of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe is opened between God and our ſouls, and divine communications are made thro' faith as the door. God wills our happineſs, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it wiſhes us to be like him, and in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we are like him we ſhall be happy, and in proportion as we are unlike him we ſhall be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Now God is love—love in his very
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032050_0005_0FF107EE21E3BC48"/>
eſſence—then according to the degree of our love will be our happineſs, and according to our hatred or enmity to him ſo will be our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Now there is no way of attaining to this love, but through a ſenſe of his goodneſs, and of his benefits conferred upon us; through a belief in his reconciliation; by conſidering him as a friend and not as an enemy; and that is only had through the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt in the goſpel. So that faith in him is not only the condition required on our part but it is alſo the door or way, by which all ſpiritual bleſſings, and heavenly tempers and graces deſcend into the hearts of all believers, united to Chriſt their head, as the branch receives nouriſhment from the vine. And as the branch muſt continue in the vine in order to bear fruit, ſo muſt the members of Chriſt continue alſo united to him by faith, in order to bring forth fruit to the glory of God, and to the ſtrengthening and confirming their faith.</p>
            <p>By this ſtate of the caſe it is very apparent that no other condition is requiſite. And yet the plain goſpel is clouded by a multitude of errors which from time to time have been ſpread over the minds of men by the great enemy of ſouls, as we may well ſuppoſe, when he is the only hindrance to ſalvation. For we are told that "if our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032050_0006_0FF107EFB8A58A88"/>
who is the image of God ſhould ſhine unto them:" and that <hi>I. Corinthians,</hi> I. <hi>chap. and</hi> 18<hi>th verſe.</hi> "The preaching of the Croſs is to them that periſh fooliſhneſs; but unto us which are ſaved it is the power of God."</p>
            <p>Among the many errors, one in particular ſeems to have prevailed, and prevailed the more becauſe it ſeems plauſible: and it is this—that if a man believes the ſcriptures; believes that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſon of God, and came into the world as a Savior, and will yield a ſincere obedience to the moral law, he will be ſaved.</p>
            <p>A zeal to religion though a falſe one ſeems to have introduced this opinion. The abettors of this ſay, that if believing in the Lord or truſting in him will ſave a man, then a man may live as he liſt—there is no hold upon him; he may live as wickedly as he pleaſes, and yet truſt to be ſaved at laſt. This is a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, though unfound objection. And it is to be feared that thoſe who make it know not what faith in Chriſt is. When thoſe who are united to him by faith receive from God the Father and through the ſon as mediator, all ſpiritual bleſſings; when love, joy, peace, longſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, and all heavenly graces bringing ſalvation in their train deſcend into the heart, will ſuch a one live wickedly? No. He will have as great a deſire to ſerve God as ever he had to ſerve ſin, "for the love of Chriſt conſtraineth him," and he ſerves as a ſon and not as a ſervant. For the fear of damnation
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032050_0007_0FF107F1B656ACD0"/>
never carried any man to Heaven. It may lead him to Repentance. It is the hope of glory which purifies his heart and makes him fit for heaven: and that is to be had through a belief in the promiſes, obtained through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Although a man ſhould be led aſtray by a falſe perſuaſion of his ſafety at the beginning of his faith before he becomes eſtabliſhed, yet the aſſertion is ſtill true that if a man continues to believe on the Lord he will be ſaved. So that if he receives the whole of the doctrine, that of believing, and continuing to believe, he cannot be injured by it, becauſe he cannot tell that he ſhall continue in the faith till he receives the ſpirit of adoption, and is ſealed with the holy ſpirit of promiſe, as the earneſt of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and then the love of Chriſt will conſtrain him to ſerve God although he was perſuaded that there was no hell at all.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon for this opinion of ſincere obedience may be this,</p>
            <p>The law of God muſt require perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, every law muſt exact it: and none of us can perform every tittle—that is ſuch a complete obedience as is required.</p>
            <p>Therefore a relaxation of the law muſt be made, or who can be ſaved? For which reaſon ſome have ſuppoſed that the Goſpel Covenant comes in, like a court of chancery, to mitigate the ſeverities of the rigid law. This is plauſible, but a great miſtake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:032050_0008_0FF107F5AB029308"/>God intends that we ſhall be happy by loving him, and therefore to give us heaven not as a matter of debt but as a favor—by pardoning our multiplied tranſgreſſions under the firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and ſo drawing us to love him and be happy; all which is deſtroyed by this ſcheme.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. A man who looks to his ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as one of the conditions of ſalvation is thereby kept from truſting in the mercy of God, or in the Lord to ſave him; becauſe he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tell whether his obedience is good enough —a ſincere obedience cannot be defined: and I never knew an inſtance of one who looked to his ſincere obedience as the ground of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance that knew what was to become of him in the next life—He was always in a ſtate of uncertainty. Such will ſometimes have a glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering hope; but it is like the morning cloud that ſoon paſſeth away.</p>
            <p>Some under ſuch a perſuaſion will have a falſe hope when their obedience is very imperfect indeed; and others whoſe obedience is much better will be troubled with doubts and ſcruples concerning their ſtate, and that becauſe, having chalked out to themſelves a ſecond condition beſides the one which the goſpel covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and not knowing whether they have performed it they cannot truſt in the mercy of God and cannot have true peace of mind from a ſenſe of God's reconciliation; that peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtanding; nor that love which caſteth out fear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:032050_0009_0FF107F7B0567F18"/>So that when men out of zeal want to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the doctrine of ſincere obedience in order to ſhut the door of licentiouſneſs, they little think by ſo doing that they actually ſhut the door of holineſs. For holineſs is from the Lord; ſo is love, if it be diſtinct from holineſs, ſalvation is a ſupernatural work, wrought by a divine power in the heart of believers.</p>
            <p>It is a miſtaken notion in ſome to ſuppoſe that a man is ſaved by being lifted up and carried to a delightful ſpot. For ſalvation is in a man's own breaſt. The kingdom of God, ſaid our Lord, is within you: and that kingdom we are told is righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. A man under the perſuaſion of ſincere obedience being part of the goſpel covenant, is kept alſo in a great meaſure from the benefit he might reap from the firſt covenant which was intended to ſhew him his utter helpleſſneſs—that he is under the wrath of God, and muſt periſh unleſs he can flee to the mercy of God in Chriſt. —But this benefit is loſt to him becauſe he has got a ſalvo; a mitigation of that ſevere law that was intended as a ſchoolmaſter to bring us to Chriſt that we might be juſtified by faith; as the apoſtle writes to the Galatians, whom he was trying to bring back to the goſpel, and who had been perſuaded to depart from it. And ſuch a man not ſeeing his danger is not dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the foot of mercy, and to caſt his ſoul as it were upon Chriſt to be ſaved by him as the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032050_0010_0FF107FBA69C1FF0"/>
only Savior. But the man that thus cometh to him he will in no wiſe caſt out.</p>
            <p>The advocates for this third way of ſalvation have been called upon to ſhew in what part of ſcripture it is contained; and though they are unable to do it; yet they ſay it is agreeable to the general tenor of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore beg leave to quote many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that you may judge whether the doctrine of ſalvation by faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is not fully maintained therein, and with this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that all theſe are poſitive aſſertions which ought to have more weight than conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions drawn from inferences, eſpecially as there is often much fallacy in reaſoning.</p>
            <p>Then 2dly, I ſhall from the old teſtament ſhew that truſting in the Lord amounts to the ſame thing as believing on him, becauſe the ſame bleſſings, or as great, are annexed to the one as to the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. I ſhall ſhew what foundation we have to truſt in the Lord, as every faith or truſt muſt have a foundation.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Shall add a few ſhort arguments, and afterwards anſwer ſome objections and conclude.</p>
            <p>The paſſages are as follow:</p>
            <p>"He came unto his own, and his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him not: but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name." <hi>John I.</hi> 11<hi>th &amp;</hi> 12<hi>th, verſes.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:032050_0011_0FF107FE0C26D700"/>"As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even ſo muſt the ſon of man be lifted up; that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have eternal life."</p>
            <p>"For God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten ſon that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.

            <p>All the hopes we have of heaven are founded upon the promiſe made to Abraham; who is called the father of the faithful, and was made by God himſelf the father of many nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in him ſhould all nations of the earth be bleſſed. Therefore St. Paul writes to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians thus, "Even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs. Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith are the children of Abraham and they which be of ſaith are bleſſed with faithful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham." He writes alſo, "ye are all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus" And again "becauſe ye are ſons God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his ſon into your hearts crying Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, Father." When they are united by faith to Chriſt their head, they become one with him, they are children of Abraham, and children of God, and if children then heirs. So that the benefits of being fixt, permanent believers in Chriſt are inexpreſſible—And yet attempts are continually making to rob men of theſe bleſſings, by drawing off their attention from theſe things and by various devices hindering their faith in Chriſt Jeſus. The Phariſees did it of old—they ſhut up the kingdom of heaven againſt men: They neither went in themſelves, neither ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they them that were entering to go in. Our Lord ſaid, "Wo unto you lawyers: for ye
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032050_0014_0FF10805512C6490"/>
have taken away the key of knowledge; ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not in yourſelves, and them that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in ye hindered." And this ſhould be a warning to us all not to hinder the ſucceſs of the goſpel; which a man undeſignedly may yet ignorantly do. God had mercy on St. Paul becauſe he did it ignorantly in unbelief: yet it became a great grief to him, perhaps as long as he lived.</p>

            <p>I ſhall forbear any more quotations on this point, theſe perhaps being ſufficient to eſtabliſh it: and ſhall proceed to ſhew from the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that truſting in the Lord amounts to the ſame thing as believing in him: the word truſt being the term commonly uſed in the former, whilſt faith or belief is the more general term in the latter, though both are ſometimes uſed in the old as well as the new.</p>

            <p>Here we ſee a man is kept in peace becauſe he truſts in the Lord—which anſwers to St. Paul's ſaying in the 5th of Romans, "Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt."</p>

            <p>Now they who truſt in the Lord are the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous—they come up to the ſtandard which the ſecond covenant requires, and therefore the Lord will ſave them.</p>
            <p>The laſt I ſhall quote on this point is from the CXXV. <hi>Ps.</hi> and 1ſt verſe—"They that put their truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount Sion, which may not be removed, but ſtandeth faſt forever."</p>
            <p>By comparing all theſe together we find that believing in the Lord is the ſame thing as truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him.</p>
            <p>But not only will ſalvation from wrath be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to thoſe who truſt in him, but deliverance from temporal evils and dangers alſo. Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can truſt in the Lord will ſurely be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe by truſting in him they become the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032050_0016_0FF1080BAD2D4308"/>
ſubjects of the promiſes, and his promiſes can never fail. Daniel was delivered in this manner from the lion's den. "So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, becauſe he believed in his God."</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. I ſhall endeavour to ſhow what founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have to truſt in the Lord, as every faith or truſt muſt have a foundation.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, it is neceſſary to believe the ſcriptures as the word of God; and every man where the goſpel is preached, may, by examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have a good ground to believe that the ſcriptures are of divine revelation; and this according to the clear dictates of that reaſon with which God originally endued mankind. Then from the ſcriptures he may learn that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſon of God, and from thence have an idea that he is able to ſave. Believing that he is able to ſave, he may next learn that he is willing to ſave all that will receive him as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior. He may learn that Chriſt died for all men, and became a propitiation for ſin, ſo that God may receive ſinners without any infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his juſtice, becauſe a full and ſufficient atonement hath been made for their ſins. He may further learn that Chriſt declared that he came to ſave ſinners—that he came to ſave that that was loſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore every man has good ground to ſay,</p>
            <p>As Chriſt died for all men, he died for me
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032050_0017_0FF1080E1AA1AC38"/>
As Chriſt came to ſave ſinners he came to ſave me. As he came to ſave that that was loſt, he came to ſave me. Every man then has a good foundation to truſt in the mercy of God, or to truſt in the Lord for ſalvation. And this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to St. Paul's declaration that "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."</p>
            <p>It is true, faith is the gift of God. So are many other gifts which we know do in ſome meaſure depend on ourſelves; ſuch as riches, knowledge, and one more general, not fit to be mentioned.</p>
            <p>As faith cometh by the word of God it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that he gives faith by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening the mind to underſtand his word; by removing the blindneſs caſt over the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that a man may diſcern the truth; may diſcern what is true whether he believes it or not.</p>
            <p>Some are earneſtly ſeeking after faith as a gift; and ſometimes they think they have it, then again that they are miſtaken, making it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain thing. Perhaps they mean God's gracious act of imputing righteouſneſs to a man, which is the conſequence of faith. "Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This imputation is a ſubſequent act howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeedily it may follow. So is peace.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe, and by faith, peace is given: which may ſolve the diſpute, whether it is becauſe of faith, or by faith as the means.</p>
            <p>Some alſo wait for certain good frames and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032050_0018_0FF10811174E7610"/>
feelings, before they can venture to truſt on the Lord. This ſeems to ariſe from the opinion that Chriſt died only for a certain ſelect number, and then how can they truſt in him unleſs they had ſome tokens whereby they might hope to be of that number. But theſe frames and feelings are the conſequence of faith: if ſo, and they wait for theſe frames before they will truſt, they will probably wait in vain.</p>
            <p>What ſaith the ſcripture; Iſaiah, "Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hath no light? Let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God." This ſeems like the way to be enlightened with the light of the living. "Behold all ye that kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a fire, that compaſs yourſelves about with ſparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the ſparks that ye have kindled. This ſhall ye have of mine hand, ye ſhall lie down in ſorrow." <hi>Iſaiah I.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>v.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this point I cordially agree with ſome good divines; that Jeſus Chriſt being generally offered to the world as a ſavior, all men have alright to lay hold on him as a ſavior, and to commit themſelves to him, juſt as they are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waiting for any qualification in themſelves, but to come as ſinners, and rely upon him. We may ſuppoſe that the publicans and harlots did ſo in his day, for they entered into the kingdom of heaven before the Phariſees.</p>
            <p>The former had nothing to offer, and there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032050_0019_0FF108135D8AED60"/>
could more eaſily ſee themſelves ſinners, and be more ready to receive mercy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a free gift, than the others who had much merit to plead in their behalf.</p>
            <p>All men have then a foundation to receive the Lord as a ſavior, and to look to him for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being God he is able to ſave: as it is written in the XLV. of Iſaiah, "There is no God elſe beſide me; a juſt God, and a ſavior; there is none beſide me. Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth for I am God; and there is none elſe."</p>
            <p>This is the ſum of what I teach—</p>
            <p>Look unto the Lord for ſalvation and he will ſave you. And as all men have a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receive the Lord Jeſus as a ſavior, they who reject him will fall under the ſin of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which they could not incur if he did not come to ſave them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. John, v. &amp; 10. "He that believeth on the ſon of God hath the witneſs in himſelf: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he believeth not the record which God gave of his ſon."</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. I am to add a few ſhort arguments, anſwer ſome objections, and conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. John, VI. 28, &amp; 29. The Jews ſaid to our Lord, in anſwer to his telling them to labour for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life, "What ſhall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, This
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032050_0020_0FF0D3466820D7A8"/>
is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent."</p>
            <p>This declaration of our Lord is a ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in ſupport of what has been advanced.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſaid himſelf on another occaſion, "all things are poſſible to him that believeth." And again, "whoſoever ſhall ſay unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou caſt into the ſea, and ſhall not doubt in his heart, but ſhall believe that thoſe things which he ſaith ſhall come to paſs, he ſhall have whatſoever be ſaith. Therefore I ſay unto you what things ſoever ye deſire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them and ye ſhall have them."</p>
            <p>Now it is not at all more difficult to conceive that a man will go to heaven by believing he ſhall go there, than to remove a mountain by believing he can do it. But he can believe neither the one nor the other without a good reaſon for it. A man at the beginning of his faith does not believe he ſhall go to heaven; but when the Lord gives him the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeals him with his ſpirit as the earneſt of his inheritance, he then has a good and ſubſtantial reaſon, to believe that he ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And by the hopes of glory he is made fit for glory. "Beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, (we) are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord." II. Cor. III. 18. And the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle John ſays "now we are the ſons of God? and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be: but
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032050_0021_0FF10818700DD970"/>
we know that when he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is." By beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, i. e. as I apprehend it, beholding now by faith, we are changed in ſome degree, ſo as to behold him hereafter without fear, but when the time comes that he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him or compleatly changed becauſe we ſhall ſee him as he is, i. e. face to face. This I think St Peter alludes to when he ſays, "Hope to the end for the ſalvation that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt." For then ſaith will be ſwallowed up in viſion. "Now we ſee through a glaſs darkly; but then face to face." So then we may ſay, let a man believe that he ſhall go to heaven and continue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, he will aſſuredly go there. St. Paul ſays the ſame thing to the Coloſſians "You that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in the body of his fleſh thro' death, to preſent you holy and unblameable and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable in his fight; if ye continue in the faith grounded and ſettled and be not moved away from the hope of the goſpel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a miniſter." Colos. I. 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the LVth chapter of Iſaiah it is written "Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye buy wine and milk without money and without
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032050_0022_0FF1081BADBEBD38"/>
price. Wherefore do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your ſoul delight itſelf in fatneſs. Incline your ear and come unto me: hear, and your ſoul ſhall live: and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David."</p>
            <p>This I apprehend is a figurative expoſtulation with ſuch as hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhewing them a ſhorter way to be filled than by labouring and toiling as they do in the painful works of the law, or thinking to attain to righteouſneſs by what they can do. As the apoſtle writes concerning the Gentiles and Jews. "The Gentiles, ſaith he, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not after righteouſneſs have attained to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, even the righteouſneſs which is of faith; but Iſrael, which followed after the law of righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the law of righteouſneſs. Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone." He ſaid a little before "a ſhort work will the Lord make upon the earth" And this is a ſhort work to attain to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by faith, inſtead of labouring for that which ſatisfieth not: and therefore the expoſtulation in Iſaiah about labouring in vain, concludes with this advice. Incline your ear and come unto me, hear and your ſoul ſhall live: i. e. hearken diligently to the word of God; get knowledge;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032050_0023_0FF1081DF9CAA998"/>
hear the glad tidings of the goſpel, and your foul ſhall live; and the Lord will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant with you; his covenant of peace; the ſame that he promiſed to make with the houſe of Iſrael—"I will put my laws in their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people. And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord: for all ſhall know me from the leaſt to the greateſt. For I will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to their unrighteouſneſs and their ſins and iniquities will I remember no more." For when the Lord ſends his love into their hearts, this love blots out their ſins, and they alſo know him according to the promiſe; for God is love, and "he that loveth is born of God, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God." I. John IV. And this is the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that is promiſed to the Jews when they ſhall be gathered out of all lands. "I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good: but I will put my fear in their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me."</p>
            <p>A promiſe is alſo made to thoſe who continue in the faith that they ſhall be ſet free. In John the 8th chap. 31 v. &amp;c. "Then ſaid Jeſus to thoſe Jews which believed on him, if ye continue in my word, then are ye my diſciples indeed, and ye ſhall know the truth and the truth ſhall make you free." It is plain from the following words that he meant a freedom from ſin, and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032050_0024_0FF108205BF72630"/>
this freedom from ſin is obtained by a deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the law: It is not only from the law that we have the knowledge of ſin; but ſin has its power from the law. "The ſtrength of ſin is the law." When a man is delivered from the law he is delivered from the power of ſin: as the apoſtle writes to the Romans. "Sin ſhall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law but under grace." Therefore it is through knowledge that we become delivered and that in our own apprehenſion. We conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law as having nothing to do with us, no more than if a law had never been made, which could have brought us under condemnation; though it remains as a rule of life, that by it we may regulate our conduct ſo as to pleaſe God our Father. And by this we ſee how the knowledge of the truth can ſet us free: and St. Paul in a very particular manner attributes that freedom from ſin which the Roman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts enjoyed, to their having obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered them, or as ſome reader it, into the mould of which they were caſt or delivered. When a man is ſet free from the law he ſerves God as a ſon, and not as a ſervant, as our Lord ſaid upon the occaſion, "If the ſon ſhall make you free you ſhall be free indeed."</p>
            <p>Again, We may conſider faith as owing to a certain degree of humility. As a proof of this we often ſee it follow great convictions for ſin which humble men much. The jailor, who
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032050_0025_0FF10822B375F728"/>
ſpake the words of the text, we may ſuppoſe to be much humbled by the earthquake; and that it diſpoſed him the more readily to hear the words of St. Paul which brought him to receive bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to believe in God and rejoice in him. We find too that charity which is the higheſt attainment, believeth all things, hopeth all things, as well as endureth all things.</p>
            <p>Add to this, thoſe who are ſtrong in faith are ſaid to give glory to God: and that without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him, inſomuch that the heavy wrath of God came on Iſrael becauſe they believed not in God and put not their truſt in his help; whereas Enoch by faith was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death; and all thoſe worthies we read of, and of whom the world was not worthy, obtained a good report through faith, though they received not the promiſe. From this we judge that faith is no trifling thing; and from all that has been ſaid to eſtabliſh this doctrine we may conclude, that to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required under the Goſpel Covenant; and that there is no other way, as "there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we muſt be ſaved." <hi>Acts,</hi> IV. 12 <hi>v.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now to anſwer ſome objections.</p>
            <p>Obj. 1ſt. The maintainers of a ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or the neceſſity of works joined to faith to make out the conditions of our acceptance, have in the courſe of time been driven from a former
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032050_0026_0FF1082498ADDF00"/>
hold which they maintained, and have ſince ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſhelter in another.</p>
            <p>They have been made to ſee that a man is not juſtified by the deeds of the law. This has been made ſo evident to them, that they now acknowledge that by faith alone a man is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and brought into a ſtate of ſalvation; but that hereafter he will be juſtified by his works. By this ſubterfuge they hope to reconcile St. Paul and St. James—The former they ſuppoſe ſpeaks of our firſt juſtification, the latter of our ſecond at the day of judgment. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily for them, St. Paul almoſt conſtantly ſpeaks of juſtification by faith in the fight of God—of that juſtification which we muſt have when we appear before him.</p>
            <p>They quite reverſe the matter. Abraham was juſtified by works, ſays St. Paul, or if he was juſtified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before God. Though he were juſtified here, yet before God, or in his ſight, he could not by his obedience, becauſe no obedience not abſolutely perfect can ſtand before the abſolute purity of God.</p>
            <p>"By the deeds of the law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified, in his ſight: for by the law is the knowledge of ſin." <hi>Rom. III.</hi> 20 <hi>v.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 3d of <hi>Galatians</hi> the ſame apoſtle writes, "that no man is juſtified by the law in the ſight of God, it is evident, for the juſt ſhall live by faith." "If there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteouſneſs
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032050_0027_0FF108266D5C6570"/>
ſhould have been by the law. But the ſcripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe."</p>
            <p>The inheritance was promiſed to Abraham and to his ſeed—that is to Chriſt, and all that are his. All that are of Faith are the children of Abraham. If they become united to Chriſt by faith or Abraham's children by faith, why ſhould the badge of their ſonſhip be altered? Why ſhould not the ſame faith which conſtituted them children continue them ſuch? To ſay that they are now by faith tranſlated into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, but that after they are put into the kingdom other terms are impoſed is quite fanciful, for it has no foundation in ſcripture.</p>
            <p>"If the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promiſe, but God gave it to Abraham by promiſe." What are the children to do? Why like their father to live by the promiſes, be perſuaded of them and embrace them, and then the promiſe will have effect in purifying their hearts, otherwiſe not. For the apoſtle ſays, if they which be of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promiſe of none effect. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his reaſoning I ſhould judge that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as a man looked to his obedience for his acceptance in the ſame proportion would his faith be made void, and the promiſe of none effect: and this muſt be the caſe of thoſe who look for acceptance on account of their good works at the day of judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:032050_0028_0FF1082969E7EF90"/>The apoſtle ſays further, as the law worketh wrath—"therefore it is of faith, meaning the inheritance, that it might be by grace; to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed: not to that only which is of the law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all." The promiſe will be ſure to all believers both among Jews and Gentiles— and if the inheritance is firſt promiſed to faith is it not ſtrange that it ſhould be changed to ſomething elſe; when it is declared that it is of Faith that it might be by grace, and elſewhere to be of grace and not of works leſt any man ſhould boaſt—and elſewhere it is ſaid that "to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt." Which the Lord will not allow of, becauſe he wills men to love him and be happy—and to love him by receiving Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a free gift.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if St. Paul had any idea of a ſecond juſtification by works, could he have concluded his life with this declaration? "I am now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight I have finiſhed my courſe. I have kept the faith. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is laid up for me a crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that day: and not to me only but to all them that love his appearing." He reſts all his hope upon his having kept the faith.</p>
            <p>St. Ignatius in his epiſtle to the Epheſians has a very bold expreſſion, "my ſoul be the ſurely
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032050_0029_0FF1082CCFC0B700"/>
of all them that truſt in the Croſs," which he could not have uſed if he had thought any other condition neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But the epiſtle of St. James is reckoned to afford a ſtrong argument in favor of juſtification by works; at leaſt in the day of judgment: which it becomes neceſſary to conſider.</p>
            <p>St. James aſks, "what doth it profit, my brethren, though a man ſay he hath faith, and have not works? can faith ſave him?" And a little further he ſays—"Even ſo faith, if it hath not works is dead, being alone." This is not denied. It is not contended that a faith which doth not produce works will avail any thing.</p>
            <p>But the apoſtle goes on to declare, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham was juſtified by works when he offered up his ſon—and that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect: And that the ſcripture was fulfilled which ſaith, Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs—and adds, "ye ſee then how that by works a man is juſtified, and not by faith only."—And at the end of the chapter obſerves, "as the body without the ſpirit is dead, ſo faith without works is dead alſo." And this ſeems to be the concluſion of his reaſoning, that faith without works is dead, which is not denied, it being a living faith producing works which is contended for.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay that the apoſtle meant that the works of Abraham and of Rahab were a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032050_0030_0FF1082F19816758"/>
of their faith in the eyes of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe were ſecret tranſactions, but that his meaning was as he ſays, that Abraham's faith was made perfect by works, and that his works were a confirmation that he was a believer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thereby fulfilled the ſcripture which declared him to be one. This is giving faith its due preeminence. Then when he adds, "ye ſee then how that by works a man is juſtified; and not by faith only," I ſuppoſe him to mean, conſiſtently with what he had ſaid, that as works ſtrengthen faith they tend to our juſtification. This may be illuſtrated thus. A man being alive is enabled to eat, and eating continues life or enables him to live. So faith being alive produces works, and works keep faith alive. Yet life is the principle by which a man can ſee his friend and enjoy his company, not his eating which is only a ſecondary help. In like manner it is faith which enables a man to ſee God with Joy; and his works only ſtrengthen and confirm his faith. For where there is no opportunity of performing good works as in the caſe of the thief on the croſs, there faith without works is ſufficient, and makes it evident that faith is the eſſential thing, For ſalvation depends upon a man's being in ſuch a ſtate or diſpoſition, as to be able to bear the glory of God. Faith and love conſtitute his ſtate, firſt faith, followed by love, as good works ſtrengthen faith, then they tend to bring as into a ſtate of juſtification in our own mind,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032050_0031_0FF108325E2E45C8"/>
or ſuch a ſtate of faith and love as will enable us to ſtand before God without confuſion, and to love him.</p>
            <p>But if a right faith muſt have good works where is the uſe of contending in this manner? It is very uſeful, and highly proper to clear the truth of thoſe difficulties with which it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed; becauſe a man is naturally diſpoſed to look to his own endeavors for acceptance; even thoſe who know better are prone to it; and every look or thought of that kind tends to make void faith and render the promiſe of none effect.</p>
            <p>On the other hand when we conſider that nothing we can do will give us any title to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but that when we have done all we are yet unprofitable ſervants, then we ſhall be more diſpoſed to humility, truſt in the mercy of God, and rely upon his promiſes.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. But it is ſaid, every man ſhall be rewarded according to his works.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. So they will. Believers will be rewarded in proportion to their works, and unbelievers will be rewarded—puniſhed, in proportion to theirs. "Say ye to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it ſhall be well with him: for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings. Wo unto the wicked! it ſhall be ill with him: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his hands ſhall be given him." <hi>Iſaiah III.</hi> 10 &amp; 11 <hi>v.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, our Lord told the Jews that if they were the children of Abraham they would do
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032050_0032_0FF10835591ED8E0"/>
the works of Abraham and as this is the caſe that true believers will do the works of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, when two qualities appertain to the ſame people, the promiſes may be made indifferently to either; or bleſſings be annexed to both; as where it is ſaid; "There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit." <hi>Rom. VIII.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again it is ſaid, that St. Paul writes to Timothy—"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to diſtribute, willing to communicate; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life." Now as there is no laying hold of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life but by faith, and it is allowed that good works help us ſo to do, there is no force in this objection.</p>
            <p>That ſalvation is not granted to good works we may judge alſo from this reaſon.</p>
            <p>Good works are only ſigns or indications of goodneſs. It is goodneſs not works which meet with the reward of heaven. Then a man if he have goodneſs of heart, or love will be happy without performing any good works if he dies without having an opportunity, which is commonly allowed upon this account; becauſe God foreſees what he would do if he had lived, and takes the will for the deed. They who thus
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032050_0033_0FF10837C08A84F0"/>
argue ſtill go upon the ſuppoſition that good works will obtain the reward; whereas the truth is, it is the diſpoſition of heart, and not the outward indications of it that will meet with a reward, and that of courſe, tho commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed as if done by a ſpecial donation.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. As I have mentioned that Chriſt died for all men as a reaſon why all men might truſt in him, beſides his being generally offered as a ſavior, which ſome believe who do not allow the former, I muſt anſwer an objection to it.</p>
            <p>I have been told that St. Auguſtine believed that be died for all men till he conſidered that faith is the gift of God, which kind of reaſoning ought not to be oppoſed to plain declarations of ſcripture. The chief argument of the objectors I mean is this.</p>
            <p>As all men are not ſaved, Chriſt did not die for all men, for if he died for all men, all would be ſaved.</p>
            <p>But in anſwer to this it may be obſerved, that the death of Chriſt does not of itſelf quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy any man for ſalvation, or make him meet for heaven. It does not qualify one of the elect, becauſe it makes no alteration in the heart. Salvation is wrought in the heart through a faith in the atonement, and a truſt in God's mercy in conſequence of it. Therefore this objection ſhould not hinder us from yielding to poſitive aſſertions, which ought not to be bent to preconceived opinions.</p>
            <p>St. Paul writes to Timothy, that God "will
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032050_0034_0FF10839D1153AE0"/>
have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus; who gave himſelf a ranſom for all to be teſtified in due time." Again St. Peter ſpeaks of falſe teachers who ſhall privily bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." Both theſe paſſages are very plain: the one ſhewing in expreſsterms that God is willing that all men ſhould be ſaved; and that there is one mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all" —the other, that ſome will bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſwift deſtruction, denying the Lord that bought them. Now though it ſhould be ſaid that a ranſom for all does not mean all men, but only all the elect, which ſeems to be a poor ſhift, this cannot be applied nor evaded with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe who deny the Lord that bought them, and bring deſtruction on themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they ſhould ſay that the Lord bought them without dying for them, or that deſtruction does not hinder their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt dying for all men does not hinder thoſe who reject him as a ſavior from falling under a ſin of unbelief. As faith is the condition of the goſpel covenant, ſo unbelief is the peculiar ſin againſt it; and a horrible ſin it is to make God a liar, in not believing the record which he gave of his ſon It is therefore, I ſuppoſe, that the "goſpel of the kingdom
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032050_0035_0FF1083EC56C6998"/>
ſhall be preached in all the world for a witneſs to all nations," before the end of the world. St. Peter alſo informs us why the goſpel was preached to them alſo that are dead —namely that they might be judged according to men in the fleſh, but live according to God in the ſpirit," i. e. that theſe departed ſpirits, might be judged like men living in the fleſh, tho' as ſpirits they are alive like God, who is a ſpirit. For he had juſt before told us that Chriſt after his death preached to the Antede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luvian ſpirits that lived in the days of Noah; and this is the reaſon given for it, that they might be judged like men living in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon why Chriſt died for all men is this. All men will be raiſed from the dead by virtue of this atonement. "For as in Adam all die ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive." As they will be raiſed at the laſt day whether they believe or not, ſo did he die for them whether they believe or no, but thoſe who believe in his death now may have a good ground to truſt in his mercy, and look for ſalvation through him; thro' the divine influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty, and communicated from time to time as he ſhall think fit; whilſt his death cannot ſcreen from wrath thoſe who believe not in it, becauſe God in glory will be a conſuming fire to unbelievers, and at the ſame time the hope and conſolation of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>But we may yet conſider Chriſt as a general ſavior—that he offered himſelf as a general
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032050_0036_0FF108408BB89858"/>
ſacrifice for ſin; that whoſoever will, may lay hold on him as a propitiation, and look to him for ſalvation; juſt as if a fountain was opened near a town for general uſe, that whoſoever will may take of the water freely. In this caſe he died as much for one man as another, though his death with reſpect to ſalvation becomes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual only to ſuch as apply it to themſelves. Still here is good ground for every man, not only to believe the hiſtorical facts concerning him, but alſo to truſt in him. Whereas when his death is conſidered only as intended for the elect, I cannot conceive upon what ground any man can believe in him otherwiſe than that he came to ſave the elect. How then can any man believe in him for ſalvation? For though faith is the gift of God, yet he tells no man that he is one of the adopted till after he is a believer. "Ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus." and "becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his ſon into your hearts, crying Abba, Father." And if "the ſpirit itſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God," then we are children before we receive that teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. If no man receives the ſpirit of adoption till after he is a believer, how can he with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety wait for any ſuch token before he can venture to truſt in Chriſt? or how can he do it unleſs he receives him generally as a ſavior, who died for one man as well as another. It is probably owing to this, that ſome get a hope,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032050_0037_0FF10842596CC618"/>
from a text of ſcripture applied to their minds, that they are one of the number for whom Chriſt died; which hope they loſe after a while and then they are to ſeek again for ſome other ſign.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Hervey and his friends place this matter on a much ſurer footing. They conſider the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as offered generally as a ſavior; and as all where the goſpel comes are invited to receive him as ſuch, they all have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to do ſo, inſomuch that they will be condemned if they do not.</p>
            <p>If the goſpel is to be preached in all the world as a witneſs to all nations, and all thoſe, who, having an opportunity of hearing it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Lord Jeſus as a ſavior, will be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for rejecting him, this is a proof that he died equally for all. And though none can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve effectually but by the power of God; and though it ſhould be the caſe, that this power is not exerted but in behalf of a certain number, yet thoſe who reject Chriſt as a ſavior will juſtly fall under condemnation, becauſe ſalvation is open to all; and there is no hindrance on the part of the Lord? the hindrance being only owing to Satan, who blinds their underſtanding: And their rejecting the goſpel is a proof that they are under his power. Therefore the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation can be as well conſidered as coming upon them, as that the Lord ſhould ſwear in his wrath, that the Jews ſhould not enter into his reſt becauſe they had erred in their hearts and had not known his ways. It
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032050_0038_0FF108443536B9F8"/>
is for this reaſon the goſpel will become a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt them. But it could be no witneſ againſt them, if Chriſt did not die as well ſo them as for others,</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude with a few exhortations.</p>
            <p>As Salvation is a matter of ſuch great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it becomes every man to examine himſelf whether he be in a good way; therefore according to St. Paul's advice to the Corinthians it would be proper to examine "yourſelves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your ownſelves; know ye not your ownſelves how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except you be reprobates," or diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as rendered by ſome? Abiding in the faith is alſo neceſſary. No time is limited we muſt abide in order to bear fruit. Our Lord ſaid, "as the Branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me." For ſome believe only for a while and in time of temptation fall away; whilſt the word in others is "choked with cares and riches and pleaſures of this life, and brings to fruit to perfection. How neceſſary is it then to examine yourſelves whether ye be in the faith. This is to be done by comparing your ſtate and conduct by the word of God. For every man attentive to ſalvation may under divine teaching know his ſtate from the holy ſcriptures. The works of the fleſh and the fruit of the ſpirit are there deſcribed. The fruit of the ſpirit is love, joy, peace, longſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance; and all theſe are
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032050_0039_0FF108479FB727E8"/>
the conſequence of believing and continuing to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To live under a known and habitual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence in ſin is without queſtion not to be in a good ſtate. But as ſome indulge themſelves in faſhionable exceſſes and think no harm of it, and be in error thro' ignorance, it is proper to remind them, that there are three great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the devil, the world, and the fleſh, and it is no great matter which a man is enſlaved to in reſpect to ſalvation, as either will exclude from heaven if perſiſted in. If many did not deceive themſelves and one another, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could conceive that a man could ſerve God and mammon at the ſame time. It is true it depends upon how much the heart is affected by the things of the world. God has given us all things to enjoy in moderation, but when the heart is drawn from him, whether it be by idols of gold or ſilver, toys or pleaſures it ſhould be a proof to us that we are not ſpiritually minded, which is called life and peace. Worldly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs then is alſo a bad ſign. "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, and the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life is not of the Father, but is of the world." I. John. II. 15. &amp; 16. v. Altho' it is not a determinate thing how far a man may be attached to the world with ſafety, as all men have concerns in it, yet each man
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032050_0040_0FF108492E6BCDE8"/>
by attention may examine how far his thoughts are weaned from the right object; and ſo far the injunction will be a rule to examine himſelf by. On the other hand we are told that we know we are paſſed from death into life if we love the brethren. This rule is but little attended to, becauſe few think much of the profeſſed fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, becauſe of prejudices on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the walk of ſome who make ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Many do not conſider that ſome only believe for a while, and the faults of others are enlarged upon they being more narrowly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their neighbours, who have been awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome meaſure by their converſions, and are rather glad of an excuſe to trouble themſelves no more about ſuch things but to go on in the old way of being ſaved if they are as good as others.</p>
            <p>A diſpoſition to prayer is alſo a ſign of being in the faith; heavenly mindedneſs and prayer being great indications of ſpiritual life.</p>
            <p>Fatherly chaſtiſements for your faults is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mark, "for whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth." And if you are ſons and have any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in religion you will very ſenſibly feel the force of this truth.</p>
            <p>And if you have abided, you will preceive the fruts of the ſpirit, producing a conduct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to them.</p>
            <p>But if after examination you find that you have no well grounded truſt in the Lord, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032050_0041_0FF1084BE00C6438"/>
no fruits anſwerable to it, you ſhould try, by humiliation and prayer, and diligent applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to get your mind informed and get that knowledge which will enable you to caſt your whole dependance upon that almighty Savior who came down from heaven for us men and for our ſalvation. And when you truſt in the Lord you will come to ſee, becauſe the Lord will teach you, if ye continue long enough to learn, that you have nothing to do with the law but as a rule of life, whereby you will be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and chaſtened as ſons, that you may not be condemned with the world. You will know what it is to be alive unto God, and will expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the truth of that ſaying in the Pſalms, "I will run in the way of thy comandments when thou haſt ſet my heart at liberty."</p>
            <p>On the contrary, if you fall back to the law, by not taking heed to the things which you have heard, and by not continuing in the doctrine of Chriſt, you will find deadneſs in all your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,—that you "build again the things which you deſtroyed, and make yourſelf a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, (Galatians) and that Chriſt will profit you nothing becauſe you are fallen from grace."</p>
            <p>May the Lord give you a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things!</p>

            <p>MR. LOCKE does not ſeem fully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs St. Paul's meaning in ſome material points. For in many places where there is a ſeeming inconſiſtency in the apoſtle, there is alſo an appearance of the like inconſiſtency in Mr. Locke. This is obſervable with regard to the great point which has been much canvaſſed in the world—whether our ſalvation is to be obtained by works or by faith. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the expoſition in each place ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear juſt, yet if the ſeeming inconſiſtency is not removed, the enquirer after truth is not ſatisfied with it, nor can he be in ſuch caſe, as long as he is perſuaded that there is no real, but only an apparent inconſiſtency in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine writings.</p>

And in his notes upon the ſame chapter he ſays, that the bleſſing—juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation—righteouſneſs—life—inheritance—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the children of God, therein mentioned, are in effect all the ſame thing on one ſide; and the curſe, v. 13th. the direct contrary on the other ſide; and alſo that the bleſſing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Abraham and his ſeed was wholly upon the account of faith. Indeed this point he is ſo clear in, that there can be no doubt of his opinion about it: for he does not ſuppoſe with ſome, that the apoſtle meant only the Jewiſh law, when he ſaid by the deeds thereof there ſhould no fleſh be juſtified; but that his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that men could be juſtified by no law whatever—becauſe every one failing of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act conformity of his actions to the immutable rectitude of the eternal rule of right, will be found unrighteous. Again, upon Epheſians, he ſays, "The apoſtle gives ſuch a draught as in every part of it ſhews, that in the Kingdom of Chriſt they are ſet far above the Moſaical rites, and enjoy the ſpiritual and incomprehenſible benefits of it, not by the tenure of a few out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremonies, but by their faith alone in
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032050_0044_0FF108556ED8A530"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, to whom they are united, and of whom they are members."</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe and ſuch like expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſignifying that it is by faith and not by works of any kind that we are juſtified; yet in other places he aſſerts, and that as the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's meaning, that it is faith and a ſincere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience joined that will procure us everlaſting life. For inſtance on the 7th of Romans, ſpeaking of thoſe under the law, he ſays "their endeavors after obedience delivered them not from that death which their bodies or carnal appetites running them into tranſgreſſions brought upon them. That deliverance was to be had from grace, by which thoſe putting themſelves from under the law into the goſpel ſtate were accepted, if with the bent of their minds they ſincerely endeavoured to ſerve and obey the law of God, though ſometimes thro' the frailty of the fleſh they fell into ſin." A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, "Converts to chriſtianity are free from condemnation, if they perform what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them."</p>
            <p>Now in order to reconcile theſe contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he ſuppoſes, that a man before he is brought into a ſtate of grace, is in a ſtate of death: that he is then as inſenſible to ſpiritual things, as a dead man, and that he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to recover himſelf—that his being reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is altogether of grace, and that it is by faith alone;—But when a man is reſtored to a ſtate of grace, or life, or ſalvation, which are
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032050_0045_0FF10856FA2EFD30"/>
ſaid to ſignify one and the ſame thing, then in order to obtain eternal life hereafter or the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, he muſt yield a ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which the following quotations may ſerve to evince.</p>
            <p>"It is the favor of God alone through Jeſus Chriſt that delivers frail man from death. Thoſe under grace obtain life upon ſincere intentions and endeavors after obedience, and thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors a man may attain to in this ſtate of frailty. But good intentions and ſincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors are of no behoof againſt death to thoſe under the law, which requires compleat and perfect obedience, but gives no ability to attain it. And ſo it is grace alone through Jeſus Chriſt that aceepting what frail man can do, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers from the body of death." Again, "Theſe two conſiderations of the kingdom of heaven ſome men have confounded and made one; ſo that a man being brought into the firſt of theſe wholly by grace without works, ſaith being all that was required to inſtate a man in it, they have concluded that for the attaining eternal life, or the kingdom of God in the world to come, faith alone and not good works are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, contrary to expreſs words of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the whole tenor of the goſpel: But yet not being admitted into that ſtate of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life for our good works, it is by grace here too that we are ſaved, our righteouſneſs after all being imperfect, and we by our ſins liable to condemnation and death: But it is by grace
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032050_0046_0FF1085A39A14008"/>
we are made partakers of both theſe kingdoms; it is only into the kingdom of God in this world we are admitted by faith alone without works, but for our admittance into the other, both faith and obedience, in a ſincere endeavor to perform thoſe duties, all thoſe good works; which are incumbent on us, and come in our way to be performed by us from the time of our believing till our death."</p>
            <p>Theſe ſhew Mr. Locke's opinion very clearly, and the ideas he had of this matter; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are anſwerable to what the apoſtle had on this ſubject may be much diſputed.</p>
            <p>If bleſſing, juſtification, righteouſneſs, life, inheritance mean the ſame thing, and mean as he ſays, the thing promiſed to Abraham and his ſeed, ſometimes called bleſſing, ſometimes inheritance &amp;c. and a man partakes of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſolely by faith without works, then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his idea of the two ſtates, the being admitted into the firſt ſtate was all that the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meant by receiving the bleſſing and partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the inheritance promiſed to Abraham. It was only an admiſſion into an eaſier covenant, ſuch as Beveridge compares to a court of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery with reſpect to a court of Common law. So that the matter as far as it reſpects Mr. Locke's argument will depend upon what this inheritance is; for if it means only that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtate of grace, which believers are now pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in as preparatory to the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, all the arguments drawn from the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions about juſtification by faith, are of no
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032050_0047_0FF1085D3AC764D0"/>
force when applied to the ſtate of glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>With deference to the opinion of that great man, I would ſuppoſe, that the kingdom of Chriſt was begun in this world and continued on to the other: and that obtaining an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in him was being tranſlated into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that as chriſtians are now bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt, they in him receive the bleſſing promiſed to Abraham, In thy ſeed ſhall all nations of the earth be bleſſed: that when they are now raiſed up and made to ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, they are created in him unto good works; and that being joined to him in one ſpirit they are inſtated in this inheritance, as the ſealing of the holy ſpirit is the earneſt thereof; and that men in this world are poſſeſſed of eternal life, and paſs from death unto life, according to our Savior's words.</p>
            <p>So far this ſeems to be St. Paul's meaning with reſpect to the inheritance; but not that they were different kingdoms, the admiſſion into which was upon different terms: for all who ſhall be found of this kingdom will meet with the happineſs annexed to it hereafter.</p>
            <p>Can we ſuppoſe that Abraham when he was juſtified was admitted into an eaſier covenant, that required a leſs perfect obedience than he was in before? and if we do not ſuppoſe it with reſpect to him why ſhould we in reſpect to his offspring? God gave him the inheritance by promiſe: and he and his ſeed are the heirs to
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032050_0048_0FF1085F74130A18"/>
it. He was made the father of all that believe, "And all that are of faith are the children of Abraham. Here is one and the ſame inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance promiſed to Abraham, and to his ſeed, then all that is neceſſary in order to become heirs to it, is to become children of Abraham; and whatever the term believer may ſignify, believers undoubtedly are the true heirs. For which reaſon we ſhould ſtick by this truth, and make it a rule when we get upon ſure ground there to keep footing: otherwiſe ſome ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary ſcripture will inſenſibly puſh us from it. This has been often obſerved. Therefore let <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> adhere to this truth that believers are the true heirs to the inheritance promiſed unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</p>
            <p>But an admiſſion into this kingdom is not only by faith, but the privileges, as well as the future benefits annexed to it, are alſo deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from faith. The ſame apoſtle writes thus to the Coloſſians, You that were ſometimes alienated, and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death, to preſent you holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in his light; if ye continue in the faith grounded and ſettled and be not moved away from the hope of the goſpel, which ye have heard &amp;c." In like manner he ſays to the Hebrews, "we are made partakers of Chriſt if we hold faſt the beginning of our confidence, ſtedfaſt unto the end." If believers are now tranſlated into the kingdom of Chriſt, and if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032050_0049_0FF10861C8878860"/>
in the faith, will be preſented holy, and unblameable and unreproveable. It ſhows that it is either one and the ſame kingdom, or that the terms or way of admiſſion are the ſame, i.e. by becoming and remaining believers.</p>
            <p>But to proceed—Mr. Locke in one of his notes on the 2d of Romans ſays, "we ſee by the doctrine of St. Paul and the new teſtament, there is one and the ſame rule of rectitude ſet to the actions of all mankind, Jews, Gentiles, and Chriſtians, and that failing of a compleat obedience to it in every tittle, makes a man unrighteous, the conſequence whereof is death." Again, "Every one failing of an exact confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his actions to the immutable rectitude of that eternal rule of right, will be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, and ſo incur the penalty of that law." And yet he ſuppoſes, that God diſpenſes with the exact performance of this eternal rule; and that he accepts of a leſs perfect obedience as more ſuitable to the frailty of men: and that the merits of Chriſt are the foundation of this change, ſo that thoſe who came under this mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er covenant by faith, are not under the law, but under grace. This I judge to be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But we no where find that God accepts of a leſs perfect obedience. He may pardon ſin, and yet require compleat obedience; an immutable eternal rule muſt forever remain unchangeable. Chriſt died to pay the penalty of this law, of this eternal law, but not that the rigor of it ſhould be abated afterwards. It does not ſeem conſiſtent with the wiſdom of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032050_0050_0FF1086362C69A68"/>
God's government that an obedience to him ſhould in any inſtance be diſpenſed with. As governor of the univerſe he has a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat obedience, and cannot conſiſtently with that order neceſſary to be preſerved admit of deviations from it: neither can we conceive how any line can be drawn to diſtinguiſh how far theſe deviations may be allowed, ſo as to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the creature: For though God may define it, yet man cannot, and therefore he muſt be uncertain of his fate. But we can conceive how God can be reconciled to men conſiſtently with his juſtice. When a perfect atonement has been made for ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we readily ſee how the penalty of the law has been paid, &amp; how our offended crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor can love us freely. Then there is no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for introducing this doctrine of ſincere obedience. For ſinners being, reinſtated by faith, whenever they tranſgreſs there is the ſame atonement to fly to: Chriſt is ſtill the propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or mercy ſeat; by faith in whom they can be healed as well as they could at firſt be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So that this eternal rule of right may ſtill remain as inflexible as ever in its demands. If a ſincere obedience is believed as acceptable, it is likely to cauſe men either to be in doubt of their ſtate; or elſe to think they are good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ſo keep them from looking to the mercy ſeat of Chriſt. Whereas he who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not his ſincere obedience, but what the law requires, will be more apt to look to the mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and by ſo doing to yield a more perfect obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:032050_0051_0FF108663948D738"/>This doctrine of being accepted by thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to pleaſe God, is no where plainly declared in ſcripture. It is only from deductions taken up. Then we will next conſider the VIth chapter of Romans, from whence it would ſeem that Mr. Locke was induced to embrace it, in order to reconcile the doctrine there with what he had ſo ſtrongly enforced of juſtification by faith alone; for his comments are otherwiſe ſeemingly irreconcileable.</p>
            <p>The ſcope of this chapter ſeems to be this; to ſhow to the diſciples the conſequence that would follow their yielding themſelves to the ſervice of ſin; namely that it would produce death. He had juſt before ſaid that the law entered that ſin might abound, but where ſin abounded grace did much more abound; therefore leſt any ſhould ſay, ſhall we ſin then that Grace may abound, he aſks, how ſhall we that are dead to ſin live any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger therein? he ſhews, that they were delivered from the ſervice of ſin. He conſiders ſin as a maſter to whom they had been ſubject—and obſerves that they were now delivered from that ſubjection—and that ſin ſhould not have dominion over them, becauſe they were not under the law but under grace. Yet from what he ſays it may be inferred that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the ſervice of their old maſter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he warne them againſt it, and tells them not to yield to ſin, but unto God as thoſe that are alive from the dead; and that if they do yield to ſin the wages he will give them is death; but that the gift of God is eternal life through
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032050_0052_0FF1086926AEADF0"/>
Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. This ſeems to be nearly the ſubſtance of the chapter. Now Mr. Locke ſeems to give this interpretation to the paſſage about ſin not having dominion over them— "If their obedience were to ſin, they were vaſſals of ſin, and would certainly receive the wages of that maſter, which was nothing but death: But if they obeyed righteouſneſs, i. e. ſincerely endeavored after righteousneſs, though they did not attain it, <hi>ſin ſhould not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them by death.</hi> i. e. <hi>ſhould not bring death upon them:</hi> Becauſe they were not under the law which condemned them to death for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tranſgreſſion; but under grace, which by faith in Jeſus Chriſt juſtified them to eternal life from their many tranſgreſſions." Again in his note on the 14th verſe. "The force of St. Paul's reaſoning here ſtands thus: You are obliged by your taking on you the profeſſion of the goſpel, not to be any longer ſlaves and vaſſals to ſin, nor to be under the ſway of your carnal luſts, but to yield yourſelves up to God to be his ſervants in a conſtant and ſincere purpoſe and endeavor of obeying him in all things; this if you do, ſin ſhall not be able to procure your death; for you Gentiles are not under the law which condemns to death for every the leaſt tranſgreſſion, though it be but a ſlip of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; but by your baptiſm are entered into the covenant of grace, and being under grace, God will accept of your ſincere endeavors in the place of exact obedience; and give you eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032050_0053_0FF1086C76617A70"/>
but if you, by a willing obedience to your luſts, make yourſelves vaſſals to ſin, ſin, as the Lord and maſter to whom you belong, will pay you <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith death, the only wages that ſin pays."</p>
            <p>From hence we ſee Mr. Locke is of opinion, that ſin not having dominion, over them means, that ſin ſhould not bring death upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every tranſgreſſion under grace was not puniſhed with death, but under the law it was. But it does not appear, that the being delivered from the dominion of ſin meant their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from death the conſequence of ſin, but their deliverance from their maſter ſin who gave death only as his wages. He repents it again and again, that the wages of ſin is death, and yet aſſerts that ſin not having dominion over them means, that ſin ſhall not procure their death as they yield to him in a few inſtances only, and do not give themſelves up entirely to his ſway. But the meaning I think is, that when they were under grace and not under the law, ſin loſes it's ſtrength, becauſe "the ſtrength of ſin is the law," and if they were delivered from the law and no longer under it, ſin loſes it's force, and conſequently has no more dominion over them; which it would have if they returned again to the law. Therefore the apoſtle in this chapter attributes their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to their having obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which he had delivered them; or into the mould of which they had been delivered or caſt, i. e. The doctrine of the goſpel which he taught them they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032050_0054_0FF1086E1C721EA8"/>
and it caſt them into that form of thought which overpowered ſin, and made them alive for the ſervice of God. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he tells the Galatians, that if they walked in the ſpirit, they ſhould not fulfil the luſt of the fleſh"—for this is being freed from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin. But it is ſaid, "If ye live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh ye ſhall die, but if ye through the ſpirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live." And this ſeems to imply that life will be given to thoſe that obey. But if we reflect a little we ſhall not find that to be the caſe; but that the meaning is, that if they mortify the deeds of the body they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> continue to live. For they were already alive; the expreſſion that they ſhall die if they live after the fleſh, denotes that they were alive, as well as the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. They were made alive by faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and it was neceſſary that they ſhould obey in order to continue ſo: for if they again yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves "ſervants to ſin, his ſervants they were to whom they obeyed whether of ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs." We muſt remember that believers are the heirs. They obtain the inheritance and keep it by faith; and as good works are enjoined as neceſſary to their future happineſs, the eaſieſt way to ſolve this difficulty is to ſuppoſe, that a certain degree of obedience is neceſſary to preſerve their faith. If this can be allowed all the difficulty will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. For a proof of it we may refer to what the apoſtle writes to the Hebrews. "Take heed Brethren leſt there be in any of you an evil
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032050_0055_0FF1086FD5531F28"/>
heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily while it is called, to day leſt any of you be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin. For we are made partakers of Chriſt if we hold the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our confidence ſtedfaſt unto the end."</p>
            <p>This ſhews that ſin hardens the heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces unbelief. The apoſtle alſo adviſing Timothy about holding faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, adds, "which ſome having put away, concerning faith have made ſhipwreck;" which further proves that without obedience there is no continuance in the faith; and it is conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what has been already mentioned, that ſin will produce death; and it does ſo by deſtroying that faith by which life is preſerved. And that obedience will confirm our faith St. James aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us when he ſays, that Abraham's faith by works was made perfect." So that we may ſtill ſay that believers are the true heirs, and yet allow that good works are neceſſary to ſalvation, becauſe they ſtrengthen that faith that men muſt preſerve in order to partake of the fulneſs of the inheritance. This ſeems to be an eaſier way of reconciling the matter, than either by ſaying on the one hand, that faith in it's nature includes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical obedience, or on the other, that good works are not neceſſary to ſalvation, but are only uſeful, ornamental, and evidences of a true faith; or even to ſay with Mr. Locke, That faith alone inſtates a man in a way of ſalvation, and that a ſincere obedience joined with faith is the condition on which he is finally ſaved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032050_0056_0FF108736846E9C0"/>
it is more agreeable to the tenor of the Goſpel, which declares that chriſtians are not only by grace ſaved through faith, which is ſuppoſed to be the firſt ſtate they are brought into, but alſo that they are "kept by the power of God, thro' faith unto ſalvation;" and that if that which they had heard ſhould remain in them, they alſo ſhould continue in the ſon and in the father."</p>
            <p>Now tho' we could not define obedience ſo as to know when it was ſincere or not, yet we may conceive a certain degree of it to continue us in the faith, and that of courſe; or that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of deviation <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> moral rectitude might deſtroy our faith; and yet this to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from ſaying that ſincere obedience is the condition upon which eternal life is given. It is different in it's nature, and different in it's conſequences; becauſe a man who conſiders his future life to depend on his obedience is always under bondage, &amp; has not the freedom of a Son: whereas a ſon looks upon the inheritance as his own, and though he ſhould think it poſſible to be caſt off, yet as long as he finds in himſelf no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to revolt, he is under no fears about it. But the caſe is very different in him "who thro' fear of death is all his lifetime ſubject to bondage."</p>
            <p>When Mr. Locke mentions that "Adam's one ſin had brought death on the Gentiles, from which they were all reſtored by Chriſt's death, with addition of eternal bliſs and glory to all thoſe who believe in him;" how can he conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032050_0057_0FF108769B827718"/>
with this ſay elſewhere, that a ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was alſo a condition? For the expreſſion of eternal bliſs muſt relate, not to the ſtate of grace here, but to the ſtate of glory hereafter. But perhaps the word obey was omitted by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. But when he ſays that thoſe who rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God and his promiſes of grace and not upon their own performances, they are the children of Abraham who ſhall inherit; There it is plain he means the firſt ſtate of grace to which they were admitted by faith alone; for he had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the bleſſing promiſed to Abraham and to his ſeed was wholly upon the account of faith."</p>
            <p>And is it not aſtoniſhing th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine this inheritance to the ſtate of grace only in this life? St. Paul deſired to be found in Chriſt having the Righteouſneſs of God by faith—he does not mention it as a thing only to inſtate him in the favor of God, but as what he wiſhed to continue and be found in. And when he was about to be offered up what he ſeemed to rejoice in was that "he had fought a good fight—that he had kept the faith—that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there was laid up for him a crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous judge would give him at that day, and not to him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to all them that loved his appearing." And this we may readily ſuppoſe, becauſe ſuch as rely upon the promiſes of God being children of Abraham, would look for him and rejoice to ſee him.</p>
