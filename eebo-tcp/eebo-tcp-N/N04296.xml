            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IT is generally confeſſed, even by the moſt eminent</hi> European <hi>writers on commerce, that their money is a ſubject of a</hi> curious <hi>and</hi> very intricate <hi>nature; which, without any ſuch acknowledgment, the</hi> various <hi>and</hi> claſhing <hi>opinions they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced concerning it is a</hi> ſufficient <hi>proof of.</hi>

               <hi>The principles of paper-money may ſeem much harder to diſcover, were we to form a judgment of the difficulty from the</hi> numerous abſurdities <hi>publiſhed for and againſt it. If their bulk be not encreaſed by this little piece, the author will not think his time</hi> miſpent; <hi>tho' the matter contained in it has <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <head>A DISCOURSE CONCERNING PAPER MONEY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE rarity of ſilver and its beautiful colour were ſufficient before it became a medium of Trade, to procure it a price, even ſuppoſing it deſtitute of <hi>natural</hi> value; tho' ſuch a kind of worth is merely <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical,</hi> like that of diamonds, which is alſo derived from <hi>fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Silver is ſtill a commodity, as every thing bought and ſold is; but then it is alſo money, which gives it a rank above other wares exchanged by it.</p>
            <p>That commodity for which the reſt in the country are <hi>generally</hi> bought and ſold, is the currency or money of the country.</p>
            <p>The nummary denominations, and by which accounts are kept, throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> do all ſtand for certain quantities of ſilver, and none of 'em for gold: Therefore as all contracts, in that part of the world are made for the firſt, and not any for the ſecond, tho' they may be diſcharged by it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its <hi>varying</hi> rate; the former is the currency of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the latter is nothing more than a commodity.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi> tobacco being that for which all other commodities are <hi>generally</hi> exchanged, is the currency of theſe Provinces, as rice is, for a like reaſon, in <hi>South-Carolina;</hi> yet they are not ſo by the ſanction of law: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>probable</hi> that ſilver, being much better qualified than either of 'em for a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of commerce, roſe up to that dignity by its own proper force; for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that the ſeveral pieces, into which it is divided, receive at the mint, is of no other uſe than to aſcertain their reſpective quantites and fineneſs, in order to ſave the trouble of weighing and trying 'em on every occaſion.</p>
            <p>But bits of paper, however denominated, could never become a currency without the <hi>compulſive</hi> aid of the legiſlature; for, if all had been left <hi>at liberty</hi> to refuſe them, their nummary denominations could never have perſuaded any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give any thing for 'em.</p>
            <p>In the year 1722 the government of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> began to coin paper-money. The ſum of 15,000 l. was then ſtruck in bills of <hi>one</hi> ſhilling to <hi>twenty,</hi> which was lent out on land-ſecurity at five <hi>per cent.</hi> Thoſe bill the legiſlature decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005308_0004_1016FA9E7029C5E0"/>
equal to as much ſilver-money of <hi>America</hi> as their reſpective denominations ſignified. Had the law ſtopt here their value could not have roſe above waſte paper. But as they were alſo made according to their declared rates, a legal tender in diſcharge of the ſilver-contracts then ſubſiſting, they naturally became money:</p>
            <p>For debtors were <hi>willingly</hi> led to ſell their goods for 'em at the nominal value aſſigned by the legiſlature, <hi>knowing</hi> they could paſs 'em on the ſame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their creditors; whoſe intereſt it alſo became to ſupport the credit of the new coin, while they had any debts remaining unpaid in the old. Other tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as may well be ſuppoſed, were at firſt fearful to contract for this new ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of money; but finding it kept up its value, or (when they <hi>fancied</hi> it did not) that the advanced price on their goods ballanced the <hi>imaginary</hi> loſs, they were as eager to bargain for it as they were before for ſilver.</p>
            <p>Were it not for the confuſion which an alteration in the nummary denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that people have have been accuſtomed to count by, would produce in trade, thoſe paper bills might as well have been called and diſtinguiſhed by <hi>livres, ſols</hi> and <hi>deniers,</hi> or by any other terms of value, as by <hi>pounds, ſhillings</hi> and <hi>pence.</hi> The power with which they were reſpectively indued were alſo arbitrary; for the law could as eaſily have made one of them mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>five ſhillings</hi> paſs for <hi>five pounds,</hi> ſilver money of <hi>America,</hi> as it did for <hi>five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> of that coin. But the retaining of names, and the annexing to them differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ideas from what they uſually convey, amounts to an actual alteration of the names: It was therefore as neceſſary that the bills ſhould, <hi>at their firſt emiſſion,</hi> be endued with ſuch powers as <hi>generally</hi> accompanied their reſpective denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to give them the denominations by which the people <hi>generally</hi> counted.</p>
            <p>To fix the idea of paper-money it may be proper to ſhow wherein it differs from paper-credit. When credit is given for money, there is always a promiſe expreſſed or implied for the payment of it; if expreſſed, it is <hi>generally</hi> on paper; and from theſe circumſtances the latter kind of engagements where they are transferable by law or cuſtom, is called a paper-credit. But the paper-bills of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> as they do not promiſe money for <hi>any thing elſe,</hi> cannot be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the notion of paper-credit. They are <hi>actually</hi> money, and may as properly be termed paper-money from the material of which they are made, as ſilver-coin is ſo denominated from the metal. All aſſignable notes promiſing paper-coin are paper-credit on the ſame reaſon that notes promiſing ſilver-coin are ſo.</p>
            <p>Forasmuch as the law, by which the <hi>Maryland-</hi> bills were iſſued, <hi>inſures</hi> to the poſſeſſors, at <hi>certain</hi> periods, the quantity of ſilver expreſsed by them, they could only be regarded as paper-credit <hi>at their firſt emiſſion:</hi> But as they paſs at a much higher rate than the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of diſcount allow, they are at preſent to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a mixture of paper-money and paper-credit. This laſt ſupplies the place of caſh, and according to the extent of it, is of more or leſs advantage to a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where ſilver is the <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> medium of commerce; that being a currency which
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005308_0005_1016FA9FF7AA2328"/>
coſts <hi>extremely dear.</hi> But where paper-money is uſed, if there be a ſufficiency, the coſt of which is comparatively nothing, a paper-credit can be of little, if any ſervice at all.</p>
            <p>We return to the law whereby paper-bills were firſt introduced into <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> and obſerve that it gradually loſt its efficacy, as the ſilver-contracts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting at the time of paſſing it were paid off. The power of the bills would have ſunk in the ſame degree, were not the people obliged, thro' the want of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to uſe them as their medium of commerce. Now foraſmuch as they contract for 'em every day as they did before for ſilver, their worth is on as good a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as it was at their firſt emiſſion; for the preſent debtors are under as ſtrong a neceſſity of purchaſing 'em to diſengage their promiſes for that coin, as the former debtors were to diſcharge their contracts for ſilver-coin; and therefore their worth cannot fall while trade continues to furniſh 'em with an employment equal to what it now does, as it always will unleſs their quantity be <hi>raſhly</hi> encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or a better currency be introduced in their room, which ſeems morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: For even with reſpect to an independent government, which, by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prohibiting ſome and laying high duties on other kinds of foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, may <hi>generally</hi> have ſuch a quantity of ſilver as the trade of the country requires, for it may ſometimes have <hi>too much</hi> as well as too little; silver is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs a currency, not to inſiſt on the great coſt of it, much inferior to paper-money on ſeveral other <hi>important</hi> accounts; as will be demonſtrated in the ſequel. <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> muſt, except in a few trifling inſtances, pay ſilver for all the goods imported from <hi>England,</hi> and cannot impoſe the leaſt duty on any of them. To attempt then to introduce that metal into the Province, as a medium of commerce, which in a dependent government, as <hi>Pennſylvania is,</hi> will ever be a currency <hi>extremely precarious;</hi> and NEGLECT to improve and extend the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the paper-money, whoſe advantages have been experienced during a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of more than twenty years; would be a proceeding which I ſhould confeſs my ſelf at an utter loſs to account for.</p>

            <p>The principles on which the value of the currency of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> is ſupported, <hi>undeniably</hi> evince, that, were the duty for purchaſing the ſilver promiſed to the poſſeſſors of the <hi>Maryland-bills,</hi> to be diſcontinued, their preſent value could not be leſſened: For the people of that Province would be then under the ſame obligation of purchaſing 'em to diſcharge their contracts as they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and would as willingly bargain for 'em afterwards as the people of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> do now for the bills current amongſt them.</p>
            <p>I would add farther, that if the ſilver-contracts at preſent ſubſiſting among the former, were to be made payable in paper-bills, according to their varying worth in ſilver, which the courſe of exchange diſcovers, the employment and conſequently the value of 'em would be increaſed (but I do not inſinuate it ought to be above what it is) much more than it would by making them a legal tender at a certain fix'd rate in diſcharge of ſilver-contracts; for that is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005308_0006_1016FA8CAF7CFF68"/>
which, after the bills have obtained a currency, cannot be introduced nor continued without danger; forasmuch as it has a <hi>direct</hi> tendency to force merchants into the truck-trade; which, in their own defence, they muſt all run into, when they ſee the currency pour'd upon 'em without bounds. In ſuch a caſe none will fell their goods for it on credit, unleſs at a prodigious advance; and on the other ſide it will have but little employment in diſcharging ſilver-contracts, for no new ones of that kind will be made; ſo that under theſe circumſtances the wonder is not why it ſhould in ſome colonies have ſunk ſo much in value, but rather how it could preſerve any value at all.</p>
            <p>The proprietary quit-rents in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> reſerved ſince the uſe of paper-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, are made payable by the patents in ſilver, or the value in paper-coin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of exchange. Thoſe reſerved before paper-money was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, which are ſaid to be ſmall compared with the others, the law regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the payment of during a certain term of Years, at the rate of eighteen pence for one ſhilling <hi>ſterling.</hi> But to this the <hi>Honourable Proprietaries</hi> themſelves aſſented in conſideration of the ſum of 1200l as appears by the publick proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>The value of the paper-money of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> notwithſtanding the obvious manner of accounting for it, is attributed by many to the land-ſecurity on which it is lent; and, in ſupport of this notion, the following argument, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever firſt broached it, has been printed; which I ſhall <hi>particularly</hi> examine <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> as it has been <hi>generally</hi> adopted, it cannot <hi>with defency</hi> be condemned in the <hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> It runs thus. <hi>As thoſe who take bills out of the banks in</hi> Europe <hi>put in money for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo here we engage our land. And as bills iſſued upon money-ſecurity are money, ſo bills iſſued upon land-ſecurity are, in effect, coined <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Now the Banks of <hi>Europe</hi> do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <hi>borrow</hi> the money lodged with them, and therefore <hi>give</hi> their notes as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the repayment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the paper-money-bank of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> to which the argument is applied, does not borrow but <hi>lend</hi> money, and therefore <hi>takes</hi> ſecurity from the borrowers for the repayment at the times ſtipulated. The two caſes then, inſtead of having the <hi>leaſt</hi> reſemblance, being <hi>eſſentially</hi> oppoſite; it is impoſſible that any concluſion drawn from the one ſhould be applicable to the other. Indeed the bills given by an <hi>European</hi> bank have the ſame power as the ſilver promiſed by 'em; becauſe the poſſeſsors have a <hi>right</hi> to receive, and do alſo receive on demand the very firms expreſſed by ſuch bills. But thoſe of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> cannot, for a like reaſon, nor for any reaſon, be conſidered as land; for tho' they be lent upon land, yet the poſſeſsors have no <hi>right</hi> to demand from any man, or any body of men, any land for 'em.</p>
            <p>Having ſhown that the value of the paper-money depends on the <hi>general</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment given it by trade; we from thence deſcend to prove that the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſequently the value of it, will, on a ſuppoſition of its quantity continuing the ſame, be more or leſs in proportion to the INTRINSIC WORTH of the <hi>moveable commodities</hi> exchanged by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005308_0007_1016FAA631605D98"/>
When theſe encreaſe in quantity without diminiſhing in goodneſs or quality, or encreaſe in quality without diminiſhing in quantity; their <hi>intrinſic worth is encreaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more any particular ſort of goods is wanted, the more hands will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in raiſing, making and tranſporting 'em to market for ſale and <hi>vice verſa:</hi> From whence it follows, <hi>That the</hi> Intrinſic worth <hi>of</hi> moveable <hi>commodities will be</hi> always <hi>proportioned to the labour and skill expended on the ſeveral ſpecies,</hi> conſidered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>of which it is compoſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The value of the land belonging to a ſociety may fall tho' the people encreaſe, if their diligence decreaſes in a greater proportion, <hi>as may ſometimes</hi> happen. But the value of the land will <hi>infallibly</hi> riſe with the <hi>intrinſic worth</hi> of the moveable commodities; which may be occaſioned by an increaſe of induſtry in the people as well as by an increaſe in their number. Therefore it is plainly the intereſt of land-holders and the owners of houſes who propoſe a rent by them, to deſire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, a plenty of money; for, without it, a great part of ſociety, who, with it, might be engaged to ſet their hands to uſeful work, will remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed; while others whoſe livelihood depends on their manual labour, and who, on an offer of ready money would <hi>eagerly, conſtantly</hi> ſtrive to earn it, will not work but as mere neceſſity compels them. Hence it clearly appears that land-holders are the <hi>natural</hi> guardians of the publick intereſt; ſince without advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their own they cannot promote the other, nor ſuffer it to be leſſened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering themſelves in an equal degree: Whereas merchants (or Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> is miſtaken) as well as uſurers or money-jobbers, land-jobbers and ſuper-nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary officers, with their tribe of retainers and dependents, may all <hi>very poſſibly</hi> grow rich, while the reſt of the community are oppreſſed and kept poor. Yet becauſe it is the immediate intereſt of land-holders <hi>in general,</hi> to promote the public good, that therefore it muſt always be the immediate intereſt of every one in <hi>particular;</hi> or, ſuppoſing it to be the caſe, that <hi>therefore</hi> none of 'em will ſacrifice <hi>a real</hi> advantage to a luſt of power, when an opportunity of gratifying it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; or to a deſire of <hi>lording</hi> it over their brethren, tho' the proſpect may ſeem remote; is a fallacious way of arguing; tho' it is a doctrine that has <hi>formerly</hi> been currently ſwallowed, <hi>to the great detriment of the patients,</hi> in a certain colony which I forbear to name.</p>
            <p>And now craving pardon for this digreſſion, I re-aſſume the principal argument and purſue it thus;</p>
            <p>Paper-money is only wanted to exchange commodities, which it does, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſold abſolutely for it or only for a time, or whether the payment be immediate or time be given for the payment. Commodities are never exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unleſs they be wanted: Therefore the demand for paper-money muſt riſe and fall with the demand for the commodities (among which we muſt here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the land) exchanged by it.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>intrinſic worth of moveable</hi> commodities be not encreaſed, neither rents nor the value of land can riſe, nor, conſequently, the demand for money, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the one or purchaſe the other:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005308_0008_1016FA8B2A14F300"/>
Neither, on the ſame ſuppoſition, can the continual variations in the value of <hi>moveable</hi> commodities, with reſpect to one another, encreaſe the demand for money; for it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> that any of the ſorts ſhould riſe unleſs the others fall. As then the demand and conſequently the value of the paper-money cannot be encreaſed, ſo it cannot be leſſened, but in proportion to the <hi>intrinſic worth</hi> of the <hi>moveable</hi> commodities exchanged by it. If the reader has not forgot, that when this inference was offered to be proved, it was on a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the quantity of money in trade remain'd the ſame, he'll more clearly perceive the truth of the poſition now laying down, to wit, That, could a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod be fallen upon to augment and diminiſh the quantity of the currency ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the demand for it; <hi>its value would remain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> UNALTERABLE; for as the proportion between the money extant and the intrinſic worth of the <hi>moveable</hi> commodities exchanged by it, would be always alike; the ſame number of ſhillings or pounds would at all times purchaſe the ſame quantity of <hi>labour and art,</hi> or of the <hi>neceſſaries and conveniences of life,</hi> taking one article with another; as for inſtance, ſhould domeſtic commodities riſe in price, with reſpect to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money, they would do ſo with reſpect to foreign goods, which muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fall proportionably; ſo that when more money than uſual is required for the one, leſs will ſerve for the other. Thus, in every caſe that can be put, the value of the money (ſuppoſing a conſtant proportion preſerved between the quantity extant and the intrinſic worth of the commodities exchanged by it) will, as it ſtands in compariſon not with one or a few, but with all the commodities purchaſeable by it, be found <hi>unalterable;</hi> which is the <hi>higheſt pitch of perfection</hi> that money can arrive at; for beyond this point it is impoſſible to carry it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rendering invariable the natural and conſtantly variable relations of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to one another.</p>
            <p>Now in order to preſerve a <hi>conſtant</hi> proportion between the quantity of money floating in trade, and the demand for it, there needs nothing more than to open a bank that ſhall lend on good real ſecurity for the <hi>natural</hi> intereſt, whatever ſums may be applied for; and ſhall alſo receive back any ſum, if not too tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, from any perſon offering it, tho' not a borrower, allowing him the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intereſt or an equivalent to it, 'till he calls it out again.</p>
            <p>An increaſe of trade will encreaſe the number of borrowers, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hire of money: Therefore the bank continuing to lend it out at the ſame intereſt it let for before that increaſe, will at once be enabled to augment the quantity accordingly. On the other hand a decreaſe in trade will decreaſe the number of borrowers, and conſequently the hire of money: Therefore the bank, continuing to give the ſame intereſt it let for before, muſt <hi>inevitably</hi> draw in the part, which on every decreaſe of commerce, will be left without em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; and thus the quantity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of money floating in trade will be augmented and diminiſhed, <hi>exactly</hi> with the demand for it.</p>
            <p>Admitting, <hi>for argument's ſake,</hi> the natural rate of intereſt to be five <hi>per cent</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a premium of four and a half will <hi>probably</hi> prove ſufficient to draw in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005308_0009_1016FABD63DDDAB0"/>
caſh at any time extant; for ſuch an intereſt when with if the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal may be had on demand, is at leaſt as good as five <hi>per cent.</hi> on any private ſecurity, where beſides the riſque, the lender can never be ſure of having his money again, as he would be at the bank, whenever an opportunity offers of laying it out to greater advantage. Therefore ſhould the full natural intereſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man be allowed by the bank for the money returned upon it; the quantity extant, inſtead of ever exceeding, will rather fall ſhort of the proportion required by trade; which muſt incline it to ſink inſtead of riſing in value. But this inconvenience may be eaſily avoided by leſſening the premium; which, without leaving it to the diſcretion of the managers of the bank, may be regulated by a <hi>perpetual</hi> table, that the men of figures will eaſily form on the <hi>Data,</hi> furniſhed 'em by one year's experience. On the ſame <hi>Data,</hi> rules may be laid down for diſcovering at all times the hire of money at market; for, as that leſſens, the intereſt <hi>paid</hi> and <hi>received</hi> at the bank muſt be leſſened too. There can be no occaſion to encreaſe it at any time for the natural intereſt between man and man (which, by the way, can never fall too low) will be always falling until every branch of trade be fully ſupplied with money. Theſe laſt hints may ſeem ſuperfluous to ſuch as have duely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the nature of intereſt, as they really would be, were they added, <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> on their account, to ſtrengthen this concluſion, <hi>That the Scheme it as</hi> eaſy <hi>in practice, as it is</hi> true <hi>in theory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The end of money is to facilitate the exchange of commodities, and therefore it is ſignificantly called <hi>an inſtrument of commerce.</hi> It is the tool which mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants work with, and its deficiency in power does <hi>more immediately</hi> affect them than any other calling, becauſe their buſineſs conſiſts in exchanging and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting goods; for which reaſon Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> throws them together, from the higheſt to the loweſt claſs, under the general <hi>emphatical</hi> name of <hi>Brokers.</hi> Yet, however neceſſary money may be to traders, they either will not (and with good reaſon) contract for a paper-currency when they <hi>apprehend</hi> it likely to fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or they'll raiſe the price of their goods according to the ſtrength of that apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in both caſes the employment and value of the money will be leſſened. While theſe jealouſies exiſt its power cannot be extended; and unleſs they be removed, it will on every addition made to it, decreaſe faſter in value than it can be encreaſed in quantity. But were this ſcheme to be carried into execution, as no doubt it will, if the arguments before offered be found concluſive; ſellers, on the one hand, would be convinced <hi>the money could not fall in value,</hi> and buyers, on the other, that <hi>it could not prove deficient in quantity;</hi> which circumſtances <hi>concurring</hi> would <hi>immediately</hi> cauſe it to circulate thro' every vein of commerce, and <hi>at once</hi> blow up the truck-trade; a manner of traffick, which, whether it be from the difficulties it is accompanied with, or the opportunities it furniſhes <hi>artful,</hi> diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt traders in exchanging and diſtributing commodities to <hi>cheat</hi> the raiſers, makers and conſumers of 'em, or on both accounts; has always been reckoned by every <hi>polite</hi> nation, where trade flouriſhed, a mark of BARBARISM.</p>
            <p>Exchange fell lately in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> from 145 l. to 125 l. and in a few months after roſe to 165 l. which was owing to the ſudden encreaſe and decreaſe of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005308_0010_1016FAA816A27EA0"/>
trinſic worth of the commodities that gave employment to the currency. But if its quantity had been augmented and diminiſhed accordingly, the price of ſterling bills of exchange could not have riſen or fallen but juſt half as much as it did. And had the ſum and power of the whole currency extant been the treble of what it was, when exchange was at 145 l. it could not have riſen high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than 147 &amp; <hi>a half</hi> nor fallen lower than 142 &amp; <hi>a half.</hi> I omit the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration here, for as much as the principles on which it is founded were deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed very particularly in one of the publick prints ſome months ago; and the conſequences flowing from thence were proved ſo clearly, that ſeveral gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who think themſelves knowing in the theory of money, becauſe they can give themſelves leave to practice any <hi>unjuſtifiable</hi> arts of getting it, were pleaſed to declare the writer gave himſelf an unneceſſary trouble, ſince, as they affirmed the points he then undertook to demonſtrate, were before his writing, as perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to them as the <hi>meridian</hi> ſun.</p>
            <p>An exact judgment cannot be formed of the ſum of money neceſſary for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the trade of any ſociety, tho' we knew the number of the individuals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for people are not in all places equally induſtrious; neither can we arrive at any certainty in this matter, tho' we were acquainted with the annual quantity of their ſeveral kinds of labour; for when the members of a community are ſettled cloſe together, each will apply himſelf to one ſingle trade, which will cauſe a greater exchange of commodities than if they were ſcattered on a large ſurface <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for then each would be obliged to follow ſeveral occupations at once, and ſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> much leſs quantity of commodities would be exchanged. The running caſh <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>England</hi> is computed at <hi>twenty millions,</hi> to which if we add the bank-notes and other paper-pledges that paſs as ready money, which are therefore in this caſe to be conſidered as part of the nation's caſh, the whole cannot amount to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> than <hi>forty millions.</hi> This ſum divided among <hi>ten millions</hi> of ſouls for ſo many <hi>England</hi> is reckoned to contain, gives 4 l. for each. Now allowing there are in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> 150,000 ſouls, their currency, if it was to be proportioned by that of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſhould be equal in power to 600,000 l. ſterling. But abating the one half, for the reaſons juſt now offered, it follows that the 80,000 l. now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> as it has not a greater power than 50,000 l. ſterling, is but the ſixth part of what the trade of the province requires. But tho' this at the beſt is but <hi>probable</hi> if it be even that, yet it is <hi>certain</hi> that the currency of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony is <hi>vaſtly ſhort</hi> of what its domeſtic trade will bear, ſince it is too evident the greateſt branches of it depend on barter only. Moreover as people cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great difficulty exchange their labour, if money which is the medium of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change be wanting, families are thereby drove to live independently of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and to provide as much as poſſible within themſelves whatever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their ſupport. The pleaſures of ſociety having by this means loſt the chief place in their thoughts, they ſeek out land at the cheapeſt rate. To this it is in a great meaſure owing that his Majeſty's ſubjects in <hi>America,</hi> including many who are born as well as others who annually arrive there, are daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring back in great numbers from the Sea, which renders 'em as uſeleſs to the colony as to their <hi>Mother-country,</hi> for ſuch conſume little or none of her manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005308_0011_1016FAA185AD6650"/>
On the other ſide, foraſmuch as people living cloſe together and ready at hand to aſſiſt one another can, if money be not wanting, more eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the neceſſaries and comforts of life than a like number more thinly ſettled; it is plain that a plentiful currency would render the ſubjects much more uſeful to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and to one another than they now are, as they would thereby be ſpontaneouſly drawn into a narrower compaſs, to which in ſuch a caſe, they would be farther allured by the rational pleaſures that accompany a ſocial life. On theſe conſiderations one can hardly forbear thinking, that the paper-money of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> might in a few years attain a power equal to 300,000 l. ſterling. And then ſuppoſing the exports and imports to be double of what they now are, and that the employment which they at preſent furniſh the paper-money in exchanging them ſhould be even trebled; yet its variation in value compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſilver (which, as was mentioned once before, may for the moſt part be exactly diſcovered by the price of ſterling bills of exchange) would be trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. In the mean while its worth in that metal would, on this ſcheme, <hi>taking one time with another,</hi> be invariable, or at leaſt not perceptible 'till after many years; for tho' a vaſt quantity of ſilver and gold is daily dug out of the earth, and found on the ſurface of it, yet it is exceedingly ſmall with reſpect to the ſum of both in the trade of the world; and therefore their <hi>declining</hi> worth cannot be eaſily perceived on a ſhort retroſpect.</p>
            <p>In the next number it will be ſhown, that the money cannot, conſiſtent with <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>public honour,</hi> be lent out at leſs than the <hi>natural</hi> intereſt; nor that leſs than that intereſt, or an equivalent to it, can be refuſed to ſuch as ſhall be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to return any part of it on the bank. In diſcuſſing theſe points, not only the reaſonableneſs of the ſcheme, but the nature and <hi>ineſtimable</hi> advantages of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-currency will be further illuſtrated.</p>
            <p>Let liberty and property be ſecured ever ſo well, yet the labour and induſtry of the people, from which the riches of every community are wholly derived, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be drawn forth to the length they are capable of, without a plenty of money. This conſidered, it may not be thought an extravagant aſſertion, that a paper-currency muſt <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> in proportion to the number of the individuals, prove to every ſociety uſing it in the manner ſet forth, <hi>a more valuable</hi> and a <hi>much more certain</hi> ſource of wealth, than the gold of <hi>Brazil</hi> is to <hi>Portugal,</hi> or than the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible ſilver-mines of <hi>Potoſi</hi> are to <hi>Spain.</hi>
