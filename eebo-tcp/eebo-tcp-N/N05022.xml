            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE TESTIMONY OF THE Monthly-Meeting of Friends IN <hi>PHILADELPHIA,</hi> Concerning our Antient, Worthy FRIEND, <hi>THOMAS CHALKLEY,</hi> Deceaſed.</head>
            <p>THE Chriſtian Experiences of the Faithful being uſeful to direct ſuch as are deſirous of following them in the Paths of true Religion and Virtue, and their good Examples ſhining
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:006297_0004_10285604A6B30350"/>
with the greateſt Clearneſs, when they have, with the Fleſh, put off all human Infirmities; Juſtice to their Memory, and a Concern for the Benefit of their Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, demand our grateful Remembrance of them, and the contributing our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to render their Labours uſeful to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations engage us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the Writings of this our eſteemed Friend and Elder in the Truth, with this Teſtimony concerning him.</p>
            <p>He was a Member of our Monthly-Meeting above Forty Years, ſo that ſome of us had Opportunities of being inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with him; and of knowing his Fidelity and Diligence in promoting the Cauſe of Truth, and the Edification of the Church of Chriſt; this having been the principal Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Concern of his Mind, and which he preferred to any other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; as will evidently appear to thoſe, who, with an honeſt and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Intention, peruſe his Journal of his Life and Travels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:006297_0005_1028560786A47850"/>By this it will appear, that He was, in the early Part of his Life, ſenſibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Viſitation of Divine Life and Grace, and, by adhering thereunto, was preſerved from the Vanities and Follies, which often divert and alienate the Minds of Youth from the due Remembrance and awful Regard of their Creator; ſo that he was enabled to bear a Teſtimony of Chriſtian Patience and Self-Denial in his youthful Days, and, by keeping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Exerciſe, as he advanced in Years, attained to further Knowledge and Experience in the Work of Religion, in which he had a Sight of the Neceſſity of keeping in a State of Humility, and of bearing the Croſs of Chriſt, which mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified him to the World; ſo that the Loſs many ſuſtain by the anxious Purſuit of the lawful Things thereof appearing to him, He was concerned to avoid it, and in Obedience to the Precept of Chriſt, to <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs,</hi> having Faith in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>that all theſe Things</hi> (neceſſary for him) <hi>ſhould be added.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:006297_0006_102856090D887270"/>Thus the Love of God influencing his Mind, and opening his Underſtanding, he became concerned for the general Good of Mankind, and received a Gift of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel of Chriſt, before he had attained the Age of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one Years; in the publick Exerciſe of which, He ſoon after travelled thro' many Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the next Year, being 1697, He came to viſit Friends in this and the adjacent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>America,</hi> where his Miniſtry and Converſation were to the Comfort and Edification of the Faithful (as ſome of us can with Satisfaction declare, from our Knowledge and Remembrance of him at that Time) and the near Fellowſhip and Union he then had with Friends here (we believe) contributed to his more ſpeedy Determination of ſettling among us, which He afterwards thought it his Duty to do, tho' the leaving his Parents and Relations (as He afterwards expreſſed) was no ſmall Croſs to him, being of a dutiful and affectionate Diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>After fixing his Reſidence among us, He perſever'd in his Concern and Labour
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:006297_0007_1028560BB3ADACE0"/>
for the Edification of the Churches, and gathering People to Faith and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the inward Teachings of Chriſt, and for that Purpoſe only He travelled many long Journies and Voyages through the ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies on this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and moſt of the Iſlands in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and in <hi>Europe,</hi> through <hi>England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Frizeland,</hi> and ſeveral Parts of <hi>Germany, and the adjacent Northern Kingdoms</hi>; and in many of theſe Places his Miniſtry and religious Labours were bleſſed with the deſired Succeſs, of which there are yet ſome Witneſſes living, and others, who were convinced of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Truth by his Means, became ſerviceable Members of the Church, and continued therein to the End of their Lives.</p>
            <p>But as the wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> formerly obſerved, that <hi>One Event cometh to the Righteous, and to the Wicked,</hi> ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to this good Man, who met with various Loſſes and Diſappointments in his temporal Eſtate; after which, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Affairs engaged him to
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:006297_0008_1028560ECDE023A8"/>
undertake ſome Buſineſs, in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which He was obliged to croſs the Seas frequently: This, however, did not abate his Zeal and religious Care to make uſe of all Opportunities of viſiting the Meetings of Friends when among them, and of calling, at other times, to ſuch who might be accounted as <hi>the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt of Iſrael, and the Diſperſed of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, or as Sheep not yet of the Fold of Chriſt</hi>; and his Services of that Kind are worthy to be commemorated, having been often productive of good Effects.</p>
            <p>His Patience was remarkable in Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments and Afflictions, of which He had a large Share; and his Meekneſs, Humility and Circumſpection, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Courſe of his Life and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were conſpicuous and exemplary; and as He frequently exhorted and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed others to the Obſervation and Practice of the many excellent Precepts and Rules of Chriſt, our Lord and Law-giver, and more eſpecially thoſe expreſſed in his Sermon on the Mount (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Sum of our moral and religious Duties) ſo He manifeſted himſelf to be
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:006297_0009_102856119CE969B8"/>
one of that Number, whom Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the wiſe Builder, who laid a ſure Foundation; ſo that his Building ſtood unſhaken by the various Floods and Winds of Tribulations and Temptations he met with, both from within and without.</p>
            <p>He was a Lover of Unity amongſt Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and careful to promote and maintain it, ſhewing the Example of a meek, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and loving Deportment, not only to Friends, but to all others, with whom he had Converſation or Dealings; ſo that it may be truly ſaid, That <hi>few have lived ſo univerſally beloved and reſpected among us:</hi> And it was manifeſt this did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Deſire of being popular, or to be ſeen of Man: For his Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Peace did not divert him from the Diſcharge of his Duty in a faithful Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to thoſe that profeſſed the Truth, that they ought to be careful to maintain good Works; and He was often concern'd zealouſly to incite and preſs Friends to the Exerciſe of the good Order and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed in the Wiſdom of Truth, by admoniſhing, warning, and timely treating with ſuch as fell ſhort of
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:006297_0010_10285614C996D580"/>
their Duty therein, and by teſtifying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who, after loving and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Care and Endeavours, could not be brought to the Senſe and Practice of their Duty; and thereby He ſometimes ſhar'd the Ill-will and Reſentment of ſuch Perſons.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral Eſſays He wrote on religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subjects at Sea, are further Proofs that his Mind was principally engaged in the great Buſineſs and Concern of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and as He continued under the ſame Engagement to the End, we are fully perſuaded the Words with which He concluded his laſt publick Teſtimony on the Iſland of <hi>Tortola,</hi> may be truly and properly applied to him, <hi>That he had fought a good Fight, and had kept the Faith, and,</hi> we doubt not, <hi>he now enjoys a Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much more might be truly ſaid of his Integrity, Faithfulneſs and Worth, but we do not think it neceſſary; our chief Intention being to expreſs our reſpectful Remembrance of him, and our Unity with his Labours and Services, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to aſſure thoſe, to whom he was not
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:006297_0011_102856198ABD11B8"/>
perſonally known, of the Truth of what He has himſelf wrote of his Life and Travels; for we believe, as He was a Man ſignally influenced with the Spirit of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Love and Good-will to Mankind, this was his chief Motive for writing; and we are ſincerely deſirous that his good Deſign may be anſwered, and that the Glory of every good and perfect Work may be attributed to that Divine Power alone, which can qualify others to ſupply the Places of thoſe faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Servants of Chriſt, who have been of late Years removed from among us, and are of that Number, of whom it is written, <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead, which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi>

ten Years of Age, my Father and Mother ſent me near two Miles to School, to <hi>Richard Scoryer</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>London.</hi> I went moſtly by my ſelf to the School; and many and various were the Exerciſes I went through, by Beatings and Stonings along the Streets, being diſtinguiſhed to the People (by the Badge of Plainneſs which my Parents put upon me) of what Profeſſion I was; divers telling me,
<q>'Twas no more Sin to kill me, than it was to kill a Dog.</q>

                        </note>About this Time the Lord began to work ſtrongly on my Mind by his Grace, inſomuch that I could not forbear from reproving thoſe Lads who would take the Name of the Lord God in their Mouths in vain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding them of the third Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Name in vain</hi>; and of Chriſt's Saying, <hi>Every idle Word that Men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give Account thereof in the Day of Judgment</hi>; for which I was mocked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided by ſome, and others would ſometimes refrain from ſuch bad Words when I reproved them.</p>
                     <p>One Time I remember I was amongſt ſome Men, one of whom I had reproved, and he told the reſt of it, and turned to me, and ſaid,
<q>That I was no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</q>
and aſked me when I ſaid the Lord's Prayer. I aſked him if he ſaid it? He ſaid. Yes. I then aſked him how he could call God Father, and be ſo wicked as to ſwear and take God's Name in vain? which I had heard him often do; and I told him what Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1685.</note> 
                        <hi>You are of your Father the Devil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Works ye do</hi>; and that thoſe that did the Devil's Work could not truly call God Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt's Doctrine. So being convicted in their Conſciences that what I ſaid was true, they were all ſilent, and wondered that I, being ſo young, ſhould ſpeak in ſuch a Manner; in which I remember I had great Peace and good Satisfaction: And from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth theſe Men let me alone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="unknown:006297_0016_10285626EDCC22E8"/>Notwithſtanding I hated to hear wicked Words, I loved Play exceedingly, being perſuaded that there was no Harm in that, if we uſed no bad Words. One Time I was at Play at a Neighbour's Houſe with the Children, and in the midſt of my Sport I was reach'd to with ſtrong Convictions, inſomuch that I could not forbear Weeping. The Childrens Mother obſerving that I wept, ſaid,
<q>Why do you weep, <hi>Tommy?</hi>
                        </q>
I told her I could not tell, except it was becauſe I was a naughty Boy.
<q>Oh! ſaid ſhe, don't believe him, for that's the Devil tells you ſo, for you are the beſt Boy in all our Street.</q>
But I knew I was told the Truth by Conviction, and that ſhe was miſtaken: For I plainly underſtood by clear Conviction, and by the Holy Scriptures (which I had been train'd up in the Reading of) that I was too vain and wanton; for I loved Muſic, Dancing, and Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Cards, and too much delighted therein betimes, and was followed with the Judgments of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e Secret of my Soul.</p>
                     <p>What I did in thoſe Sports and Games, I always took care to do out of the Sight, and without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my tender Parents; for I was afraid of their Reproofs and Correction, the which I was ſure to have, if they had any Intelligence of it.</p>
                     <p>I remember that, unknown to my Parents, I had bought a Pack of Cards, with Intent to make uſe of them when I went to ſee my Relations in the Country, where there was Liberty in the Family ſo to do, at a Place called <hi>Woodford,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Woodford, <hi>in</hi> Eſſex.</note> about ſeven Miles from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where I got Leave ſometimes to go; and at the Time called <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> I went to ſee them, and five Miles on my Way went to a Meeting, at a Town call'd <hi>Wanſtead</hi>; at which Meeting,<note place="margin">Wanſtead.</note> a Miniſter of Chriſt declared againſt the Evil of Gaming, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of Cards; and that the Time which People pretend to keep Holy, for Chriſt's Sake, many of them ſpend moſtly in Wickedneſs, Sports, and Games; even
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006297_0017_1028562A2E153DC0"/>
ſome pretending to be Religious: And, generally ſpeaking, more Sin and Evil is committed in this Time, than in the like Space of Time in all the Year beſides; ſo that the Devil is ſerved inſtead of honouring Chriſt. From this Meeting at <hi>Wanſtead,</hi> I went to the Houſe of my Relations, where the Parſon of the next Pariſh lodged that Night, who uſed to play at Cards with them ſometimes; and the Time drawing near that we were to go to our Games, my Uncle called to the Doctor (as he call'd him) to me, and to my Couſin, to come and take a Game at Cards; at which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I had ſtrong Convictions upon me not to do it, as being Evil, and I ſecretly cry'd to the Lord to keep me faithful to him; and lifting up my Eyes, I ſaw a Bible lie in the Window, at the Sight of which I was glad. I took it, and ſat down, and read to my ſelf, greatly rejoicing that I was preſerved out of the Share. Then my Uncle called again, and ſaid,
<q>Come, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, you and I, and my Wife and Daughter, will have a Game at Cards, for I ſee my Couſins, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſed.</q>
Then he looked upon me, and ſaid, "He was better diſpoſed alſo." So their Sport for that Time was ſpoiled, and mine in that Practice for ever; for I never (as I remember) play'd with them more, but as ſoon as I came Home, offered my new and untouch'd Pack of Cards to the Fire. And of this I am certain, the Uſe of them is of evil Conſequence, and draws away the Mind from Heaven and heavenly Things; for which Reaſon all Chriſtians ought to ſhun them as Engines of Satan: And Muſic, and Dancing, having generally the ſame Tendency, ought therefore to be refrain'd from. The Sentiments of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> a People in great Eſteem among Proteſtants, are worthy the Conſideration of all true Proteſtants and Chriſtians; which were
<q>That as many Paces, or Steps, as the Man or Woman takes in the Dance, ſo many Paces or Steps they take towards Hell.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006297_0018_1028562DA06BE958"/>I very well remember the Work of God upon my Soul, when I was about ten Years of Age; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at a certain Time when I had been rebelling againſt God and my Parents, in Vanity and Lightneſs: And as I had offended both, ſo I was corrected by both. For I had not only the Anger of my Parents, but the Lord frown'd upon me, inſomuch that I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled exceedingly, and was as tho' I heard a vocal Voice ſay to me,
<q>What will become of thee this Night, if I ſhould take thy Life from thee?</q>
At which I was amazed, and in great Fear. Then I covenanted with God, that if he would be pleaſed to ſpare my Life (for I thought God would have taken my Life from me that very Moment) I would be more ſober, and mind his Fear more than I had done before.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs I broke Covenant with God my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, my Adverſary tempting me ſo to do, telling me I was but a Child, and that it was natural for Children to be briſk and to play, and that God would wink at my Childhood and Youth, and it was time enough for me, when a Man, to become Religious. But ſtill God followed me with his chaſtiſing Rod, and often put me in Mind of my Covenant that I made with him in my Diſtreſs; and that he had granted my Requeſt which I then made to him; and unleſs I would take up a Croſs to my own corrupt Will and Inclinations, he ſhould take me out of the World. Then, Oh then! I cried, <hi>Lord help, or I die! Save me, or I periſh for ever!</hi> I cannot keep thy Covenant, nor do thy Will, without thy Help and Aſſiſtance! And indeed if the Lord had not helped, I had been undone for ever.</p>
                     <p>So I continued bow'd down in my Mind, calling on the Lord; thinking and meditating on Heaven and heavenly Things: But, as I am ſenſible, I had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Enemy that always ſought my Hurt and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, I have Cauſe to bleſs God, who by his Grace (as mine Eye was turned to it) helped me to do his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006297_0019_1028562F27CB9388"/>
Will, as he was pleaſed to manifeſt it to me; ſo that thereby ſome Change was wrought on me, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly.</p>
                     <p>And I then began to delight in Reading and Sobriety, which before were irkſome to me: And when I read the Holy Scriptures, I deſired that God would open them to my Underſtanding, which he did to my Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication many Times. I alſo begged earneſtly of the Lord, that he would be pleas'd to be with me, and make me like to thoſe his Children and Servants, of whom I read in the Holy Scriptures, who faithfully ſerved Him all their Days. And when I read of the Crucifixion of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, it would break my Soul into Tenderneſs. I thought it was enough to awaken and humble any Soul that was well-meaning, and had any Senſe of the Power, Love, and Grace, of Chriſt. Thus I went on for ſeveral Years, feeling that Peace which paſſeth natural Underſtanding, which many Times accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied my poor and needy Soul. And being advanced to about 14 or 15 Years of Age,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1690.</hi> Shad-Thames, Southwark.</note> I remember that I uſed to ſhun the Croſs of ſpeaking in the plain Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (which I always read in the Holy Scriptures) to thoſe whom I converſed with, except my Father and Mother, who would not allow me to ſpeak other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: I was convicted in my Conſcience that it was not right to play the Hypocrite after that Manner; and on a certain Time I had Occaſion to ſpeak with an Officer, a great Man in our Neighbourhood, and my Heart moved within me for fear I ſhould ſhun the Croſs of Chriſt: For it was Chriſt's Language to all, as we may read in the New Teſtament; and the Scriptures, from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelations,</hi> ſpeak Thee and Thou, to a ſingle Perſon, in a general Way.</p>
                     <p>So I took up the Croſs, and ſaid Thee to him; and he was much affronted, and ſaid,
<q>Thee! what doſt thou Thee me for?</q>
I ſoberly aſked him if he did not ſay Thee to his Maker in his Prayers? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006297_0020_10285632173D10F0"/>
he was too good, or too great, to be ſpoke to in the ſame Language in which he addreſs'd the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty? Unto which he made no Reply, but ſeem'd to fall from his Paſſion into Admiration, as one ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in himſelf. And he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>re me Reſpect ever after; and I greatly rejoiced that I was preſerved faithful. Tho' it may look like a little Thing to ſome, yet I found it good as the Scripture ſaith <hi>not to deſpiſe the Day of ſmall Things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the twentieth Year of my Age,<note place="margin">1694.</note> I was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and carried aboard a Veſſel belonging to a Man of War. I was put down into the Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d in the Dark, not having any Thing to lie upon but Caſks; and what made it worſe to me, I was among wicked, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Men; and as we were ſhut up in Darkneſs, ſo was their Converſation dark and helliſh. In the Morning (for which I longed more than the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) the Lieutenant called us up on Deck, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined us whether we were willing to ſerve the King. He called me to him, and aſked me,
<q>If I were willing to ſerve his Majeſty?</q>
I anſwered, that I was willing to ſerve him in my Buſineſs, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Conſcience, but as for War or Fighting, CHRIST had forbid it, in his excellent Sermon on the Mount; and for that Reaſon I could not bear Arms, nor be inſtrumental to deſtroy or kill Men. Then the Lieutenant looked on me, and on the People, and ſaid, "Gentlemen, what ſhall we do with this Fellow? he ſwears he will not Fight." The Commander of the Veſſel made Anſwer, "No, no! "he will neither Swear nor Fight." Upon which they turn'd me on Shore. I was thankful that I was delivered out of their Hands; and my tender Parents were glad to ſee me again.</p>
                     <p>Now as I grew in Years, the World began to take too much Root in me; and my unwearied Enemy would tell me that it was lawful enough and indeed I ſee that he hurts many with lawful Things, with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006297_0021_1028563826FBF330"/>
whom he knoweth that unlawful Things will not take, and here I had been loſt, if God had not been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to me. But he in whoſe Preſence I delighted, withdrew, and deprived me of that Enjoyment which was graceful and comfortable above all Things to my Soul. Then did I pray, with Tears, O that it might be with me as it was at other Times before! and I was willing to let the World go, rather than Grace and God's Glory. The Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>No good Thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. lxxxiv. Verſe 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1695.</note>About this Time there was a great Concern on my Mind, rightly to diſtinguiſh between the Voice of Chriſt, and the Whiſperings of Satan, and thus it open'd to me: That Chriſt, the Truth, always ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Good, and for a good End, and that there is divine Life to the Soul in this Speaking; but the Devil never ſpeaks Good, unleſs ſometimes for a bad End, and then not Good in Reality, only colour'd with a good, or fair Shew.</p>
                     <p>And keeping under this Exerciſe, the Lord appear'd to me again, and many Times refreſh'd my Heart with his Goodneſs. And when I was in my Buſineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, I did Witneſs the Holy Ghoſt, the Comforter, to be near me; which was more to me than all the World, or the Riches, Glory, and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; the Love of God being ſo ſweet to my Soul and Spirit, my Breathings, Prayers, and Supplications, were to the Lord, that my Neighbours, Acquaintance, and Relations, might alſo partake of the like precious Faitn and Love which I enjoy'd; and that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men might anſwer that great and good End for which the Lord did create them; which is, that Glory, Honour, and Praiſe, might aſcend and be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him.</p>
                     <p>I had ſuch a Senſe and Fear of Diſhonouring God, that I often, with Tears, cry'd, Never let me live to diſhonour Thee. Oh! it had been better for me, than
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006297_0022_10285639AD870B68"/>
I had never been born, or my Mother's Womb had been my Grave, than that I ſhould live to diſhonour Thee, or wilfully reproach the Name of Chriſt, who, with the Father, is only worthy of Divine Honour.</p>
                     <p>In this Concern I felt the Goſpel Power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to work upon my Soul, and the Word of God was as a Seed in my Heart, growing and opening in me, ſpeaking to me, and making my Underſtanding fruitful in the Things of his Kingdom; and in that Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which was given me of God, through his Grace and Holy Spirit, I exhorted People to Repentance and Amendment of Life; and I always humbly deſir'd the Help and Divine Influence of God's eternal Word therein. Oh! I did fervently pray, that I might mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Goſpel in the Power of Jeſus; for I clearly diſcern'd in the Light of the Son of God, that all Miniſtring out of Chriſt's Power, was neither edifying nor efficacious unto Souls: Therefore I did earneſtly beſeech God for the Continuance of the Gift of His Spirit, that I might be enabled to preach the Goſpel in the Power of Chriſt Jeſus. The Concern that was upon me on this Account at that Time, is hard to be expreſs'd in Words.</p>
                     <p>The latter End of the Year 1695, my Father ſent me into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> on ſome Buſineſs, which, when I had accompliſhed, I viſited ſome Meetings of Friends there, and my Mind being much affected with the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of an impending Storm, (the Nation being about this Time threatened with an Invaſion from <hi>France,</hi> in favour of the late King <hi>James,</hi> ſo that there was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of much Bloodſhed and Confuſion in the Land) I wrote a Letter to my Parents, and another to Friends of the Evening Meeting (kept Weekly at my Father's Houſe) expreſſing my great Thankfulneſs to the Almighty, in Remembrance of the many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Viſitations of Divine Love and Favour we had been made Partakers of, to the uniting our Hearts to Him, and to one another; and my earneſt Prayers

and Supplications, that we might be preſerved in true Love, and the Unity of the Spirit, which is the Bond of everlaſting Peace, and that the World might be made ſenſible of this true Peace, which abounds in thoſe who Love and fear the Lord, and truly believe in the Name of Jeſus. <hi>Oh! ſurely they would then depart from Sin, and abandon Iniquity, by which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this Time we loſt a Lad, that fell into the Sea (as he was drawing a Bucket of Water) and was drowned; the Ship running ſwiftly, he could not be

ſaved, altho' it was ſpeedily endeavoured. Several others died before we got over; but for the moſt Part we were Healthful. The Lord be prais'd, he was, is, and will be, with thoſe that faithfully ſerve him to the End.</p>
                     <p>We were three Ships in Company, but by Diſtreſs of Weather, ſoon after we came out, we parted. After we had been at Sea about eight Weeks (on the 15th of 12th Month) we ſaw two Veſſels aſtern of us. One of them came up with, and the People hailed us, and told us they came from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and had been out ten Weeks. The other came up with us next Day. The People informed us they had been at Sea ſeven Weeks, and that they had had a dreadful Time of it. She had loſt Part of her Topmaſt, and her Spritſail Topmaſt was gone. She was a new Ship, and never at Sea before, belonging to <hi>London,</hi> and bound for <hi>Virginia,</hi> as near as we could underſtand: Our Ship loſt none of her Tackling, thro' the great Mercy of God to us, tho' the Wind and Sea was wonderful high at Times; the Mate told me I might go to Sea all my Life, and not ſee the like; he ſaid he had been at, or uſed the Sea, twenty Years, and never ſaw it ſo rough and high before. We had Meetings twice a Week, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of which were comfortable and refreſhing Meetings, to which moſt of the Paſſengers, being in all about Sixty in Number, ſometimes came; and ſeveral of them were affected with the Senſe of Truth, and the Lord ſtrengthened our Faith and Hope in Him.</p>
                     <p>Oh for ever bleſſed be the Living and Eternal God, who kept my Soul above the Fear of Death, Hell, and the Grave; for my Truſt was in Him, and He did bear up my Spirit above the Waves of the Sea; and in the Time of Toſſing with Tempeſts, I was comforted and chearful, Praiſing the Lord in my Heart, both in the Day Time, and in the Night Seaſon.</p>
                     <p>I was much concerned in my Mind, for many of the Paſſengers, who with the ſecond Mate, and ſeveral of

the Seamen were very Sick (by ſome it was thought near unto Death) I cried to the Lord to heal them, in the Name of his dear Son, and that it might be a Means to convince them of the Efficacy of Love to, and Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, the Phyſician of Value; and the Lord was pleaſed to heal them. The Mate of the Ship deſired that I would come and pray by him. I went to him, and prayed in the Power and Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Lord helped him; that he ſaid he was fine and eaſy, and thanked me for my Love; and in a little Time he recover'd. Several others of the Seamen and Paſſengers I was Inſtrumental to help in their Sickneſs. The Lord bleſſed my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in ſupplicating Him, on their Behalf, and adminiſtring what I had to them. One of the Seamen ſaid,
<q>He was bound to pray for me as long as he lived; and that the Lord would bleſs me.</q>
Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Paſſengers ſaid,
<q>That I was the bleſſed Doctor (for there was a Chirurgeon, or Doctor, in the Ship.</q>) I was very free to communicate of what I had to any ſick Perſon in the Ship, and ſeveral bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord on my Behalf. Indeed I thought I could ſcarce do enough for any that were in Diſtreſs. I write not thus, that I might ſeem popular, but with my Mind bowed before the Lord. Many Times in this Voyage there was Conſultations in my Mind, whether I had beſt write a Memorandum hereof; but at laſt conceiving in my Spirit that it might ſtrengthen and excite Love to God, and Faith in his beloved Son, in true Believers, I wrote as aforeſaid; and then I was ſatisfied, and gave the Glory to God.</p>

Our Voyage was above twelve Weeks, it being then Winter Time, and for the moſt Part the Winds ſo high, that the Ships could carry but little Sail, which made our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the longer.</p>

                        </gap>ſt Side of <hi>Cheſapeak</hi> Bay, with <hi>Thomas Everden,</hi> in his Sloop. Went to his Houſe, and had a Meeting, where many People came. Here we met with our Friends, <hi>Jonathan Tyler, Henry Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and <hi>Henry Payton</hi>'s Siſter. While I was at this Friend's Houſe, there was one <hi>Robert Cathing,</hi> who being very ill, ſent for <hi>Thomas Everden,</hi> and he (not being very well) deſired me to viſit the ſick Perſon: So I went, and the Man was near to Death. Howbeit he ſaid he was comforted much with the Viſit, and that he had never received ſo much Benefit by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Prieſt in his Life:
<q>Altho', <hi>ſaid he,</hi> it coſt me dear for what I had; and if ever I live to get over it, by the Aſſiſtance of God I ſhall have nothing to

do with them more. But, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> he ſhould not live three Days.</q>
And before the End of three Days he expired. He deſired (if I were not gone) I would be at his Funeral. On Notice hereof, about ten Friends went; and there were a great many People, among whom we had a good Opportunity, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weighty Truths were opened to them in the Love of God; and ſome of them were tender and wept; and the moſt, if not all (I think I may ſay) were ſolid and weighty.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Thomas Everden</hi>'s Houſe we went to <hi>George Truit</hi>'s, at whoſe Houſe we had a Meeting. This Friend and I went to an <hi>Indian</hi> Town not far from his Houſe, becauſe I had a Deſire to ſee theſe People, having never ſeen any of them before. When we came to the Town they were kind to us, ſpoke well of Friends, and ſaid they would not cheat them (as ſome others did.)</p>

In thoſe Parts we had ſeveral Meetings, where we were informed Friends had not had any before. And really I cannot but bleſs the Lord for the Opportunities we had with the People; for the Goodneſs of God, thro' Chriſt our Lord, was great, both to us and them, and with Tears they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the Truth.

and about which Place, and in other Parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> I had many large and precious Meetings, the Power of the eternal Son of God being wonderful, in which Power we many Times bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Name together. It was in my Heart much to exhort Friends to Love to God, and to Unity one with another, without which there is no fulfilling the Law or Goſpel. There are many Friends in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and many ſober young People, which greatly rejoiced my Spirit; ſo that for their Encouragement, the Lord opened my Mouth in a prophetic Manner to declare unto them the Bleſſings which he had in Store for them, on Condition of their Walking in the Truth. Glory to God on high! Untruth decays, and the Branches of it mightily wither; the Darkneſs is much paſt, and the true Light ſhineth gloriouſly in many Souls.

I told him that I had no other View in coming there, than the Good of Souls, and that I could ſay with the Apoſtle, that a Neceſſity was laid upon me, <hi>and Wo would be to me if I did not preach the Goſpel.</hi> Then ſaid he,
<q>I wiſh you would preach at my Houſe in GOD's Name.</q>
So next Day we had a Meeting at his Houſe; and on the firſt Day we had the largeſt Meeting that we had or the Iſland. It was thought there were above two Hundred People. The Lord in his Power did make his Truth known to the Praiſe of his Name. Oh! how was my Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for that People! The Lord Jeſus did open my Heart to them, and theirs to Him: They were alſo loving and kind to us. The chief Magiſtrate of the Iſland deſired that I would have a Meeting at his Houſe, there being no ſettled Meeting of Friends before I came; and after Meeting he diſputed about Religion with me. I thought we were both but poor Diſputants; and I cannot remember all that paſs'd between us, but that in the Cloſe of our Diſpute, he ſaid,
<q>I diſputed with your Friends in <hi>Barbados,</hi> and they told me, That we muſt eat the ſpiritual Fleſh, and drink the ſpiritual Blood of Chriſt: And <hi>ſaid the Governor,</hi> Did ever any one hear of ſuch Fleſh and Blood; for
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006297_0033_1028565B55074530"/>
is it not a Contradiction in Nature, that Fleſh and Blood ſhould be Spiritual?</q>
O ſurely, ſaid I, the Governor hath forgot himſelf; for what Fleſh and Blood was that which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Except ye eat my Fleſh, and drink my Blood, ye have no Life in you.</hi>
                        <q>Why, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I don't think they were to gnaw it from his Arms and Shoulders.</q>
Then I told him, he had anſwer'd himſelf. Thus our Diſpute ended. [And from that Time forward they have continued a Meeting, and there is now a Meeting-houſe, and a yearly Meeting for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it is a growing Meeting to this Day, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral publick Friends are raiſed up amongſt them, who preach the Goſpel of Chriſt freely.]</p>
                     <p>At this Time a Friend was convinced, whoſe Name was <hi>Starbuck,</hi> who became very ſerviceable, and lived and died an eminent Miniſter of Chriſt on that Iſland. Several Scores of them came and accompanied us to the Water Side; and when we embarked on Board our Sloop, they deſired that I would come and viſit them again. So I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended them to the Grace of our Lord Jeſus, and we parted in great Love and Tenderneſs. In the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the next Day we got to the Main Land, where we were gladly received.

Why,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>our Miniſter in his Pulpit.</hi> I replied, <hi>That it was a great Abuſe upon us, for I had been trained up from my Childhood in the Reading and Belief of the Scriptures, and my Father and Mother were Friends</hi> that is, Quakers. She wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to try me further, ſaid, <hi>Did your Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer you to read the Bible when you were a little Boy? Yes,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>and gave me Correction when I was not ſo willing to read therein as they would have me. Then,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>Our Miniſter has bely'd you; and ſince you ſay ſo, if it pleaſe God, I will go and hear you.</hi> She went with us to Meeting; and after it was over (going Home) one aſked her,
<q>How ſhe would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to their Miniſter, for going to Meeting.</q>
She replied, <hi>It was Truth ſhe had heard, and ſhe would ſtand by it through the Grace of Chriſt, and need not be aſhamed of it</hi> (through we are of our ſelves but poor weak Creatures.) This Woman was ſober and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and one of good Report. By the foregoing we may ſee how Slanders flow from ſome Pulpits; the more is the Shame and Pity! We went on, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in that Ability he gave us, with which the People were affected, and would have had us tarried longer, but we could not (although they much importuned us) becauſe we had appointed a Meeting at <hi>Oyſter River.</hi> After we had had ſeveral Meetings about <hi>Piſcataway</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dover.

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006297_0035_10285660ACAEB498"/>
there were many People. From <hi>Boſton</hi> I went to viſit Friends about <hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> till I came again to <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi> By the Way I met with <hi>Aaron Atkinſon,</hi> who was on a Viſit to Friends in <hi>New-England.</hi> I had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good Opportunities, and powerful Meetings, in thoſe Parts, and Truth wrought a Tenderneſs in divers at <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi> The Preſence of Him, who ſaid, <hi>Where two or three are met in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> being ſenſibly witneſſed by many; for he was with us of a Truth.

<q>Friends, you are come to ſee me in the Love of God. God is Love, and thoſe that dwell in God, dwell in Love. I thank God, I feel his Divine Life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day and every Night.</q>
He lived to ſee his above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned daughter married, and died, aged 107 Years.</note>. We had ſeveral Meetings there amongſt Friends, and others, many being well ſatisfied concerning the Truth, and ſpoke well of it.</p>

One Night our Sailors thought that an Enemy or Pyrate was near us, who fired two Guns, and ſo paſſed by us; but it being Night, we could not certainly know what ſhe was. I rather judged it might be ſome Ship in Diſtreſs, for we ſaw one of the Ships that Evening that came out with us, and the next Morning we could ſee none at all, and there was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Wind that Night, ſo I feared that our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had ſprung a Leak and founder'd; and when I told our Maſter my Opinion, he ſaid, he feared the ſame likewiſe.

Howbeit we had ſeveral good Meetings,<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we gave Glory to God our Saviour; and for ever let it aſcend, ſaith my Soul, to him over all! After contrary Winds, about two Weeks, the Wind ſprung up Weſterly, and was fair for ſeveral Days; in which Time we got finely on our Way again, and left the <hi>Weſtern Iſlands</hi> about two Days Sail behind us; and then the Wind was contrary again. Contrary Winds are commonly tedious at Sea (but eſpecially to thoſe that know not where to ſtay their Minds) but we being ſeveral Friends of us on Board that were Paſſengers, had oftentimes good Meetings ſeveral Times a Week; and if any of our Ship's Company came to Meeting, they always were ſober, and ſometimes tender; and truly, God's Love was extended towards them. And when it was not our Meeting Days, we ſpent not our Time idly, but for the moſt Part in Reading the Holy Scriptures, and Writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which we were at ſundry Seaſons greatly refreſhed, ſtrengthened, and comforted. O my Soul! glorify God thy Maker, and Chriſt thy Saviour for ever, in the Senſe of His Goodneſs and Mercy, both by Sea and Land, by Night and by Day! After we had been almoſt ſeven Weeks at Sea, we thought that we were near the Land, but we founded ſeveral Days, and found no Bottom, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' we let out Abundance of Line, I think above 300 Yards.</p>
                     <p>About this Time our Doctor dreamed a Dream, which was to this Effect, himſelf relating it to me: He ſaid,
<q>He dreamed that he went on Shore at a great and ſpacious Town, the Buildings whereof were high, and the Streets broad; and as he went up the Street he ſaw a large Sign, on which was written in great golden Letters SHAME. At the Door of the Houſe (to which the Sign belonged) ſtood a Woman with a Can in her Hand, who ſaid unto him. Doctor, will you drink? He reply'd, with all my Heart, for I have not drank any Thing but
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006297_0039_1028566D870DF820"/>
Water a great while (our Wine and Cyder being all ſpent, having had a long Paſſage) and he drank a hearty Draught, which he ſaid, made him merry; ſo went up the Street reeling to and fro, when a grim Fellow coming behind him, clapp'd him on the Shoulder, and told him, that he arreſted him in the Name of the Governor of the Place. He aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for what, and ſaid, What have I done? He anſwered, for ſtealing the Woman's Can; the Can he had indeed, and ſo he was had before the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which was a mighty black Dog, the biggeſt and grimeſt that ever he ſaw in his Life; and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was brought in againſt him by an old Companion of his, and he was found guilty, and his Sentence was to go to Priſon, and there to lay for ever.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He told me this Dream ſo punctually, and with ſuch an Emphaſis, that it affected me with ſerious Sadneſs, and cauſed my Heart to move within me (for to me the Dream ſeemed true, and the Interpretation ſure) I then told him he was an ingenious Man, and might clearly ſee the Interpretation of that Dream, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly anſwered to his State and Condition, which I thus interpreted to him:
<q>This great and ſpacious Place, wherein the Buildings were high, and the Streets broad, is thy great and high Profeſſion: The Sign, on which was wrote <hi>Shame,</hi> which thou ſaweſt, and the Woman at the Door, with the Can in her Hand, truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents that great, crying and ſhameful Sin of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which thou knows to be thy great Weakneſs, which the Woman with the Can did truly repreſent to thee: The grim Fellow which arreſted thee in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Territories is Death, who will aſſuredly arreſt all Mortals: The Governor which thou ſaweſt, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting a great black Dog, is certainly the Devil, who after his Servants have ſerved him to the full, will tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them eternally in Hell.</q>

One, and a Warning to him from the Almighty, who ſometimes ſpeaks to Men by Dreams.</p>

We drove about the Channel's Mouth for ſeveral Days for Want of Wind; after which, for two Days the Wind came up, and we got as far up the Channel as <hi>Limebay,</hi> and then an Eaſterly Wind blew freſh for ſeveral Days, and we turned to Windward, but rather loſt than got on our Way, which was tireſome and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to ſome of us.</p>
                     <p>Now about this Time (being ſome Days after the Doctor's Dream) a grievous Accident happened to us. We meeting with a <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel in <hi>Limebay</hi> a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Start,</hi> hailed her, and ſhe us.

Our Doctor, and a Merchant that was a Paſſenger, and one Sailor, went on Board, where they ſtaid ſo long until ſome of them were overcome with Wine, altho' they were deſired to beware thereof; ſo that when they came back, a Rope being handed to them, they (being fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Merchant caught hold of a Rope called the Main Sheet, whereby his Life was ſaved. The Sailor not getting ſo much drink, as the other two, got nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly on the Bottom of the Boat, and floated on the Water till ſuch Time as our other Boat was hoiſted out, which was done with great Speed, and we took

him in; but the Doctor was drowned before the Boat came. The Seaman that ſat upon the Boat ſaw him ſink, but could not help him. This was the greateſt Exerciſe that we met with in all our Voyage; and much the more ſo, as the Doctor was of an evil Life and Converſation, and much given to Exceſs in Drinking. When he got on Board the aforeſaid Ship, the Maſter ſent for a Can of Wine, and ſaid,
<q>Doctor, will you drink.</q>
He replied,
<q>Yes, with all my Heart, for I've drank no Wine a great while.</q>

                     <p>In this Year I thought it my Place to enter into a married State, and I acquainted my Father of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and that I inclin'd to make Choice of <hi>Martha Betterton,</hi> a religious young Woman, whom I entirely loved for that Piety, Virtue, and Modeſty, which I beheld in her; <hi>(I was in the twenty-fourth Year of my Age, and ſhe in her twenty-firſt.)</hi> I likewiſe acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Father and Mother with my Intentions, to which both our Parents conſented; her Father ſaying (when I ſpoke him) <hi>Go together, and the Lord bleſs you together.</hi> And my Father ſaid, <hi>If I was worth my Weight in Gold, ſhe deſerved me.</hi> The Heartineſs of both our Fathers in this Matter, was more to me than a Portion of Silver or Gold, of which we had but very little; but our Love to each other was very great, and being well and honourably grounded, it was not eaſily ſhaken. So after Conſent of Parents, we propoſed our Intentions of Marriage to the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meetings unto which we belonged; and becauſe I had been travelling in <hi>America,</hi> I had Certificates from my Brethren there (not only) of my Induſtry and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Miniſtry, with the good Effects thereof, but alſo of my Clearneſs in Relation to Marriage; and after having twice publiſh'd our Intentions, we had Liberty of ſaid Meeting to proceed to the Solemniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Marriage, which was accompliſhed at <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire-Houſe,</hi> in <hi>London</hi> (at a Meeting appointed for that End) on the 28th Day of the ſeventh Month, in the aforeſaid Year, in the Preſence of many hundreds of People, and many worthy Brethren and Elders. A Day of Days it was to my Soul! wherein I was made ſenſible of the Love and Goodneſs of God in a particular Manner, which to me was an earneſt

reported on the Iſland that the Governor had given us a Licenſe to preach (which Report was not true, further than the aforeſaid Diſcourſe) and then we had larger Meetings than before. We had a Meeting at Judge <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Houſe, and one at a Houſe not far from his.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable that this Iſland hath formerly been a very healthy and fruitful Place. Red Cedar, or Sweet Wood, is all the Timber they have in the Iſland, with which they build their Houſes, make their Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Goods, build their Ships and Sloops, and make their Fires; ſo that there is continually a fragrant and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Smell, which we could ſmell at Sea ſometime before we ſaw the Land; and it is yet a pretty healthy and fruitful Iſland, but not ſo healthy and fruitful as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. In one of the Meetings I was concerned to let them know, that it was the Evil of their Ways and Doings that had cauſed the Almighty to with-hold from them the Fruits of the Earth, and to make their Iſland more unhealthful than formerly it was. After Meeting the Judge told me I had ſaid truly, for that was the Cauſe; and if I had ſpoke more to that Matter, or on that Subject, I had done well.

A Molatto Man named <hi>Stavo</hi> (being the Maſter's Servant) went out upon the Bowſprit to hand the Sail, and there came a Sea and waſhed him off; and the Veſſel ran over him; and, in all probability, he had certainly been drowned, had he not been a good Swimmer; for he ſwam, as we judged, three Quarters of a Mile, before he got to the Sloop, it not coming into any one's Mind to lower the Sails, until I ſharply order'd it to be done, which they then did readily; and the Courſe of the Veſſel being

                     <p>After I came Home from <hi>Barbados</hi> and <hi>Bermudas,</hi> I followed my Calling; and kept to Meetings diligently; for I was not eaſy to be idle; either in my ſpiritual or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Callings; and at Times travelled in the Work of the Miniſtry in our own Province (in which there are many large Meetings of Friends, and they increaſe and multiply from time to time.)

Very ſweet was the Love of God to my Soul that Morning, and the Dew of the everlaſting Hills refreſhed me; and I went on my Way Praiſing the Lord, and magnifying the God of my Salvation. In this Journey I met with another remarkable Deliverance, going over a River eight Miles broad, we put our Horſes [we being eight Men, and ſeven Horſes] into two Canoes ty'd together, and our Horſes ſtood with their Fore-feet in one, and their Hind-feet in the other.

Among the many Hundreds that were ſlain, I heard but of three of our Friends being killed, whoſe Deſtruction was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, as I was informed (the one was a Woman, the other two were Men.) The Men uſed to go to their Labour without any Weapons, and truſted to the Almighty, and depended on his Providence to protect them (it being their Principle not to uſe Weapons of War, to offend others, or defend themſelves) but a Spirit of Diſtruſt taking Place in their Minds, they took Weapons of War to defend themſelves; and the <hi>Indians,</hi> who had ſeen them ſeveral Times without them, and let them alone, ſaying,
<q>They were peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men, and hurt nobody, therefore they would not hurt them,</q>
now ſeeing them have Guns, and ſuppoſing they deſigned to kill the <hi>Indians,</hi> they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhot the Men dead. The Woman had remained in her Habitation, and could not be free to go to a fortified Place for Preſervation, neither ſhe, her Son, nor Daughter, nor to take thither the little Ones; but the poor Woman after ſome Time began to let in a ſlaviſh Fear, and did adviſe her Children to go with her to a Port not far from their Dwelling. Her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being one that truſted in the Name of the Lord, <hi>the mighty Tower, to which the Righteous flee and find Safety,</hi> could not conſent to go with her; and having left a particular Account in a Letter to her Children of her and their Preſervation, I think it worthy to be inſerted here in her own Words. <hi>When the cruel</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians <hi>were ſuffered to kill and deſtroy, it was ſhewed me, That I muſt ſtand in a Teſtimony for Truth, and truſt in the Name of the Lord, that was a ſtrong Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and we ſhould wait upon him. And I often deſired my Mother and Huſband to ſit down, and wait upon the Lord, and he would ſhow us what we ſhould do: But
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006297_0055_1028569D1989FAA8"/>
I could not prevail with him, but he would ſay it was too late now, and was in great haſt to be gone; but I could not go with him, becauſe I was afraid of offending the Lord: But ſtill he would ſay I was deluded by the Devil, ſo that my Mother would often ſay,</hi> A Houſe divided could not ſtand; <hi>and ſhe could not tell what to do, altho' ſhe had moſt Peace in ſtaying, yet ſhe had Thoughts of moving, and ſaid to me Child,</hi>
                        <q>Can thee certainly ſay it is revealed to thee that we ſhould ſtay; if it be, I would willingly ſtay, if I was ſure it was the Mind of God.</q>
                        <hi>But I being young, was afraid to ſpeak ſo high, ſaid, Mother, I can ſay that it is ſo with me, that when I think of ſtaying and truſting in the Name of the Lord, I find great Peace and Comfort, more than I can utter, with a Belief we ſhall be preſerved; but when I think of going, O the Trouble and Heavineſs I feel, with a Fear ſome of us ſhould fall by them! And my dear Mother ſighed, and ſaid, "She could not tell what to do." But I ſaid to them, If they would go, I would be willing to ſtay alone; if they found Freedom, I was very willing, for I was afraid of offending the Lord. But ſtill my poor Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band would ſay, "I took a wrong Spirit for the right." And he would ſay how I ſhould know,</hi>
                        <q>For if I was right, I would be willing to condeſcend to him.</q>
                        <hi>And then I ſaid, In Condeſcention to him I would move; but I hoped the Lord would not lay it to my Charge, for was it not to condeſcend to him, I would not move for the World, and after I had given away my Strength, in a little Time there came Men from the Garriſon, with their Guns, and told us, "They came for us," and told us, "The</hi> Indians, <hi>they thought, might be near;" and then away we went; and my Mother went in with my Brother-in-law, altho' I perſuaded her not to do it. But ſhe ſaid,</hi>
                        <q>Why, my Child is there; And why may not I be with her as well as thee?</q>
                        <hi>And ſo we went along to</hi> Hampton, <hi>to my Huſband's Brother's. But O the Fear and Trouble that I felt! And told my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006297_0056_1028569EB00FE0F8"/>
it ſeem'd as if we were going into the Mouths of the</hi> Indians. <hi>And the next Day was the firſt Day of the Week; and our dear Friend,</hi> Lydia Norton, <hi>came with my dear Mother; and in her Teſtimony, ſhe ſaid there was there that was very near to her Life, that was very near Death. O then I was ready to think it would be I, becauſe I believed we had done amiſs in moving, and great Trouble was I in, and told dear</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia <hi>of it; but ſhe comforted me as much as ſhe could, and ſaid, "She did not think it would be I." And my dear Mother went to my Siſter's again, to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, where ſhe found herſelf not eaſy; but, as ſhe often ſaid to many, that ſhe felt herſelf in a beclouded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and more ſhut from Counſel than ever ſhe had been ſince ſhe knew the Truth; and being uneaſy, went to move to a Friend's Houſe that lived in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; and as ſhe was moving, the bloody cruel</hi> Indians <hi>lay by the Way, and killed her. O then how did I lament moving! And promiſed if the Lord would be pleaſed to ſpare my Life, and Huſband, and Children, and carry us Home again, I would never do ſo more. But O the Fear, and Trouble, and Darkneſs, that fell upon me, and many more at that Time! And three or four of us kept our Meeting: But altho' we ſat and waited as well as we could, yet we ſat under a poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded Condition, till we returned Home again, then did the Lord pleaſe to lift up the Light of his Love upon our poor Souls. O then I told my Huſband, altho' he had built a little Houſe by the Garriſon, I could not move again. So he was willing to ſtay while the Winter Seaſon laſted, but told me he could not ſtay when Summer came, for then the</hi> Indians <hi>would be about; and ſo told me,</hi>
                        <q>That if I could not go to the Garriſon, I might go to a Friend's Houſe that was near it.</q>
                        <hi>And I was willing to pleaſe him, if the Lord was willing; and then applied my Heart to know the Mind of Truth, and it was ſhewed me, that if I moved again, I ſhould looſe the Senſe of Truth, and I ſhould never hold up my
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006297_0057_102856A4ACB77E98"/>
Head again. O then I told my Huſband he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſk me to move again, for I durſt not do it. Still he would ſay it was a Notion, till our dear Friend</hi> Thomas Story <hi>came, and told him,</hi>
                        <q>He did not ſee that I could have a greater Revelation than I had.</q>
                        <hi>And ſatisfied my Huſband ſo well that he never aſked me more to go, but was very well contented to ſtay all the Wars; and then Things were made more eaſy, and we ſaw Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the wonderful Works, and of the mighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord, in keeping and preſerving of us, when the</hi> Indians <hi>were at our Doors, and Windows, and other Times; and how the Lord put Courage, in you, my dear Children, don't you forget it, and don't think that you was young, and becauſe you knew little, ſo you feared nothing, but often conſider how you ſtaid at Home alone, when we went to Meetings, and how the Lord preſerved you, and kept you, ſo that no Hurt came upon you: And I leave this Charge upon you, Live in the Fear of the Lord, and ſee you ſet him always before your Eyes, leſt you ſin againſt him: For if I had not feared the Lord, and felt the Comforts of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I never could have ſtood ſo great a Trial, when ſo many judged, and ſaid I was deluded, and that all the Blood of my Huſband and Children, would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at my Hands; but the Lord was near to me, and gave me Strength and Courage, and Faith to truſt in him, for I know his Name to be a ſtrong Tower, yea, and ſtronger than any in the World; for I have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fled there for Safety.

I told him to challenge was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſet a Coward to work, and we were no Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; for he knew we could venture our Lives for our Religion, which I queſtion'd whether he would do for his; ſo I diſmounted, and he having the Bible open in his Hand, I being near him, chanced, againſt my Will and Knowledge, to touch it with my Foot.
<q>Look you, Gentlemen, <hi>ſays he,</hi> he tramples the Word of

For which groſs Abuſe his own Hearers openly rebuked him, and put him to Shame. Then he ſaid,
<q>He would prove us no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt.</q>
                        <hi>I bid him prove himſelf one, and he would do the Buſineſs.</hi>
                        <q>Well, <hi>ſays he,</hi> how ſhall we know who are Chriſt's Miniſters?</q>
                        <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid I in anſwer to him, <hi>art thou willing to be try'd by Chriſt's Rule, for he hath given us a plain Rule to know them by.</hi> "What is that Rule? let's hear it," <hi>ſays he. 'Tis ſhort, but full, namely,</hi> By their Fruits you ſhall know them: For Men don't gather Grapes of Thorns, nor Figs of Thiſtles; <hi>wherefore by their Fruits they are known.</hi> "I deny it, <hi>ſays Prieſt</hi> Crawford <hi>(for that was the Name he went by here, he going under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother elſewhere)</hi> that they are known by their Fruits." <hi>I anſwered, Then thou denies the plain and naked Truth of Chriſt.</hi> So I called aloud to the People to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what a blind Guide they had; and indeed he was wicked, as well as blind, and his Fruits not good; which may make one ſuppoſe, that he was not willing to be try'd by his Fruits: For ſoon after News came that he had a Wife in <hi>England,</hi> and as he had another here, his Fruits were wicked with a Witneſs; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt's Doctrine, no Good could ſpring from his Miniſtry, therefore he proved himſelf by his evil Deeds to be no Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt Near the aforeſaid Place we got a Meeting ſettled, which is called <hi>Little-Creek</hi> Meeting; and about the ſame Time a Meeting was eſtabliſhed, and a Meeting-Houſe built at <hi>Duck-Creek.</hi> The People in thoſe Parts about this Time began mightily to ſee through the formal Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch as preach for Money or Hire, who love the Hire, tho' they don't love to be called Hirelings.</p>

<q>It was an unlawful Aſſembly, the Houſe not being licenſed by Law.</q>
The Juſtices told him,
<q>That he and his People being there to hear, if any unwarrantable or falſe Doctrines was preached, he had a fair Opportunity to lay it open before all the People.</q>
So they deſired him to hear patiently and quietly. He ſeem'd to like the Propoſition, and ſat down by me. We had not ſat down long before I ſtood up, and ſpoke to the People ſome conſiderable Time; and the Lawyer ſat oppoſite to me, and took what I ſaid in Short-Hand, for about Half an Hour; but growing weary, he laid down his Pen, and took out of his Pocket a Bottle of Liquor, or Spirits, and ſaid,
<q>Come, Friend, here is to thee (or you) you have ſpoke a great While, you need ſomething to refreſh you.</q>
So I made a Stop, and ſaid to the People, Here is your Miniſter, and here is ſome of the Fruits of his Miniſtry, of which he and all ſober People may be aſhamed. And then I went on again without any Oppoſition till I had done; but afterwards they were in a Rage, and threatened what they would do to me, if ever I came to have a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more there. But I told 'em if they had Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take our Lives from us, they were not dear to us for the ſake of Chriſt and his Goſpel; and that we did not matter their Threatenings, I deſired the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer to give me a Copy of what he had written: He went about it, but did not do it; neither was he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did in penning my Words; for ſeveral of the People then preſent did bear Witneſs he had not wrote it <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi> nor truly taken the Senſe of what I ſpoke, wherefore I charged him to be Juſt, otherwiſe he had many Witneſſes againſt him; at which the Prieſt bent his Fiſt, and held it up to me, but did not ſtrike me, and away they went in a Fret.

<q>She looked upon our coming to be more than natural, becauſe we did not come to buy, or ſell, or get Gain, but came in Love and Reſpect to them,</q>
and deſired their Well-doing both here and hereafter; and further continued,
<q>That our Meetings among them might be very beneficial to their young People,</q>
and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated a Dream which ſhe had three Days before, and interpreted it, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>That ſhe was in <hi>London,</hi> and that <hi>London</hi> was the fineſt Place ſhe ever ſaw (it was like to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> but much bigger) and ſhe went acroſs ſix Streets, and in the ſeventh ſhe ſaw <hi>William Penn</hi> preaching to the People, which was a great Multitude, and both ſhe and <hi>William Penn</hi> rejoiced to ſee one another; and after Meeting ſhe went to him, and he told her, That in a little Time he would come over and preach to them alſo, of which ſhe was very glad. And now ſhe ſaid her Dream was fulfilled, for one of his Friends was come to preach to them.</q>
And ſhe adviſed them to hear us, and entertain us kindly; and accordingly they did. Here were two Nations of them, the <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's</hi> and the <hi>Shawneſe.</hi> We had firſt a Meeting with the <hi>Seneca's,</hi> with which they were much affected; and they called the other Nation (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Shawneſe</hi>) and interpreted to them what we had ſpoke in their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the poor <hi>Indians</hi> (particularly ſome of the young Men and Women) were under a ſolid Exerciſe, and Concern.

From <hi>Antigua</hi> we ſail'd for <hi>Nevis,</hi> but the Wind being contrary,<note place="margin">Montſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note> we put in at <hi>Montſerrat</hi> (an Iſle that hath a great Mountain in it, on the Top of which is a Hot Spring of Water, which boils up, and the Mud of it is clear Brimſtone; ſome of which we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on Board our Veſſel; the which is admirable, and ſhews the wonderful Works of God. They ſay that the Spring is hot enough to boil an Egg.) From this Iſland we ſailed to <hi>Nevis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nevis.</note> and had Meetings with thoſe few Friends that were there, with whom we parted at the Sea Shore in great Love and Tenderneſs: After which we ſailed to an Iſland called <hi>Anguilla,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anguilla.</note> and were civilly treated there by the Generality of the People; as alſo by the Governor, <hi>George Leonard,</hi> at whoſe Houſe we had Meetings. I remember that after one Meeting the Governor went into his Porch, and took the Bible, and opened it, and ſaid,
<q>By this Book, if People believe the Holy Scriptures, I am able to convince the World, and prove that the People
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006297_0069_102856C8C4A6D778"/>
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> are the People of God, and that they follow the Example and Doctrine of Chriſt, and the Practices of the Apoſtles and primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, nearer than my People in the World;</q>
(<hi>i. e.</hi> generally ſpeaking) At this Iſland ſeveral People were heartily convinced, and did confeſs to the Truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom a Meeting was ſettled. Here was never any Friend before, as the Inhabitants ſaid. <hi>I intreat the Lord Jehovah to preſerve the ſincere-hearted among them in his holy Fear whilſt they remain in this World; and not them only, but all that love and fear him, in all Kindreds and Nations, and amongſt People of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions whatſoever. This, in the univerſal Spirit of God's Divine Love, is the Deſire of my Soul.</hi> Back from <hi>Anguilla</hi> we went to <hi>Nevis,</hi> and from <hi>Nevis</hi> to <hi>Antigua</hi>;<note place="margin">Nevis.</note> and notwithſtanding our Sloop was a dull Sailer,<note place="margin">Antigua.</note> yet we were preſerved from the Enemy, to the Admiration of our ſelves, Friends, and others, our Courſe being in the very Road of the Privateers. Juſt as we got into the Harbour and were landed, a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer came by with a Prize along with her, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, which excited our Thankfulneſs to the Lord for our Preſervation. Here we met with the Packet-Boat bound for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and thence for <hi>England.</hi> We ſtaid a little at the Iſland call'd <hi>Saint Chriſtophers.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophers.</hi>
                        </note> In our Way to <hi>Jamaica</hi> we ſaw a ſmall Privateer, that gave us Chace, and it being calm, ſhe rowed up towards us. The Maſter prepared the Veſſel to fight, hoiſting up his Mainſail, and putting out our Colours. In the Interim ſome were bold, and ſome ſorrowful. One came to me,<note place="margin">Chaced by a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer.</note> and aſked,
<q>What I thought of it? And what I thought of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles now?</q>
I told him I thought I was as willing to go to Heaven, as himſelf was; to which he ſaid nothing, but turned away from me. Another aſked me,
<q>What I would do now?</q>
I told him, I would pray that they might be made better, and that they might be made fit to die. Then in the midſt of their Noſe and Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:006297_0070_102856CECD21D4E8"/>
in Secret I begged of the Almighty, in the Name, and for the Sake of his dear Son, that he would be pleaſed to cauſe a freſh Gale of Wind to ſpring up, that we might be delivered from the Enemy without ſhedding Blood (well knowing that few of them were fit to die) and even whilſt I was thus concerned, the Lord anſwered my Deſire and Prayer, for in a few Minutes the Wind ſprung up, and we ſoon left them out of Sight, our Veſſel ſailing extraordinary well, and the next Day we got to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and had divers Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Port-Royal, Kingſton,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh-Town,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jamaica.</note> &amp;c. At a Meeting at <hi>Spaniſh-Town,</hi> there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom my Heart was very open, and I felt great Love to them, for the Sake of their Fathers <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and they were ſo affected with the Meeting, that they ſent us ſome unleavened Cakes, made with fine Flour and ſweet Oil, it being a Feſtival Time with them. We had a Meeting at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> in a Place where the Earthquake had deſtroyed a large Building, in which Meeting I had occaſion to remind them of the righteous Judgments of God, which had been juſtly inflicted on them for their Sins and Wickedneſs. Some wept, and ſome were rude. The People here, as I was informed, were generally very wicked. After having had divers Meetings, the Packet in which we had taken our Paſſage, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to ſtay but ten Days, we went off ſooner than we otherwiſe ſhou'd have done, and ſolemnly taking Leave of thoſe Friends that were there,<note place="margin">Sails for <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> we went on Board our Veſſel, in order for <hi>England,</hi> by God's Permiſſion. We got readily through the <hi>Windward Paſſage,</hi> which is between the Iſlands of <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi>; and divers Times after we left <hi>Jamaica,</hi> we were chaſed by ſeveral Ships, but they could not come up with us. One Ship of twenty-eight Guns gave us Chace after a great Storm, and was almoſt up with us before we could well make Sail; they being eager of their Prey, ſent their Hands aloft to let their Reefs out of the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006297_0071_102856D052E789E0"/>
in order to make more Speed, and came running mightily towards us, and gained much upon us; we fearing to make Sail by Reaſon of the Storm, and the Sea running very high, and our Maſts being therefore in Danger, we were ſome Time in Doubt whether we ſhould eſcape or not: But whilſt we were in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, down came the French Ship's three Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſts at once, ſo we eſcaped, and left her, and went rejoicing on our Way, that we were thus delivered. This was one of the great and remarkable Deliverances among the many I met with, by the good Hand and Providence of the Lord, my great and good Maſter, whom I hope to ſerve all my Days.</p>
                     <p>After having been at Sea about ſix Weeks, we began to look out for Land, and in two or three Days we founded, and found Ground, at about ninety Fathoms; after which we ſaw two <hi>French</hi> Privateers, that gave us Chace about four a Clock in the Morning, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us vigorouſly; but ſailing better than they, we run them out of Sight by eight a Clock the ſame Morning, and in about two Hours after we ſaw the Land of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>;<note place="margin">On the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> in eminent Danger.</note> it being miſty Weather, with Rain and Wind, our Maſter thought it beſt to lay by and forbear Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What to do now we could not tell, until they began to fire at us; but in this Emergency and Strait our Maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved he would rather run the Veſſel on Shore than they ſhould have her, ſhe being richly laden with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo, Silver, and Gold, reckoned to the Value of Fifty Thouſand Pounds. In this Strait, we muſt either fall into the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> who were our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or run amongſt the Rocks; and we thought it beſt to fall into the Hands of the Almighty, and truſt to his Providence; ſo towards the Rocks we went, which looked with a terrible Aſpect.

                     <p>When I came from my Home at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> I did intend (the Lord permitting) to viſit Friends in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and being accidentally caſt on Shore there, I thought it my Place firſt to go thro' that Nation. I had been in <hi>Ireland</hi> about nine Years before, and then being but young, and now being more grown in Body, my old Acquaintance and Friends did not at firſt know me; but we were kindly and lovingly received by our Friends and Brethren in that Nation, where there is a great and numerous People, that Serve and Worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth, and who have divers good and wholeſome Orders eſtabliſh'd amongſt them, in the Unity and Fellowſhip of the Goſpel. In this Nation we had many and large Meetings after our Landing, viſiting Friends Meetings along to the North, many, not of our Society, coming to them, among whom we often had good Service, to our and their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as they often declared, <hi>Richard Gove</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill with me. Friends from their National Meeting, certified to our Brethren in <hi>America,</hi> of our Service,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006297_0073_102856D522788620"/>
and Labour of Love among them, after we had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled ſeveral Hundred Miles, and viſited Friends Meetings generally, and ſome other Places where it was not uſual. While I was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> under a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Proſperity of Truth and Religion, I wrote an Exhortation to the Youth, and others, which was afterwards printed there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Scotland.</note>We took Ship in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at a Town called <hi>Donaghadet,</hi> being accompanied with divers Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who brought us on our Way after a godly Sort. We got to <hi>Port-Patrick,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> after about five Hours Sail, in order to viſit thoſe few Friends that were ſcattered about in that Part of the Nation. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in thoſe Parts looked very ſhy on us, and did not care to diſcourſe with us on Matters Civil or Religious,<note place="margin">Glaſgow.</note> which I thought unreaſonable. The firſt Town or City we came to in which we had a Meeting, was <hi>Glaſgow</hi> (accounted the ſecond City in <hi>North-Britain</hi>) where, in our Meeting for the Worſhip of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, we were ſhamefully treated by the People, throwing Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I alſo told them, that I had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel of Chriſt among their Brethren in <hi>New-England,</hi> and in <hi>Boſton,</hi> where they formerly hanged the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and cruelly perſecuted them for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and yet they did not treat us ſo brutiſhly even there. And further I told them, that I lived in thoſe Parts of <hi>America,</hi> and what Account I ſhould have to carry Home to their aforeſaid Brethren, of our
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:006297_0074_102856DB52A16CA8"/>
Treatment in <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> the ſecond City in <hi>Scotland.</hi> I deſir'd them to conſider of it, and be aſhamed, if they had any Shame. This a little abaſhed them for the preſent, but afterwards they were as bad as ever. There were at this Meeting divers Collegians, who were very rude. I aſked if that was their Way of treating Strangers? And that I believed their Teachers in the Univerſity did not allow of ſuch ill Manners, by which they ſcandalized themſelves, their City, and Country.<note place="margin">Hamilton <hi>and</hi> Gerſhore.</note> From this City we went to <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Gerſhore,</hi> where they were more civil. At <hi>Gerſhore</hi> a Man of Letters, and ſober Converſation, begged that I would pray to the Almighty, that he would eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh him in the Doctrine which he had heard that Day. This being rare in thoſe Parts, therefore I thus minute it here. We went on towards the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and thereabouts,<note place="margin">1708.</note> where there is a tender-hearted People, among whom we had ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ge Gatherings,<note place="margin">Aberdeen.</note> and ſome that were not of us, expreſs'd their Satisfaction. In the North I met with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who coming from a Nobleman's Houſe, joined me, and aſked me, "If I knew <hi>Robert Barclay?</hi>" I ſaid not perſonally, but by his Writings I knew him well. He told me,
<q>That he <hi>(Barclay)</hi> had not left his Fellow in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        </q>
We afterwards travelled Southward, where there were but few Friends, and ſmall Meetings; yet we may ſay, that the Goodneſs, Love, and Preſence, of Him, who ſaid, <hi>Where two or three are gathered in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> was oftentimes witneſſed to be with us, bleſſed be his Holy Name. Oh! that the Children of Men would praiſe him in Thought, Word, and Deed, for he is worthy. So in great Reverence and holy Fear, we travelled along towards <hi>South-Britain,</hi> had ſeveral Meetings at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and divers other Places;<note place="margin">Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh. Berwick.</note> alſo at <hi>Berwick upon Tweed,</hi> where there were many Soldiers who were very rude. The Devil hath had many Battles with us, ever ſince we were a People, in
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006297_0075_102856DCD85D4248"/>
order to hinder us in our Worſhip, but we generally came off with Victory, as we did here alſo, thro' Faith in His Name, <hi>Who hath loved us, and manifeſted himſelf to us.</hi> Thoſe rude Soldiers throwed their Hats into the Congregation, in order to diſturb us, and hinder us in our Service, but were at laſt aſham'd and diſappointed. At this Place my dear Friend and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-traveller, <hi>Richard Gove,</hi> and I parted: I was for going by the Eaſt Sea Coaſt up for <hi>London,</hi> and he inclin'd towards <hi>Cumberland,</hi> after we had travelled about a Year in the Work of the Miniſtry, in great Love and true Friendſhip, in which Work we were true Helpers one of another; and as we had laboured together in the Work of Chriſt, ſo we parted in His Love. Now from <hi>Berwick</hi> I travelled along to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi>;<note place="margin">Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> had one Meeting by the Way, and ſeveral good Meetings at <hi>Newcaſtle, Sunderland, Shoten,</hi> and <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and ſeveral other Places in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> The Winter coming on apace, it began to be bad travelling; and I being already much ſpent by it, deſign'd to go ſpeedily up to <hi>London</hi>; and taking ſome Meetings in my Way, as at <hi>Stockton, Whitby, Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, Burlington, Hull,</hi> and <hi>Brigg,</hi> and ſo on thro' <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> where I went to viſit a Friend that was Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> becauſe for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Sake he could not pay an ungodly Prieſt the Tythes of his Labour. From <hi>Lincoln</hi> I proceeded to <hi>Huntington,</hi> about which Place we had ſeveral large Meetings, ſo on to <hi>Baldock,</hi> where I met with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and <hi>John Gopſil,</hi> who came from <hi>London</hi> to meet me, which was a joyful Meeting, for I had not ſeen my Father for about nine Years. The Love and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between us, and the Gladneſs in ſeeing each other again, cannot well be expreſſed (but I believe it was ſomewhat like <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Meeting in <hi>Egypt</hi>;) it was affecting and melting: Bleſſed be the Almighty that gave me once more to ſee my tender and aged Parent! So from <hi>Baldock</hi> we went to <hi>Hitching,</hi> and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006297_0076_102856DFA94A4448"/>
had a Meeting there, as alſo at <hi>Hertford,</hi> from whence, with ſeveral Friends, I went to <hi>Enfield,</hi> where I met with my dear and only Brother <hi>George,</hi> and there were with us ſeveral of my Relations, and divers others of our Friends: We were heartily glad to ſee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. From <hi>Enfield</hi> we went forward for <hi>London,</hi> and by the Way we met with ſeveral Friends (of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Horſlydown,</hi> to which I did belong from my Childhood) who came to meet me, and accompanied us to <hi>London.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">London.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſtay'd in and about the City moſt of the Winter, viſiting Meetings when I was well and in Health; for thro' often changing the Climates, I got a ſevere Cold, and was ill for ſeveral Weeks, ſo that I was not at any Meeting, which Time was very tedious to me; not ſo much becauſe of my Illneſs, as that I was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of divers Opportunities and Meetings (which are in that City every Day of the Week except the laſt.) When I was a little got over this Illneſs, I went into <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> and ſome Parts adjacent,<note place="margin">Hertford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. Uxbridge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> and had Meetings at <hi>Staines, Langford, Uxbridge, Walford, Hempſtead, Bendiſh, Albans, Market-Street, Hitching, Hertford, Hodgdon,</hi> and then return'd again to <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After I had been at <hi>London</hi> a while, I viſited ſeveral other Country Meetings, as <hi>Winchmore-Hill,</hi>

                        <hi>Totten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Wanſworth, Plaiſtow, Deptford,</hi> and <hi>Epping,</hi> and then ſtaid about <hi>London</hi> ſome Weeks waiting for a Paſſage for <hi>Holland,</hi> which I intended to viſit before I left my own Habitation.</p>
                     <p>And on the 14th of Firſt Month, 1708-9, I, with my Companion, <hi>John Bell,</hi> after having acquainted our Friends and Relations (having their Conſent) and taking our ſolemn Leave of them, we went down to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and ſtaid there two or three Days for a fair Wind. We went on Board the Ship <hi>Ann, John Duck,</hi> Maſter, bound for <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> in Company with a Fleet of Veſſels waiting for Wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the Wind was fair we ſailed for the Coaſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> and

when we arrived on that Coaſt the Wind was contrary;<note place="margin">1709.</note> and blew very hard, ſo that ſome of the Ships in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany loſt their Anchors, but in a Day or two we all arrived ſafe at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi>

At this City we ſpoke without an Interpreter, becauſe the moſt in the Meeting underſtood <hi>Engliſh.</hi> From <hi>Rotterdam</hi> we travelled by the Trackſcoot, (or Boat, being drawn by Horſes, which is a pleaſant eaſy Way of travelling) to a large Town called <hi>Harlem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Harlem.</note> where we had a Meeting, and ſpoke by an Interpreter; to which Meeting came di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of thoſe People called <hi>Menoniſts</hi>: They were very ſober and attentive, and ſtay'd all the Time of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſpoke well of it.

Some of the Meetings were very large, and the longer we ſtay'd, the larger they were. This <hi>Frederickſtadt</hi> is a City in the Dominions of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and was the fartheſt Place we travelled to Eaſtward; and from hence I wrote a ſmall Piece, called, <hi>A loving Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto Young and Old in</hi> Holland <hi>and elſewhere</hi>; which was tranſlated into the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Low-Dutch</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; and divers Impreſſions of them were alſo printed in <hi>England.</hi>

it being common with them to do the moſt laborious, and the Men the lighteſt and eaſieſt Work.

                     <p>In this Journey between <hi>Frederickſtadt</hi> and <hi>Embden,</hi> we had four Days hard travelling, and were twice overturned out of our Waggons, but we got no Harm, which was admirable to us; for once we fell Waggon and all over a great Bank, juſt by the Side of a large Ditch, and did but juſt ſave ourſelves out of the Ditch. The next Time we overſet upon Stones: We wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that none of us were hurt, particularly myſelf, I being much heavier than any of the reſt; but thro' the Mercy of God, we got well to <hi>Embden</hi> the ſecond Time, and had a Meeting upon a Firſt Day, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Meeting,<note place="margin">Delfzeel.</note> we took Ship for <hi>Delfzeel</hi> (which was from <hi>Embden</hi> about nine or ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles, by Water) and with a fair Gale of Wind, got there in leſs than two Hours Time.

which was declared by the Help and Grace of Chriſt; and many Times, my Heart was, by the Aſſiſtance of that Grace, wonderfully opened to the People. If I ſhould be particular in the Account of theſe Journies, it would enlarge this Part of my Journal more than I am willing.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Virginia</hi> I had a Meeting at <hi>James'</hi> River, where a Prieſt of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with ſome of his Hearers, made ſome Oppoſition (after our Meeting was over) and were for diſputing about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and he openly declared,
<q>The Spirit was not his Guide, nor Rule; and he hoped, never ſhould be. But, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> the Scriptures were his Rule, and that there was no Need of any other; and that they were as plain as <hi>Gunter</hi>'s Line, or as 1, 2, 3.</q>
I told him, <hi>The Scriptures were a good ſecondary Rule, and that it were well if Men would ſquare their Lives according to their Directions; which we, as a People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exhorted all to: But that the Holy Spirit, from which the Holy Scriptures came, muſt needs be preferable to the Letter, that came from it; and without which Holy Spirit,</hi> The Letter kills, <hi>as ſaith the Apoſtle.</hi> I alſo aſked him, <hi>How he, or any elſe, without the Light, or Influence of the Holy Spirit, could underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were parabolically and allegorically expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in many Places?</hi> And further to uſe his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>How could any underſtand</hi> Gunter's <hi>Line, without</hi> Gunter<hi>'s Knowledge? Or without they were taught by</hi> Gunter, <hi>or ſome other?</hi> Neither can we be the Sons of God, without the Spirit of God. Which he anſwered not, but went away.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>New-England,</hi> one <hi>Joſeph Metcalf,</hi> a Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Teacher, at <hi>Falmouth,</hi> wrote a Book, entitled, <hi>Legal Forcing a Maintenance for a Miniſter of the Goſpel, warrantable from Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. Which Book, a Friend of <hi>Sandwich</hi> gave me, and deſired I would anſwer it; which, after finding ſome Exerciſe on my Mind, for the Cauſe of Truth, I was willing
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:006297_0092_102857107A0604E8"/>
to undertake; and accordingly, wrote an Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which I called, <hi>Forcing a Maintenance, not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable from the Holy Scriptures, for a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</hi> In which I endeavoured to ſet the Texts of Scripture in a true Light, which he had darkened and miſrepreſented by his chimerical Doctrines.</p>
                     <p>In this Year, 1713, I went from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in the <hi>Hope Galley, John Richmond,</hi> Maſter, to <hi>South-Carolina.</hi> We were about a Month at Sea; and when it pleaſed God that we arrived at <hi>Charles-Town,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">South-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina.</note> in <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> we had a Meeting there, and divers others afterwards. There are but few Friends in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; yet I had ſeveral Meetings in the Country. The People were generally loving, and received me kindly. What I had to declare to them, I always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſpeak to the Witneſs of God in the Soul, and according to the pure Doctrine of Truth in the Holy Scriptures; and there was Openeſs in the People in ſeveral Places. I was ſeveral Times to viſit the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who was courteous and civil to me. He ſaid, "I deſerved Encouragement;" and ſpoke to ſeveral to be generous, and contribute to my Aſſiſtance. He meant an outward Maintenance; for he would have me encouraged to ſtay among them. But I told him, that tho' it might be a Practice with them, to maintain their Miniſters, and pay them Money for preaching, it was contrary to our Principle to be paid for preaching; agreeable to the Command of our great Maſter, Chriſt Jeſus, who ſaid to his Miniſters, <hi>Freely you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, freely give:</hi> So that we are limited by his Words, whatever others are: And thoſe who take a Liberty, contrary to his Doctrine and Command, I think, muſt be <hi>Antichriſt</hi>'s, according to Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The longer I ſtaid there, the larger our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were; and when I found my ſelf free and clear of thoſe Parts, I took my Paſſage for <hi>Virginia,</hi> in a Sloop, <hi>Henry Tucker,</hi> Maſter.

                     <p>About this Time I had an Inclination to alter my Condition of being a Widower, to a married State; and the moſt ſuitable Perſon that I (with ſome of my good Friends could think upon, was <hi>Martha,</hi> the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Joſeph Brown:</hi> And on the 15th of the Second Month,<note place="margin">1714.</note> 1714, we were joined together in Marriage, with the Unity of Friends in general. We had a large Meeting at our Marriage, the Solemnization thereof being attended with the Grace and Goodneſs of God; and, for Example-ſake, we made but little Proviſion for our Gueſts: For great Entertainments at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and Funerals, began to be a growing Thing among us, which was attended with divers Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies.</p>
                     <p>My Wife was a ſober and religious young Woman, and of a quiet natura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Holy Scriptures, <hi>A meek and quiet Spirit is with the Lord of great Price.</hi>

                     <p>The firſt Child we had I called <hi>Abigail</hi> (or the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Joy, as the Word ſignifies) and while ſhe lived, I had Joy and Comfort in her, even more than I could expect, her Age conſidered; for ſhe lived but about eighteen Months, yet in that Time gave frequent Proofs of an uncommon Capacity, and dropt ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Expreſſions, that I have ſaid to her Mother,
<q>This Child is too ripe for Heaven to live long on Earth, therefore let us not ſet our Hearts upon it.</q>
And I have thought that in this Child the Saying of Chriſt was fulfilled, even in the Letter of it, <hi>Out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings, thou haſt perfected Praiſe,</hi> Mat. xxi. 16.</p>
                     <p>I was at divers Yearly Meetings in 1715,<note place="margin">1715.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Choptank</hi> in <hi>Maryland</hi>;<note place="margin">Maryland. Shrewſbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

I was likewiſe at divers other Meetings in thoſe Provinces; which were large and ſatisfactory.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Salem</hi> Yearly Meeting I was ſent for to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where there was a young Woman that was to be try'd for her Life. She deſir'd that I would pray for her, and charged me to warn the young People to be careful not to keep bad Company:
<q>For, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> it has been my Ruin, and brought me to this Shame and Reproach.</q>
She had been tenderly brought up and educated. I knew her when ſhe wore a Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Gold Chains, tho' now ſhe wore Iron ones: Upon which Subject I had afterwards a large Opportunity to ſpeak to the People in a very moving Manner; which ſeem'd to very much affect the Youth, and others in the Meeting, which conſiſted of many Hundreds of People. I ſaw this young Woman afterwards, the Jury acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her; and I told her, that her Life was given her for

a Prey; and reminded her, how it was with her when ſhe was in Priſon in Chains; and I adviſed her to walk more circumſpectly for the future; which ſhe ſaid, ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould do.</p>

                        <note place="margin">1716.</note>In the Year 1716, I had ſome Concerns which drew me to the Iſland of <hi>Bermudas</hi> (to which Iſland I went twice that Summer.) My Family increaſing, I traded a little to Sea for their Support and Maintenance: And I can truly ſay, I carried on my Affairs and Buſineſs in the Fear of God, having an Eye, or Regard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, more to his Glory, than to my own Intereſt. We had a rough Paſſage to this Iſland (in the firſt Voyage) and were forced, by Diſtreſs of Weather, to caſt ſome of our Goods into the Sea; and the Storm being very violent, ſome of the Seamen thought we ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the Waves; and as for me, they had ſhut me up in the Cabin alone, all in Darkneſs, and the Water came in ſo that they were forced to take it out in Buckets.<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> When the Storm was a little over, the Maſter came to me, and aſked,
<q>How I did all alone in the Dark?</q>
I told him, <hi>Pretty well</hi>; and ſaid to him, <hi>I was very willing to die, if it ſo pleaſed God:</hi> And indeed I did expect no other at that Time. After this great Storm was over we arrived at <hi>Bermudas</hi> in a few Days;<note place="margin">Bermudas.</note> but going into the Harbour the Bottom of the Veſſel ſtruck the Rocks, but we got well in; for which I was thankful to the Almighty. I ſtay'd on the Iſland about a Month, and had ſeveral Meetings, to ſome of which, many came who were not called Friends. They were all ſober, and ſome well ſatisfied; and the People of the Iſland generally received me lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, and were very kind to me. <hi>(Our Ancients, who bore he Burden and Heat of the Day, met with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>By Reaſon of my outward Affairs, I had Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities with ſome Perſons of great Note and Buſineſs
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:006297_0096_1028571B48BCC160"/>
on this Iſland; and ſometimes opened the Principles of Friends to their Satisfaction; ſome of them cold me,
<q>They never underſtood ſo much concerning our Friends before; and if what I ſaid was true, they had been miſinformed.</q>
Divers ſuch Opportunities I had with ſeveral on this Iſland, there being but very few of our Society.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are called the <hi>Sommer Iſlands,</hi> or <hi>Bermudas,</hi> there being many little Iſlands in the midſt of the Main Iſland, in Form like a Horſe-ſhoe, and are about two Hundred Leagues Diſtance from the Capes of <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</hi> It is rare to ſee Hail, Snow, or Ice there.</p>
                     <p>After I had done my Buſineſs,<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> and had been for ſome Time on the Iſland, I had a ready and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Paſſage Home, where I was joyfully received.</p>
                     <p>After ſome little Stay at Home,<note place="margin">Bermudas.</note> I went the ſecond Time (that Summer) to <hi>Bermudas,</hi> and then alſo I had ſome Meetings, and did ſome Buſineſs on the Iſland. It was my conſtant Care, that my worldly Affairs ſhould not hinder me in my religious Concern for the Good of Souls. It happened at this Time there was a mighty Hurricane of Wind, ſo that it blew many Houſes to the Ground, and very many Trees up by the Roots, and rent divers Rocks aſunder, which I was an Eye-Witneſs of: Tho' it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that thoſe Rocks in the <hi>Sommer Iſlands,</hi> are not ſo hard as in ſome other Parts of the World, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the Northward; for here they ſaw them with Saws, and cut them with Axes like Wood. I was told there were ſixty Sail of Veſſels then at theſe Iſlands, and all drove on Shore but three, and ours was one of the three that rode out the Storm; for which I was truly thankful. In this great Storm, or Hurricane, ſeveral Sloops (there being no Ships) were driven upon dry Land, ſo that after the Storm was over, one might go round them at High Water, and ſeveral blown off the dry Land into the Water. One that was ready to be launch'd, tho' faſtened
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:006297_0097_102857AFC9ECC580"/>
on the Stocks with two Cables and Anchors put deep in the Ground, yet the Violence of the Wind blew her into the Water, and daſhed her all to Pieces.</p>
                     <p>About this Time the <hi>Bermudas</hi> People had got a vaſt Treaſure of Silver and Gold, out of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wrecks; and at a Meeting which I had with a pretty many People on the Firſt Day of the Week before the Hurricane, or Storm of Wind, it came weightily on my Mind to exhort them <hi>Not to be lifted up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, nor exalted in Pride: For I declared to them, that the ſame Hand that took it from the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>could take it from thoſe who had now got it out of the Sea; and if he pleaſed, by the ſame Way; which was a Storm that caſt away the Ships going from</hi> Spain. <hi>And indeed ſo it happened the ſame Week; for it was reckoned by Men of Experience and Judgment, that they had laſt more by the Storm, than they had gained by the Wrecks of the Spaniards.</hi> A ſober old Man (not of our Profeſſion) told me the next Day after the Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane was over, that what I ſpoke in the Meeting was ſoon come to paſs: And he added, I was a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to them. Many Houſes that were not blown down, were uncovered. My Landlord's Houſe being old, ſeveral thought it would be down; but by the good Providence of God, it was one of them which ſtood. I was in my Store, which ſtood alſo; tho' I expected every Minute when it would have been blown down. It was by the Mercy of God we were preſerv'd, and not for any Merit of ours. I intreated the Lord in the midſt of this great Wind, that he would pleaſe to ſpare the Lives of the People; for many of them being Seafaring Men, were very unfit to die; at which Time I thought I was ſenſible of the Anſwer of my Prayer, and he was pleaſed to be intreated for them: For, notwithſtanding the Violence of the Storm, and the great Deſtruction it made, yet not one Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or Child, nor Creature was loſt, that I heard of in all the Iſland, which was to me very admirable.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:006297_0098_102857B3C54D1610"/>
The Friend of the Houſe came to me after the Storm abated, and ſaid,
<q>The Lord had heard my Prayers for them.</q>
Altho' they could not by any outward Knowledge, know that I had prayed for them, yet they had a Senſe given them, that I was concerned for them before the Almighty; which indeed was true. <hi>Oh! that we may never forget the merciful Viſitations of that High and Lofty One, who inhabits Eternity!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While I was on the Iſland I was invited to, and kindly entertained at the Houſes of ſeveral of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and at the Governor's, who invited me ſeveral Times to his Houſe: And once I was with him, and ſome of his chief Officers at Dinner, with divers of the firſt Rank, where I was treated very kindly; and after Dinner the Governor's Practice was to drink the King's Health, and he hoped I would drink it along with them.
<q>Yes, <hi>ſaid the reſt at the Table,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chalkley</hi> (as they called me) will ſurely drink the King's Health with us.</q>
So they paſſed the Glaſs, with the King's Health, till it came to me; and when it came to me, they all looked ſtedfaſtly at me, to ſee what I would do (and I looked as ſtedfaſtly to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty) and I ſaid to them, I love King <hi>George,</hi> and wiſh him as well as any Subject he hath; and it is known to Thouſands that we pray for him in our Meetings and Aſſemblies for the Worſhip of Almighty GOD: But as to drinking Healths, either the King's, or any Man's elſe, it is againſt my profeſſed Principle, I looking on it to be a vain, idle Cuſtom. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<q>That they wiſhed the King had more ſuch Subjects as I was; for I had profeſſed a hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for him:</q>
And the Governor and they were all very kind and friendly to me all the Time I was on the Iſland.</p>
                     <p>After I had finiſhed my Concerns I embarked in the Sloop <hi>Dove</hi> for <hi>Philadelphia</hi> (ſhe being conſign'd to me in the former and this Voyage.) It being often calm and ſmall Winds, our Proviſion grew very ſcanty.
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:006297_0099_102857B54B016DB8"/>
We were about twelve Perſons in the Veſſel, ſmall and great, and but one Piece of Beef left in the Barrel; and for ſeveral Days, the Wind being contrary, the People began to murmur, and told diſmal Stories about People eating one another for Want of Proviſions; and the Wind being ſtill againſt us, and, for ought we could ſee, like to continue, they murmured more and more, and at laſt, againſt me in particular (becauſe the Veſſel and Cargo was conſign'd to me, and was under my Care) ſo that my inward Exerciſe was great about it; for neither myſelf, nor any in the Veſſel, did imagine that we ſhould be half ſo long as we were on the Voyage: But ſince it was ſo, I ſeriouſly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſtop their Murmuring, I told them they ſhould not need to caſt Lots (which was uſual in ſuch Caſes) which of us ſhould die firſt, for I would freely offer up my Life to do them Good. One ſaid, "God bleſs you, I will not eat any of you." Another ſaid, "He would die before he would eat any of me;" and ſo ſaid ſeveral. I can truly ſay, on that Occaſion, at that Time, my Life was not dear to me, and that I was ſerious and ingenuous in my Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And as I was leaning over the Side of the Veſſel, thoughtfully conſidering my Propoſal to the Company, and looking in my Mind to him that made me, a very large Dolphin came up towards the Top or Surface of the Water, and looked me in the Face; and I called the People to put a Hook into the Sea, and take him, for here is one come to redeem me (ſaid I to them;) and they put a Hook into the Sea, and the Fiſh rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily took it, and they caught him. He was longer than myſelf: I think he was about ſix Foot long, and the largeſt that ever I ſaw. This plainly ſhew'd us that we ought not to diſtruſt the Providence of the Almighty. The People were quieted by this Act of Providence, and murmured no more. We caught enough to eat plentifully till we got into the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.
Buſh <hi>and</hi> Gurpaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Rivers,</hi> Maryland.</note> about which Time, at <hi>Buſh-River,</hi> ſeveral were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. The Meeting I found in a growing Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that which is Good, ſeveral Perſons meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Silence to worſhip God, according to Chriſt's Inſtitution, which was, and is, and ever will be, in Spirit and in Truth: And for the Encouragement of all ſuch, Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>That ſuch the Father ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to worſhip him:</hi> And again, <hi>Where two or three are met together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> And if Chriſt be in the midſt, there is no abſolute Need of vocal Teaching, except it be the Will of the Lord to call any to it. Let the ſpiritual Chriſtian read and judge.</p>
                     <p>After my Return I had ſeveral Meetings in the Country, near <hi>Philadelphia</hi>;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> &amp;c.</note> and about the latter End of the Eighth Month I was at divers Marriages, one of which was on the Third Day of the Week, about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Miles above <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> over <hi>Delaware</hi> River: The next was over the River again, about twenty Miles below the City: The third was about twenty
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:006297_0101_102857BCE510B560"/>
Miles further down the River,<note place="margin">1717.</note> and on the oppoſite Side at <hi>Salem</hi> (on the following Days;) ſo that I croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Delaware</hi> River three Times in three Days, and rode about one Hundred Miles. The Meetings were all large, and Matter ſuitable to the Occaſion freely opened to the People. Theſe Remarks are not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet up Man, or exalt Fleſh, but to ſtir up others to come up to the Work of Chriſt in their Generation: All the Glory and Godlineſs of Man is but at the Graſs, which ſoon withers, without we dwell in the Root of true Religion, and holy Life of Chriſt; and that God may have the Glory of all his Works, is the End of all the Labours and Travels of the Servants and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In the Tenth Month, 1717, divers Conſiderations moving me thereto,<note place="margin">Takes a Voyage to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bados.</hi>
                        </note> I took a Voyage to <hi>Barbados,</hi> in the Snow Hope, <hi>J. Curtis,</hi> Maſter, and from thence to <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>London</hi>; partly on account of Buſineſs, and hoping once more, if it pleaſed God, to ſee my aged Father, my Brother, Relations, and Friends; which Voyage I undertook in the ſolid Fear of God. I deſired the Concurrence of my Wife, and my Friends and Brethren of the Meeting to which I did belong, in this Undertaking, the which I had in a general Way, and the good Wiſhes and Prayers of many Particulars, with a Certificate from our Monthly Meeting, ſignifying their Unity with my Converſation and Miniſtry, and preſent Undertaking: And I felt the Love and Goodneſs of God therein, but in many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it was a great Croſs to me, as the leaving my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Wife and Children, and many of my dear Friends, whom I loved well in Chriſt: And the Croſſing of the Seas always was troubleſome to me, being ſickly at Sea, eſpecially in windy or ſtormy Weather; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement was worſe to me for the Time than a Priſon; for it would be much eaſier to me to be in Priſon on Land, upon a good Account, than in Priſon at Sea,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:006297_0102_102857BFB7E38690"/>
I always looking on a Ship to be a perilous Priſon, tho' my Lot was to be much therein: And as for my natural Life, I always gave it up when ever I went to Sea; and I thought that was the leaſt Part of the Hardſhip, never putting much Value thereon; and I think I had rather die at any Time, than go to Sea, it being ſo contrary to my Nature and Diſpoſition, as well as Inclination: But to Sea I went, for the Reaſons mentioned, and got from <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> the firſt Night in ſaid Veſſel, and to <hi>Elſinburgh</hi> next Day, where we lay for a fair Wind about two Days; and when the Wind was fair, we ſail'd to <hi>Bombay-Hook,</hi> where we met with two other Veſſels bound out to Sea, who waited alſo for the Wind. We lay there two Nights, and then on a Firſt-Day Morning ſet Sail, the Weather being bitter cold, and the Ice very thick on the Sides of our Veſſel, and on our Ropes. The ſame Day that we left <hi>Bombay-Hook</hi> we got out to Sea, took in our Boat, and went on our Way;<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> and in four or five Days we got into warmer Weather.</p>
                     <p>In this Voyage I wrote ſomething of the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> uſed by ſome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Converſations were very looſe and corrupt, which I entitled, <hi>One truly tender Scruple of Conſcience, about that Form of Prayer called the</hi> Common Prayer, <hi>as uſed by the Church of</hi> England <hi>and her Members,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In this our Voyage we ſaw ſeveral Ships, but ſpoke with none; and in twenty-ſeven Days from our Capes we arrived at <hi>Barbados,</hi> and came to an Anchor in <hi>Carliſle-Bay.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Barbados.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I had been twice in <hi>Barbados</hi> before, but this was the quickeſt Paſſage by one Day. Here I was loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and tenderly received by my Friends. I took my good Friend, <hi>Joſeph Gamble</hi>'s Houſe, for my Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, moſt of the Time whilſt I ſtay'd on the Iſland; and I viſited Friends Meetings ſeveral Times over,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:006297_0103_102857C1423CBD18"/>
there being five of Friends Meeting-Houſes in the Iſland, and our Meetings were ſometimes large and open.</p>
                     <p>Our Stay was longer here than we at firſt expected, by Reaſon of a great Drought, they having no Rain for more than a Quarter of a Year, which was a great Hindrance to Trade on the Iſland. While I was this Time in <hi>Barbados</hi> our ancient Friend <hi>George Gray</hi> died. I was at his Funeral, at which there were many People; and on this Occaſion we had a large Meeting in our Meeting-Houſe at <hi>Speights-Town,</hi> where I had a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Opportunity with the People, opening to them the Neceſſity of preparing for, and thinking of their latter End; and preſſed them earneſtly thereto. They were generally attentive and ſober, and ſome were broken into Tenderneſs. While we were burying the Friend there appeared a diſmal Cloud hanging over the Iſland, ſuch an one as I never ſaw before: It was to my thinking, of the Colour of the Flame of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and I expected there would have been a great Storm, or ſome mighty Guſt, and much Rain, they having had very little for many Weeks, or ſome Months: but it went over, and there was no Rain, nor Wind, as I remember. Soon after ſome People came in from Sea, and they ſaid, that from that Cloud it rained Aſhes; and they brought ſome of the ſame to the Iſland, ſome of which Aſhes I have now before me: The taſte of them ſeems to me to be a little ſulphurous, and have ſome glittering Particles in them, in Colour and Smell I think they differed little from common Aſhes. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Almighty and Infinite Being ſignally ſhewed his Mercy and Favour to poor Mortals; for had not his Mercy prevented, he could as eaſily have rained down the Fire as the Aſhes, who rained down Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone on the Cities and Inhabitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> for their Pride and Idleneſs, much of which abounds among the Inhabitants of <hi>Barbados,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being very luxurious. Oh! may the luxurious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:006297_0104_102857C469812710"/>
of that Iſle, as alſo all others, conſider their Ways and Doings, and not provoke the Great Lord, the Sovereign of Heaven and Earth, as many of them do by their evil Lives, and voluptuous Converſations; and that they would kiſs his Son, tho' not with a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>' Kiſs, of Profeſſion, or ſpeaking well or fair of him only, but with divine Love manifeſted through Obedience, while his Wrath is but a little kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them before it break out into a Flame.</p>
                     <p>After this Funeral I was ſent for to <hi>Bridge-Town,</hi> to the Burial of a Maſter of a Ship, a young Man, who was very freſh and well a few Days before. There was a great Appearance of People, and I was pretty largely opened in the Meeting, on the Words of the Prophet, where he ſays, <hi>All Fleſh is Graſs, and all the Goodlineſs thereof, is as the Flower of the Field. The Graſs withereth, the Flower fadeth, becauſe the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: Surely the People is Graſs. The Graſs withereth, the Flower fadeth; but the Word of our God ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> Iſaiah lx. 6, 7, 8. And I treated of this Word, its Wonderfulneſs, its Duration, and its Work in Man: As alſo of the fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſtitution of mortal Man, tho' young and ſtrong, as that young Man was a few Days before, whoſe Corpſe was then before us.</p>
                     <p>I was at divers other Burials on this Iſland, which indeed doth prove a Grave to many New-comers, it being a hot Climate, makes thoſe who are not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to it, very thirſty, and by Reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Heat, it is not eaſy to quench their Thirſt; ſo that what is called moderate Drinking, throws many Strangers into a violent Fever, and oftentimes is the Cauſe of their Death. I note this as a Caution to any who may tranſport themſelves there (that may ſee this) that they may ſhun that Danger, which might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by drinking cool Drinks, of which they have many Sorts very pleaſant, <hi>viz.</hi> Cane, Sugar-reed, and
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:006297_0105_102857C8D1C82F60"/>
White Sorrel, Pine, Orange, and divers others: And I adviſe ſuch, as they love their Health, to refrain from drinking much hot Drinks or Spirits.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw ſeveral Curioſities in Nature in this Iſland, which among the great Numbers of the Works of God, do ſhew forth his Praiſe and Glory. One to the Leeward Part of the Iſland, which is called the Spout, ſends up a vaſt Body of Water into the Air, occaſioned by a great Cavity in the Rocks under the Water, which may be ſeen in calm Weather, when the Sea is low; but when the Wind blows (a great Body of Water being pent in a large hollow Place) it forces it up into the Air, ſometimes ten, fifteen, and twenty Yards high, according as the Strength of the Wind is more or leſs, and makes a Report like a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, or Thunder a great Way off. I believe I have ſeen it ten or twelve Miles out at Sea. I was alſo at a Place called <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Cave, which we got to with ſome Difficulty, in going down the ſteep and craggy Rocks. There is on the outward Part next the Sea, a very large, vaulted Place in the Form of a Half-circle, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one hundred Foot high, as near as I could gueſs. In this large Vault, behind a Rock, is the Mouth of the Cave, not the Height of a Man at the firſt Entrance; after one is in, a few Yards, one may walk upright com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, the Bottom being pretty plain and ſmooth for about a hundred Yards, and then we come into a large Cave which is form'd archwiſe, and about ten or fifteen Yards high, as we thought, being much higher in the Middle than the Sides, but almoſt as regular as if it had been done by Art, which we beheld with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, by the Help of Wax-Candles, and other Lights, that we made and carried for that Purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>When I had done my Buſineſs in <hi>Barbados,</hi> having been about thirteen Weeks there, our Veſſel being load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ſailed from thence the 10th of Second Month, 1718, for <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:006297_0106_10282E18F77E19B8"/>We had a good Paſſage,<note place="margin">1718.</note> being five Weeks and two Days from <hi>Barbados</hi> to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in which we ſaw divers Veſſels at Sea, but ſpoke with none;<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> and after Sight of the Land, we got in two Days to <hi>Beachy-Head,</hi> which is about fifteen Leagues from the <hi>Downs</hi> or <hi>Deal.</hi> We ſailed along Shore by <hi>Folkſtone,</hi> where we took in a Pilot, and had a comfortable Paſſage through the <hi>Downs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">London.</note> and up the River of <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where I met with my dear and aged Father, and loving Brother, Siſter, and Couſins, and many other of my near and dear Relations and Friends.</p>
                     <p>In this Voyage I wrote ſome Things which opened in my Mind at Sea, upon that excellent Sermon of Chriſt's upon the <hi>Mount,</hi> as it is recorded in the Holy Scriptures of the New Teſtament, in the vth, vith, and viith Chapters of the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew,</hi> but have ſince heard that the ſame is much better done by an abler Hand; and therefore it may ſuffice here to give the Advice, which in the Courſe of my Travels I have often had occaſion to do, that the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity ſhould frequently read this Sermon, and be careful to practice the ſame; that they may not only be Chriſtians in Name, but in Deed, and in Truth.</p>
                     <p>After viſiting my Relations, and ſome Meetings of our Friends in, and about <hi>London,</hi> and having finiſhed my Buſineſs, being ready to return homeward, divers Friends accompanied us from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Graveſend</hi>; and the Wind not being fair, we went to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and had a Meeting there; and then back to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and there took a ſolemn Farewel of our Friends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending one another to the Grace of Chriſt; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Time made but little Stay in <hi>Britain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Fifth Month, 1718, we ſailed from the <hi>Downs</hi> in the aforeſaid Snow <hi>Hope,</hi> divers Friends,<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> 
                        <hi>viz. John Danſon, Iſaac Hadwin, John Oxley, Lydia Lancaſter, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth Rawlinſon</hi> and <hi>Rebecca Turner,</hi> being in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with us: After about nine Weeks Paſſage from Land to Land, having had Meetings Firſt Days and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:006297_0107_102857CB8D4EBD00"/>
Fifth Days on board all the Voyage, we came all ſafe and well to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> thro' the Bleſſing of God, where I ſtay'd with my Family a few Months, and then took another Voyage for <hi>Barbados</hi> and <hi>Britain.</hi> I was under ſome Concern more than ordinary, as to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Well-being, or Accommodation of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the Circumſtances thereof being a little changed by the Increaſe of Children, remembring the Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>That thoſe who had not that Care and Concern, were worſe than Infidels</hi>; my Lord Jeſus (whoſe Servant I profeſs myſelf to be) alſo ſaying, <hi>It is better to give than receive</hi>; wherefore an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offering of the Conſignment of a Veſſel and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go (the Snow <hi>Hope, Warner Holt,</hi> Maſter) to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bados,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London,</hi> and ſo to make Returns Home again, for <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> I embraced it; tho' with Reluctance, to leave my very loving Wife, Children, and Friends, all whom I tenderly loved and reſpected. I alſo had in my Eye an Hope, thro' the Bleſſing of God, to obtain wherewith to accommodate my Friends, who were Strangers and Pilgrims in this World for Jeſus Sake, as I alſo had been myſelf; and that they might find a Place or Home, and Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under my Roof; not to Exceſs, but to Comfort and Edification; which in Sincerity, is all the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur I covet or deſire in this World: So after due Conſideration, on the ſecond Day of the Eleventh Month, 1718, we ſet Sail from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> many Friends taking their Leaves and Farewel of us for that Voyage. Thus with Hearts full of Love and Good-Will, we parted with our Friends, and went down the River about five Miles, where we ran aground, but got off next Tide, and next Day came to an Anchor at <hi>Cheſter.</hi> On the 4th Day of the Month we ſet Sail, and got to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> about the 11th Hour; it being Meeting-Day, we went to Meeting, where our great Lord was pleaſed in ſome good Meaſure to own us with his living Preſence, and comfort us with his
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:006297_0108_102857CE818CED48"/>
Love; bleſſed be his Holy Name! In the Morning we ſailed to <hi>Reedy Iſland,</hi> where we ſtay'd for the Tide, and in the Night our Cable parted, which we knew not till the Morning, and then we had gone from the Place where we anchored, above a League: But tho' the Veſſel drove about the River, yet ſhe did not go on Ground. We dropp'd our other Anchor, and ſent the Boat to ſeek for that which was parted from us, but could not find it until the next Tide, and then could not get it up, and were unwilling to go to Sea without it; which occaſioned us to ſtay ſeveral Tides before we could get it: At laſt with much Difficulty we weigh'd it, our Men's Clothes being much frozen; for it was very cold, and froze extremely hard. After this we went down to <hi>Bombay-Hook,</hi> where was alſo another Veſſel going out to Sea. Next Day the Wind was againſt us, and it ſnowed much, and froze hard; and that Night the River and Bay was filled with Ice as far as we could ſee, and it drove very hard againſt our Veſſel, ſo that we wiſhed for Day; for we thought ſometimes it would have torn her Bows into Pieces; but our Anchor and Cable held us, we thought, to a Miracle (for which we were thankful to the great Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all thoſe who put their Truſt in him.) When the Tide turned for us we got up the Anchor, and ſo let her drive with the Ice down the Bay: The other Veſſel did the ſame. It was now dangerous moving, go which we would. The Veſſel in Company with us attempted to go back again, but ſeeing that we did not, as we ſuppos'd, came to Anchor again, and we both went down the Bay together; and the Wind ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up fair, we got clear of the Ice in ſome few Hours Time; but by this Hindrance we could not get to Sea that Day, but were obliged to come to Anchor near the Middle of the great Bay of <hi>Delaware,</hi> and the Night being fair and calm, we rode it out ſafely, which if it had been windy Weather, would have been dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. Early in the Morning (of the 9th Day of the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:006297_0109_102857D04BCD1E40"/>
Month) we got to Sea, and ſoon left Sight of the Land.<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> Next Day the Wind was high, and the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proved ſtormy for ſeveral Days, inſomuch that our Main-deck was under Water moſt of the Time, ſo that we were forced to go before it for ſeveral Days together. We alſo ſhut up our Cabin Windows, and were toſſed exceedingly, and I was very Sea-ſick; and we began in this Storm to fear falling on the Rocks of <hi>Bermudas,</hi> which we were near, as we imagined, and the Wind ſet right on the Iſland. But when we had paſſed the Latitude of <hi>Bermudas,</hi> we met with fair Weather and Winds (all the remaining Part of our Paſſage being pleaſant and comfortable) by which I was led to conſider the Viciſſitude which Mortals may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect while on this unſtable terraqueous Globe, which is full of Changes; and I ſtrongly deſired to be rightly prepared for that World which is eternal, and its Joy and Felicity permanent; at which bleſſed Port, I hope in God's Time, thro' his Grace, ſafely to arrive. Thus thro' Storms, Tempeſts, Ice, and Snow, we left thoſe frozen Climes, and croſſed the Tropick of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> (between which, and that of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> there is neither Froſt nor Snow at Sea, at any Time of the Year) and the Wind always within a ſmall Matter one Way, <hi>viz.</hi> Eaſterly (except in Hurricanes and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Storms, which ſometimes they have in thoſe Parts of the World.) We arriv'd at <hi>Bridge-Town,</hi> in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bados,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Barbados.</note> in one-and-twenty Days, which was the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Paſſage that I ever had, this being the fourth Time of my coming hither, where I was always kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by my Friends.</p>
                     <p>About this Time War was declared againſt <hi>Spain</hi> by the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> by Proclamation, in <hi>Bridge-Town,</hi> which put ſuch a damp on Trade, that there was little Buſineſs, and the Markets low and dull, which made my Stay longer than I would have choſe; but my Friends, among whom I had many Opportunities, ſeem'd rather pleas'd than otherwiſe;
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:006297_0110_102857D30B9B2D18"/>
telling me,<note place="margin">1719.</note>
                        <q>That they did not care if I was to ſtay there always if it were my Place:</q>
And when I left <hi>Barbados</hi> Friends gave me better Credentials than I thought I deſerved—. A Friend of mine giving me Intelligence that the Market was better at <hi>Antigua</hi> than at <hi>Barbados,</hi> I diſpatched my Affairs, and took Part of our Cargo there, and was kindly received by our Friends. We were about three Days in our Paſſage, and had fine Weather therein.<note place="margin">Antigua.</note> At <hi>Antigua</hi> I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Meetings, my Buſineſs at no Time hindered me in my more weighty Service; for I always, through Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Help, made that give Way to my religious Duty, in which I ever found Peace and inward Satisfaction. In about five Weeks I finiſhed my Buſineſs in this Iſland, having no ſmall Satisfaction in coming to it; and our Veſſel being now loaden, we took our ſolemn Leave, and with the good Wiſhes of many, departed for <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Friends there ſignified to their Brethren, that they were glad of my Company, and that I was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to them, tho' I came upon Buſineſs. My Hand, when Need required, was to my Buſineſs, but my Heart was, and I hope is, and ever ſhall be, freely given up to ſerve the Lord, in that Work whereunto I believe he has called me. We have Liberty from God, and his dear Son, lawfully, and for Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation's Sake, to work or ſeek for Food or Raiment; tho' that ought to be a Work of Indifferency, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the great Work of Salvation. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Labour not for the Meat which periſheth, but for that which endureth for ever, or to eternal Life:</hi> By which we do not underſtand, that Chriſtians muſt neglect their neceſſary Occaſions, and their outward Trades and Callings; but that their chief Labour, and greateſt Concern ought to be for their future Well-being in his glorious Kingdom; elſe why did our Lord ſay to his Diſciples, <hi>Children, have you any Meat?</hi> They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, No; and he bid them <hi>caſt their Nets into the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:006297_0111_102857D8CB36D980"/>
Sea, and they drew to Land a Net full of great Fiſhes</hi>; and Fiſhing being their Trade, no doubt but they ſold them, for it was not likely they could eat 'em all them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Alſo the Apoſtle of Chriſt ſays, <hi>He that doth not take care of his Family, is worſe than an Infidel:</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) wrought with his Hands, even while he was in his Travels, and in the Work of the Goſpel; and others taſted of the Benefit of his Labour naturally, as well as ſpiritually. It is alſo written, <hi>That he that will not work, ſhall not eat.</hi> By all this, and much more, which might be noted, it appears that we not only have liberty to labour in Moderation, but we are given to underſtand, that it is our Duty ſo to do. The Farmer, the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Merchant, do not underſtand by our Lord's Doctrine, that they muſt neglect their Calling, or grow idle in their Buſineſs, but muſt certainly work, and be induſtrious in their Callings. We all ought to underſtand, that our Hearts and Minds ought to be out of the World, or above the Nature and Spirit of it. 'Tis good and profitable for both Soul and Body, rightly to diſtinguiſh between earthly and heavenly Things, and to be careful how they mix the one with the other; for it is an eternal Truth, that God and Mammon cannot dwell together, or join together in the Heart. If our Love is more to God, than the Creature, or to Heaven than Earth, then will he dwell in us, and with us: But if our Love is more to the Creature than to Chriſt, or to Earth than Heaven, then will he not dwell with us, but will leave us to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for the Lord Omnipotent will not admit of any Rival.</p>

                        <note place="margin">At Sea.</note>On the 11th of the Fourth Month, 1719, we left <hi>Antigua,</hi> ſtood cloſe to the Wind till we again croſſed the <hi>Tropick,</hi> and got into thoſe Latitudes where the Winds are variable. Sailing in the great Deeps we ſaw the Wonders of the Lord, particularly in divers Kinds of Fiſh, they living upon one another in the Sea, the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:006297_0112_102857DA52E96288"/>
great Fiſhes on the ſmall Ones; and Mankind too much reſembles them in that Reſpect. About the Latitude of 33 North, our Maſter, <hi>Warner Holt,</hi> ſeeing a Scool of Porpoiſes about the Ship, tho' he was not very well, and had not been for moſt of the Voyage, he took his Harping-Iron, and ſtruck one of them, and we took him into the Veſſel, out of which we got ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Quart Bottles of Oyl; and we moſt of us eat heartily of this Fiſh, which agreed with our People very well. They fry'd his Liver for our Meſs, of which I eat a large Meal, which was well-taſted, and eat more like freſh Beef than Fiſh. I make this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum of it, that if any ſhould take them when their Proviſions are ſcarce, they may eat freely without Danger, according to our Experience. When we had been at Sea about three Weeks, being near the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of 40 North, and about the Longitude of 42, tho' it was in the midſt of Summer, we ſaw an Iſland of Ice, at which we all marvelled, and judged that there had been a ſevere cold Winter in thoſe Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes on the Land of <hi>America.</hi> When we ſaw this Iſland of Ice we judged ourſelves not far from the Banks of <hi>Newfoundland.</hi> Hitherto we had eaſy Gales of Wind, and many Calms, which made our Paſſage ſeem long to us. We ſaw two Sail of Ships about thoſe Latitudes, but ſpoke with neither, being willing to ſhun them as it was War-time.</p>
                     <p>We had in this Voyage Weekly Meetings for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Almighty, in which the Great Lord both of Sea and Land, was pleaſed greatly to manifeſt his Name and Truth amongſt us, for which my Soul of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſecretly and openly bleſſed and praiſed his Divine and Glorious Name and Truth; for he bore up my drooping Spirit, ſo that I could truly ſay with the Royal Pſalmiſt (not becauſe he ſpoke it only, but alſo being an experimental Witneſs thereof) <hi>The Floods have lifted up, O Lord, the Floods have lifted up their Voice: The Floods lift up their Waves. The Lord on High is
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:006297_0113_102857DE27E19070"/>
mightier than the Noiſe of many Waters, yea, than the mighty Waves of the Sea,</hi> Pſalm xciii. 3, 4. This the King wrote of his own Experience in a ſpiritual Senſe; but I may ſay without boaſting, I have witneſſed the Rage and Noiſe of mighty Waves and Waters, both natural and ſpiritual; the one, as tho' it would ſwallow up my Reputation among Men, and the other, as tho' it would ſwallow up my Perſon, in this my watry Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrination: <hi>But bleſſed be the Name of him that is Holy and Eternal, who indeed is ſtronger than the Noiſe of many Waters, or than the mighty Waves of the Sea, either inwardly or outwardly, I will through his Strength, magnify his Name, becauſe he is worthy: And may I do it for ever!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the 11th Day of the Fifth Month, we ſaw great Flocks of Birds, which we judged came from the <hi>Azores,</hi> or <hi>Weſtern Iſlands,</hi> near which we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned ourſelves to be. The 21ſt Day we ſaw, and came up with, a <hi>French</hi> Ship, which had been fiſhing on the Banks of <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> and was bound for <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the Maſter of which came on board us, and our Captain went on board them. We exchanged ſome Rum and Sugars (of our Sea-Stores) for their <hi>French</hi> Wine and Cyder, and ſome of our Proviſions for ſome of their Fiſh. The Captain was a Proteſtant, and very courteous to us: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>France</hi> at this Time being kind to the Proteſtants, ſo that they increas'd much in that Kingdom. The <hi>Frenchman</hi> ſeeming deſirous to know what Religion I was of, I told him, by an Interpreter, that I was one called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> or <hi>Trembler,</hi> and that our Principle was to do Good to all Men, and not to hurt any Man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſt's Doctrine, <hi>Not to render Evil for Evil, but to overcome Evil with Good.</hi> When they went away and took Leave of us, they deſired me to pray for them, the which I remembred with Tenderneſs of Spirit, and having but little Wind, we kept Company for ſeveral Days; but the Wind ſpringing fair, we
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:006297_0114_102857DFAFCBAC08"/>
wiſhed them well, and went on our Way, our Veſſel outſailing moſt that we met with; and a few Days after we met with a <hi>New-England</hi> Ship, who came out ſix Days before us from <hi>Antigua.</hi> We were then in the Latitude of about 50 North, and 29 ½ Degrees of Longitude from the <hi>Lands-End</hi> of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> The 30th Day of the Fifth Month, we ſounded, and found Ground at 28 Fathom, and on the 1ſt of the Sixth Month, we ſaw the <hi>Lands-End</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> all our Company being in Health, and well; <hi>For which my Heart was truly thankful, to that great and infinite Being, whoſe Providence is over us poor Mortals in all Parts of the World, and who reigns over Sea and Land, and is worthy of Adoration, Worſhip, Service, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Praiſe for ever!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a few Days we came into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Channel,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Engliſh</hi> Channel.</note> and going up the Channel there came one of the King's Yacht's, and they preſſed moſt of our Men; the beſt Hands we had they took from us, and carried them on board a Man of War, after which we came to Anchor at <hi>Folkſtone,</hi> where I left the Veſſel, and got a Horſe to <hi>Dover,</hi> and from <hi>Dover</hi> took Coach to <hi>London.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dover.</note> In the Coach were divers Perſons who began to talk about the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſpoke againſt their plain Way of Living and Cloathing, and ſaid,
<q>That they did not underſtand their unfaſhionable Way of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; neither was it the Way to gain Proſelytes.</q>
Upon which I aſked them, <hi>Whether they underſtood</hi> Paul, <hi>the great Apoſtle of the</hi> Gentiles? <hi>who ſaid,</hi> Be ye not conformable to the World (i. e. <hi>the Faſhions of it) for this great Reaſon,</hi> The World, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions thereof, paſſeth away; <hi>which is a great Truth, and it is plainly ſeen how fickle and changeable the World is in its vain Faſhions and Cuſtoms, which, to follow, in all its fooliſh Cuts and Turns, or Changes, muſt, of Conſequence, make a Man or Woman very fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and apiſh.</hi> I told them, <hi>That our Religion was agreeable to the Holy Scriptures, which, if they did not
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:006297_0115_102857E3DA1E2840"/>
underſtand, neither could they underſtand us; for the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, was generally there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in very plain; and the Doctrine in Chriſt's excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount, is clear and plain to very low or mean Capacities:</hi> So they diſcourſed no more of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion till we came to <hi>London,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">London.</note> where once more I met with my loving and aged Father, a Man fearing God, and having a Gift of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and well-beloved of his Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who, with others of my near and dear Relations and Friends, received me gladly.</p>
                     <p>After ſome Months Stay among my Relations and Friends in <hi>London,</hi> we ſold our Veſſel, the Snow <hi>Hope,</hi> and bought another Ship which we called the <hi>Trine-Hope (Warner Holt,</hi> Maſter) and when I had done my Buſineſs I ſailed in the ſaid Ship for <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">At Sea.</note> We had Meetings on board the Veſſel twice a Week, in which the Almighty was pleaſed to favour us with his good Preſence. Sobriety, and the Fear of God, and Faith in his beloved Son, Chriſt, was often recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Youth then on board the Veſſel with us, of whom there were divers, who tranſported themſelves to <hi>America,</hi> in order to ſettle there. At one Meeting on board I was tenderly concerned to remind them of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who in his Youth, left his Country and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſojourn in a ſtrange Land, and how in that Undertaking, he ſought the Lord, and his Bleſſing, more than any outward Thing; and that he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſed with many Favours from Heaven above, and alſo from the Earth beneath, and they were adviſed to take him for their Example: And many other Things were tenderly opened to them in the Love of God, and in his Fear and Counſel they were exhorted from time to time.</p>
                     <p>It being Winter-Time we ſailed to the Southward, and got into warm Weather, and were on our Paſſage ſeven Weeks and ſome odd Days from Land to Land, in which Time we ſaw ſeveral Veſſels, and ſpoke with

one, whoſe People ſaid, they were chaced by a <hi>Turk,</hi> but got from him, at which they greatly rejoiced. We apprehended it was our Ship that they ſaw over Night, for we ſaw a Sail that crowded from us as faſt as ſhe could, and it being near Night, we ſhorten'd Sail, and ſo ſhe left us; but in the Morning came up with her, and being pretty near, both they and we put out our Colours, and being both <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> we ſpoke to each other, and were glad to meet with ſome of our own Nation upon the great Ocean; but our Veſſel ſailing beſt, we took our Leave of them, wiſhing them a good Voyage. We met with rough Seas and high Winds in the latter Part of our Paſſage, till we came to the Capes of <hi>Delaware,</hi> which we all rejoiced to ſee, and we had a pleaſant Paſſage up the Bay and River to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where I had once more a comfortable Meeting with my dear Wife and Family, which I grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledged as a high Favour from the Hand of the Almighty.</p>
                     <p>We arrived at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> the 1ſt of the Second Month, 1720; after which, I ſtay'd at,<note place="margin">1720.</note> and about Home, for ſome Time (and was not idle,<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> but kept to my Buſineſs, and to Meetings) and having a Deſire to ſee my Friends in the Province of <hi>Maryland,</hi> at their General Meeting at <hi>Weſt River,</hi> I was accompanied by <hi>Iſaac Norris</hi> and <hi>Thomas Maſters</hi> (both ſober young Men.) It had been a Time of pretty much Rain, and the Waters thereby being out and high, going over a Ford of <hi>Brandywine,</hi> my Mare got among the Rocks (it being a very rocky Creek) ſhe fell down, and the Stream being very ſtrong, ſhe rowled upon me, and being intangled with the Stirrup, I could not eaſily clear myſelf, but I gave a Spring from her, and ſwam to clear myſelf from her; and when I was clear, I got to her again, and lay'd hold of her Mane, and through the good Providence of God, got well out with the Mare on dry Land, which was a remarkable Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. In three Days we got to <hi>Weſt River,</hi>

Yearly Meeting, which was large, and Friends were glad to ſee me, I having not been there for ſeveral Years. I was out on this Journey about two Weeks, and rode about 300 Miles; and after my coming Home, I travelled pretty much in and about the Provinces of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1721.</note>In the Year 1721, <hi>Thomas Lightfoot</hi> and I, with <hi>William Browne,</hi> went to a Meeting at <hi>Buſh-River,</hi> and going over <hi>Suſquehannah-Ferry,</hi> the People were fiddling and dancing. When their Dance was over I aſked them (believing them to be Proteſtants) <hi>If they thought</hi> Luther <hi>to be a good Man?</hi> They replied,
<q>Yes, there was no doubt of it.</q>
                        <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>and ſo do I; and I will tell you what he ſays concerning Dancing,</hi>
                        <q>That as many Paces as the Man takes in his Dance, ſo many Steps he takes towards Hell;</q>
which ſpoil'd their Sport, and they went away, and we went on ours towards the Meeting; and a good Meeting it was! and we after it returned by Way of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and had a Meeting there, and one at <hi>New-Garden,</hi> and ſo on to <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> I was from Home about a Week, and travelled in this Journey about 150 Miles, and was well ſatisfied therein.</p>
                     <p>In the Years 1721 and 1722, I went ſeveral Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and had many large Meetings, travelling many Hundreds of Miles, of which I neglected to keep a particular Account, hardly thinking what I did worth recording; but divers of my Friends in many Parts of the World, put me upon ſomething of this Nature, to which, at length, I gave up, and found ſome Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Satisfaction therein, in looking back and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Dealings of God with me in my Youth and upwards.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Philadelphia</hi> I went to the General Meeting at <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> in <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey,</hi> where I heard of <hi>J. G</hi>'s being wounded by a young Man, with a Sword, of which he died, lamenting that he did not take the Counſel of his Friends; as young Men, who

ſlight the Counſel of them that wiſh them well,<note place="margin">1722.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do, either ſooner or later, if the Day of their Viſitation be not over. Some few Days after this Meeting at <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> I viſited Friends on <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and returned Home again, having travelled about 300 Miles. In my Stay at, and about Home, I wrote ſomething concerning <hi>Perfection,</hi> in anſwer to a nameleſs Author; as alſo ſomething concerning <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,</hi> or <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Year 1722,<note place="margin">Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania.</note> I went back in the Woods to <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the <hi>Great Swamp, Perkiomy, Manaha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towny,</hi> and <hi>Oley,</hi> where I had Meetings, travelling over great Mountains, from which we could ſee many Miles. I travelled in this Journey about 150 Miles, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Home in about two Weeks; and after ſtaying ſome Time at Home, and viſiting neighbouring Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I went to the Yearly Meeting of Friends on <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> which Meeting was very large, many People (not of our Perſuaſion) being there, and were very ſober. Many Things were opened in the Love of Chriſt, and his great Love was largely declared to that great Congregation. The Parable concerning the <hi>Prodigal Son,</hi> came before me to ſpeak of to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a very moving Manner, and ſtrongly to invite the Youth to lay hold of the Love of the Father in his Son, to poor Souls: And indeed it is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parable, ſetting forth the infinite Love of the great Lord of all to his poor Creatures. Many were affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reached to at this Meeting, and the Almighty was praiſed and glorified, who alone is worthy.</p>
                     <p>From thence I went and had a Meeting at <hi>New-York,</hi> and then ſet forward to <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> where we had a comfortable Meeting; <hi>Naaman,</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> being much the Subject of that Days Work: And that one Thing loved and eſteemed more than Chriſt, whatever it be, is to be avoided, and the People warned to be careful to cleave cloſe to the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi>) and to give up all which is
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:006297_0119_102857EB3A8C6358"/>
contrary to his Nature, and to take up Chriſt's Croſs, and follow him: For it is thoſe who follow him in the Regeneration, that are to be Heirs of his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>In this Year alſo I was at the Burial of our Friend <hi>Jonathan Dickenſon,</hi> at which we had a very large Meeting, he was a Man generally well-beloved by his Friends and Neighbours. In this Meeting a Paſſage (he had often told me in his Health) was brought to my Remembrance, I think, worthy to be recorded to the End of Time, which is as followeth:
<q>It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penned at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> that two young Men were at Dinner with <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and divers other People of Account in the World, and they were ſpeaking about Earthquakes (there having been one in that Place formerly, which was very dreadful, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſtroyed many Houſes and Families.) Theſe two young Men argued that Earthquakes, and all other Things, came by Nature, and denied a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Power, or Deity; inſomuch that divers ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at ſuch wicked Diſcourſe, and being aſhamed of their Company, left it; and at the ſame Time the Earth ſhook, and trembled exceedingly, as tho' aſtoniſhed at ſuch Treaſon againſt its Sovereign and Creator, whoſe Footſtool it is: And when the Earth thus moved, the Company which remained were ſo aſtoniſhed, that ſome run one Way, and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but theſe two atheiſtical young Men ſtay'd in the Room, and <hi>Jonathan</hi> with them, he believing that the Providence of Almighty God could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him there, if he pleaſed, and if not, that it was in vain to fly; but the Hand of God ſmote theſe two young Men, ſo that they fell down; and, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> told me, he lay'd one on a Bed, and the other on a Couch, and they never ſpoke more, but died ſoon after. This was the amazing End of theſe young Men:</q>
A dreadful Example to all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, and diſſolute and wicked Livers. <hi>Oh! that young People might be warned, that the Hand of God
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:006297_0120_102857F09F73BE18"/>
might be upon them for Good, and that they would ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly be concerned for their Salvation!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the 30th of the Fourth Month, 1723,<note place="margin">1723.</note> my tenth Child, named <hi>Thomas,</hi> died about Midnight (having before buried nine.) It was ſome Exerciſe to me thus to bury my Children one after another; but this did a little mitigate my Sorrow, that I knew that could I have all Things relating to them according to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; could I ſee them grow up to be ſober Men and Women, well married, have a Competency in the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it was ſafer and better for them, and they more out of Danger, being taken away in their Infancy and Innocency; and I fervently begged of the Almighty, that he would be pleaſed to take them away while Innocent, rather than that they ſhould live to be vicious or unrighteous Men and Women, and to bring Scandal on the holy Name of Chriſt, and upon our Chriſtian Profeſſion; which Conſiderations did mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to ſettle and quiet my Mind in my ſorrowful Exerciſe. <hi>The Great Lord of all ſanctify the Sorrows and Afflictions of his People and Children, and grant them the Fulfilling of that bleſſed Portion of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that all Things ſhall work together for the Good of them that love and fear God: Even ſo be it, ſaith my Soul!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Sixth Month of this Year I removed from the City into the Country,<note place="margin">Removes to <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
                        </note> to a ſmall Plantation I had at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> in order to be more retired, and for Health's Sake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> finding ſome declining in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Strength, which I take to be very much owing to the ſevere Colds and Hardſhips I have ſuſtained in my long and hard Travels, more eſpecially in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>America</hi>; for without Vanity I may ſay, that I always lov'd Temperance, and have been ſometimes zealouſly concerned to preach againſt Intemperance; and tho' I cannot now take ſo long Journeys as I have formerly, my Spirit earneſtly travels for the Welfare
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:006297_0121_102857F223E6F6B8"/>
of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Peace and Proſperity of all thoſe who love, fear, and ſerve, God, and believe in his Son.</p>
                     <p>On the Sixth Day of the Eighth Month, it pleaſed God to give me another Son, whom I named <hi>George,</hi> after my Father, Brother, Nephew, and King; and tho' this Name is now a great Name among Men, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd that no Name can preſerve Life, ſo I gave him up to the Will of him who gave him to me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, if I have no Name thro' Children to Poſterity, I may have a Name in the Lamb's Book of Life, which I have ever eſteem'd far above a Name amongſt Men.</p>
                     <p>After my Removal to this Place I was not idle, but viſited neighbouring Meetings, and in the Eighth Month I went to <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> General Meeting,<note place="margin">Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> where there were many Hundreds of People, and the Truth declared had good Impreſſion upon the Minds of many; ſome after Meeting, who were not of our Society, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to the Truth, and that they were glad they were there. In this Meeting I was concerned for the Welfare of Mankind, and the Exaltation of the Holy Name of the Almighty, to declare the univerſal Love of God to Man, from ſeveral Texts of Holy Scripture, as that Paſſage concerning <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and ſomething concerning the Objection made againſt us, the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that we do not acknowledge the Holy Scriptures to be the Word of God; for tho' we believe that the Scriptures came by Divine Inſpiration, yet we are clearly convinc'd by their Teſtimony, and by the Spirit of Truth in our Hearts, that Chriſt is the eternal Word of God, by whom all Things were made and created, and do ſtill exiſt.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> with divers other Friends, I rode to <hi>Croſwicks,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Croſwicks.</note> where, on the Fifth Day, we had a very comfortable Meeting, in which the ancient Love and Goodneſs of our heavenly Father was with us to the tendering our Hearts into Tears of Joy, ſome of us being likewiſe affected in Remembrance of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Almighty to us, in the Meeting we had in

this Place under the Trees about twenty-five Years ſince. The great Subject of Faith and Works was ſpoken to; as, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeem'd to lay too much Streſs on Works, and the <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> and others, too little: But our Principle led us to join both together; the Almighty having joined them together, none ought to ſeparate them. This Subject of Faith and Works having been much in Debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt profeſſed Chriſtians, it is on my Mind here to mention a few Things deduced from the beſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, <hi>Without Faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. xi. 6.</p>
                     <p>Second, <hi>Faith is the Gift of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Third, <hi>Faith works by Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourth, <hi>Faith is the Evidence of Things not ſeen, and the Subſtance of Things hoped for.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifth, <hi>Faith without Works is dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixth, <hi>The Juſt live by Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventh, <hi>You believe</hi> (or have Faith) <hi>in God, believe alſo in me,</hi> John xiv. 1.</p>
                     <p>And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks excellently concerning the Power of Faith, and the mighty Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders wrought by it. <hi>Note,</hi> this living, ſaving, true, and Divine Faith, muſt be in the Heart, thro', and in Chriſt Jeſus the Son of the Living God, who is, and always will be, the Author and Finiſher of it in every true Believer.</p>
                     <p>After I came from <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> I viſited divers neighbouring Meetings, and ſome in <hi>Cheſter</hi> County,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cheſter</hi> County.</note> where I had Meetings for nine Days ſucceſſively, ſome of which were very large (particularly at <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Goſhen</hi>) in which I was opened to exhort them to keep to that plain, honeſt Way of Life and Converſation, which our Fathers and Elders were found in, and to remind them of the Sufferings they endur'd for their Teſtimony to the bleſſed Truth, in the firſt breaking forth thereof in the laſt Age; and I was concern'd to ſhow them, that

the Almighty, who had bleſſed us with plenty of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings, would continue the ſame to us, if we were careful to live in his Fear; but that otherwiſe, we might expect his Judgments for Diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>And after my Return, I continued about Home for ſome Time, it being Winter Seaſon, and bad Travelling, and I not ſo capable of travelling as formerly: But I had great Peace and Tranquility of Mind, in that I had freely given up my youthful Days to ſerve my Creator, and the ſame Love and Zeal was yet freſh and warm in my Heart, for the Glory of his Great Name; and I ſtill have a full Reſolution through his Strength and Grace to ſerve him, the great Lord of all, all my Days, according to the Light and Strength given to me.</p>
                     <p>Our Yearly Meeting at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> this Year was large, in which our Friend <hi>Benjamin Kid,</hi> from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being with us, had great Service. I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Concern which was upon me at this Meeting, that the univerſal Love of God, through Chriſt, might prevail amongſt Mankind, and to preſs Friends to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to all People the Influence thereof, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Lives and Converſations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1724.</note>In the Second Month, 1724, I went into <hi>New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> as far as <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> where, on a Firſt Day, we had a large Meeting, to general Satisfaction; and the next Day we had another, wherein the Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of God, thro' Chriſt was opened freely to the People, and our Duty to forgive one another was large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated of; and it was plainly ſhewn, that without forgiving others, we could not be forgiven of God, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If ye forgive Men their Treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you: But if ye forgive not Men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your Treſpaſſes,</hi> Matth. vi. 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and much more to the ſame Effect on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; as alſo Chriſt's Anſwer to <hi>Peter,</hi> who aſked, <hi>How oft a Man ſhould forgive his Brother if he treſpaſſed

againſt him?</hi> Peter <hi>ſays, till ſeven Times?</hi> Our Lord Jeſus anſwers, <hi>I ſay not unto thee, until ſeven Times, but until ſeventy Times ſeven,</hi> Matth. xviii. 22. And again Chriſt ſays, <hi>If thy Brother treſpaſs againſt thee ſeven Times in a Day, and ſeven Times in a Day turn again unto thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him,</hi> Luke xvii. 4. Which hard-hearted People think a great Hardſhip, but Chriſt's Croſs muſt be taken up, and born daily, if we will be his Diſciples and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in Deed, and in Truth, as well as in Profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>After we had reconciled ſome Differences at <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> we went to a Place called <hi>Meneſquan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Meneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quan.</note> and had a good, open Meeting, and moſt of the People of that Place were there. It was a good Time, and I hope the Opportunity will not ſoon be forgotten by divers that were there. From this Place we travelled to <hi>Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks,</hi> and had a good Meeting.<note place="margin">Croſwicks.</note> After Meeting a Friend told me that ſome would ſay,
<q>I ſpoke by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, becauſe I had opened ſome Matters which were exactly to the State and Condition of ſome there:</q>
But I knew nothing of their State and Condition, otherwiſe than as it was then immediately opened in my Mind; neither had I been told any Thing concerning them directly or indirectly: And from thence we travelled to <hi>Burlington,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> where the Monthly-meeting of our Friends had deſired that I would be aſſiſtant to help to end a Difference which had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Miſtake, and continued for about ſeven Years (ſince the firſt Occaſion was given) and thro' Divine Aſſiſtance, our Hearts being filled with the Love of Chriſt, we ſo prevailed upon the differing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that they gave each other Satisfaction, with Hopes that they ſhould live in Love for the future; and Friends of the Place greatly rejoiced at the End of that Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. As I went along this Town, ſome Friends told me of a religious People ſome few Miles diſtant, whom they deſired I would have a Meeting with. I deſired them to ſee if it would be granted, and let me
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:006297_0125_102857FD39DDFAE8"/>
know; which was done, and we had a Meeting, and were kindly received, and the Divine Nature of the Goſpel of Chriſt was freely opened to them, and in great Love we parted from one another. I travelled in this Journey about two Hundred Miles; and when I came Home, my dear Wife and Family gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me with Hearts full of Love: And this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony I think proper, for ſeveral ſolid Reaſons, to leave behind me of my virtuous and loving Wife, that ſince we were married, ſhe never hindred me in that Service my great Maſter called me unto, in all the Time of our living together: We always parted, for the Sake of the Goſpel of Chriſt, in pure Love, and in the ſame Love we always met again.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this Time I met with ſeveral great Loſſes by Sea and Land, and myſelf and my little Daughter were dangerouſly ſick, ſo that our Recovery ſeem'd doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; yet thro' the Mercy of God, we both recovered, for which I praiſe his Name.</p>
                     <p>After ſome Stay at Home, I was again moved in the Love of Chriſt, to viſit the General Meetings of <hi>Duck-Creek</hi> and <hi>Salem.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Duck-Creek.</note> At <hi>Duck-Creek</hi> we had a large and ſatisfactory Meeting. From <hi>Duck-Creek</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Meeting at <hi>George's-Creek,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">George's-Creek.</note> which was a good Meeting. The next Morning we went over to <hi>Elſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cohanſie.</note> and ſo on to <hi>Cohanſie,</hi> where I met with two of my Fellow-labourers in the Work of Chriſt, <hi>Thomas Lightfoot</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Kid.</hi> We had a Meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at <hi>Cohanſie,</hi> in which the People were exhorted to Sobriety and juſt Dealing. The contrary of both is too obvious at ſuch Times as Fairs; there being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Fair People there as well as others, and the Nature of Chriſt's Work in the Heart, was ſomewhat ſpoke to, but not ſo open a Meeting as ſome others, the People thereaway being too ſlack and dull as to Religion. Next Day we had a Meeting at <hi>Alloways-Creek,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Alloways-Creek.</note> where we all three had ſome pretty cloſe Work; and from thence we went to the General Meeting at

                        <hi>Salem,</hi> which was larger than common, on account of ſaid Friend (<hi>Benjamin Kid</hi>'s) being there; who,<note place="margin">Salem.</note> in the Love of Chriſt, came from <hi>England,</hi> to viſit the Churches in this Part of the World. There were ſo many Friends and others here at this Time, that ſome Houſes were ſo filled, that there was not Room for all that came to lodge there.<note place="margin">Frankfort.</note> After this Meeting I return'd Home and in a few Days, went into <hi>Cheſter-County,</hi> and travelled above 100 Miles; and when I came Home I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that ſome for Want of a true Senſe of the Work of Chriſt, had been cenſuring me for my much Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling and hard Labour in the Work of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel of Chriſt; tho', by the ſame Rule of judging, the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and our ancient Friends, who travelled much, cannot eſcape their Cenſure; for in all my Travels, I have had an eſpecial Regard to the Unity of the Brethren, and never knowingly went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without it: <hi>But let this Caution be recorded for the Inſtruction of all ſuch forward Judges; let them be careful of judging Chriſt's Servants, leſt their Words become their Burden:</hi> Judge not, that ye be not judged (<hi>ſaith our great Lord</hi>) for with what Judgment ye Judge, ye ſhall be judged.</p>
                     <p>Soon after my Return from <hi>Cheſter-County,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Abington.</note> I was at a Marriage at <hi>Abington,</hi> which was one of the moſt ſolemn I have been at; and on the 15th of the Third Month, at the Youth's Meeting at <hi>Germantown,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town.</note> to my great Satisfaction; and on the 23d of the ſame Month, I went to the General-meeting of Miniſters and Elders at <hi>Burlington</hi>; at which Meeting,<note place="margin">Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> ſeveral Things relating to the Goſpel-miniſtry, were declared; as its being a free, a clear, and a powerful Miniſtry, reaching to the Conſcience, and Convincing of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of continuing in Sin: And divine Charity was much recommended, without which, <hi>All Miniſtry is but as ſounding Braſs,</hi> &amp;c. From this Meeting I went with <hi>Walter Herbert,</hi> into <hi>Bucks-County,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Neſhami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> and at <hi>Neſhaminy</hi> we had an open, tender Meeting. From thence I went
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:006297_0127_10285803EF68FE50"/>
to <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and was at a Marriage of a Son and Daughter-in-law of <hi>Thomas Canby</hi>'s. The Meeting was large,<note place="margin">Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> and Friends well ſatisfied; and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, tho' I was very hoarſe, thro' a Cold I had taken, and could hardly ſpeak in common Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it was much taken away in my Miniſtry, ſo that I was carried thro' the Service to our Admiration, for which I was truly thankful. After this Meeting I returned Home with true Satisfaction, ſuch as is much more valuable than Silver and Gold, two mighty Idols in the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Frankfort. North-Wales.</note>After a little Stay at Home I went on a Firſt Day to <hi>North-Wales</hi> or <hi>Gwinnedd,</hi> where was a pretty large Meeting, many young People being there, to whom I was concern'd to ſhew, that Chriſt is the Way by which we muſt come into the true Church, thro' Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and that all who invent other Ways are Thieves and Robbers. I rode twenty-five Miles that Day, and next Day came to <hi>Frankfort,</hi> and was at the Burial of an ancient Friend, <hi>Joan Orpwood,</hi> at which our Friend, <hi>John Salkeld</hi> was, with whom I was the next Day at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> at our Third-Day Meeting, which was a good Meeting.</p>
                     <p>On the 4th Day of the Fourth Month, intending ſoon to take a Journey to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> I thought it a proper Time to alter my Will, as I had kept one by me for divers Years before, conſidering the Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Life. On the 5th of the Fourth Month I went to <hi>Merion</hi> to viſit an ancient Friend,<note place="margin">Merion.</note> 
                        <hi>John Roberts,</hi> who was ſick near unto Death, where I again met with <hi>John Salkeld.</hi> The Friend expreſſed his Satisfaction in this Viſit, and we had a Reward of Peace in the Exerciſe of that Chriſtian Duty of Viſiting the Sick, which is recommended by the Apoſtle to the primitive Churches of Chriſt. After we had been ſome Time with our ſaid ſick Friend, we went to the Meeting which had been appointed for us ſeveral Days before, and was large and ſatisfactory; for which favourable

Viſitation we bleſſed the great Name of the Almighty, and parted tenderly in Chriſtian Love and Good-will. The Friend we went to viſit died the next Day. He was a Helper of the Poor, and a Maker of Peace in the Neighbourhood: Of ſuch, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of God.</hi>

Underſtanding by a concerned Friend, that of late ſeveral of our Friends are taken away from you by Death, a Concern came on my Mind to put you in Remembrance of your latter End, and of the Cauſe of Chriſt; and alſo, of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his bleſſed Light and Truth in your (in that Reſpect, poor, tho' in ſome others, rich and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) Iſland: The Poſterity of many that have been taken away there, as well as in divers other Places, having gone aſtray; and that it may not be ſo with theſe who are left behind, let a weighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern come upon you. O dear Friends! let your Practices and Expreſſions, manifeſt to the riſing Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the Welfare of their Souls, more than of their Bodies, is at Heart with you; and do not indulge them in that which you in yourſelves were convinc'd to be of an evil Tendency, when your Hearts were firſt reached by the Power of Truth. How many Youths have been loſt, thro' the Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Example of their Elders, and thro' an undue Indulgence of them in Vanity, Folly, Pride, and Idleneſs! Woful Experience doth but too much

declare that they are many: O they are many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who have been loſt by ſo doing! Wherefore, dear Friends, clear yourſelves of your Children; and, if they will obſtinately go aſtray, faithfully bear your Teſtimony againſt them, in Life, Doctrine, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Converſation, which will Witneſs for you when you are dead and gone, and your Heads laid in the ſilent Grave. Thus will your Youth, thro' the Bleſſing of God, and your Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, come up in your Places, or at leaſt you will be clear, and their Blood will be upon their own Heads. A pure, ſtrict Watch is required of you in Converſation, in all thoſe Relations: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God may be glorify'd. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be exampled. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours may be edify'd, or built up in pure Religion: And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That you may die in Peace with him that created you, and died for you; remembring the bleſſed Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine before Men, that others, ſeeing your good Works, may glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And again; <hi>You are as a City ſet on a Hill, which cannot be hid.</hi> And as you thus train up your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Way which they ſhould go, when they are young, you may have Reaſon to hope they will not depart from it when they are old; for many have been convinced of the Truth, as it is in Jeſus Chriſt, thro' the good Converſation of his Followers. And how can we expect to die well, if we do not live well? Or can we expect the Anſwer of, <hi>Well done,</hi> if we are not in the Practice of doing well?</p>
                           <p>And I do deſire and earneſtly exhort Friends to read the Holy Scriptures, and wait to feel the Power from which they ſprung, thro' the holy Writers; and alſo to teach them to their Children. And, dear Friends, let me prevail with you in the Love of God and his dear Son, to keep cloſe to your Meetings for the Worſhip of Almighty God, and for the

well ordering of your Society; and do it in the meek Spirit, for that is of great Price with the Lord; and when in your Meetings, get into a religious Exerciſe, and lively Concern for God's Glory, and your Souls Peace and Proſperity. I pray the holy Lord of Sabbaoth, to open your Hearts to him in the Reading of this little Epiſtle, as mine is open to you, my beloved Friends, that you and I may be edified (tho' outwardly ſeparated) as we were when together; and if we ſhould never meet more in this World, that we may meet in the Kingdom of God, where we may never part more. <hi>Amen. Hallelujah,</hi> ſaith my Soul!</p>
                           <p>I deſire this may be copied and read at the Cloſe of one of each of your particular Meetings, and, if it could be readily, in every Family of Friends; to all whom is my very dear Love in Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Servant I am, and hope to be to the End, and I am an entire Lover of Souls, and a Well-wiſher of <hi>Sion</hi>'s Proſperity</p>

From <hi>Rockway</hi> (for ſo is the Place called) we went to <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> and had a very large Meeting on a Firſt Day; and, as I was informed, ſome were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there that Day.

                        <note place="margin">Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> where ſome were lately convinced of the Principle of Truth as it is in Chriſt Jeſus, ſome of whom were excommunicated by the Preſbyterians, with whom they had formerly join'd. We had a pretty large Meeting in a Friend's Barn,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:006297_0132_10285815460AA568"/>
where one Prieſt <hi>Prime</hi> oppoſed me, as he alſo had my Friend <hi>Benjamin Kid</hi> ſome Time before, of which, by Letter, I gave an Account to my dear Friends <hi>Thomas Lightfoot</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Kid,</hi> deſiring them (in their Return from <hi>New-England</hi>) to have an Evening Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there. The Grounds of this Prieſt's Cavilling, or Diſpute, was that I had declared, That it is the Light of Chriſt, or his Spirit, which convinceth the World of Sin, and not a natural Light, or the Light of a Natural Conſcience; from whence he took Occaſion to charge me with denying a natural Conſcience, the Falſhood of which I charg'd upon him before the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, and deſired him, if he had any Thing on his Mind, to write it to me, to which I promis'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him an Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Huntington</hi> I went to the General Meeting of Friends held at <hi>Newtown,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Newtown.</note> which was ſo large that the Meeting-Houſe could not contain the People, and the Weather being extreme hot, the People without Doors were ſome of them uneaſy, and went to and fro; but thoſe that were in the Houſe, and ſo near as they could hear, were very attentive, and as far as I could learn, generally ſatisfied.<note place="margin">New-York.</note> Our next Meeting was at <hi>New-York,</hi> which was the quieteſt Meeting I ever had there; and thoſe few Friends at <hi>New-York,</hi> and ſome that were there from <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> parted with us in the Love of Chriſt, and in the Fellowſhip of his bleſſed Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and ſo I travelled homewards, having good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in viſiting my Friends; and when I came Home, I found my dear Wife and Children in Health,<note place="margin">Frankfort.</note> for which I bleſs God.</p>
                     <p>After this Journey I kept to Meetings at and about Home as uſual, and was at the Fifth-Day-Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> when <hi>Samuel Preſton</hi> was married to <hi>Margaret Langdale</hi> (the Widow of my dear Friend and Fellow-traveller, <hi>Joſiah Langdale:</hi>) The Meeting was large, and the Parable of the Virgins, and the Bridegroom's coming at Midnight, was opened, with
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:006297_0133_10285816CB96E370"/>
an Exhortation to People to be ready againſt that Hour, and that they ſhould take Care to have the Holy Oil of Divine Grace in their Hearts.</p>
                     <p>After this Meeting I had ſome Affairs which called me into <hi>Cheſter-County,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cheſter-County.</note> and on the Road my Horſe gave a ſudden and violent Start out of the Path, and threw me down, and before I could get up again, he ſtruck my Face, and on my right Eye with his Foot, being newly ſhod, which ſtunn'd me for the preſent; but as ſoon as I opened that Eye which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt, I perceiv'd that I lay on my Back, under my Horſe's Belly, with my Head between his fore Feet. He ſtood ſtill, and I got on my Hands and Knees, the Blood ſtreaming out of my Noſe and right Eye, and while I was bleeding, a Man and Woman came by, and ſtay'd till I had done Bleeding, and ſaw me mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my Horſe again. I went forward, being about two Miles from the Houſe I intended to go to, and after riding about a Mile, I met with a Friend that knew me, and was ſurprized to ſee me ſo bloody, and went with me to <hi>Randal Maylin</hi>'s, (a faithful, honeſt Friend, who was upwards of eighty Years of Age, and had ſuffered much for his Profeſſion of the Truth in his younger Years) where ſeveral tender-hearted, motherly Women dreſſed my wounded Eye. I was truly thankful to the Lord for his Providence towards me in this Deliverance, among many others, which he in his Goodneſs hath vouchſafed to me. I ſtay'd at this Friend's Houſe, three Nights and mended apace, and the Friend accompanied me to my Houſe at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> where my loving Wife, with ſome Surprize, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me very affectionately; and thro' her Care and continual Application, I recovered, that I could ſee pretty well with Spectacles, which I was obliged to uſe for ſome Months. <hi>Such Accidents plainly ſhew us the Neceſſity of preparing for ſudden Death, as we know not when, or how, we may go off the Stage of this Life.</hi>

                        <pb n="121" facs="unknown:006297_0134_1028581A9A5D9A70"/>On the 25th of Fifth Month, I received a Letter from a Perſon in the County of <hi>Burlington,</hi> relating to <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> to which I made Anſwer as follows:</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>THY Lines I received laſt Night, in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing of which, there was a Chriſtian Love in my Heart towards thee, tho' unknown by Face, and I have much Freedom of Mind to anſwer thine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Requeſt, and my ſmall Ability. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, We are near in Sentiments to each other in the grand Chriſtian Principle of ſaving Religion, which is the Work of the Holy Spirit of Chriſt upon the Soul, for that is the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> which is Chriſt's, and is truly ſaving, and abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation; Chriſt's Baptiſm being but one, which is with the Holy Ghoſt, and with ſpiritual Fire or Water; <hi>John</hi>'s being the Element, or Figure; and CHRIST's being the Spirit, Power, and Divine Subſtance, and is to be with the Church of Chriſt, and with his true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to the End of the World. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In Anſwer to thy <hi>Query, Was Water-Baptiſm</hi> (that is, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>not commanded by Chriſt himſelf, in</hi> Matth. xxviii. 19? I anſwer, I believe not. My Reaſon is this, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit, is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Text, or that Command, in expreſs Words, and Water is not; and therefore we omit going into outward Water, and for other Reaſons as followeth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Water-Baptiſm, which was <hi>John</hi>'s, was practiſed by the Apoſtles, is true; but it was not practiſed by Chriſt, who, no doubt, would have done it if it had been abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for he diſdained not to waſh his Diſciples Feet, a much more deſpicable Office than that of the Baptiſmal Ceremony: So becauſe Chriſt did not himſelf practiſe it, nor, as we conceive, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to go into material Water, we therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Apoſtles did baptize with Water, we deny not; and that they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:006297_0135_1028581C42D52C88"/>
and did circumciſe, is alſo undeniable. Now, muſt we circumciſe becauſe the Apoſtles did, and were themſelves circumciſed? Conſider that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and I hope that will give thee ſome Sight or Light into, or concerning the Diſpenſation of Water-Baptiſm, which was <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, and was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in its Day and Diſpenſation, in pointing at Chriſt's Baptiſm, until it came, which was the Subſtance, and was with ſpiritual Fire, and ſpiritual Water, and will continue for ever. To Chriſt, and his Baptiſm, I heartily direct thee for further Inſtruction, <hi>in whom</hi> is Light, and that Light is the Life of Men, or <hi>Life, and that Life the Light of Men.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And further, I would write a little of my own Thoughts concerning Water-Baptiſm, and on ſome Texts of Scripture, being Chriſt's own Words, <hi>viz. He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> or condemned, <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 16. Now this muſt needs be underſtood of the Spirit's Baptiſm; for it would be abſurd to ſay, or believe, that all who are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the Element Water, are ſaved, or all who are not baptized with Water, are damn'd; therefore it is the Spirit's Baptiſm, that all profeſſing Chriſtianity ought to come unto to Witneſs Salvation. Again, Chriſt ſays, <hi>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> or of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> iii. 5. This divers will have to be a Mixture of the Element Water, and of the Spirit; but Chriſt ſays, <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the Fleſh profiteth nothing: The Words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life,</hi> John vi. 63. <hi>And that which is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit,</hi> John iii. 6. According to which Doctrine, I have Faith to believe, that outward, fleſhly, or elementary Water-Baptiſm, profits little or nothing to the Soul. Again, Why ſhould the Water in that Place be underſtood of the Element,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:006297_0136_10282E176F7E14C0"/>
any more than the Fire in the other, <hi>viz. To be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire?</hi> Since Chriſt ſaid, <hi>My Words they are Spirit and Life.</hi> Remember the Well of Water that ſprings up to eternal Life in the Believers: Remember the Water that Chriſt gave, whoſoever drank of it was never to thirſt more. This is all Spiritual, which the carnal Mind cannot comprehend or enjoy, but is witneſſed by the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Man. And further, if we conſider what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion there is in the World about this Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, it may well put a tender-ſeeking Soul upon further Search into the Nature of holy, ſaving Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> have one Way; the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> another; the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> they have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and all differ ſo widely, that, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they will not worſhip together; neither are they ever like to be reconciled, except they come to the Holy Spirit and Divine Power of Jeſus, the good Saviour and precious Guide of Souls. That Saying of his hath often been a Comfort to me in deep Exerciſes and Diſtreſſes of Mind, when he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come; but if I go away, I will pray to the Father, and he will ſend the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, in my Name, and when he is come, he ſhall lead you, and guide you into all Truth; he ſhall take of mine, and give it unto you, and ſhall bring all Things to your Remembrance, that I have ſpoken unto you.</hi> And that he was to convince the World of Sin; and that he ſhall abide with you for ever. May the precious Gift of the Spirit be given to thee, and to all true Seekers of God, his Chriſt and Kingdom, is my real Deſire, and humble Prayer to the moſt High.
[<hi>See the Four Evangeliſts for this Promiſe, they not wording it alike.</hi>]</p>
                           <p>Having anſwered the moſt of thy Letter, I would add a few Lines more, <hi>viz.</hi> I have known ſome
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:006297_0137_1028581E41F7A598"/>
who could not be ſatisfied with Words about this Point of Baptiſm with Water, until Chriſt had by his Spirit given them Satisfaction in themſelves; and as thou comes more and more into cloſe Communion with his Grace and Spirit in thy own Soul, I hope thou alſo wilt have better Satisfaction than that of Words only. I have known ſome of the People called <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> who have been convinced of the Truth, according to our Way and Principle, to whom all the Writing, and Diſputing, and Reading, and Preaching, about this Point, could never give ample Satisfaction, until they had it inwardly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Chriſt, manifeſted to them by his Holy Spirit in their Hearts, as aforeſaid. Tho' I would not be underſtood to be againſt ſatisfying one another as much as lieth in our Power, and as we find Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Love of God and Chriſt. And further, I never underſtood that any of our Society were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely againſt ſuch practiſing of it,<note place="margin">☞</note> who could ſee no further, or did really think in their Conſcience it was their Duty ſo to do: But we believe, that we ſee beyond the Figure or Shadow, and are come to the Subſtance, for the Reaſons mentioned, and many more which mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Several Treatiſes have been written upon this Subject, one of which is very full (before we were a People) by <hi>William Dell,</hi> a wiſe and learned Man, and one who had a large Senſe of the Power of God: And among us <hi>Barclay</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, and a Treatiſe by <hi>John Gratton,</hi> who was a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Preacher, and one by <hi>Joſeph Pike:</hi> And alſo here is a little Book of <hi>Thomas Upſher</hi>'s (a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Preacher before he came to join with us) which I ſend thee, with whom I was well acquainted, as alſo with thoſe Men who ſubſcribed it. If thou applies thyſelf to <hi>Richard Smith,</hi> of <hi>Burlington,</hi> he is as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as any I know to help thee to thoſe Books, all which are larger on the Subject, and have given Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Thouſands about it; tho ſome, as I have
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:006297_0138_10285823DEEA2B58"/>
ſaid, could never be ſatisfied with Words. In read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the latter Part of thy Letter, I was tenderly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and my Prayers to the Almighty were that he would pleaſe to direct thee by his Power and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Grace of his dear Son, who hath ſaid, <hi>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt off.</hi> Now, tender Friend, Chriſt is the true Light, that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, by which Light thou muſt walk to the Kingdom and City of God. He is the Door into the true Sheepfold: He is the Truth, in whom thou muſt believe: He is the Divine Life and Light of the Soul: He is the true Chriſtian's All in all: <hi>And, as the Kingdom is within</hi> (as ſaid Chriſt) <hi>ſo the King is alſo within,</hi> and without alſo. He is God Omnipotent, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient, Omnipreſent, the immortal Jehovah, and is God over all, bleſſed for ever. And as a Servant of his, I recommend thee, with my own Soul, unto him for Preſervation and Divine Direction; for it is the great Work of Chriſt's true Miniſters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to direct the ſeeking, travelling Souls to him; to whom, with the Father, and the eternal Spirit, be Glory, now, and evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>—From thy aſſured Friend in Chriſt.</p>

                           <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> &amp;c.</note> I viſited ſome Meetings about Home, as <hi>Philadelphia, Abing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and <hi>Germantown.</hi> In ſeveral of thoſe Meetings I was concerned to exhort Friends, as our Meetings and Worſhip was, in this Province of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> a Kind of national Worſhip, to beware that they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves in the Sins of the Nations, but to be careful to keep to the holy, ſelf-denying Life of Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>On the 5th of the Sixth Month, between the Hours of nine and ten in the Night, there was an Earthquake,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:006297_0139_1028582563DAC5A0"/>
which divers People were very ſenſible of; and about this Time divers People were taken off with a violent Fever; and I was concerned in ſeveral Meetings to put the People in Mind of their Mortality, and Shortneſs of Time here; and alſo of the Uncertainty of it, and the Neceſſity of ſpeedy Preparation for their final Change and future Well-being. In the aforeſaid Month I was at our Youths Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where I was concerned to adviſe Parents to do juſtly to their Children, in the divers Relations of a Child's State; to be juſt in Correction, and to be ſure to give them Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and train them up in Reading of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>they being able, thro' Faith in Chriſt, to make us wiſe to Salvation.</hi> I alſo was earneſt in Exhortation to the Youth, to obey and Honour their Parents, and to have a Care not to be diſobedient to their Fathers and Mothers. I had a Concern alſo to remind that large Congregation, that the Almighty had ſtretched out his Arm of Power, with his Rod, and had given the People of this Land three Strokes therewith, as a gentle Admonition towards Heart-preparation, to meet him, and to prepare for their latter End, or final Diſſolution: Which was <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Sickneſs, or peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Fever, which carried off many of the People. <hi>Secondly,</hi> An Earthquake, of which divers in Town and Country were very ſenſible. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Whirlwind, ſuch as we never before heard of in this Land, that I remember. They were admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take particular and ſpecial Notice of thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Strokes of the Divine Hand, for if he pleaſed he could as ſoon take away many by Sickneſs, as a few, and if he pleaſed he could have made us a Deſolation, as well as the Country about Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> or <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> not very far from us; and he could alſo blow us away with a Whirlwind of his Wrath, and could as eaſily have blown down all our City, as thoſe few Houſes in the Country.</p>

                     <p>The 25th of the Sixth Month I was at the Burial of the Wife of <hi>Richard Waln,</hi> a virtuous and good Woman. Some of her laſt Words were,
<q>Some Mens Sins go before-hand to Judgment,<note place="margin">Fair Hill.</note> and ſome follow after them; and that her Sins were gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which was a great Comfort to her, now ſhe was going to leave the World.</q>
It was a large Meeting, and a ſeaſonable Opportunity that we had at the Funeral. The People were called upon to work,<note place="margin">Frankfort.</note> while it was called To-day, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> as our Saviour ſaid, <hi>the Night cometh, wherein no Man can Work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this and the foregoing Year I met with various Trials and Exerciſes: As <hi>Firſt,</hi> Great inward Poverty and Want. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Great Loſſes in outward Affairs. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The evil Spirits of divers ſtirred up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, to report Falſhoods concerning me, with many other ſore Exerciſes both inward and outward. As to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> I had often been try'd that Way, and found by Experience, that I muſt wait upon God my Saviour, for freſh and renewed Viſitations from above; in which Exerciſe, I had always in the Lord's Time, Comfort from him, as by the ſame Exerciſe I had now the ſame Comfort alſo; but I thought it very long, and the Enemy did greatly endeavour to break in upon my Patience now more than uſual: But my Heart ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in Faith and Hope upon the Lord my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Saviour, and in his Time he was pleaſed to help me, bleſſed be his holy Arm and Power for ever! Many bleſſed Saints and Servants of Jeſus were brought to my Mind, who were in the like Condition, ſo that I had a ſecret Joy in their Company (who met with the like in their Travels to the holy City.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to my outward Loſſes, I thought with myſelf, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it might be beſt for me: And I remembred that many, through the Increaſe of outward Riches, were
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:006297_0141_1028582DCCF43920"/>
exceedingly hurt as to their inward State; and tho' I (or any good Man) might be concerned for our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to get and leave ſomething for them, yet I plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaw, that generally ſpeaking, much Riches doth much Hurt to Youth. This was a melancholly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that I had made in my Life and Travels, and I ſee at this Day that it is an univerſal Diſtemper (a very few excepted) wherefore I cry'd mightily to God that he would give to me and mine, the Gift of his Grace and Holy Spirit, whatever our Circumſtances might be in the World. In this alſo I ſaw that Patience was an excellent Virtue, and that the Meek had the beſt Inheritance of the Earth, if they had ever ſo little of it; and that true Happineſs did not conſiſt in earthly Things, which my Experience had largely taught me. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the baſe and evil Treatment I met with (which was more than I had ever met with in all my Life before) great Endeavours were uſed to leſſen my Reputation, as a Man and a Chriſtian; all which proved falſe and fruitleſs, and in due Time my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was made manifeſt; and I conſidered that they could not uſe me worſe than they had done my Lord and Maſter, and that the Devil was angry with any who endeavoured to dethrone him, and pull down his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, at the Foundation of which, thro' the Help of my Maſter, I had many a Stroke or Blow, with ſuch Weapons as he was pleaſed to furniſh me withal.</p>
                     <p>The laſt of the Sixth Month, and the 1ſt of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Month, was the Quarterly and Youths Meeting at <hi>Burlington,</hi> at both which I was. At the Quarterly Meeting I was concerned to open to that Meeting, how all along tne Church of God was governed by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the Time of the Law, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein; and that when it was too hard, and too much Work for <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was adviſed to get the Help and Aſſiſtance of the Elders; and that the ſame Power and Spirit of God that was with and upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> was upon the Elders who aſſiſted him in the Affairs of the
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:006297_0142_102858320C38FB88"/>
Church, and Congregation of the Lord's People; ſo that it was governed by God's Spirit, and is to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the ſame ſtill, and not by the Will of Man, nor according to the Will of Man in his corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And when <hi>Iſrael</hi> went from God's Power and Spirit, the Lord left them, but at laſt ſent to them his only begotten Son, our dear Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; and he was, and ever is, to be Governor of his Church, <hi>thro' his Holy Spirit, which,</hi> he told his Diſciples, <hi>he would pray the Father, and he ſhould ſend unto them, the Comforter, the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, and he ſhould abide with them for ever, and ſhould lead and guide them into all Truth</hi>; which ſweet and precious Promiſes that he made to them, the true Believers do witneſs to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled at this Day. Glory to his Name for ever, <hi>he is the wonderful Councellor, mighty Saviour, and Prince of Peace! of whoſe Peace and Government there ſhall never be an End, and upon whoſe Shoulder the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is to be for ever,</hi> for whoſe Power and holy Spirit Friends were exhorted to pray and wait, and to be ſenſible of it in the Diſcipline and Government of the Church now in this Goſpel Day, in which is a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Manifeſtation of God's Love, thro' his Son, than in the Time of the Law. The Youth's Meeting was alſo large, and divers Teſtimonies were born, by Way of Exhortation and Counſel to the Youth. They were with much Tenderneſs adviſed to take Counſel of their Elders, and were ſhewn how it fared with ſome young Men, who ſlighted the Advice and Counſel of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and that one, when on a Dying-bed, cried out in the Bitterneſs and Agonies of his Spirit,
<q>Oh! that I had taken the Counſel and Advice of my Friends, for then I had not been here, nor in this Condition.</q>
Youth were adviſed to beware of keeping bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſpending their precious Time in Taverns, which hath undone many fair and promiſing Youths: And it was ſhewn, how a <hi>young Man might cleanſe his
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:006297_0143_10285833E3A3C398"/>
Ways, by taking heed thereto, according to the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever,</hi> and which the Holy Scriptures proceeded from; and they were earneſtly exhorted to read and practice what was written therein: And a very tender Time we had in Prayer to God, thro' his dear Son, to preſerve us all in his Fear, both Youth and aged; and ſo our Meeting broke up, and we parted in the ſweet Love of God, and his Chriſt our holy Saviour.</p>

                     <p>I was now removed (as already related) into the Country, for Retirement, which I greatly loved and delighted in; but as ſoon as I was a little ſettled there, the Enemy of all Good endeavoured to diſquiet my Repoſe, by ſtirring up ſome bad People againſt me, who lived near, and in Time paſt had ſawn'd upon me: And, to add to my Afflictions, I loſt a Veſſel, in which, I ſuppoſe, I had upwards of Five Hundred Pounds; and another Veſſel came in almoſt a Wreck, in which I ſuffered in my Intereſt ſeveral Hundreds

more, and a third I heard of, in which I had the like Loſs; and about the ſame Time I had alſo a good new Barn burnt to the Ground in a few Minutes, ſo that I was exceedingly ſtripp'd that Way: And to add yet more to my Exerciſe, I was ſorely afflicted with Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, having a Swelling in my Jaws, Mouth, and Throat, to that Degree that I could neither ſpeak nor ſwallow for ſome Time, nor eat nor ſleep for about ſeven Days (as I remember) without great Difficulty.

                     <p>When I got a little well, ſo that I could go to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I went to <hi>Germantown, Abington, Philadelphia,</hi> and <hi>Darby.</hi>

than that which went before. Friends were very glad to ſee me abroad again (they having expected daily to hear I was dead) and there was Tenderneſs over the Meeting, and God over all, thro' his dear Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was praiſed and glorified, who is worthy for ever.</p>

But what is our Lives, to the Life of the only-begotten Son of God? And truly, we muſt give them up often, if we have the Cauſe of Souls at Heart; and then he often gives them to us again, Glory to his holy Name for ever! As Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He that will ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it, and he that will lay down his Life for my Sake and the Goſpel, ſhall find it</hi>; which reacheth your Caſe in this Undertaking. And indeed, ſome of our Lives, in our own Senſe, is hardly worth mentioning, conſidering the Cauſe of Chriſt.</p>

And that there are Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences among them, is alſo true; but they have the more Need of being viſited by ſuch, who are, thro' their wiſe Conduct and healing Diſpoſition, likely to heal thoſe Breaches which are, or may be among them. Some, indeed, have gone among them, and have done Hurt, by a raſh and turbulent Way of Management, and by ſo doing, have rather made the Breaches wider, than by a meek and loving, as well as lowly Diſpoſition, leſſened their Differences, and healed them.</p>
                           <p>And, tender Friends, tho' it may ſeem hard for you in ſeveral Conſiderations, to give up to go to Sea, and alſo to divers who love you, and are nearly related to you, know ye, and ſuch ſo concerned, <hi>That the Lord is ſtronger than the Noiſe of many Waters, and than the mighty Waves of the Sea.</hi> And I really believe that you, as well as my Soul (with the Servants of Chriſt) have, and will experience it to be ſo, as <hi>David</hi> did, whoſe Words they are.</p>
                           <p>I remember the Words of our great Lord and Maſter Jeſus, when he ſent forth his Servants to preach his Word and Goſpel; <hi>I ſend you forth as Lambs among Wolves.</hi> No queſtion but you, like innocent Lambs, before your Return (if it pleaſe God to give you to us again) may meet with the Wolves Spirit, or the Spirit of the Beaſt, in ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers among whom you may Travel; then will the

                           <p>And, dear Maidens, I look upon it as your Croſs is great, you being two innocent, chaſt, young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to give up your Names to croſs the Sea, which I know is a great Croſs to a chaſt Woman, or Man either, the Seamen, too generally, being rude, diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute People; ſo your Crown will be great alſo. I have known that by keeping near to Chriſt, and his Truth and Power, there hath been a wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation divers Times in ſeveral of thoſe rude Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and ſome have been ſo far convinced, as to be exceedingly Kind, and to ſpeak well of Friends and their Converſation, when it has been coupled with the Fear and Wiſdom of God. When I have gone to Sea I always found a religious and chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon me, for the poor Sailors, the good Effects of which, have been much more than I may ſpeak of; but give this little Hint for your Encouragement and Information.</p>
                           <p>Well, dear Souls, if you go, I believe the Lord will go with you; and ſure I am, that my Spirit will go along with you, which will not hurt you, if it do you no Good And altho' my Exerciſes and Tribulations of late have been very great, both Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Natural, yet my very Heart within me affects the Cauſe of Chriſt, according to the beſt of my Underſtanding; and I heartily wiſh well to all my Fellow-Labourers, who are faithful, painful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, and diſintereſted, except as to the Intereſt which they deſire in Chriſt and his Kingdom, for the Sake of which, they love not their Lives unto Death.</p>
                           <p>I muſt now take Leave, after putting you in Mind of remembring me, your poor Friend and Brother, when before the Throne you are ſupplicating the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercies in Secret, even as my Heart is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

As in the Work of Converſion, or Regeneration, there is a Growth and Increaſe from the State of a Child to that of a Man in Chriſt, ſo in the Work of the Miniſtry, or Preaching the Goſpel, there is alſo a Growth from a Babe to an able Miniſter, in all which the Power and Grace of the Holy Spirit muſt be our Guide, our Help, and Support, keeping cloſe to which, we ſhall increaſe in Divine Wiſdom and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ound Judgment, and our Hearts and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings will be more and more opened and inlarged. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>When I was a Child, I ſpake as a Child, underſtood as a Child, and thought as a Child</hi>; and yet he was an excellent Child of God, and Miniſter of Chriſt, and as he grew in his Gift, and Chriſt's Grace, he became a wonderful, ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſtrument in the Hand of God. Now a Child's State in the Miniſtry is too much overlooked by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſome thinking to be Men, as ſoon as they are brought forth into the Miniſtry; and, according to my Obſervation, divers have been at a Loſs, and ſome quite loſt, for Want of a patient Continuing in Well-doing, and not waiting to feel a Growth and Increaſe from above, have gone on in their own Strength and Will, perhaps againſt the Advice and Inſtruction of a ſound and honeſt <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla,</hi> and have been hurt; and ſome, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Gift, have had that ſame Gift taken from them, even by the Lord, who gave it them.</p>
                           <p>As I take it, a true Miniſter of Chriſt, is to take no Thought what to ſay, but it will be given him in the ſame Hour that which he ſhould ſpeak to the People (that is, in a general Way) and if it is not given from above, I believe he or ſhe ought to be ſilent; for they receive freely, if they do receive any Thing from Chriſt, and ſo they ought freely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter; and where little is given, little is required, all which is plain from Chriſt's own Words in the New Teſtament; and Chriſt's Croſs is to be taken
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:006297_0155_102857300C724780"/>
up by his Miniſters in their Preaching, as well as in their Converſation.</p>
                           <p>It is a Practice which the Holy Scriptures have not acquainted us with, that the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould take a Verſe, or a Line, out of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Write, or Study, before-hand, a Diſcourſe on it, and Preach it, or rather Read it, to the People. The holy Men of Old (as we read both in the Old and New Teſtament) ſpoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, and by it they were gifted for the Convincing, Converting, and Reforming the World, and for Comforting and Edifying of the Saints, quite contrary to the latter Practice of modern-reading Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who Diſpute, Write, and Preach, againſt the immediate and Divine Revelation of the Spirit of Chriſt, and therefore cannot be of his Miniſters, but muſt be the Miniſters of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Letter, and not of the Spirit of Chriſt, or of his Goſpel. And where the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>When I was a Child, I ſpoke as a Child,</hi> I take him to point at the being brought forth newly into the Work of the Miniſtry, as well as the Work of Converſion, and that he uſeth them Expreſſions by Way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, and therefore I compare it thus: A Child when it firſt begins or ventures to ſpeak, he ſpeaks but a few Words, and thoſe ſtammering ſometimes, and its Judgment is weak, and muſt be put upon Speaking by his Father over and over, if he be a backward Child, otherwiſe if he be forward, and ſpeaks too much, he is curb'd by a wiſe Father: And thus, according to my Obſervation, it hath pleaſed our heavenly Father to inſtruct his Children in the Miniſtry, and as a Child in Chriſt, I would ſpeak a little of my Experience unto the Child, or Children of God. When I firſt felt a Neceſſity on me to preach the Goſpel, I had but a few Sentences to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, in great Fear and Tenderneſs, with ſome
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:006297_0156_102857319E0D67B8"/>
Trembling, with which my Brethren were generally ſatisfied and edified; and after ſome Time I felt a Concern to preach the Goſpel in other Countries, and to other Nations (than that in which I was born) which to me was a very great Croſs; but feeling the Woe of the Lord to follow me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>n not giving up to it, I in ſome Time took that Croſs up, for Chriſt's Sake and the Goſpel's: And in Taking it up, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd the Truth of the Apoſtle's Doctrine, <hi>That the Goſpel of Chriſt is the Power of God unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. i. 16. Thus, thro' a continual Labour and ſpiritual Travel, I wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed a Growth in Experience, and an Enlargement in Expreſſions and heavenly Doctrine; and my Heart was mightily enlarged to run the Ways of God's Commandments, and divers were convinced, and ſome, I hope, thoroughly converted, and many comforted, and God, thro' the Miniſtry of his dear Son, glorified, who is thereof only worthy for ever.</p>
                           <p>In all which I have nothing to boaſt of nor glory in, ſaving in the Croſs of Chriſt; for what is <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> but Inſtruments? (I would not be underſtood to compare with thoſe Apoſtles, but to endeavour to follow them as they followed Chriſt.) Chriſt is All in all: He is the great Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Teachers, and the higheſt Schoolmaſter of all: And he ſays, <hi>He that will be my Diſciple, muſt firſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We do not find any where in the New-Teſtament, that Chriſt's Miniſters or Meſſengers were only to ſpeak or preach to one Meeting of People, or that they were called or hired by Man; for then it would have been neceſſary Man ſhould pay them; but Chriſt ſays, <hi>Freely you have received, freely give; and go forth,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. xxviii. 19, 20.</p>
                           <p>And, my Friend, I find to this Day, that it is ſafe for me when I am Miniſtring to the People; when the Spring of Divine Life and Power, (from which
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:006297_0157_1028573337BF6C60"/>

                           <p>I would have this taken no otherwiſe, but as one Friend and Brother opening their States and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another for Edification, and the Strength'ning each other in Chriſt.

                     <p>The 25th of Twelfth Month I was at the Burial of the Wife of <hi>Randal Spikeman.</hi> It being our Fifth-Day-Meeting, divers ſober People were there not of our Perſuaſion, and I was drawn forth to ſpeak to the People of the Death of Chriſt and his Merits, and to ſhew them that there is no Merit in the Works of Man, as he is Man, or in a formal Righteouſneſs or Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>In our Yearly Meeting at <hi>Burlington</hi> it was agreed that the Families of Friends ſhould be viſited, and ſoon after our Monthly-meeting appointed me, with other Friends, to viſit the Families of Friends of our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in which Viſitation, many were comforted and edify'd, both Youth and Aged; and we could truly ſay, that the Power and Grace of God, and the ſweet Love of Chriſt accompanied us from Houſe to Houſe, to our mutual Comfort; and we were ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily opened and guided to ſpeak to the States of the People in their Families (that were unknown and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to us) that ſometimes ſome of them were ready to think that we ſpoke by Information, when in Truth we were clear of any ſuch Thing, and only ſpoke from what was immediately given to us, without any Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from Man or Woman; which to us was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very wonderful, and caus'd us to praiſe the great Name of the Lord.</p>

Upon this Viſit I would remark, that it is a great Pity, that Youth, when in Health and Strength, ſhould put off the Work of their Salvation, and forget the moſt High, till either Sickneſs or Death overtake them.

The Perſon being well-beloved, there was a large Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of People of divers Perſuaſions, and we had an Opportunity at this Funeral to exhort the People to live ſo as that they might die well; and that the Way to die in the Favour of God, was to live in his Fear; and Charity to thoſe who diſſent from one another, was preſſingly recommended from the Apoſtle's Words, that <hi>If we had Faith to remove Mountains, and to give all our Goods to the Poor, and our Bodies to be burned, yet if we wanted Charity, we were but like ſounding Braſs, and a tinkling Cymbal,</hi> 1 Cor. xiii. 1, 2, 3. And alſo our Belief of the Doctrine of the Reſurrection of

                     <p>The latter End of the Second Month, I was at a Marriage at <hi>Horſham</hi> (at which was preſent <hi>William Keith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Horſham.</note> our Governor) and I was concerned to ſpeak of the End of that great Ordinance, and of the Happineſs of thoſe married Perſons who fulfil the Covenants they make in Marriage, and what Strength and Comfort the Man is to the Woman, and the Woman to the Man, when they keep their Covenants, and that they are the contrary when they break them: And I alſo opened the Methods preſcribed by our Diſcipline, to be obſerv'd in Marriages, and our Care to prevent any clandeſtine Marriages amongſt us. After Meeting I return'd Home without going to the Marriage-Dinner, as I generally avoided ſuch Entertainments as much as I could, having no Life in, or Liking to them, being ſenſible that great Companies and Preparations at Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, were growing Inconveniencies among us, the which I was conſcientiouſly concerned to diſcourage.

A ſolid Meeting it was! wherein the mighty Power of the Creator was declar'd of, as alſo the Divinity of Chriſt, and his Manhood, and People were exhorted to be careful of forming any perſonal Ideas of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; for the Holy Scriptures do plainly manifeſt, that God is a wonderful, infinite, eternal Spirit, and therefore is to be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth, and outward Repreſentations of the Lord Jehovah, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders too much on Idolatry.

                        <hi>Kennet,</hi> and <hi>Marlborough,</hi> and ſo to the Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Meeting at <hi>New-Garden,</hi> where we had a large, open Meeting, wherein was ſhewn, that thoſe who meddled with our Diſcipline, in the Will, Nature, Spirit, and Wiſdom of Man only, could do but little Service, and that our Diſcipline, as alſo our Worſhip and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ought to be performed in the Wiſdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, thro' the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt.— From <hi>New-Garden</hi> we went to <hi>Birmingham,</hi> had a large Meeting, and I was much drawn forth to the Youth, of whom many were there: From <hi>Birmingham</hi> we went to the Quarterly-meeting for Diſcipline and Worſhip at <hi>Concord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Concord.</note> in <hi>Cheſter-County,</hi> which was larger than I had ever ſeen there before. In the Quarterly-meeting of Diſcipline, Friends were exhorted to keep to the Croſs of Chriſt, and to ſpeak to Matters in the Fear
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:006297_0161_102857435B73C560"/>
of God, and to avoid and ſhun as much as in them lay, Self-Will, Humour, Pride, and Paſſion; ſhewing that the rough, crooked, unhewn, unpoliſh'd Nature of Man, could never work the Righteouſneſs of God, and is contrary to the meek, Self-denying, Life of Jeſus. <hi>John Salkeld,</hi> and <hi>Jacob Howell,</hi> then ſignifying that they were going to viſit Friends in <hi>Long-Iſland</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> the Senſe of the Call, Labour, and Work of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and of the Love of Chriſt (in the Freeneſs of it) to Mankind, took ſome good Hold on divers in that Meeting, and the great Name of God, and his dear Son, thro' the Holy Spirit, was glorified.</p>
                     <p>From this Meeting I came Home (having been out on this Journey near three Weeks, at 20 Meetings, and travelled more than 200 Miles) and found my Wife and Children in Health, and we rejoiced to ſee each other; but my Rejoicing was in Fear, even almoſt to Trembling, leſt I ſhould be too much lifted up when Things were agreeable to me.</p>
                     <p>After my Return Home I went to ſeveral neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Meetings, and on a Fifth-Day was at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> at the Marriage of <hi>Richard Smith</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Powell.</hi> The Meeting was large, and the Marriage ſolemnly celebrated, and the People were earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to love Chriſt above all, and to manifeſt that Love by keeping his Commandments, and that not in Shew or Words only, but in the Heart and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>About the latter End of the Third Month, I went to the Quarterly-meeting of Miniſters and Elders for the County of <hi>Burlington</hi>;<note place="margin">Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Stony-Brook.</note> and from thence to <hi>Stony-Brook</hi>; where, on the Firſt-day, we had a large Meeting (in <hi>Joſeph Worth</hi>'s Barn) which was crowded with People, and was a ſolid, good Meeting. From <hi>Stony-Brook</hi> I went to <hi>Croſwicks,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Croſwicks</note> and was at their Youth's Meeting, which was the largeſt I had ever ſeen in that Place; I told them they might

ſay as the Sons of the Prophets did, <hi>That the Place was too ſtreight for them,</hi> and adviſed them to enlarge it. I was glad to ſee ſuch a large Appearance of ſober People, and ſo great an Increaſe of Youth (in this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of <hi>America</hi>) and exhorted them to live in the Fear of God, that his Bleſſings might ſtill be continued to them; and an Exerciſe was on my Mind for the Welfare of the young People, to ſhew them the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Sin and Vanity, and of keeping ill Company, and following bad Counſel; and that the young King <hi>Rehoboam</hi> (<hi>Solomon</hi>'s Son) loſt the greateſt Part of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Kingdom, by following the Company and Counſel of vain, young Men; and that many young Men in this Age had loſt and ſpent the Eſtates their Fathers had left them by the like Conduct, and brought themſelves to Ruin, and their Families to Poverty and Want. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers lively Teſtimonies were delivered in this Meeting, and it ended with Adoration and Praiſe of Almighty God; and tho' the Meeting held more than four Hours, the People did not ſeem willing to go away when it was over; for indeed it was a ſolid, good Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Buſineſs of the Quarterly-meeting was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in Peace and Love (that being the Mark the Diſciples of Jeſus were to be known by) and Friends were exhorted with a great deal of Tenderneſs to keep that Mark.</p>
                     <p>In this Journey I travelled about ninety Miles, and was at four Meetings, being from Home four Days, and was much ſatisfied in my Journey; but met with ſome Exerciſe when I came Home, hearing of ſome Loſſes and Damage to my Eſtate; ſo that I found <hi>after I had</hi> (according to my beſt Endeavours) <hi>done the Will of God, I had need of Patience, that I might receive the Promiſe.</hi> I was ſenſible of the Meſſenger of Satan, the Thorn in the Fleſh, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of.</p>
                     <p>About this Time a loving Friend of mine informed me, that one whom I very well knew in <hi>Barbados,</hi> a Miniſter of our Society, had gone into an open Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:006297_0163_10285749B25B2CA0"/>
ſo as to keep Meetings ſeparate from his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and contrary to their Advice: I was concerned in Love to write a few Lines to him, to remind him of the unhappy State and End of ſuch, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the brotherly Love and kind Treatment of Friends, had ſeparated from us, and loſing the Senſe of Truth, which had made them ſerviceable in the Church, were acted by a rending, dividing Spirit, by which the Enemy of our Happineſs had ſo far obtain'd his End, as to make ſome Diſturbance for a Time; but few, if any, of theſe Separatiſts, have had further Power than to promote and maintain their ſeparate Meetings during their own Lives; ſuch Meetings hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in every Inſtance I have known (except one, and that laſted not long) dropt on the Death of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And tho' we think it our Duty to teſtify againſt, and diſown all ſuch; yet this Diſowning is only until the Perſons offending, from a real Senſe of, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for their Faults, acknowledge and condemn the ſame; then the Arms of Chriſt, and of his Church, are open to receive and embrace them: I therefore ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſought him to conſider the Danger of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any who love and believe in Chriſt (tho' never ſo little in their own or other Mens Eſteem) for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have true Peace in departing from the pure Love of God, his Truth, and People; to which I added the following Sentences out of the New-Teſtament:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have Love one to another,</hi> John xiii. 35.—Don't loſe this Mark.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from Death unto Life, becauſe we love the Brethren. He that loveth not his Brother, abideth in Death,</hi> 1 John iii. 14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is Love,</hi> — iv. 8.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>He that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> —. 16.</p>

Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town.</note> I was at a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in <hi>Philadelphia</hi>; and was ſoon after on the Firſt Day at two Meetings at <hi>Germantown,</hi> where I went to viſit a Friend who had not for ſome Months been at Meeting, being in a diſconſolate Condition; I invited her to Meeting, where the Love and Goodneſs of Chriſt to the Poor in Spirit was largely manifeſted, and the Friend after Meeting ſaid, ſhe was better, and afterwards recovered, and kept to Meetings. I was frequently at the Week-day Meetings at <hi>Philadelphia</hi>; for I thought that Week not well ſpent, in which I could not get to Week-day Meetings, if I was in Health.</p>
                     <p>In this Month I was at the Burial of <hi>George Calvert,</hi> who was one of ſober Life, and juſt Converſation, and being well-beloved by his Neighbours, he left a good Report behind him. Soon after which I was at <hi>Merion</hi> Meeting,<note place="margin">Merion.</note> which was large and ſolid: The People were tenderly exhorted, That neither outward Favours, nor ſpiritual Bleſſings, might make them grow forgetful of God; but that in the Senſe of the Increaſe and Enjoyment thereof, they might be the more humble; and foraſmuch as the Chriſtian Church in former Ages was corrupted by temporal Riches and Power, it was intimated, that as we had Favour ſhewn us from the Government, and Increaſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Things, we ſhould be very careful not to abuſe thoſe Priviledges, by growing proud, and wanton, or envious, and quarrelſome; but <hi>To do juſtly, love Mercy, and walk humbly with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Month I was at <hi>Middletown</hi> in <hi>Bucks</hi> County, at the Burial of my dear and intimate Friend <hi>John Rutledge</hi> (who died very ſuddenly) at which Burial there were above 1000 People: He was well-beloved among his Neighbours, and was a ſerviceable Man where he lived:<note place="margin">Neſhami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> I admired to ſee ſuch a Number of
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:006297_0165_10285750B590AD50"/>
People upon ſo ſhort Notice, he dying one Day in the Afternoon, and being buried the Day following: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Teſtimonies were born concerning the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Works and Ways of God. It was a ſolid bowing Time, wherein many Hearts were broken, and melted into Tenderneſs. After Meeting a young Man came to me trembling, and begg'd that I would pray for him, for he had ſpent too much of his Time in Vanity, and had ſtrong Convictions on him for it, and had been greatly affected and wrought upon that Day: I exhorted him to deny himſelf, and to take up his Croſs, and to follow Chriſt, who hath ſaid, <hi>He would in no wiſe caſt off thoſe who came to him</hi> [in true Faith.] He went from me very tender and loving, being broken in his Spirit.</p>
                     <p>From thence I went to <hi>Gwynnedd</hi> (or <hi>North-Wales</hi>) where on the firſt Day of the Week we had a very large Meeting; in the Morning of the Day,<note place="margin">North-Wales.</note> a Voice awoke me, which cry'd aloud, ſaying, REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS FOR WELL AND EVIL DOINGS ARE SEALED AS AN ETERNAL DECREE IN HEAVEN, which confirmed me that Mankind were happy or unhappy in that World which is to come, according to their Deeds in this Life, if their Deeds be Good (as Chriſt ſaid) their Sentence will be, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed</hi>; if their Deeds be Evil, <hi>Depart from me all ye that work Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and go ye Curſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And, if thou do'ſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? And if thou do'ſt not well, Sin lieth at the Door.</hi> And again, <hi>I have no Pleaſure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way, and live.</hi> Theſe, with many more Texts of the ſame Nature, contained in the holy Scripture, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Doctrine of perſonal Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as ſome hold it. We had a Meeting alſo in the Afternoon of the ſame Day, which was ſatisfactory to many; our Hearts being filled with the Love of God, for which we thankfully praiſed him. The next Day we had a Meeting of Miniſters, in which they
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:006297_0166_10285753A5DE36C0"/>
were exhorted to wait for the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, without which there can be no true Miniſter not Miniſtry. I was concerned to put them in Mind to keep cloſe to Chriſt, their holy, ſure Guide, and Biſhop, to be cautious of going before, leſt they ſhould miſs their Way, and of ſtaying too far behind, for fear we ſhould loſe our Guide; and to be careful to <hi>keep a Conſcience void of Offence towards God, and alſo towards Man</hi>; that we might ſay to the People truly, <hi>Follow us, as we follow Chriſt</hi>; that our Converſation might confirm and not contradict our Doctrine, for our Saviour ſays, <hi>By their Fruits ye ſhall know them; Men do not gather Grapes of Thorns,</hi> &amp;c. and of ſuch as ſay and do not, he charged his Followers not to be like them, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. 3. The next Day we had another very large Meeting there, in which many Things were opened and declared, tending to eſtabliſh and build us up in our Faith in Chriſt. After this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parting with my Friend <hi>John Cadwallader,</hi> who had accompanied me, I came homeward, lodging that Night at <hi>Morris Morris</hi>'s (whoſe Wife was very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) with whom we had a tender Time.</p>
                     <p>The 29th of the Fifth Month I was at the General Meeting at <hi>Germantown,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town.</note> which was a large and good Meeting; going Home I went to ſee <hi>Richard Buzby,</hi> who was not well; he ſaid the Company of his Friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived him. Next Day I went to viſit <hi>Jane Breintnall,</hi> who was ſeized with the Dead-Palſy on one Side, and the Lord was pleaſed to comfort us together, as ſhe expreſſed, to our mutual Satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>On the 30th of the ſaid Month was our Quarterly Meeting of Miniſters at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> where humble Walking with God was recommended and pray'd for, and it was deſired that Miniſters might be exemplary therein, having Chriſt for their Pattern.</p>
                     <p>On the 1ſt of the Sixth Month, I was at our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> which was a dull Meeting to me and divers others, a lively Exerciſe of Spirit being too much

wanting among many, and cloſe walking with God in Converſation: If we would really enjoy the Love and Preſence of Chriſt in our religious Meetings, we ought to keep near to him in our daily Converſation, which that we might do, was humbly deſired in Supplication and Prayer to God.</p>
                     <p>The young Man who came to me under great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Mind after the Funeral of <hi>John Rutledge,</hi> wrote to me, that he was followed with the Judgments of God for his manifold Tranſgreſſions, deſiring that I would pray for him.

                     <p>In my Travels I met with a Perſon who query'd of me, how he ſhould know which Society had moſt of the Holy Spirit, ſince moſt of the Profeſſors of Chriſt do believe in the Holy Ghoſt (or Spirit?)</p>
                     <p>To whom I made the following Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let the Rule of Chriſt determine this Queſtion; he ſays, <hi>By their Fruits ye ſhall know them; Do Men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grapes of Thorns, or Figgs of Thiſtles? Matt.</hi> vii. 16. The Fruits then of the Spirit of Chriſt are, Love,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:006297_0169_1028575BAD1899F8"/>
Faith, Hope, Patience, Humility, Temperance, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, brotherly Kindneſs and Charity, with all Manner of Virtues. Therefore the Society of Chriſtians, who brings forth moſt of the Fruits of the Holy Spirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently have moſt of Chriſt's Grace and Spirit. But ſome object and ſay, we will not believe that any Society have the Holy Ghoſt now, or the immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Inſpiration of the Spirit, unleſs they work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. To which it is anſwered, That right Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Sin, and true Faith in Chriſt, cannot be wrought without a Miracle, neither can we bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit without the miraculous Power of Chriſt.—Men by Nature bring forth the Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that which is contrary to Nature is miraculous. Sin is natural, but divine Holineſs, or the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, wrought in Man, is ſpiritual, ſupernatural, and miraculous. And as to natural Men (that are in a ſtate of Nature) ſeeing outward Miracles, if they will not, nor do not believe what is written in the holy Scriptures of the Old and New-Teſtament, neither will they believe, altho' one were to riſe from the Dead. Notwithſtanding Chriſt wrought outward Miracles, and did the Works which none other could do; tho' he cured all Manner of Diſeaſes, and fed many Thouſands with a few Loaves, and a few ſmall Fiſhes (and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, when all had eaten, was more than there was at firſt) tho' he raiſed the Dead, and himſelf aroſe from the Dead, yet few, but very few, believed in him, ſo as truly to follow him. His Birth, his Life, his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, his Death, his Reſurrection, are all miraculous; and ſince all this was done in the Perſon of Chriſt, and at the firſt Publication of his Religion to Men, there is now no abſolute Neceſſity of outward Miracles, tho' his Power is the ſame now as ever; but he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>He that believeth on me, the Work that I do, ſhall he do alſo, and greater Works than theſe ſhall he do,</hi> John xiv. 12. Upon which <hi>W. Dell</hi> ſays, <hi>This muſt be underſtood in Relation to Sin; for Chriſt had no Sin in
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:006297_0170_1028575EF1B7E7C0"/>
himſelf to overcome, but we all have ſinned,</hi> and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Sin is the greateſt of Miracles.—This will try the notional or nominal Chriſtian, who ſays, we can never overcome Sin in this World.—Where then is our Faith in the Son of God, who for this Purpoſe was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil, <hi>John</hi> iii. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 14.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let not Chriſtians be ſlow of Heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt; and if we truly believe therein, and live in the Practice of his Doctrine, we ſhall ſee Miracles enough to ſatisfy us forever.</p>
                     <p>The 16th of Sixth Month, I was at the Weekly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Franckfort,</hi>

ſeveral Parts of the Country to ſee how I did, and were glad I was like to recover. The Day before I was ſo hurt (being the firſt of the Week) I was at Meeting at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and was concern'd to ſpeak of the Uncertainty of Life, and the many Accidents we are incident to in thoſe frail Bodies, and exhorted Friends to live ſo, that they might have a Conſcience ſerene, and clear of Offence towards God and Man, and then they might expect the Comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, which in ſuch Seaſon of Difficulty would be a great Help and Benefit to them, of which I had the ſweet Experience the next Day, under great Extremity of Pain; and tho' the Pain of my Body was ſuch that I could not for ſeveral Nights take my natural Reſt, yet I had Comfort, thro' the ſweet Influence of the Holy Spirit, which Chriſt promiſed his Followers, <hi>John</hi> xiv. 26.</p>
                     <p>On the 18th of the Seventh Month began our Yearly-meeting at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which was large, and our Friends,<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> 
                        <hi>John Wanton,</hi> and <hi>William Anthony,</hi> from <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and <hi>Abigail Bowles,</hi> from <hi>Ireland,</hi> had good Service therein. From this Meeting an Addreſs was ſent to King <hi>George</hi> for his royal Favour to us as a Society of People, in giving his Aſſent to a Law made in this Province for preſenting the Forms of Declaration, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſtead of the Terms heretofore us'd.</p>
                     <p>The Beginning of the Eighth Month, being a little recovered from my Hurt, I had a Deſire once more to ſee my Friends on the Eaſtern Shore of <hi>Maryland,</hi> at their General-meeting at <hi>Choptank.</hi> The firſt Day I ſet out, I travelled about thirty Miles, and at Night was very weary, being but weak in Body, and I was almoſt ready to faint in my Mind about proceeding any further; but next Day <hi>George Robinſon</hi> (at whoſe Houſe I lodged) offering to accompany me, we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled about forty Miles to <hi>Saſſafras</hi> River, and both of us, tho' much tired, were comforted in each other's Company and Converſation. On the next Day we travelled near twenty Miles to the General-meeting in
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:006297_0172_102857665DB5F500"/>
                        <hi>Caecil</hi> County, in <hi>Maryland</hi>; where we met with two Friends from <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> and two from <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> who were there on the like Occaſion. The Meeting was large and quiet, many People being there not of our Society, and were very ſober: The Meeting held ſeveral Days, wherein the Goſpel-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation was ſet forth, and the Love of God in Chriſt was exalted. From <hi>Caecil</hi> we went to <hi>Cheſter</hi> River, and had a Meeting there, at which the People were exhorted to come to Chriſt, the eternal Rock, and true Foundation, and to build their Religion on him, againſt whom the Gates of Hell can never prevail; and they were ſo much affected, that they did not ſeem forward to leave the Houſe after the Meeting was over. From <hi>Cheſter</hi> River we went to <hi>Tred-Haven,</hi> to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral-meeting of Friends for <hi>Maryland,</hi> which was very large; ſome Friends from <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and <hi>Virginia</hi> being alſo there, and many People of other Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties: Many Teſtimonies were born to the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt by his Spirit in the Soul, and Friends were earneſtly deſired to be diligent in reading the Holy Scriptures, and to keep up the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our wholſome Diſcipline; by the Neglect of which, a Door would be opened to looſe liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and undue Liberties.<note place="margin">The <hi>Great-Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</hi>
                        </note> From <hi>Tred-Haven</hi> we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled into the <hi>Great Foreſt,</hi> between the Bays of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſapeak</hi> and <hi>Delaware,</hi> and had a ſatisfactory Meeting; as yet there was no publick Meeting-houſe in this Place, wherefore I told the People of the Houſe, I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them for the Uſe of it; but they tenderly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, they were more obliged to me for my kind viſiting of them; and truly we had a ſolid, good Meeting there: The People being generally poor, they had but little Notice taken of them by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-loving Teachers, who preach for Hire. From the <hi>Foreſt</hi> I went to <hi>Little-Creek,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Little-Creek.</note> in the Territories of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi>; where was a General-meeting for the Counties of <hi>Newcaſtle, Kent,</hi> and <hi>Suſſex.</hi> The

Meeting was large, and Friends parted in great Love and Tenderneſs. And I went forward to <hi>Duck-Creek,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Duck-Creek,</hi> &amp;c:</note> where we had a Meeting; divers Perſons of Note being there, and all were quiet, and heard with At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. From <hi>Duck-Creek</hi> I went to <hi>George</hi>'s-<hi>Creek,</hi> and had a Meeting; where a Man of a ſober Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſaid, That he never heard Things ſo ſpoken to before; but that he could witneſs to the Truth of all that was ſaid. It was a good Meeting before the Concluſion; but I was very low and poor in my Spirit in the Beginning of it. From this Place we ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> where we had a Meeting;<note place="margin">Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</note> it was the Time of the Sitting of the General Aſſembly, and ſeveral Members of the Houſe were at Meeting: The Governor (who has from our firſt Acquaintance been very reſpectful to me) hearing that I was in Town, ſent to deſire me to tarry all Night in <hi>Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>; but being engag'd to a Meeting over the Rivers <hi>Chriſtine</hi> and <hi>Brandywine,</hi> and it being near Night, I could not ſtay, but went away that Evening, and ſent my Love to him, deſiring to be excuſed. That Night I lodged at <hi>John Richardſon</hi>'s, and next Day went to <hi>George Robinſon</hi>'s, at <hi>Newark,</hi> where we had a Meeting on the Firſt-Day, and on Second-day another at <hi>Providence</hi>;<note place="margin">Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

I ſtay'd there all Night, and in the Morning we had a comfortable Heart-melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Time together, in which was revived the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:006297_0174_1028576C568D29B0"/>
of the many favourable Seaſons of God's Love we had enjoy'd in our Travels in the Work of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and we tenderly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we never met more in this World, we might meet in that which is to come, where we might never part more, but might forever live to ſing with all the Saints and holy Angels, Hallelujah to God and the Lamb. From <hi>Darby</hi> I went to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> Third-day Meeting, and from thence to my Houſe, where my dear Wife and Children with open Hearts and Arms received me, and I them with Joy; at which Time I had a gracious Reward of Peace for my Labour of Love, which far exceeded Silver or Gold. In this Journey I travelled above three hundred Miles, had nineteen Meetings, and was from Home above three Weeks, in which Time I recovered of my Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Admiration; ſo that I had with Satisfaction to remember the Apoſtle's Saying, that <hi>All Things work together for Good to them that love God,</hi> Rom. viii. 28.</p>
                     <p>After my Return Home, I was at the General-meeting at <hi>Franckfort</hi>; and in the Beginning of the Ninth Month, I was at Meetings, at <hi>Abington, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantown,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> and divers Times at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Youths-meeting, wherein ſeveral Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were born, and the Youth exhorted to Piety and Humility.</p>
                     <p>On the Fifth Day of this Month in the Morning, being under a Conſideration of the many ſore Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Trials I had met with from my Childhood, I was much affected; but the following Portions of Scripture being brought to my Remembrance, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſome Relief, <hi>viz.

                        <pb n="163" facs="unknown:006297_0175_1028576F935BCF80"/>In this Month, I was at the Funeral of our worthy, antient Friend, <hi>Thomas Lightfoot.</hi>

                     <p>After this Burial, I was at one at <hi>Abington</hi>; the Meeting was large, and, on that Occaſion, ſeveral Things ſuitable to the States of the People were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on.</p>
                     <p>I was alſo about this Time at <hi>Germantown,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town.</note> and at a General-meeting at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to my great Satisfaction, being accompanied by my antient Friend <hi>Rowland El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>; and at the Third-day Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> at the Time of our Fall Fair, there were fervent Deſires, and Prayers, in ſeveral of us, That the Youth might be preſerved from the Evils too prevalent at ſuch Times of Liberty and Prophaneneſs.</p>
                     <p>About the 20th of the Month I went for <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> being drawn in true Love to make a general Viſit to Friends there; and likewiſe having ſome Buſineſs to tranſact there.

From the <hi>Falls of Delaware,</hi> we travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led next Day to <hi>Piſcattaway,</hi> and lodged at an Inn; and on the next Day we went to <hi>Woodbridge,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</note> to <hi>John Kinſey</hi>'s, and on Firſt-day we had a ſatisfactory Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there with Friends and others; and the next Day <hi>John Kinſey</hi> went with us to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and that Night got to <hi>John Rodman</hi>'s, and next Day we reſted,<note place="margin">Fluſhing.</note> being weary with travelling ſo far in the Cold.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Fifth Day of the Week we had a large Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> and another in the Evening at <hi>Obadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah Lawrence</hi>'s, which was an open, tender Time. From <hi>Fluſhing</hi> we went to <hi>Cow-Neck,</hi>

After which we went ten Miles to <hi>Amos Willet</hi>'s Houſe, where we had a ſerviceable Meeting: He invited his Neighbours, who came and received us with Hearts full of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; and thoſe not of our Society, were well ſatisfied with the Meeting; ſo that we went on our Way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, that we were favoured with the good Preſence of God in our Journey. <hi>Amos Willet</hi> and his Wife went with us to <hi>Huntington,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Cow-neck.</note> where we had a good Meeting, and much larger than could be expected.

<q>It was Time to begin, for there is as many come as would come to Night;</q>
tho' he was miſtaken in that; but he not having Patience to watch and pray, went away; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which we had a good Meeting—Theſe two Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were in the Government of <hi>Connecticutt,</hi> where they formerly made a Law impoſing a Fine of five Pounds on thoſe who ſhould entertain any of our Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, which Law, I was informed, was repealed in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> From thence we travelled into <hi>New-York</hi> Government, and had a Meeting at <hi>Rye,</hi>

                     <p>This Evening we went to ſee another young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was in a deep Conſumption, but in a very comfortable State of Mind; having a great Deſire to ſee me before ſhe died, ſhe ſent to me to come to her, and her deſire was anſwered, her Spirit being revived with a freſh Viſitation of the Love of Jeſus Chriſt, the holy Phyſician of Value, and our Supplications were, that the Lord would be pleaſed to be with her, and ſupport her to the End, and grant her an eaſy Paſſage from this Life to his glorious Kingdom, when it ſhould pleaſe him to remove her, which Prayer we have Cauſe to hope was anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Tho' the Days were ſhort we rode about fifteen Miles, and made theſe two Viſits, after that great Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> and the Seaſon was exceeding cold; but our great and good Maſter ſupported us, and was with us in our Exerciſes and Service for his Name and Truth's Sake.

I was fainty after this Meeting, but reſting a little I ſoon grew better, ſo that we had an Evening Meeting at <hi>James Cock</hi>'s, where one came and told us, we muſt not eat any Fleſh, and produced <hi>Thomas Tryon</hi>'s Works for his Proof; but I took the Bible, and ſhewed him a

Tho' at the ſame Time, according to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, I was for Temperance in Meats and Drinks, as well as Moderation in Apparel. The next Day we had a very large Meeting at <hi>Oyſter-Bay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Oyſter-Bay.</note> many being there, who were not of our Society, who ſteadily gave Attention to what was declared: Here being many young People, they were perſuaded to give up their blooming Years to do the Will of God, and to Remember him their Creator, in their youthful Days: Friends ſaid there had not been ſuch a Meeting there a great while, for which Opportunity I was humbly thankful to the Lord. After Meeting we went to <hi>Samuel Underhill</hi>'s, and had an Evening-meeting with his Brother, who, through Sickneſs and Lameneſs, could not get out for a long Time. "Next" Day, <hi>Samuel Bowne,</hi> being with me, we went to viſit a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was weak in Body, but lay in a comfortable Frame of Mind; ſhe was thankful for our Viſit, and ſaid the Viſits of her Friends were comfortable to her. Next Day, being the Fourth-day of the Week, we had a Meeting at the Widow <hi>Taylor</hi>'s, who deſired it on Account of her Father, who was in the 88th Year of his Age, and ſo infirm, that he could not get to Meetings; he was very clear in his Underſtanding and Memory, and was much refreſhed with this Meeting, as were divers of us alſo. Next Day we had a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Fluſhing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fluſhing.</note> which was large and open, and the Grace and Power of Chriſt was with us in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Goſpel. After this Meeting, we had an Evening-meeting with our antient Friend <hi>Joſeph Thorne,</hi> who by Reaſon of his Age and Infirmity could not go abroad as far as to the Meeting: The Houſe was crowded with his Neighbours and Friends, and
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:006297_0183_10285787615CA258"/>
we had a ſolid, good Time together. While at <hi>Fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> I went to viſit a young Woman who was a moſt diſmal Spectacle to behold, an Object of great Pity: Her Face, Hand and Foot, being much eaten away by the King's Evil; our Prayers were, that now in her great Miſery, the Almighty would be pleaſed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her Soul by his Grace and Spirit, and ſanctify her Afflictions to her, that it might work for her a more exceeding Weight of Glory in that World which is to come. The next Firſt-day we had a large Meeting at <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> wherein many weighty Truths were opened to the Satisfaction and Edification of the Auditory, and in the Evening we had a Meeting with the Wife of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Farrington,</hi> who was too weakly to go abroad; the Neighbours came in, and we had a ſeaſonable Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. The next Third-day was the Youths-meeting at <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> in which we were concerned to exhort to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God and their Parents, and to follow their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as they follow Chriſt; for where any leave Chriſt, there we are to leave their Example, though they were our Fathers or Mothers; and the right Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Parents was ſet forth, and they exhorted not to deſpiſe the Day of ſmall Things, and the happy State of the Obedient, and the unhappy State of the Diſobedient, and many weighty Truths were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them in that Meeting by ſeveral experienced Friends. From <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> I went to the Week-day-meeting at <hi>Newtown,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town.</note> and in the Evening we had a Meeting at the Widow <hi>Way</hi>'s; the Neighbours coming in, we had a good Time with them: The Parable of the ten Virgins, was treated of, and the great Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of wanting the divine Oil of Grace in our Veſſels, was ſhewn to them.</p>
                     <p>The next Day, being the 5th of the Week, we had a very large, ſatisfactory Meeting, at the Widow <hi>Allſup</hi>'s at the <hi>Kills,</hi> and from thence with ſeveral Friends went to <hi>New-York,</hi>

cold, but we felt the Love of Chriſt to warm our Hearts, and tho' I think I never felt it colder, I never had my Health better. Several Friends accompanied us to the Boat at <hi>New-York,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">New-York.</note> the Water being open on that Side, we took our Leave of each other, and put out for the other Shore; but before we got there, we were blocked up in the Ice and it was a conſiderable Time before we could work our Way through, but at laſt got well on <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> where I waited ſome Hours for Company, who through ſome Difficulty got on Shore; after which we went to the <hi>Narrows</hi> thro' a Storm of Wind and Snow, but the Wind being high we could not get over that Night, nor the next Day, the Ice having come down, and filled the Bay: When the Tide had drove away the Ice, we put out, and got well over, and lodged at the Ferry-Houſe on <hi>Staten-Iſland.</hi> Next Morning we went to the Ferry at the <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing-Star,</hi> over againſt <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> but it was all faſtened with Ice, and we not daring to venture over it, went to the Ferry at <hi>Amboy,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Trenton.</note> and lodged at Capt. <hi>Gould</hi>'s, who treated me very kindly, I being much tired with Travelling. Next Morning I went over <hi>Delaware River</hi> on the Ice (as we had alſo the Day before at <hi>Rariton</hi>) and that Day, being the 5th of Twelfth Month,<note place="margin">Frankfort.</note> I got ſafe Home to my loving Spouſe and tender Children, where I found all well, and a hearty Reception, having travelled 600 Miles, and attended above 60 Meetings.</p>
                     <p>After having been at Home, and at our own Meeting at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> I went to the Quarterly-meeting at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> where Friends were glad to ſee me.</p>
                     <p>On the next Fifth Day I was at the Marriage of <hi>Thomas Maſters,</hi> and <hi>Hannah Dickinſon,</hi> where were many ſober People, not of our Society.</p>
                     <p>Having been lately among Friends at <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and been comforted in the many Opportunities we had together, it came into my Mind to viſit them with an

                           <p>It came into my Mind to write a few Lines to the Quarterly-meeting of Friends at <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> by way of Epiſtle, well knowing alſo that many of us are as Epiſtles writ in one anothers Hearts by the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Finger of the moſt High; and thoſe Characters of divine Love ſo written will not eaſily be eraſed. I could willingly have been at your Quarterly-meeting, but that I had been ſo long from my Family, that I was much wanted therein, and my coming Home was ſeaſonable and acceptable, both to them and my Friends; and I humbly thank the Lord, I found all well. Now that which is on my Mind to your Quarterly-meeting, is after this Manner, concerning the Government of the Church of Chriſt, of which Church He is the holy Head and Lawgiver: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to ſeek and wait for Counſel and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from him, in all our Monthly and Quarterly-meetings, for the well-ordering of our little Society, which is growing and increaſing in the Earth, and alſo in your Iſland (notwithſtanding the invidious Attempts of ſome Men of corrupt Minds) and it will grow and increaſe more and more, as we keep our Places, our heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                           <p>Dear Friends, the good Order of Truth, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt in his Church, is a great Help to us and our Children, when carried on in Chriſt's
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:006297_0186_1028579059C6C528"/>
Spirit [pray obſerve or mind that] for if our Order, and Church-Government, be carried on in the Spirit of Man (as he is meer Man) tho' he is never ſo crafty, or cunning, it will do more Hurt than Good in the Church of Chriſt. Chriſt's Spirit muſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern Chriſt's Church; and when, and where, that is over all, then, and there, Chriſt's Church, and Kingdom, is exalted, of whoſe Kingdom and Peace there will be no End; and happy will all thoſe be, whoſe End is in it. <hi>Moſes,</hi> that Man of God, governed in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in the Spirit of God, and when he found the Work too heavy for him, the Lord put his Spirit on Seventy more, who were Help-meets in the Government; ſo that it was God's Spirit that governed; and while that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, all was well; but when they went from that, they fell into Error and Diſobedience; and, at length, the Meſſiah came, and he governed his own little Flock himſelf; and when he aſcended up on high, he promiſed his Spirit ſhould be with, and in his Church, forever, and be their holy Guide into all Truth, in which he would alſo comfort them: And Chriſt fulfilled this his Promiſe; for when his Diſciples waited at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be endued with Power from on high, according to the Advice of their Lord, they were filled with the Gift and Grace of the Holy Spirit: And when the Brethren and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders met together about the Affairs and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, they gave forth Rules and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from that General-meeting to the particular Ones; and the Holy Ghoſt preſided amongſt them, which they ſignified to the other Meetings, ſaying, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to put you in Mind of ſuch and ſuch Things.</hi> And while this Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit, governed in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtian Church, all was well; God and Chriſt was glorified, and his Church and People edified; but by going from that, the Apoſtacy came in.</p>

                           <p>And, dear Friends, the Teſtimony of Jeſus, in the Spirit of Prophecy, opens in me after this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that if our Society keep and live up to the Spirit and Truth of Chriſt, which hath been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to our Fore-fathers, and to us alſo in this Age, the great Lord of all will proſper his Work in our Hands, and bleſs both us and our Children, as we and they keep therein.</p>
                           <p>And as we have kept cloſe to this our heavenly Guide, how hath the Lord ſweetly manifeſted his Love and Power to us in our Meetings for the well-ordering of our Society? Which many Times hath filled our Hearts with pure Praiſes, and holy Thankſgiving, to the high and lofty One, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits Eternity, and dwells in the higheſt Heavens, and is Light forever: To whom, with the Lamb of God, who takes away the Sins of the World, I recommend you, my dear and well beloved Friends, Brethren, and Siſters, in Chriſt, with my own Soul.</p>

                     <p>Soon after I was at the Firſt-day Meetings at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi>; and in this Month I went into the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi>

The Meeting ended (to Satisfaction) with Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Almighty.</p>
                     <p>A few Days after, I was at our General Spring-meeting in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which was large; where our Friends <hi>Robert Jordan</hi> and <hi>Abigail Bowles</hi> had good Service.</p>
                     <p>This Week I was at four very large Meetings, at <hi>Philadelphia, Franckfort,</hi> and <hi>Abington,</hi> much to my Satisfaction, tho' I had no vocal Service therein; yet my Heart was broken into Tenderneſs and Tears, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Miniſtry of ſeveral weighty, ſolid Teſtimonies, that were born by good and living Miniſters, qualified to preach the Goſpel in the Demonſtration of the Spirit, and with Power.</p>

The People of this Meeting were generally <hi>Germans,</hi> ſeveral of whom ſtay'd in the Houſe after the Meeting was over, and were broken into Tenderneſs, in a Senſe of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Love of God unto us, for which I was alſo humbly thankful and bowed in Spirit.</p>
                     <p>I was at the Third-day Weekly-meeting in <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> which was but ſmall, conſidering the large Number of thoſe profeſſing to be of our Society in this City; thoſe preſent were cloſely and tenderly exhorted to be zealous for good Works, and againſt bad Works; not reſpecting the Perſon of any Man; the Abominations committed by ſome under our Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in this City and Province, calling for Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as the Promiſe of God's Favour was to thoſe who mourn'd with Sighs and Cries for the Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among his People formerly, <hi>Ezek.</hi> ix. 4.6. ſo now, as many as are under the ſame Concern, may hope for Preſervation and Salvation, if he ſhould in like Manner viſit us, as at this Time he doth ſome of our Neighbours; there being a great Sickneſs and Mortality in ſome of the adjacent Places.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Cohanſy.</note> and had Meetings there: I was informed that more than Seventy Perſons had lately died here of a malignant Diſtemper, tho' it ſeem'd to abate, none dying while we were there.

                     <p>From <hi>Cohanſy</hi> I went thro' the Wilderneſs over <hi>Maurice</hi>'s River,<note place="margin">Maurice<hi>'s</hi> River.</note> accompanied by <hi>James Daniel,</hi> thro' a miry, boggy Way, in which we ſaw no Houſe for about forty Miles, except at the Ferry, and that Night we got to <hi>Richard Townſend</hi>'s, of <hi>Cape-May,</hi> where we were kindly received; next Day we had a Meeting at <hi>Rebecca Garriſon</hi>'s, and the Day after a pretty large one at <hi>Richard Townſend</hi>'s, and then went down to

                     <p>From <hi>Cape-May</hi> we travelled along the Sea-Coaſt to <hi>Great-Egg-Harbour,</hi> had another Meeting, much larger than the firſt, at <hi>Rebecca Garriſon</hi>'s, and here I was much concerned to promote the ſettling a Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting, for the well-ordering the Affairs of our Society.</p>
                     <p>We ſwam our Creatures over <hi>Egg-Harbour</hi> River, and went over ourſelves in Cannoes, and afterwards we had a Meeting at <hi>Richard Summers</hi>'s, which was as large as could be expected, conſidering the People's living at a Diſtance from each other.</p>
                     <p>The next Meeting we had at <hi>John Scull</hi>'s; and on Firſt-day we had a large one at <hi>Peter White</hi>'s, and on Second-day at <hi>Japhet Leeds</hi>'s, and then we went five Miles through a Marſh to <hi>Little-Egg-Harbour</hi> River, and had a Meeting in their Meeting-houſe on the Fourth Day of the Week, and 11th Day of the Month, which was the larger by the Addition of the Owners, Maſters, and Mariners, of two Sloops from <hi>New-York,</hi> who, hearing of the Meeting, came to it. And the next Day we had another Meeting at the ſame Place, and lodged at <hi>Jervis Farc</hi>'s. After theſe two Meetings, I left <hi>Egg-Harbour,</hi> accompanied by ſeveral Friends from thence, and travelled about forty Miles, before we came to any Houſe.

                           <p>I was with him ſeveral times in his laſt Illneſs, and moſt of the two laſt Days of his Life, as thou mayſt perceive by the Contents.—Our worthy Father was honourably buried on the 11th Inſt. being carried from his own Houſe to the Meeting-houſe at <hi>Horſley-down,</hi> accompained with his Relations, where was a large Meeting of many People, as many as the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe could well contain, and many Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were there born to the innocent, exemplary Life, Integrity and honeſt Zeal of our dear Father, ſo concurrent and unanimous, that I have hardly known any ſuch Occaſion more remarkable: He was accompanied from thence to the Grave very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, and there in like Manner interred, where a further Teſtimony was given to his honeſt Life and Converſation, and lively Zeal for the holy Truth, whereof he made Profeſſion.</p>

I may farther add, that when Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was about 60 Years of Age, he had a Concern to viſit Friends Meetings in the North of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome other Parts of the Nation; and in the 75th Year of his Age, he travelled to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and from thence (in Company with <hi>James Bates,</hi> a publick Friend, of <hi>Virginia</hi>) went over for <hi>Ireland</hi>; in all which Services he had good Satisfaction, and was
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:006297_0200_10285846A691F660"/>
well received of Friends: Divers other Journeys and Travels he performed not here noted; but this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into mother Nation at 75 Years of Age, ſhews his Age had not quenched his Love and Zeal for his Lord's Work and Service.</p>
                           <p>In our Father's Old-age he was attended with very great Exerciſes: About the 77th Year of his Age, as he was aſſiſting his Men in the Duſk of the Evening, he miſſed his Footing, and fell down, and broke his Leg; and ſoon after his Leg was well, he met with another Accident by a Fall, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him, and made him lame to his Death, never recovering the Hurt he had by that Fall, which was after this Manner; he was ſitting in a Chair by his Door on a Plank, which not being ſet faſt, it fell, and he, to ſave himſelf from the Stroke of the Plank, fell with his Hip on the Stones, and got hurt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, notwithſtanding he was remarkable for his Activity; he would walk (tho' ſo aged, and alſo lame) as far as the <hi>Work-houſe, Devonſhire-houſe,</hi> and <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth</hi> Meetings [two or three Miles from Home.] The laſt bad Accident that befel him was about three Weeks before his Death, when, being walking in the Timber-yard, a ſingle Plank, which ſtood againſt a Pile, fell down, and ſtriking him on the Side, threw him down; he complained not much of the Blow till about a Week after, when he was taken with a violent Pain in his Side, on the very Place where he received the Stroke, and, when his Cough took him (with which he was often troubled) the Pain was very great; howbeit, thro' Means of a Sear-cloth he received ſome Eaſe, and the Pain of his Side abated, and the Cough went off; but a violent Flux followed, and it brought him very low, and extream weak; ſo that it was thought he could not continue long; upon which Notice was ſent to me, and I went to ſee him, and found him very low; but he revived, and changed often in this laſt Illneſs;
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:006297_0201_102858482E656D18"/>
I having been to ſee him five or ſix Days before, having an Account he was ill, I then found him chearful, and thought he might recover. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued all the Time of his Illneſs in a patient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Frame of Mind; on a firſt Day, in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, he took his Bed, being the 6th of the Firſt Month, and in the Evening, after the Afternoon-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which was the Day before his Death) ſeveral Friends came to viſit him, who, finding him very weak, after a little Stay, went to take their Leave of him, whom he deſired to ſit down, and after ſome Time of Silence, he broke forth in Declaration in an intelligible and lively Manner, to this Effect, ſaying; <hi>We have no continuing City here, but ſeek one to come, which hath Foundations, whoſe Builder and Maker is God: Friends, that we may all labour to be prepared for our laſt and great Change, that when this earthly Tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, we may have a Habitation with the Lord, a Building not made with Hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Heavens, and that it might be thus, the Lord hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good,</hi> viz. <hi>To do juſtly, love Mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.

My Son-in-law, <hi>Samuel Thornton,</hi> being with me, and we ſitting by the Bed-ſide, with his Nurſe, his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, and his Men, about the 4th Hour in the Morning he pray'd fervently after this Manner: <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace,

                           </p>
                           <p>After a little Time of Silence, he deſired me to remember his dear Love, in the Life of Chriſt Jeſus, to my dear Brother, <hi>Thomas Chalkley,</hi> in <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and to all my old Friends and Acquaintance.</p>
                           <p>About the 11th Hour in the Morning he enquired how the Tide was, which no Body preſent could exactly tell; ſome Time after he aſked again; his Man then went out to ſee, returning, he told him, it would be High-water about 3 a Clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; he then lay ſtill a while, and after ſome Pauſe ſpoke chearfully out aloud, ſo that all in the Room might hear him, <hi>I ſhall go off about Five</hi>; his Man ſaid, Maſter, how do'ſt know? To which he anſwered, <hi>Know, I do not know, but I believe it.</hi> After this the Apothecary, one of his Neighbours (among whom he was well beloved) about Noon came to ſee him, and aſked him how he was? Father anſwered, that for three or four Hours in the Night he thought he ſhould have gone. Why, ſaid he, Sir, it will be no Surpriſe to you, I hope. No, no, ſaid my Father, very chearfully.

                           <p>3d, He had a fatherly Care for his Children, in tender Prayers for us, and in good Advice to us, and in giving us Learning according to his Ability, and teaching us (by his Example, as well as Precept) Induſtry, Humility, and the true Religion of our bleſſed Saviour, endeavouring to plant it in us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and to deſtroy the evil Root of Sin in us, while young.</p>

                     <p>Our General-meeting at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> the 30th of Fourth-month, was large, our Friend <hi>William Piggot,</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> being there (in the Courſe of his Viſit to Friends in <hi>America</hi>) and had cloſe Work and good Service in this Meeting.</p>
                     <p>In the Fifth Month, 1726, I viſited the Meetings of Friends at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>

did my great Maſter: Becauſe I was concerned to teſtify, that their Deeds were Evil, and to excite my Friends to manifeſt a Chriſtian Zeal, by openly denying ungodly Men, while they continue in their ungodly Works; but when they become truly penitent, and reform their Lives, the Arms of Chriſt, and his Church, will be open to receive them.</p>
                     <p>Being under ſome melancholy Thoughts, becauſe ſome Perſons, for whom I wiſhed well, and to whom I had been of Service, were ſo envious and malicious as to tell falſe Stories of me, tending to defame me; as I was riding to our Meeting, it opened with Satisfaction to my Mind, <hi>The more my Enemies hate me, The more I'll love, if that can be</hi>; and I had hearty Deſires to come up in the Practice of this Reſolution: And I then thought I ſhould come up with them all, for if a Man loves and prays for his Enemies, if they are gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he is inſtrumental to their Good, and ſo hath Cauſe of Rejoicing; and if they are not gained, he heaps Coals of Fire on their Heads; ſo that every true Chriſtian, by keeping under the Croſs of Chriſt, and in the Practice of his Doctrine, gets the better of his Enemies.</p>
                     <p>In the Beginning of the Sixth Month, I was at the Burial of <hi>Robert Fletcher,</hi> a worthy Man, and one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally beloved by all Sorts of People (as far as ever I heard) There was a large Meeting at his Funeral, wherein ſeveral Teſtimonies, ſuitable to the Occaſion, were born: Some of his laſt Words were mentioned, which were, <hi>That he had lived according to the Meaſure of Grace given him.</hi> And the Doctrine of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was maintained according to the Scripture, and the People were exhorted to prepare for their final Change.

                     <p>My Neighbour, <hi>Daniel Worthington,</hi> accompanied me in this rough Travel, ſome Part of the Way being hilly, and very ſtony and buſhy, and the Weather wet. We had four Meetings, and rode about four-ſcore Miles; and tho' I had travelled much in this Province, I had never been at ſome of thoſe Places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But a few Nights before I ſet out, I had a plain Proſpect of them in a Dream, or Night Viſion, as I ſaw them afterwards, which I thought ſome-what remarkable.</p>
                     <p>The People inhabiting this Province, are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come numerous, and make many Settlements in the Woods, more than I have obſerv'd in my Travels in any of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations; and there hath long been a Deſire in my Mind that they might proſper in the Work of true and thorough Reformation; and a godly Fear and Concern being upon me, I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put them in Mind of the State of this Land, when their Fathers firſt came and ſettled in it; and to caution them, of growing careleſs, and forgetting the Lord, leſt he ſhould forſake them, and <hi>turn their</hi> now <hi>fruitful Fields into a barren Wilderneſs,</hi> as this was ſo lately; which it is eaſy with him to do, if he pleaſes, for the Sins of the People.</p>

reaſonable for People to turn away from us, as it was for our Fore-fathers to turn away from other Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>In the Seventh Month, I was at our Yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held at <hi>Burlington,</hi> for the Provinces of <hi>New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> which was a very large Meeting, there being Friends from <hi>New-England, Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt-day Morning I went to <hi>Eveſham</hi> to the Burial of our ſerviceable Friend <hi>Jervis Stockdale</hi>;<note place="margin">Eveſham</note> he being in good Eſteem, there was much People: The Meeting was in a good tender Frame, and continued ſeveral Hours ſo, in which divers Teſtimonies were delivered, in order to ſtir up People to Truth and Righteouſneſs, and godly living, that they might die well. I lodged the Night before at <hi>Peter Fearon</hi>'s, and in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was awaked out of my Sleep, as it were by a Voice, expreſſing theſe Words; HE THAT LIVETH AND BELIEVETH IN ME SHALL NEVER DIE. This I took to be the Voice of Chriſt, I do not know that it was vocal, but it was as plain as one. From theſe Expreſſions I had to obſerve to the People, the happy State and Priviledge of thoſe who live and believe in Chriſt, and that ſuch muſt not live in Sin.</p>
                     <p>During the Time of our Yearly-meeting, ſome rude People came up the River in a ſmall Sloop, provided by them for that Purpoſe, and ſpent their Time in drinking, carowſing, and firing of Guns, to the Grief and Concern of Friends, who were religiouſly diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Duty, in ſerving and worſhipping the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; and, it is obſervable, that one of theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Perſons had his Hand ſhot off at that Time, and that the chief Promoters and Actors in this riotous Company, were ſoon after cut off by Death, in the Prime of their Days.</p>
                     <p>After the General-meeting was over, which ended well, Friends in the Love of God departed in Peace

                        <p>2dly, <hi>James</hi> (the holy Apoſtle of Chriſt, our Lawgiver, and our King) ſays, <hi>Above all Things,</hi>

                           <hi>my Brethren, ſwear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, neither by any other Oath.</hi> Chriſt ſays, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>; and <hi>James,</hi> his Diſciple and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſays, <hi>Swear not by any Oath</hi>; wherefore, if ſwearing on the Bible be any Oath, or is ſwearing at all, it is contrary to the expreſs Doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> as is plain from the above cited Texts.</p>
                        <p>3dly. The Primitive Chriſtians did not ſwear at all, in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity. Query, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Modern ſwearing Chriſtians are better than the Primitive Ones, who for Chriſt, and Conſcience ſake, could not ſwear at all, even before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, tho' legally called?</p>
                        <p>4thly, Many Chriſtians have ſuffer'd Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they for Conſcience ſake could not ſwear, and ſo break the Command of Chriſt their Lord; and do not our Modern Chriſtians trample upon their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Sufferings? Some of whom ſuffered Death for not ſwearing before the Heathen Magiſtrates, and ſome were martyr'd by the Papiſts; judge then whether the Perſecuted or Perſecutors were in the right.</p>
                        <p>5thly, Many of our worthy Friends and Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (ſince the former) have ſuffer'd to Death in Goals for not ſwearing, when required by perſecuting Proteſtants, becauſe for Chriſt's ſake and Sayings, as above, they could not ſwear at all: And this hath been a Teſtimony which our Society hath conſtantly born ever ſince we have been a People, for the Reaſons above, and more alſo, if there were Occaſion, which might be given.</p>

                     <p>The 23d of Eighth Month, I was at the Morning Meeting at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> on a Firſt-day of the Week,<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> which was large, and I was concerned therein to exhort
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:006297_0210_10285867EE13DA48"/>
Friends to labour to purge and cleanſe our Society of ſuch under our Profeſſion who live in open Prophaneneſs, and are riotous in their Converſations. I was at the Bank-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Afternoon, where we had a comfortable Time: And the next Sixth-day of the Week I was at our Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting, where it was unanimouſly agreed, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſome late indecent Conduct of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons pretending to be of our Profeſſion, that a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from that Meeting ſhould go forth againſt ſuch diſorderly Doings, and unchriſtian Practices; and that all ſuch Perſons, who were irregular in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, be diſown'd to be of our Community, until they by Repentance, manifeſt their Reformation; which was accordingly ſoon after publiſhed, and read in our Firſt-day Morning Meeting, and in our Youths-meeting. And about this Time our Governor iſſued a ſeaſonable Proclamation againſt Drinking to Exceſs, Gaming, Swearing prophanely, Revelling, Night-walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Diſturbing the Peace, and other Immoralities; which afforded ſome Satisfaction to ſober and well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined Friends, and others: Yet there remain'd a great Exerciſe and Concern upon my Mind, that ſome young People, whoſe Parents had been careful in training them up, were grown ſo wicked, that by their extravagant Conduct, they not only diſturb'd our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Meetings, but likewiſe became obnoxious to the peaceable Government we live under.</p>
                     <p>In the Ninth Month I was at divers Meetings, at <hi>Merion,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Merion. German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Germantown, Fairhill, Abington,</hi> and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia</hi>; in which were ſeveral Marriages ſolemnized in a religious Manner. And in the Tenth Month, I went into the County of <hi>Salem,</hi> about my Affairs: It happened to be at the Time of the Quarterly-meeting for <hi>Salem</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter</hi> Counties; but I did not know of it,<note place="margin">Salem.</note> until I came to <hi>Salem,</hi> where Friends were glad to ſee me, as alſo I was to ſee them; there were ſome of us whoſe Hearts were knit and united together as <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s and <hi>David</hi>'s, the divine Love of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

much ſhed abroad in our Hearts at that Meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When it was over, and I had finiſhed my Buſineſs, I could not be clear in my Mind, without having ſome Meetings in the ſaid Counties of <hi>Salem</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter</hi>; and tho' it was a ſickly Time, and People died pretty much in thoſe Parts where we were going, <hi>James Lord</hi> and I, in the Love of Chriſt, viſited the Meetings at <hi>Alloway</hi>'s Creek, <hi>Cohanſy, Pile</hi>'s-<hi>Grove, Woodberry,</hi>

                        <hi>Newton,</hi> and <hi>Haddonfield,</hi> having Meetings every Day in the Week, except the laſt, and ſometimes riding near twenty Miles after Meeting, the Days being at the ſhorteſt, and the Weather very cold; but the Lord was with us, which made ſufficient Amends for all the bodily Hardſhips we met with.</p>
                     <p>I got home well, but weary; and was well and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received by my loving Spouſe, Children, and Servants; and I was truly thankful to the Moſt High, for his Preſence and Goodneſs continued to me; ſo that, tho' I perceived my bodily Strength to decline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, my Sight, Hearing, and Voice, failing much, I have Occaſion to believe, at times I was helped even beyond Nature in the Work of Chriſt, my dear Lord and Maſter.</p>
                     <p>The 27th of the Tenth Month, I heard the News of the Death of my dear Friend <hi>John Lee</hi> (by one ſent to Deſire my Company at his Burial) It affected me with Sorrow, he being an old Acquaintance, and inward Friend of mine, with whom I had travelled many Miles: He was a living, ſerviceable Miniſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and inſtrumental to convince di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of that Principle of Divine Light and Truth, which we profeſs. I could not be at his Burial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my Indiſpoſition, and the Unſeaſonableneſs of the Weather; yet I think it my Duty, to ſay this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him;
<q>That our Love and Friendſhip was conſtant and intire unto the End, having been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted about thirty-five Years, as near as I can remember.</q>

Whereas Intemperance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Health, ſtains the Reputation, hurts Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (in reſpect to a healthy Conſtitution of Body, and Eſtate) ruins many Families, brings to Poverty and Diſgrace, and, what is yet worſt of all, is a great Lett to Religion and the true Fear of God, and is a great Scandal to any who make Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>In this Month I accompanied <hi>William Piggot</hi> (who lately arrived from <hi>London,</hi> on a religious Viſit to the Meetings of Friends in <hi>America.</hi>) From <hi>Philadelphia</hi> we went to my Houſe at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and from thence to <hi>North-Wales,</hi>

                     <p>The 8th of the Twelfth Month was our Youths-meeting at <hi>Franckfort</hi>; many dying about this Time, I was concerned in the Meeting to put Friends in mind of their Mortality; and that I had told Friends lately, at their Meetings at <hi>Abington</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> "That as I was riding from my Houſe to <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> about a Mile from the City, I ſaw (in the Viſion of Life) the Hand of the Lord ſtretched over the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Province, with a Rod in it, in order to correct

the Inhabitants for their Sins and Iniquities; which Sight affected my Mind greatly, and altho' I did not hear any vocal Voice, nor ſee any viſible Hand, yet it was as plainly revealed to me as tho' I had:" And that notwithſtanding I underſtood ſome ſlighted that Teſtimony, yet I obſerved to them, that ſince that Time, more People were taken away than common, as they now might ſee; and indeed that inward Sight and Senſe I had of the Diſpleaſure of God for the Sins of the Times, made great Impreſſion on my Mind; and that no Fleſh might glory, the Lord took, from the Evil to come, ſeveral ſober, well-inclined young People, as well as divers whoſe Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations were evil and vicious; ſo that all had need to be warned to be watchful, and turn to the Lord, leſt he come at unawares, and call us ſuddenly out of the World unprepared. In the Twelfth and Firſt Months many died, of all Ages and Profeſſions; and now ſome, who would hardly give Credit to what I had delivered in ſeveral Meetings, began to ſee the Fulfilling of it, and great Talk there was about it: And many ſolid and large Meetings we had with the People at divers Funerals about this Time, exhorting the People not to ſlight the preſent Viſitation of the Almighty, and to prepare for Eternity, to meet the Judge of the Quick and the Dead, who ſtands at the Door. And among many that were taken away by Death, were ſome few of my particular Friends; and firſt, dear <hi>Hannah Hill,</hi> who was a bright Example of Piety and Charity, ſhe was like a nurſing Mother to me in my Affliction, as was her Huſband more like a Brother, than one not related, whoſe generous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment I may never forget at times. <hi>Thomas Griffith,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, died alſo about this Time: <hi>Thomas</hi> was a ſerviceable Man, and well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed in our Society; and his Wife a noted Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for being helpful to, and viſiting the Sick: She choſe the Houſe of Mourning, rather than the Houſe

Many of my Friends were kind to me, and ſent a Cargo of Goods, in the Sloop <hi>John, Anthony Peel</hi> Maſter, conſigned to me for Sales and Returns. When the Veſſel was loaded, ſhe proceeded down the River, and I went by Land to <hi>Salem,</hi> and was at Meeting there on Firſt-day, and on Third-day went aboard the Sloop at <hi>Elſenborough</hi>: On the 8th of the Second Month, we took in our Boat and Anchors, and proceeded to Sea. From <hi>Elſenborough</hi> and the <hi>Capes</hi> I wrote to my Wife, giving her an Account how it was with me, and encouraged her to bear my Abſence with Patience: It was indeed very hard for us to part.</p>
                     <p>I may not omit taking Notice of an Exerciſe which I felt one Night as I lay on my Bed in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> (on the 21ſt of the 1ſt Month, my Sleep being taken from me) which I recollected and wrote down on board the aforeſaid Veſſel, and was in this Manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That the Lord was angry with the People of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> becauſe of the great Sins and Wickedneſs which was committed by the Inhabitants, in Publick Houſes, and elſewhere: And that the Lord was angry with the Magiſtrates alſo, becauſe they uſe not their Power as they might do, in order to ſuppreſs Wickedneſs; and do not, ſo much as they ought, put the Laws already made in Execution againſt Prophaneneſs and Immorality: And the Lord is angry with the Repreſentatives of

the People of the Land, becauſe they take not ſo much Care to ſuppreſs Vice and Wickedneſs, and wicked Houſes, in which our Youth are groſsly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, as they ought to do: And alſo the Lord is angry with many of the better Sort of the People, becauſe they ſeek after and love the Things of this World, more than the Things of his Kingdom: And it was ſhewed me, that the Anger of the Moſt High would ſtill be againſt us, until there was a greater Reformation in theſe Things.</q>
[<hi>It is worthy of Commendation, that our Governor,</hi> Thomas Lloyd, <hi>ſometimes in the Evening, before he went to reſt, us'd to go in Perſon to Publick Houſes, and order the People he found there to their own Houſes, till, at length, he was inſtrumental to promote better Order, and did, in a great Meaſure, ſuppreſs Vice and Immorality in the City.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>For ſome Days after we were at Sea, the Weather was pleaſant, and we had our Health, for which my Heart was truly thankful. I exhorted the Sailors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Swearing; and tho' they had been much us'd to it, they left it off, ſo that it was rare to hear any of them ſwear; for which Reformation, ſo far, I was glad. I lent and gave them ſeveral good Books, which they read, and ſhew'd much Reſpect to me: But ſoon after the Wind was contrary (for ſome Days) and ſome in the Veſſel were quarrelſome. I aſk'd them what they thought of the Saying of Chriſt, <hi>viz. If a Man ſmite thee on one Cheek, turn to him the other alſo?</hi> At which they were ſilent, and better conditioned to one another afterwards, and we had ſome Reformation both from Fighting and Swearing. This Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age I was not ſo Sea-ſick as I formerly had been (tho' I had, before I left Home, ſome uneaſy Thoughts about my uſually being Sea-ſick) which I took as a peculiar Favour from Heaven. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Latitude of 20 Degrees North, we met with Calms and contrary Winds, which was very hard for ſome in the Veſſel to bear, they putting

themſelves much out of Temper about it; as for my own Part, I had been us'd to Diſappointments, and therefore did not ſo much mind it. I ſpent pretty much of my Time in reading and writing, and God being gracious, it was, in the main, a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Time to me; and I enjoyed my Health as well as ever I did at Sea in my Life, for which I often breathed forth inward Thanks to the Almighty.

                     <p>I was one Evening leaning over the Side of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, as being very loneſome (having little Converſation with any in the Veſſel, for divers Reaſons) I turned from all outward Things to the Lord, and was glad to feel his Preſence and Goodneſs, which was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to me in my loneſome State; and as my Travels and Concerns had called and cauſed me to be much on the Seas, it alſo pleaſed my good and gracious God, to ſupport me thereon many Times, in divers Trials, Temptations, and Exerciſes; for all which, I bow in awful Reverence before him, and return Thankſgiving and Praiſe to his great Name.</p>

Next Tide we got to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and, it being Firſt-day, I had a Meeting with Friends there, with which we were greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in the Lord, and in one another. After Meeting I went on board the Sloop, and, having a fair Wind, we ſailed for <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where we arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the eleventh Hour, lodged that Night at <hi>Paul Preſton</hi>'s, and next Day went home to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> where my Wife, Children, and Servants, received me with much rejoicing.</p>
                     <p>When I was in <hi>Barbados, P. M.</hi> who accompanied me from <hi>Bridge-Town</hi> to Windward to Counſellor <hi>Weeks</hi>'s, told me, "That when I was in the Iſland before, he and I had ſome Diſcourſe concerning the Uſe of the Sword, he then (not being of our Society) wore a Sword, but now had left it off, and his Buſineſs alſo, which was worth ſome Hundreds a Year." I had reminded him of Chriſt's Words, that, <hi>Thoſe who take the Sword, ſhould periſh with the Sword,</hi> Mat. xxvi. 52. and, <hi>Reſiſt not Evil, and if a Man ſmite thee on one Cheek, turn the other alſo: Love Enemies, do Good to them that hate you, pray for them who deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe you, and perſecute you.</hi> After I had us'd theſe Arguments, he aſk'd me, <hi>If one came to kill me, would I not kill rather than be killed?</hi> I told him, <hi>No; ſo far as I know my own Heart, I had rather be killed than kill.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>That was ſtrange, and deſired to know what Reaſon I could give for it.</hi> I told him, <hi>That I being innocent, if I were killed in my Body, my Soul might be happy; but if I killed him, he dying in his

Wickedneſs, would, conſequently, be unhappy; and if I were killed, he might live to repent; but if I killed him, he would have no Time to repent; ſo that, if he killed me, I ſhould have much the better, both in reſpect to myſelf and to him.</hi> This Diſcourſe had made ſo much Impreſſion, and ſo affected him, that he ſaid, he could <hi>not but often remember it.</hi> And when we parted at <hi>Bridge-Town,</hi> we embraced each other, in open Arms of Chriſtian Love, far from that which would hurt or deſtroy.</p>
                     <p>After I had been at home ſome Time, I viſited the Meetings at <hi>Philadelphia, Burlington</hi> and <hi>Germantown,</hi> in which Places I had Service of divers Kinds, and was lovingly received by Friends and others.</p>
                     <p>In the Fifth Month, <hi>Joſhua Fielding</hi> and <hi>John Oxley</hi> had a large and ſatisfactory Meeting at <hi>Franckfort. Joſhua</hi> came from <hi>London</hi> on a religious Viſit to <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and having been on divers Iſlands, he landed on the Main at <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> and from thence travelled thro' the Wilderneſs 400 Miles, or more, where no Publick Friend had ever travelled before: The Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was perilous, but the Lord was with him; who may, in his own Time, make Way for his Servants in thoſe deſart Places. <hi>John Oxley</hi> came on the ſame Account from <hi>Barbados,</hi> and had good Service among Friends in his publick Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>In this Month we thinking it convenient to ſend our little Children to School, and not having a School-maſter of our Society near us, concluded to put our Son and Daughter under the Care of <hi>Nathaniel Walton,</hi> to whom I thought it my Duty to write a few Lines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Salutation and Language I would have them train'd up in, which were on this wiſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

Children, in theſe Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> Reſpecting the Complement of the Hat, and Courteſying, the Practice thereof being againſt my profeſſed Principle; 1ſt, Becauſe I find nothing like it in the Bible; but, as I think, the contrary. Thou knows the Paſſage of the <hi>Three Children of God,</hi> who ſtood covered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a mighty Monarch; and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who could not bow to great <hi>Haman:</hi> And, 2dly, I believe thoſe Practices derived from vain, proud Man.

                     <p>The latter End of the Fifth, and the Beginning of the Sixth Months, the Weather was exceeding hot, ſo that divers People dy'd ſuddenly of the Heat (as it was ſuppoſed.)</p>
                     <p>The Beginning of the Sixth Month I was at the Youths-meeting at <hi>Abington,</hi> which was large,<note place="margin">Abington.</note> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to many; and I not having been there ſince I came from Sea, divers expreſſed their Gladneſs to ſee me; and we were that Day favoured with ſome Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, both celeſtial and elementary, to our Comfort.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame Month I was alſo at the Youths-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> It had been a ſickly Time,<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> but many had recovered. That Paſſage opened on my Mind, to ſpeak of in the Meeting, concerning the Lepers which Chriſt cleanſed and healed, being ten in Number, and that but one came to return Thanks to God, for being healed, and reſtored to Health, <hi>Luke</hi> xvii. 12. Friends were exhorted to prize their Health, and to ſhew their Thankfulneſs to God, the Giver of it, by fearing and ſerving him, and taking Heed to Chriſt, the Word, in their Hearts. The Meeting was in a good, ſolid Frame, and we praiſed the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and gave him Thanks for his merciful Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>About this Time I heard of the Death of our King <hi>(GEORGE the Firſt)</hi> a Prince whom I loved and honoured; which News was very ſorrowful to me on divers Accounts: His Love and Kindneſs to our Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, was well worthy our grateful Remembrance.</p>
                     <p>On a Third-day, being our Week-day-meeting at <hi>Franckfort, Elizabeth Whartnaby</hi> and <hi>Mary Smith</hi> were there: It was a comfortable Opportunity. They were two Nights at my Houſe. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                              </note>BY ſeveral Writings of thine (of late) I perceive that a good Thing is at work in thy Mind, the which I pray the All-wiſe and Infinite Being to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote in thy Heart, to thy eternal Salvation, and his Glory. I now begin to be in ſome Hopes that my Prayers and Tears for thee, in the Lord's Time, may be anſwered: And I do believe, if thou keeps low in thy Mind, that God will more and more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit thee. The Advice of <hi>David</hi> to his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he alſo gave him the Kingdom, comes before my Mind to give thee—<hi>My Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect Heart, and with a willing Mind; For the Lord ſearcheth all Hearts, and underſtandeth all the Imaginations of the Thoughts; if thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off forever,</hi> 1 Chron. xxviii. 9. Dear <hi>Iſaac,</hi> this was Counſel from one of the greateſt and beſt of Kings, to a wiſe young Prince, who petitioned the Almighty for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, before Riches, or Honour, or long Life; which Petition ſo pleaſed God, that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his Requeſt, and, over and above, bleſſed him in an extraordinary Manner.</p>
                           <p>I perceive thou art inclined to read pretty much: I pray thee, that thy chief Study in Books may be the holy Scriptures. Let all other Books (tho' of Uſe, and good, in their Places) be ſubſervient to them; for their Authority, of all other Writings (to the true Believers in Chriſt) are moſt divine;

                     <p>The latter End of the Sixth Month, I went to the General-meeting of Miniſters and Elders for the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Part of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> and to the Quarterly and Youths-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at <hi>Burlington,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Stony-Brook.

                     <p>The 16th of the Seventh Month began our Yearly-meeting at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Yearly-meeting at <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi>
                        </note> which was attended with the gracious Preſence of God, to the Comfort and great Satisfaction of many Souls. In this Meeting divers young Men and young Women appeared, who were lately come forth in the Miniſtry, and, as I believe, had received a Meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt's Goſpel; which was Cauſe of Rejoicing to the Faithful among us, and excited our Thankſgiving and Praiſes to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Lord of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                     <p>At this Meeting we had the Company of four Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and one from <hi>Barbados,</hi> and many from divers other Parts, it being a very large Gathering of ſome Thouſands of People (as was believed) in which many were ſtrengthened in their Faith in Chriſt, and comforted thro' the Power of the

In the Conſideration of that Chriſtian Love which was between us, I think I may truly note, That we were always glad to meet each other; therefore the Thoughts of this ſo ſudden Change, and final Parting, brought, for the preſent, a Sadneſs and Heavineſs over my Mind; conſidering his Station in that Neighbourhood, and Service in that Congregation to which he did belong; for therein he was well-beloved, and very ſerviceable.</p>
                     <p>And Oh! The Loſs that his dear Wife and tender Children will have of him, really affects me with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in penning theſe Notes; but the Sorrow, in theſe Things, is all on our Side; for he, without Doubt, is at Reſt with his great Maſter in Heaven. We had a larger Meeting at his Funeral, than ever was known to be there before (as an antient Friend told me) which was ſolemn and ſerviceable to many.</p>
                     <p>Some Time after, having been at divers Meetings about home, <hi>John Oxley</hi> and I, in Company, viſited Friends on <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi>

                     <p>I was alſo at <hi>Rahaway</hi> River, where was a ſolid,<note place="margin">Rahaway.</note> good Meeting. From thence I returned home, having been abroad about a Month, and at above 20 Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and travelled above 350 Miles.</p>
                     <p>In the Eighth Month, at <hi>Franckfort,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> we had three Burials out of one Houſe, at one Time; the Mother, Daughter, and Grand-daughter (of which I had never known the like Inſtance before) On this Occaſion we had the Company of many Neighbours, and a very ſolemn Meeting at our Meeting-houſe at <hi>Franckfort.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About this Time I was at divers Meetings at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, Abington,</hi> and <hi>Burlington:</hi>

                     <p>The World ſtill continued to frown upon me; but, tho' my Caſe was ſuch in this World, yet, at Times, I had great Conſolation in Chriſt; and, in the Midſt of my Troubles, when I looked back, I could truly ſay, That I had not been extravagant, but frugal; not covetous, but charitable; not idle, but induſtrious; not willing to be ſuch an <hi>Infidel</hi> as not to take Care for my Family; it was ſome ſolid Comfort to my Mind;
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:006297_0226_10285896133A4D60"/>
and I bleſs the Almighty, that I always preferr'd his Work and Service to my own, and therein had great Peace. This I can alſo ſay, if it were the laſt I ſhould ſay, That I never wilfully, or knowingly, wrong'd any Man, Woman, or Child, ſince I came to Years of Diſcretion; and yet I have nothing to boaſt of; it is the Lord's <hi>Grace</hi> and Mercy <hi>which ſaveth us.</hi>

even ſome vile, prophane Men, whom I could not forbear to reprove for their Swearing, and taking the ſacred Name in vain, yet they ſhew'd Reſpect, notwithſtanding I reproved them ſharply.

The 3d and 4th Days of the Sixth Month, it was very windy, with Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Thunder, and Rain; in which rough Weather one of our beſt Sailors put his Shoulder out of Joint, and they brought him to me to ſee if I could do him any Service; I was not forward to meddle; but the Man and the People believing, if I would undertake for him, I might help him; I told them, that tho' I did not underſtand Bone-ſetting, I would inſtruct them the beſt I could; then I ordered him to ſet down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Deck, and to be ſtript to the Waiſt, and got a round Piece of Wood as thick as his Arm, and wrapt a Piece of Cloth about it, that it might not bruiſe his Fleſh, and put it under his Arm, and ordered two Men, one at each End of it, to lift up ſtrongly, and a third Man to ſtretch his Arm out, and keep it down withal; which being done, the Bone went into its Place; for which I was thankful in my Heart to the Almighty.—About the 10th of the Sixth Month we ſafely arrived at <hi>Spight</hi>'s-<hi>Town</hi> in <hi>Barbados,</hi>

                     <p>After I came home from this Voyage, I viſited the Meetings of Friends at <hi>Philadelphia, Franckfort, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantown,</hi> the <hi>Falls of Delaware, Burlington, New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover, Mount-Holly, Fair-Hill,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The 2d of Ninth Month I was at the Quarterly-meeting of Miniſters and Elders at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> where I met with <hi>Joſeph Taylor,</hi> a Friend, who had viſited our Meetings pretty generally on the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and was now on his Return homewards, with whoſe Viſit Friends had good Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and certified the ſame to our Brethren of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where he lived in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>

<pb n="220" facs="unknown:006297_0232_102858A661053F40"/>
Time, to declare to the People of that City, "That the Lord was angry with the Legiſlators of <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> becauſe they were not ſo much concern'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Religion and Piety as they ought, and to make ſuch Laws as might prevent the exceſſive Increaſe of Publick Houſes, which often prove Seminaries of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; but ſtrove to promote Parties more than Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And that the Lord was angry with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, becauſe they did not ſo much as they might, and ought to do, put thoſe good and wholeſome Laws in Execution, which were already made, againſt Vice and Immorality: And that the Lord was angry with ſome of the better Sort of People, becauſe they ſeek and mind the Things of this World, more than the Things of God and his Kingdom." But I was helped to clear myſelf in the Morning-meeting, to the Satisfaction of many of the Honeſt-hearted, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden my Mind of a great Exerciſe that I had long lain under.</p>
                     <p>In the Afternoon we had a large Meeting at the Bank-meeting-houſe, occaſioned by the aforeſaid Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial; the Reſurrection of the Dead was declared in that Meeting, according to the Doctrine of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, the great Author of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and alſo of that eminent Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>; and that old and falſe Calumny, that our Society denied the Reſurrection of the Dead, was publickly denied and refuted. The People were exhorted to live well, that they might die well; and then they need not doubt but that they would riſe well at the Reſurrection in the laſt Day: The Meeting concluded with Praiſe to the Almighty for all his Mercies, and Prayer to him, that he would ſanctify that Day's Service to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>In the Tenth Month, I prepared for another Voyage to the Iſland of <hi>Barbados,</hi> and had the Ship <hi>Briſtol Hope,</hi> conſign'd to me, but the Winter ſetting in ſooner than common, cauſed our Stay much longer

than we expected, whereby I had the Opportunity to viſit divers Meetings, as <hi>Burlington,</hi> the <hi>Falls of Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, Neſhaminy,</hi> and <hi>Wright</hi>'s-<hi>Town,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>

Bucks <hi>County.</hi> Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> In this City a Concern was on my Mind to declare to the People, that the Almighty had ſhewed me, that he had often viſited them in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> with his own Hand, and with his own Rod; but if that did not work the deſigned End, for which he viſited them (of which they were told alſo before it came to paſs) he then would chaſtiſe them with the Rod of Man, and this was as plainly ſpoken to me in my own Habitation, as tho' it had been the Voice of a Man, though it was not vocal.</p>
                     <p>The 12th of the Eleventh Month, being Firſt-day, I was at <hi>Horſham</hi> Meeting, and had a tender bowing Time therein; and in my Way home viſited ſome Friends who were ſick, it being a Time of general Viſitation in thoſe Parts, and the next Seventh Day I was at the Meeting of Miniſters and Elders at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> where we had a good Meeting; here I was earneſtly deſired to be at the Funeral of <hi>Edmond Orp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> the eldeſt Friend belonging to <hi>Franckfort</hi> Meeting;<note place="margin">Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> but was in a Strait, this Friend, being my Neighbour, and I had before engaged to be at the Burial of one with whom I had been acquainted near 40 Years, therefore I did my Endeavour to be at both, being each of them buried in the Afternoon, and five Miles diſtant; the Days being ſhort alſo, divers told me it was imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable; I told them they might be miſtaken, as they were, for though we had a large Meeting, and the Company of <hi>Rowland Wilſon,</hi> from <hi>Britain,</hi> who had large and good Service therein, yet after Meeting we mounted, and got to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> about a Quarter of an Hour after the Corps was brought into the Meeting-houſe, as I was informed; we had a large, and, as I thought, a good Meeting, after which I went home, being weary in my Body, but thankful in my Heart,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:006297_0234_102858AF9F68AA28"/>
that the Almighty had been with us, and helped us to perform that Day's Service.</p>
                     <p>On the 20th of the Eleventh Month, and Second-day of the Week, I went into a Piece of Ground (which I was clearing for Meadow) in order to give Directions to the Workmen, and one of the Trees fell contrary to the Kerf, and alſo to the Wind, which was then at North Weſt, and when I ſaw it falling towards me, I ran from it, but before I could get out of the Way, it fell upon me, acroſs my Book, from my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to my Hips, and ſtruck me down to the Earth, where for ſome Time I lay ſpeechleſs and in all Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood I ſhould have been immediately kill'd, if I had not been providentially preſerved by the Body of the falling Tree lying on a Stump, which prevented its cruſhing me, as I lay on the Ground. A Friend that was near me with a Horſe, deſired the Wood-cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (when they were recovered from the Surpriſe, and I to the uſe of my Speech) to help me on his Horſe, and I rode home, but in extreme Miſery, and I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great Concern, leſt I ſhould ſurprize my Wife and Children ſuddenly. We ſent to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for Dr. <hi>Griffith Owen,</hi> who came in about two Hours, and let me Blood, and order'd ſeveral Things to be apply'd and taken, which thro' Divine Favour proved very ſerviceable to me; notwithſtanding which I was in great Pain many Days, and long and tedious Nights, not being able either to feed myſelf, nor turn in my Bed, for a great while.—In this Confinement I was at times favoured with a very comfortable Senſe of the Preſence of God, whoſe Providence is over all his Works; and as his Love to me was great, ſo the Love of his People was alſo, many of whom, and of my Neighbours, came to ſee me, ſympathiſing with me in my Diſtreſs; but among them I had one of <hi>Job</hi>'s Comforters, who wickedly abuſed me in this Low State. I can ſcarce forbear mentioning his Name, having Example for it in holy Writ, but through the Lord's help I'll put on Charity.</p>

In this Meeting I exhorted them to think on Eternity, and to prepare for it, by living to Day, as tho' they were to die To-morrow; for I found it by Experience to be needful, and then if ſudden Death comes, it will not ſurprize us.</p>
                     <p>As I now found it continue my Buſineſs to go to Sea for a Livelihood, I undertook the Charge of the Ship <hi>New Briſtol Hope,</hi> as Maſter, tho' it was a Way of Living to which I did not incline; I took care in our Veſſel that there ſhould be no Swearing in my Hearing, nor Drunkenneſs, to my Knowledge, without Reproof, and if I could not be inſtrumental that Way to break them from Swearing, and Drinking to Exceſs, my Manner was, to put them away, ſo that we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally had a pretty quiet Ship. We left <hi>Philadelphia</hi> the 13th of the Twelfth Month, but Storms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds detained us in the River and Bay, ſo that we did not get out to Sea till the 21ſt of ſaid Month, when the Pilot left us,<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> by whom I wrote to my Wife and Family; and now I thought I felt the Benefit of the good Wiſhes of my beloved and dear Friends I left behind, which did me a great Deal of Good, as it often hath done on the like Occaſion; for faithful Friends, and good Chriſtians, are as Epiſtles written in one anothers Hearts.—In our Paſſage we took ſeveral Dolphins, which were very welcome to us, we having a long Paſſage, and our freſh Proviſions near ſpent. The 19th of the Firſt Month we ſaw the Iſland of <hi>Barbados,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Barbados.</note> having had ſeveral Meetings on board the Ship in this Voyage, the good Effects I could ſee but little of, only for that Day they would be a little more ſober, and ſome of them addicted to Swearing, did not ſwear ſo often as they did before.

                        <note place="margin">Bridge-Town.</note> at their Week-day-meeting; and next Firſt-day (being the 30th of the Month) I was at a Meeting at <hi>Pumpkin Hill,</hi> where I was enlarged in the Doctrine of Faith.</p>
                     <p>After this I went to the <hi>Bridge</hi> with a Friend from <hi>New-England</hi>; we had two good Meetings, it being the General-meeting for the Friends of the Iſland, and afterwards I with ſeveral Friends went again to <hi>Speight</hi>'s <hi>Town,</hi> and on the 12th of the Second Month, I was at the <hi>Thicket</hi>'s-<hi>meeting,</hi>

<q>That as many Paces as the Perſon takes in the Dance, ſo many Paces or Steps they take to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Hell:</q>
And I told them, that I had heard ſeveral had uſed that vain Exerciſe in our Meeting-houſe, which was appointed for the Worſhip of God, and I ſaid, I hoped for the future it would be ſo no more; two of thoſe Perſons who danced in our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-houſe, were then in the Meeting, tho' I did not know it. This Teſtimony ſo wrought on the Colonel, that he ſaid, he could ſcarcely feel his Legs ſince I ſpoke it; and the Juſtice ſaid, if theſe Words be true, he had taken many Steps towards Hell, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor and Judge ſaid, It was home Doctrine to ſome that were there: Divers of them ſeemed to be touched with the Teſtimony of Truth, though not ſo ſolidly as I deſired. Soon after I went with <hi>Joſhua Byrch,</hi> to viſit the Governor of the Iſland, Colonel <hi>Worſley,</hi> who treated us with much Freedom and Civility; he deſired me to ſit down by him, and then called for a Decanter of Wine, of which he kindly offered me a Glaſs, but I told him I chiefly drank Water; he ſaid Water is certainly the beſt Drink in the World, and told me I was a Credit to my Drink, as I looked as well or better than moſt who drank Wine.</p>

He ſaid he would contribute as much as any, altho' he had heard me only that one time; but he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that we received no Money nor Pay for our Preaching; yet his Good-will I aknowledged.</p>
                     <p>The 4th of the Third Month, I was at Meeting at the <hi>Spring,</hi> where I met with <hi>Joſeph Gamble,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spring.</note> and <hi>John Oxley,</hi> and his Wife, and ſeveral others, not belonging to this particular Meeting, and we were edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied together in the Love and Life of Chriſt. I was concerned to ſpeak of the divers Viſitations and Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God to the People ſince the World began; quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Words of holy Writ, That,
<q>God who ſpake to the Fathers by the Prophets, ſpeaks now in thoſe laſt Days by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all Things:</q>
And that this Diſpenſation is the laſt and brighteſt Diſpenſation of all, and is the greateſt and moſt glorious Manifeſtation of God's Love to Mankind; and that beſides this vocal Speaking of Chriſt, when in the Body on Earth, he now ſpeaks ſpiritually, which ſpiritual Speaking of Chriſt, in and to the true Church, and true Believers, will out-laſt Time, and endure to all Eternity; the great Lord of all for his unſpeakable Benefit therein, was praiſed and glorified, as being alone worthy.</p>

                     <p>In this Voyage a great and weighty Concern came on my Mind, on Account of the young and riſing Generation, deſiring they might be happy in this World, and in that which is to come. And firſt, as to this World,
<q>I have taken Notice, that divers of the Youth are too apt to waſte their outward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which often is given to them (for when they get it themſelves, they are for the moſt part more ſaving of it) and this Waſting ard Spending thoſe Sparks call Generoſity, Liberality, Good-nature, Gentility, fine Breeding, and Abundance of other fine Names, not conſidering the Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Frugality, Care and Watchings, of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Anceſtors, to get what they have.</q>
May Parents note this well, and not be anxiouſly concerned to get much Wealth, which may be a Means to ruin their Poſterity! And truly moſt of theſe ſpending, drinking, Company-keeping, gaming, chatting, tippling Youngſters, take a great Deal more Care, how they may get Money from others, that they may ſpend it, than how to earn it, or faithfully labour for it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they will beg or borrow, and run in Debt, but take little or no ſolid Thoughts to pay; by which Means divers of thoſe topping, beggarly Beaus, and Spenders, have brought both themſelves and Relations, Parents and Friends, to Shame and Diſgrace, and
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:006297_0239_102858BD898604D0"/>
ſometimes to Poverty,<note place="margin">1729.</note> where the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r Relations and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have been too liberal. Let all indulgent Parents note this alſo.</p>
                     <p>And if any concerned Perſon ſhould adviſe thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Youths of their Evils, 'tis much if they gain not their laſting Ill-will, and the Epithets of Nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards and Covetous, ill-natured, cenſorious, ſour, moroſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However I ſhall venture to ſtand the Shock of their Diſpleaſure, and in as moving Terms as I can, conſiſtent with the Matter on my Mind, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to conſider the End of their ſpending, ſlothful, idle Life (which if continued in) muſt needs end in their Ruin, and they may repent when it is too late, crying out, "Oh! that I had hearkened to the Advice of my Father, and my indulgent Mother! Oh! that I had taken the Counſel of my good Friends in Time, then I had not beer in this Condition, nor in thoſe Straits I am now in." This, or worſe, muſt at laſt inevitably be the Condition of thoſe unthinking Time-waſting and Money-ſpending, evil Company-keeping young People, of both Sexes. Some of whom, if they can get it, will ſpend more in a few Hours, than their Parents can get in ſo many Days, which is very unreaſonable, as well as unthinking; for if the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Parents do not hold their Hands, truly they muſt all ſink together; and where the Parents have been what theſe ſorts of Youths call liberal, whole Families have by ſuch Liberality been undone, which is a Caſe to be lamented by all ſober People.</p>
                     <p>I pray our ſpending Youths to conſider, how many brave, fine young Men and Women, whoſe Parents have left them Eſtates and handſome Incomes, have by ſuch Extravagancies, ſoon ſpent all, and ſometimes more than all, and Diſgrace and a Goal have been their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and how many, by living too faſt, have died too ſoon, much ſooner than might be expected, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Courſe of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I would adviſe them to regard what the wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Go to the Aunt, thou Sluggard,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:006297_0240_102858C060AC0F38"/>
conſider her Ways, and be wiſe; ſhe gathereth her Food in the Summer</hi> (i. e. <hi>ſhe prepares againſt the Winter</hi>) Though this may be deſpicable in the Eyes of our fine Gentlemen and learned ſpending Wits, yet there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more Wiſdom in theſe little induſtrious Animals, than in thoſe great Spenders, who, in the Spring and Summer of their Years, take ſo little Thought of ſaving what hath been with ſo much Care gotten for them, or of getting more againſt their Winter or Old-Age; which, if they live, will certainly overtake them, when their Youth or Summer is gone.</p>
                     <p>But many Youths object againſt this Advice, crying out, as I have often heard, "The aged give this Advice when they are old, but did as we do when they were young, as we are;" although this may be true in ſome, yet it will not hold good in the general, and if it do in ſome, is not that Maxim Good? "Let others Harms learn us to beware, before it be too late, that we fall not into the ſame Snare, which hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled or caught Thouſands, to their great Shame and reproach." Again, Thoſe who have been ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in their Youth, and are eſcaped out of the Snare, are more fit to caution or adviſe how to eſcape it, or to ſhew thoſe Paths which led them into that Labyrinth of Woe and Miſery.</p>
                     <p>The Author of all Evil uſeth his utmoſt Skill and Power to promote the Practices of exceſſive Drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> among Mankind, it being a mighty Support to his Kingdom; for when the Nobility of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is clouded thereby, then Oh! how many wicked Oaths, Oh! what corrupt Language, what unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, unbecoming Words and Actions, are brought forth! How is good Manners corrupted! How is the ſober, chaſte Soul offended, and, above all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, how is God diſhonoured, and the End of our Creation fruſtrated, and Man condemned!</p>
                     <p>When People are in thoſe Exceſſes, how do they take the ſacred Name in vain, and ſo bring themſelves in guilty before God, and Man; for he has poſitively

ſaid,
<q>
                           <hi>He will not bold them guiltleſs, who take his Name in vain</hi>; ſo that let him plead never ſo many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, he is pronounced guilty by the Judge of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth: Therefore let me perſwade the Youth to remember what the Lord by his Servants ſaid concerning drinking to Exceſs, <hi>Woe to the Drunkards</hi>; and that <hi>no Drunkard ſhall inherit the Kingdom.</hi> Again, <hi>Woe to them that are mighty to drink Wine, and Men of Strength to mingle ſtrong Drink,</hi> &amp;c. If it be objected, as it often is, when ſuch poor Souls are reproved, and their Sins ſet in Order before them; We truſt in the Mercy of God and the Merits of Chriſt; I ſay this is a good Truſt and Hope, if upon a good Foundation; but the Wicked muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Ways, and the Unrighteous their evil Thoughts; but what Forſaking is that, when ſtrong Conviction is upon the Soul, to make Covenants, Vows and Promiſes, and break them from Time to Time? And tho' Chriſt hath ſatisfied the Juſtice of the Almighty for Sinners, it is for thoſe who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Sins, not thoſe who plead for the Practice of them, and endeavour, by many vain Excuſes, to juſtify themſelves in them.</q>

                     <p>In this Voyage we had ſeveral Meetings on board, the firſt of which was at the Requeſt of my ſecond Mate, to call the Sailors together in the Cabin; I not being forward to propoſe it to them, leſt they ſhould ſuſpect me of ſome Vanity, in deſiring to preach to them; they not knowing the Croſs of Chriſt in that Exerciſe.</p>

                     <p>This Voyage, in our Return home, we had a full Ship, and upwards of thirty Paſſengers,<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> and was on our Paſſage home about a Month, and had good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Weather therein.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Cheſter.</note> and viſited my old Friend <hi>David Lloyd,</hi> who, with his good Spouſe <hi>Grace,</hi> treated me with tender, Chriſtian Love: the Judge and I, being old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and both of us in Years, and he not well, we took Leave, as if we were not to ſee one another any more (which happened accordingly, for he died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I returned.)</p>
                     <p>We weighed Anchor at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and got down to <hi>Elſenborough,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Salem.</note> and went to <hi>Salem</hi> Meeting (it being Firſt-day of the Week, and 12th of the Month) with ſome of our Paſſengers and Sailors.

Buſineſs, and viſiting our Friends Meetings in about five Weeks, we put to Sea the 10th of the Twelfth Month, and ſailed along to Leeward of divers Iſlands, till we came to <hi>Anguilla,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anguilla.</note> where we landed in Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to get Salt, but at this Time was not any to be had there. We came to an Anchor here in the Night, hoping to get to an Harbour before it was dark; but it ſoon being very dark, and coming into ſhoal Water, we ſaw a large Rock, and came to by the Side of it, in about five or ſix Fathom Water,<note place="margin">Narrowly eſcapes Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck.</note> taking it to be a Ship, and when it was Day we ſaw our Miſtake, and that inſtead of a Veſſel, we were too nigh a Rock, and the Wind coming about, tail'd our Ship towards it ſo near, that we were ſenſible of touching twice; I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Men to heave a little farther a-head, and ſo we lay clear till Morning. When Morning came, of which we were glad, ſeveral Boats, with a Cable, came to us, and the People adviſed us to put a Spring on our Cable, and cut it, that ſhe might caſt the right Way; which accordingly we did, and it had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Effect; ſo that we ſoon got into a very fine Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, it being about a Mile off. Many thanks were given by many of the People for this Deliverance to the Almighty. <hi>George Leonard,</hi> the Governor of this Iſland, heard in the Morning, that a Veſſel was on the Rocks, and the People were running with Saws and Axes, in order to break her up, if ſhe ſhould not be got off: The Governor ſeeing them, ſent a Lieutenant with Orders, that let her belong to what Nation ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they ſhould help to get her off, if it could be, and if ſhe was likely to be made a Wreck, he charged them at their Peril not to meddle with her, nor any Thing belonging to her, until they had firſt come to Terms with the Maſter, which is worthy to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
                     <p>We ſtay'd ſeveral Days before we could get our Anchor; for after we were in the Harbour, it blew very hard for four or five Days; ſo that with four

Oars we could not row our Boat a-head, but watching for a Calm one Night, our People went and got it, and then we went into the principal Road and Harbour in the Iſland called <hi>Croaker</hi>'s-<hi>Bay</hi>; the Name of that we came from was <hi>Rendezvous-Bay,</hi> where lived a very kind Friend of ours, named <hi>John Rumney,</hi> who, with his Wife and Family, treated us with great Love, and courteouſly received us in their Houſe, and he went with me to the Governor's, who was my old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Friend, who, with much Love and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (when he knew me) took me in his Arms, and embraced me, and lovingly ſaluted me with a Kiſs of Charity, and thanked God for our Deliverance, and that he had lived to ſee me once more (I having been there ſome Years before) he was ſeventy odd Years of Age, as I remember, and had eighty odd who called him Father: They living much on Roots and Pulſe, are very healthy in this Iſland. I was here nine Days, and had ſeven Meetings with the People; the longer I ſtaid the larger the Meetings were; ſo that I had ſome Difficulty to leave them. Through the Grace and Gift of God I was helped to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt freely, and they received it both freely and thankfully, divers, if not all; for theirs and my Heart was very open one to another, the holy Lord's Name be praiſed forever</p>
                     <p>The 3d of the Firſt Month, <hi>Ezra Worthington</hi> died, and the 4th in the Afternoon, he was buried on the Plantation of <hi>John Rumney,</hi> near his Houſe; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and his Son in Law were at the Burial, where I told them, that he was an inoffenſive, innocent, ſober young Man, and that Death was to be the End of us here, putting them in mind to remember their latter End. After I had done ſpeaking, the Governor ſaid,
<q>That Death was a Debt due to Nature, and that we muſt all pay it, and bleſſed is the Man that in Time truly prepares for it.</q>
This was a good Expreſſion for a Man in his Poſt, and worthy of my Notice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I thought.</p>

                     <p>The 20th of the Firſt Month, being the firſt of the Week, we had a comfortable Meeting for Divine Worſhip, in which the Goodneſs of God was extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us as we were rowling on the mighty Waters of the great Deep, after which we had pleaſant Weather, and a fair Wind, for ſeveral Days.</p>
                     <p>On the 26th the Wind ſprung up at Eaſt North-Eaſt, a hard Gale, which laſted ſeveral Days; and having but little Sea-room for about thirty Hours, it blew ſo hard, that we could dreſs no Victuals: I then thought on the Words of <hi>Job,</hi> when he ſpoke to his impatient Wife, ſaying 'Shall we receive Good at the Hand of God, and ſhall we not receive Evil alſo? (or that which is accounted or looks like Evil in the Eye of Man) In this time of Exerciſe the Love and heavenly Life of God, in his beloved Son, filled my Heart, and cauſed an Overflowing of Praiſes to his holy, glorious, and bleſſed Name. Oh! it was exceeding precious to my Soul at that time!</p>
                     <p>The 1ſt of the Second Month, we ſaw Land, being driven to the Southward near 250 Miles in this laſt hard Weather; but we ſoon after arrived at our deſired Port.</p>

<pb n="244" facs="unknown:006297_0256_102858EFBA861DE0"/>
were taken off the Stage of this Life in the City of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and I was concerned to exhort Friends in that City to bring their Children to Meetings, and educate them, when young, in the Way they ſhould go, that they might not depart from it when old; and that he who had taken many away, could, if he pleaſed, take many more; or though he might have laid down his Rod at preſent (the Diſtemper in the City being much abated) he could ſoon take it up again. It is my Belief that the Lord Almighty will ſtill continue to viſit the City and People (if there is not a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) with further, if not ſorer, Viſitations, becauſe he hath known them to do them Good, and make them a Bleſſing to many Iſlands and People; giving them the Fatneſs of the Earth, and that which is far more, the Dew of Heaven; ſo that he may juſtly ſay to us, as to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>You have I known of all the Families of the Earth; therefore I will viſit upon you for all your Iniquities.</hi>

                     <p>The 27th Day (being the Firſt Day of the Week) we had a comfortable Meeting, the Weather being moderate; and on the 7th of the Fifth Month,<note place="margin">Barbados.</note> we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Bridge-Town</hi> in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> where we unloaded part of our Cargo, and from thence we went to <hi>Speight</hi>'s-<hi>Town</hi>; where, after a Stay of about five Weeks, we accompliſhed our Affairs. I alſo viſited all our Friends Meetings, and ſome ſeveral Times, in which we were edified and comforted,<note place="margin">Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane.</note> and divers of us had Occaſion to bleſs the holy Name of God for his Mercy to us: Before we left the Iſland, there happen'd a great Storm or Hurricane, which did much Damage to the Ships, and to the Iſland, blowing down many Houſes, and ſpoiling much Proviſions, deſtroying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Plantain Trees on the Iſland, which is a very wholſome and pleaſant Fruit, and much uſed by many inſtead of Bread.</p>
                     <p>I was clearing out our Veſſel when this Storm hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and being twelve Miles off, could not hear of or concerning her, but thought it altogether unlikely that ſhe ſhould ride out ſo great a Storm, in ſo bad a Harbour or Road, it being open to the Sea, and ſuch a Storm as had not been known for many Years, and ſome ſaid, never but one (to their Knowledge) though much more Damage hath at ſome other Times been done to the Shipping, by reaſon that the hardeſt of of the Wind was not that Way, which was moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to them in <hi>Carliſle-Bay,</hi> where they moſtly lay; for they all got out to Sea, except two or three that were loſt by the violence of the Weather. It was indeed a very diſmal Time, the Veſſels which rode it out were much damnified, and one being loaded, ready to
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:006297_0258_102858F70A11CA10"/>
ſail, ſunk right down, and was loſt in the Bay. When I had cleared our Ship, I ſet forward in order to ſee what was become of her; but the Floods were ſo out, and the Ways were ſo bad, I could not without ſome Danger get to her that Night; but next Morning I ſet out from <hi>Joſeph Gamble</hi>'s, and, to my Admiration, from the Top of a Hill (on which a Houſe in the Storm was blown flat to the Ground) I ſaw our Ship at an Anchor, having rode out the Storm, with one Sloop by her, for which cauſe my Soul was humbly thankful.</p>
                     <p>On the 17th of ſaid Month, with ſome more than ordinary Fatigue, we got up our Anchor, and took in our Boat, and got our Paſſengers and Proviſions on board,<note place="margin">Sails from <hi>Barbados.</hi>
                        </note> the Sea breaking high on the Shore, ſo that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of our People and our Boat were in Jeopardy of being loſt; but at length being all on board, we ſet Sail, and having ſailed ſlowly about ſix or ſeven Miles, we met with a Sloop who had loſt her Maſt in the Storm, and next Morning we met with two large <hi>London</hi> Ships, who had put out to Sea, not venturing to ride it out.</p>
                     <p>We had fine pleaſant Weather for ſeveral Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we left the Iſland, and on the 22d of the Sixth Month (being the firſt Day of the Week) we had a Meeting for the Worſhip of God, which was comfortable and ſatisfactory to us. The 4th and 5th of the Seventh Month, we had very freſh Gales from the North-Eaſt to the North, and was near a Water Spout (about a Stone's throw off) which ſurpriſed ſome on board, on which I came out of my Cabbin, and ſaw the Water run up out of the Sea into the Cloud, as plain as ever I ſaw tne Water run into the River, till it filled the Cloud with Blackneſs, and then it would break in great Quantities into the Sea, which is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, when falling on Veſſels. The 5th of the Month, being the firſt Day of the Week, we had a good religious Meeting, for divine Worſhip, wherein our People were earneſtly exhorted to a holy Life, and
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:006297_0259_102858F9B1E3B698"/>
to be earneſtly concerned for the true Faith, which is in Chriſt; that Faith which works by Love, and is the Evidence of Things not viſibly ſeen, being manifeſt by Works of Piety and Virtue. In this Voyage we were twenty two Days from the Iſland of <hi>Barbados</hi> to the Sight of <hi>Cape Henry,</hi> in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and had a pleaſant Paſſage in the main to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where,<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> in the Seventh Month, was held our Yearly-meeting, at which I had a deſire to be, my watery Employment having hinder'd my being at a yearly Meeting for ſeveral Years: At this Meeting I met with my old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and dear Friends, <hi>John Richardſon,</hi> of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Paul Johnſon,</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> both on a Goſpel Viſit to the Brethren and Friends in <hi>America:</hi> The Meeting was large, and attended with Divine Grace and Goodneſs, and ended with Thankſgiving and Praiſe to God and the Lamb.</p>
                     <p>While our Ship was loading I was at ſeveral Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Country, as at <hi>Abington, Germantown, Fair-Hill,</hi> and <hi>Franckfort,</hi> in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> County: and at the <hi>Falls of Delaware, Buckingham, Neſhaminy,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in <hi>Bucks</hi> County. I was alſo at <hi>Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> at the Marriage of <hi>William Callender,</hi> junior, of <hi>Barbados,</hi> with <hi>Katherine Smith,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Mary Smith,</hi> of <hi>Burlington.</hi>

                     <p>On the 16th of the Ninth Month,<note place="margin">A ſeventh Voyage to <hi>Barbados</hi> as Maſter.</note> I proceeded on the ſeventh Voyage to <hi>Barbados,</hi> in the Ship <hi>New Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol Hope,</hi> as Maſter, having on board ſeveral Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, one of whom <hi>(Elizabeth Martindale)</hi> was on the Paſſage convinced of the Principles of Truth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſuffer'd, in divers Reſpects, for her making Profeſſion with us.</p>
                     <p>We had a long Paſſage down the River, the Wind being high and boiſterous. On the 22d of the Ninth Month we left the <hi>Capes</hi> of <hi>Delaware,</hi> and ſaw the Iſland of <hi>Barbados</hi> the 21ſt of the Tenth Month,<note place="margin">Arrives at <hi>Barbados.</hi>

I was alſo at ſeveral good and comfortable Meetings at <hi>Speight's-Town,</hi> where we had one the Day we ſail'd, being the 21ſt of the Eleventh Month; and on the Sea-ſhore parted with our Friends in great Love,<note place="margin">Sails from <hi>Barbados.</hi>
                        </note> and ſet Sail, the Wind being about North-Eaſt, ſo that we could not weather the Iſland of <hi>Martineco</hi>; we therefore ſail'd along by the Iſlands of <hi>Dominico</hi> and <hi>Guardaloupe,</hi> and had Calms under the Iſlands, and ſometimes the eddy Winds from off the Mountains, or High Lands, would take the Sails, and carry the Ship clear round, which made it ſometimes tedious. The 23d and 24th, we paſſed by the Iſlands of <hi>Mont ſerrat, Antigua, Rodondo, Chriſtopher</hi>'s, <hi>Nevis, Bartholomew, Statia, Saba, Barbuda, Martin</hi>'s, and <hi>Anguilla,</hi> the Winds and Weather being fair and pleaſant. The 25th, in the Evening, it began to be hazy; and, in the Night, we ſplit our Main-top-ſail, which coſt us a great deal of Labour, and Loſs of Time, before we could get it mended and ſet again. We had pretty fair Weather about 20 Days, until we came on our Coaſt, and into Soundings; when a hard Gale of Wind ſpringing up eaſterly, which ſetting on the Shore, was dangerous, and we had a long Night coming on; but, through the Favour of the Almighty, we got off from the Land. In the Midſt of the Danger of this Storm, my Soul ſang Praiſes to the Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="249" facs="unknown:006297_0261_102858FF6E923208"/>The 12th of the Twelfth Month, we met with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eaſterly Storm, being in about thirty Fathom Water, it blew, and rain'd very hard, and was alſo exceeding cold, and our coming from a hot Climate made it more hard to bear. In this Storm we ſaw di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Lights, which the Sailors call <hi>Corpuſants,</hi> one of them was exceeding bright, and ſat, as near as I can compute it, about Half an Hour on our Main-top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt Head, plain to the View of all the Ship's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, divers of whom ſaid they never ſaw the like, and I think I never heard of, or ſaw the like before.</p>
                     <p>The Storm continued all Night till Day, when it abated, and, it being the Firſt of the Week, we had a comfortable Meeting, in which the People on board were adviſed to get divine and heavenly Learning, and not to be Fools in Religion, or in the Things of God, nor to hate his true Knowledge; for if they had all the natural Knowledge, and brighteſt natural Parts in the World, they would be but Fools without <hi>the true Fear of God,</hi> which the wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Is the Beginning of Wiſdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 27th of the Month we ſaw <hi>Cape Henlopen,</hi> having been 27Days from the Iſland of <hi>Barbados:</hi> This was a cloſe, foggy Day, we could ſee but very little before us, and had like to have been a-ground on the Shoals, which they call the <hi>Hen and Chickens,</hi> but went between them and the <hi>Cape,</hi> in three Fathom Water; the Wind blowing hard at South, we went up the Bay by the Lead; for we could not ſee Land; and the Gale being ſo freſh, we got to <hi>Bombay-Hook,</hi> from our <hi>Capes,</hi> in about ſix Hours, which is accounted twenty Leagues; where we came to an Anchor, and there met with abundance of Ice. Merciful was the Deliverance and Preſervation we met with, from the Hand of the Almighty, this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; may we ever gratefully remember it! About a League above <hi>Bombay-Hook,</hi> when the Fog broke up, we found ourſelves cloſe on the <hi>Jerſey</hi> Shore; and the Wind ſprung up at North-weſt, and obliged us to come to an Anchor; where the Ice came down upon
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:006297_0262_1028590232CC97C8"/>
us, which ſurprized ſome of us much. The ſudden coming out of ſo hot a Climate, into one ſo ſeverely cold, had a bad Effect on moſt of our Ship's Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and, for my own Part, I had a ſore Fit of the <hi>Phthyſick,</hi> and was, at times, almoſt breathleſs, and thought I muſt die, for I could hardly breath, or ſpeak; but yet I reſolved, as long as I was capable of Thoughts, I would think of God, and my beloved Jeſus; in which Thoughts and Meditations I found ſome Comfort and Conſolation. I ſat up for divers Nights, not being able to lie down for want of Breath; and I could not drink any ſtrong Drink, as Rum, Wine, Ale, or Punch, ſuch as the Sailors drank; but, inſtead thereof, I drank Sage Tea, which was very helpful to me.</p>
                     <p>The next Day, the Ice came down more and more upon us, and we feared to put back, becauſe, if we had gone a-ground in the Bay, the Ice might have demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed us; ſo we took the moſt convenient Time we could, and got up our Anchor, with ſome Difficulty, and ſtood for <hi>Reedy-Iſland,</hi> one of the beſt Harbours upon <hi>Delaware</hi>; but, the Wind and Tide ſailing us, we could not get in; and the Ebb brought down the Ice mightily on us, ſo that it took away the Head of our Veſſel, and cut her Sides very much. The next Tide we got into the Harbour, and lay cloſe to <hi>Reedy-Iſland,</hi> making the Ship faſt on Shore. While we lay here, ſeveral Veſſels came to us, and faſten'd on Shore as we did. The Ice drove one Veſſel on us, and broke our Spritſail Yard. Here I went on Shore, where the People were very kind to us, particularly the Sheriff of the County, <hi>John Gooding,</hi> and his Wife and Family. I went alſo to the Houſe of <hi>John M' Coel,</hi> who, with his Wife, were very tender in their Care and Love towards me; bathing my ſwell'd and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numm'd Limbs until the Froſt was pretty well out of them. The Good-will, and tender Love and Care, I here met with, affects my Mind in the noting of it: I pray the

Moſt High, whom I love and ſerve, to be their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder.</p>
                     <p>I had two Meetings at our Meeting-houſe at <hi>George's-Creek,</hi> where was People of divers Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who gave good Attention. For theſe Meetings I was truly thankful; for though, through the extream Cold, I could hardly ſpeak when on board, I now ſpoke freely, much to my Admiration, and I believe to the People's Satisfaction, more than is proper for me to mention, wherefore I praiſe God. When the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a little more open, and the Ice gone, we ſailed up the River to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> where I was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received by my Friends; and while the Veſſel was repairing and fitting for another Voyage, I was not idle, but viſited Friends Meetings at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>

I was alſo at <hi>Haddonfield</hi> and <hi>Eveſham</hi> Meetings, in <hi>Weſt-Jerſey</hi>; both good and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Meetings, and will not eaſily be forgotten; for therein God was graciouſly pleaſed to viſit us with his Word, bleſſed be his Name.</p>
                     <p>The 4th of the Third Month we again ſet ſail for <hi>Speight's-Town,</hi> in <hi>Barbados</hi>;<note place="margin">An eighth Voyaye as Maſter, &amp;c.</note> and the 6th of the Month, about ſix in the Morning, left the <hi>Capes of Delaware.</hi> From the Time we left the Sight of the <hi>Capes of Delaware,</hi> to the Sight of <hi>Barbados,</hi> was Twenty-five Days (which was the quickeſt Voyage that ever I had in this Ship) in which Time we had three Meetings for the publick Worſhip of Almighty God, and to me they were beneficial; and for God's Goodneſs, I could do no leſs than return Praiſe to Him, who alone is worthy forever.</p>
                     <p>After I had done my Buſineſs at <hi>Barbados,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Barbados.</note> and viſited Friends Meetings on the 5th of the Fifth Month, I ſailed for <hi>South Carolina,</hi> touched at the Iſland of <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> and landed ſome Paſſengers there.<note place="margin">St. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophers.</note> From thence we went to Sea, and the ſame Night we had a

                     <p>We were prevented by contrary Winds, and a ſtrong Current, from getting into <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> and while we were beating about the Coaſt, we met with a Veſſel, which came from thence, who gave us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that many People died ſuddenly, and that they buried ten or twelve in a Day. Hearing ſuch News, and the Wind being ſtill againſt us, our Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who intended for <hi>Carolina,</hi> concluded to go for <hi>Philadelphia</hi>; ſo we tacked about, and ſtood for <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware-Bay,</hi> and then we had a freſh Gale a-head again for ſeveral Days, and ſpending ſo much Time on the Coaſt, our Water was far expended, and we agreed to come to an Allowance of Water, a Quart a Man for Twenty-four Hours, for ſeveral Days before we got in. We were about five Weeks in our Paſſage from <hi>Barbados</hi> to <hi>Delaware</hi> River.</p>

from Sea up the River, ſo that a great Damp was put on Trade, and the Froſt coming ſo ſuddenly, many People were taken with Colds, and many died in both the Provinces of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> My dear Friend and kind Landlord <hi>Paul Preſton,</hi> died about this Time, who, on his dying Bed, ſaid, 'He had no Deſire to live, but to do Good, and that it had been his Care to keep a Conſcience void of Offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and to all Men, which now was his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.'

In this Journey I was favoured with the Grace and Goodneſs of the Divine Hand to a greater Degree than I was worthy of, though I was ſometimes exceeding poor in my Spirit, and, in my own Judgment, very weak for Service and Labour, both in Body and Mind; our Meetings, conſidering the ſevere Seaſon, were large, and, I hope, they were to general Edification.</p>
                     <p>On the 25th of the Tenth Month, being the reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Birth Day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at a little Town, near the <hi>Falls,</hi> called <hi>Bordentown,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Borden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>town.</note> we had a Meeting (where never any had been before of our Friends) in one of the Houſes newly built by <hi>Joſeph Borden,</hi> the Proprietor of the Place: He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained us lovingly at his Houſe, when he was ſo generous as to offer Ground for a Grave-Yard, and to build a Meeting-Houſe on, and a handſome Sum of Money towards building it, though he did not make Profeſſion to be of our Society. Some that were at this Meeting, who did not profeſs with us, came over the Creek on the Ice to <hi>Iſaac Horner</hi>'s, in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where we had a ſatisfactory Meeting, in which God, through Chriſt was glorified. <hi>Daniel Stanton</hi> (my Wife's Siſter's Son) accompanied me in this

Journey, whoſe Company and Miniſtry was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, both to me and Friends, and we had Meetings at the <hi>Falls, Briſtol, Middletown, Wright's-Town, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentown. Croſwicks, Mansfield, Upper</hi> and <hi>Lower Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Mount Holly, Rancocas, Eveſham,</hi> and <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and divers Evening Meetings at ſeveral Friends Houſes. It now being a ſickly Time I was often ſent for to viſit the Sick, in which Viſits we were comforted, and God's holy Name was praiſed.</p>
                     <p>On the 18th of the Eleventh Month, I was ſent for to <hi>Briſtol</hi> to viſit <hi>Ennion Williams,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Briſtol.</note> who was dangerouſly ill, and to <hi>Burlington,</hi> to the Burial of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Jonathan Wright,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> who was buried from the great Meeting-Houſe at <hi>Burlington.</hi> The Meeting was very large, ſhe being well beloved by her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Acquaintance, being a Woman much given to Hoſpitality (and indeed many of the Friends of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> have exceeded in that Reſpect the moſt that ever I have obſerved in my Travels) She was a Pattern of Piety, a loving, obliging Wife, and tender and careful Mother, a kind Neighbour, a loving and faithful Friend, and ſo continued to the End; for ſome of her dying Words were, That ſhe deſired
<q>her Love might be remembred to all her Friends,</q>
which was done open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſaid Meeting, and tenderly affected many.</p>
                     <p>After I came home, I was at the Marriage of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parker,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Gilbert,</hi> at which Marriage was our worthy, antient Friend, <hi>John Richardſon,</hi> with divers other European Friends. The Meeting was large and edifying.</p>
                     <p>The River ſtill continuing frozen up, I had a Deſire to viſit my Friends and Brethren in <hi>Cheſter</hi> County, whom I had not ſeen for ſome Years; and in order thereto, in the Beginning of the Twelfth Month, I, with my Kinſman, <hi>Daniel Stanton,</hi> ſet out from <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> and went to <hi>Newtown,</hi> where we had a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next Day (being the firſt of the Week) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an Evening Meeting at <hi>Evan Lewis</hi>'s; from

thence we went to the Monthly-meeting at <hi>Providence,</hi> on Third-day to <hi>Middletown,</hi> Fourth-day to <hi>Concord,</hi> Fifth-day to <hi>Birmingham,</hi> Sixth-day to <hi>London-Grove</hi>; after which we had an Evening-meeting at a Widow's Houſe: From thence we traveil'd on Seventh-day to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and were at a large Meeting there on Firſt-day, and had an Evening-meeting at a Friend's Houſe, where ſome Perſons came, who had never been at a Meeting of Friends before; on Second-day we had a Meeting at <hi>Suſquebannah</hi> Ferry, to which divers Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came over the Ice, and it was a good Opportunity to many of them. Third-day we had a large Meeting at <hi>Weſt-Nottingham,</hi> and in the Evening at <hi>William Brown</hi>'s, and next we had a large Meeting at <hi>New-Garden,</hi> and at <hi>Michael Lightfoot</hi>'s Houſe we met with two Friends from <hi>Ireland, Mungo Bewley,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Stephens,</hi> who were now proceeding on the Courſe of their religious Viſit to Friends in <hi>Maryland, Virginia,</hi> and <hi>North-Carolina.</hi>—From thence I went to viſit my old Friend and Acquaintance <hi>Ellis Lexis,</hi> who had a Deſire to ſee me: We had an Evening-meeting in his Chamber, to our mutual Comfort and Refreſhment; and next Day had a very large Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Meeting-houſe at <hi>Kennet</hi>; after which we went to <hi>Concord</hi> to the Quarterly-meeting for the County of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and were at three Meetings there, and likewiſe had three Evening-meetings at Friends Houſes; at which Meetings we had the Company of my Kinſwoman <hi>Alice Alderſon,</hi> and her Companion, <hi>Margaret Coupland,</hi> who were lately come from the <hi>North of England,</hi> to viſit Friends in this and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Provinces.</p>
                     <p>We went on Third-day to the General-meeting at <hi>Providence,</hi> which was very large; <hi>Joſhua Fielding</hi> and <hi>Ebenezer Large</hi> were there; and we had an Evening Meeting at <hi>Rebecca Minſhall</hi>'s; and next went to <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> where we had a larger Meeting than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, conſidering the Seaſon; we lodged at <hi>John

                     <p>In the Firſt Month was our General Spring-meeting, at which were ſeveral Publick Friends from <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>John Richardſon, Alice Alderſon,</hi> and <hi>Margaret Coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Meeting was large and edifying, the ſaid Friends having Service therein to general Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

The Winds were, for the moſt Part, contrary, and, before we got into the Trade Wind, we met with two hard Gales; the laſt of which was a Kind of a Hurricane, in which we could carry no Sail at all, but let the Veſſel lie to the Mercy of the Seas, or rather to the Mercy of him that made the Seas, and all that is therein, and in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to ſtand on Record,<note place="margin">1731.</note> becauſe it is ſo rare in ſeafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Men. About the Beginning of the Eighth Month (being in the Latitude of <hi>Barbados</hi>) the Thoughts of my leaving my Family and Habitation, and many of my loving Relations, and near and dear Friends (as at divers other times alſo) made me pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and ſorrowful; but it being on a Principle of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and ſometimes meeting with the Preſence and Goodneſs of God, I was enabled to do my Affairs and Buſineſs, and forbore to appear ſorrowful as much as poſſibly I could, or to be of a ſad Countenance in the Sight of Men; but to him, who knew all Things, and ſees in ſecret, I poured out my Soul in all my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, for he only is able to help me. I met with ſome who untruly cenſured me, as covetous of the Things of this World, or to be rich; and that for the ſake of theſe outward Things, I might venture my Life, until I might loſe it: Really, as to my Life, it hath long been my Deſire to be ready to reſign it, and is ſo ſtill: And, as to thoſe outward Things, ſo far as I know, my Heart is clear; Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be clear and even with the World, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rather to give than receive, is all the Grandeur I deſire; and if that be not granted, I hope to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented without it, and to be thankful. I look upon Crowns and Sceptres, and all the fine Things of this World, that are of the Nature of it, but as Trifles, and diminutive Things, in Compariſon of a Houſe and Kingdom eternal in the Heavens. In this Voyage, as uſual,<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> I read in the Holy Scriptures, and met with ſtrong Conſolation therein, eſpecially in the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; I alſo read much in the Works of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Judge and good Chriſtian, <hi>Matthew Hale.</hi>

                     <p>The 21ſt of the Ninth Month, we had a very hard Gale of Wind at North-weſt, which blew ſo hard, that it put us by from ſailing, ſo that we were obliged to lay her to the Wind; for, by the Violence thereof, we could not carry any Sail; and it was ſo dark, that we could neither ſee Stars, nor one another; nor hear one another, without we were very near, the Seas riſing very high: Indeed the long, ſtormy and dark Nights were very diſmal; and ſome of our Goods got looſe in the Hold. In the Beginning of the Night, about the ſeventh Hour, <hi>Philip Kearney,</hi> my Apprentice, fell into the Sea, and was loſt; which was a deep Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us in divers Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>The 25th we ſaw the Land, and next Day we came to an Anchor in <hi>Delaware</hi> Bay.<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> The Loſs of this Lad, was a Cauſe that we were not ſo joyful, as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for People to be when come to the Shore.</p>

the Nights being long, the Days very ſhort, and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſharp; we left our <hi>Capes</hi> in the Night, it being dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous lying in the Bay; and after being out ſeveral Days,<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> we had favourable Winds, and pleaſant Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but when we got into the Trade-wind, it blew hard, and moſtly againſt us; ſo that the firſt Land we ſaw was the Iſland of <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Arrives at <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>'s</note> where we arrived in 20 Days from our <hi>Capes</hi>; and the Market for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions being at that Time better than at any other of thoſe Iſlands, and the Property of the Veſſel moſtly belonging to me, and the Cargo generally conſign'd to me, I diſpoſed of Part of it. Here being no Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Society on this Iſland, I had Meetings on board the Veſſel in the Harbour, and divers from the Shore, and ſeveral Maſters of Veſſels came to our Meetings, the Snow having large Accommodations for ſuch an Occaſion; and, ſo far as I could underſtand, the People were generally ſatisfied, and ſpoke well of our Meetings.</p>
                     <p>Of late times, and alſo in this Voyage, meeting with many Loſſes and Croſſes, and much Afflictions, and various Exerciſes, I was ready to ſay in my Heart, <hi>Lord, why am I thus afflicted, now in my decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Years, ſince, thou knows, I love thee above all Things, and that I would not willingly or knowingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee, my great and dear Lord?</hi> It was anſwered (as though vocally ſpoken) <hi>My only begotten and beloved Son, who never offended me, ſuffered much more.</hi> This Word being ſuch an evident Truth, I begg'd Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to go through all my Sufferings and Afflictions, ſo that at laſt I might live with Chriſt in the glorious Kingdom of God forever, where I might always bleſs and praiſe his holy Name.</p>
                     <p>Five or ſix Days after our Arrival at this Iſland, a Veſſel, that came out five or ſix Days before us, arrived, ſhe meeting with the ſame boiſterous Weather as we did, yet we made our Paſſage ten or eleven Days ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Divers other Veſſels, bound to <hi>Barbados,</hi> put in

here, through theſe contrary Winds; and when I ſaw others in the like Circumſtances with us, I was the more thankful for being preſerved ſafe, and ſo ſoon to this Place; yet it was a conſiderable Loſs and ſore Trial not to get to <hi>Barbados,</hi> the Iſland I was bound to, and a great Diſappointment to me, and many more.</p>
                     <p>At this Iſland a Perſon, whoſe Name was— <hi>Galloway,</hi> a Man of a great Eſtate, hearing that I kept Meetings on board the Veſſel, kindly invited me to have a Meeting at his Houſe, and ſaid he would give Notice of it to divers of the Gentlemen (as he called them) of the Iſland, telling me, that I ſhould be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to his Houſe, which was much more convenient than the Veſſel; but I was not very forward to accept of my Friend <hi>Gall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He anſwered, "Yes, there is Good and Bad of all Societies." 2dly, I aſk'd, "If his Wife would like it, or be willing that a Meeting ſhould be in the Houſe?" He ſaid, "She deſired it, and would be very willing." 3dly, I aſk'd, "If he thought he could ſit in Silence? He told me, "He believ'd he could." I then told him, "I was obliged to him for his kind and friendly Offer, and, God willing, I intended to come, and tell my People of the Ship's Company to come alſo, and deſired him to give Notice of it:" The which he did; and there was a large, ſatiſfactory Meeting: Oh may the Almighty ſanctify it to ſome Souls, is my Deſire!</p>
                     <p>He and his Wife were both very courteous to me, and invited many of his rich Friends and Relations: His Wife's Father was a Judge in this Iſland of good Repute. Divers People, of ſeveral Profeſſions, were at this Meeting, and many expreſſed their being glad
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:006297_0274_102859295F0183E8"/>
of it. An Attorney at Law ſaid, "He was thankful for the Words he heard that Day, and, if I would ſtay with them, he would always come to our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings." One Judge <hi>Mills</hi> was at this Meeting, and very kindly invited me to his Houſe. Some meeting me next Day, ſaid, They were ſorry they were not there. The Miſtreſs of the Houſe told divers of the People, who were Perſons of Note, "That they ſhould remember what they had heard;" and ſpoke it with a religious Concern, as it ſeem'd to me. When I went to this Meeting, I was very poor, and in much Fear, ſpeaking with a great Concern on my Mind for the People's Salvation, and that God, thro' Chriſt, might be glorified.</p>
                     <p>After this Meeting, it was (as tho' a Voice) ſaid unto me, <hi>How doſt thou know but for this Cauſe, and for this Meeting, thou art brought here to this Iſland, tho' againſt thy Will?</hi> The People told me that they did not remember that there ever was a Meeting of our Friends before on the Iſland. The Meeting had this Effect, that the People had a better Opinion of our Society than they had before. The Subject in this Meeting was, The Excellency of the Goſpel Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation above that of the Law, in that it brought us to the Law, went through the Law, and was above the Law, and far from deſtroying the Law, but fulfilled it; for Proof of which, they were referred to Chriſt's moſt excellent Sermon which he preached on the <hi>Mount,</hi> Mat. v.</p>
                     <p>From the Iſland of <hi>Christopher</hi>'s I purpoſed, God willing, for <hi>Barbados</hi>; the which I apprehended would be a troubleſome Voyage, it being about 100 Leagues to Windward, and a ſtrong Current againſt us. On the 19th of the Twelfth Month, we ſailed towards <hi>Barbados</hi>; and the Wind being a-head, and blowing hard,<note place="margin">Lucea.</note> we tarried two Nights at the Iſland of <hi>Lucea,</hi> where we took in Wood and Water: The People here were moſtly <hi>French,</hi> and were very civil to us.</p>

                     <p>While we lay here, I had a Meeting on board our Veſſel, to which came five Maſters of Veſſels. It was a good Meeting, tho' I ſpoke to them in much Miſery and Pain, having very angry painful Sores on my Legs, occaſioned by a Fall in getting out of the Boat, the Seas running high, and through the Violence of the Waves, I fell acroſs the Boat, and broke both my Shins very grievouſly.</p>

                     <p>After this Meeting was over, the Maſter of the large Ship came on board, and ſaid, "He was ſorry he had not come ſooner, ſo as to have had the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to have been at the Meeting."</p>

We ſtaid at <hi>Anguilla</hi> three Days, and there took on board ſome Bags of Cotton on Freight, and ſailed from thence the 10th of the Second Month. The Governor of this Iſland, whoſe Name is <hi>George Leonard,</hi> told me, "That he ſhould live and die in our Principles, ſaving that he muſt defend his People." But he did not conſider, that his Defence might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both him and them, and that ſuch Defence was directly contrary to Chriſt's Doctrine and Practice. A remarkable and diſmal Paſſage he related to me, that, ſome Days before, a Veſſel came from the Iſland of <hi>Saltitudas</hi> (which went there to take in Salt) the People going on Shore, the Maſter told him, that there lay at the Landing the Heads of above twenty Men on one Side the Path, and the Quarters of them on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which ſo ſurprized them, that they made the beſt of their Way to <hi>Anguilla,</hi> where they related this diſmal Story, and ſuppoſed the Slain to be <hi>Britons</hi> by their Appearances, and that they were deſtroyed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are known to be cruel to them: This Action being far from the Spirit of Chriſtianity, is a Reproach to the Actors thereof.</p>

                        </note> who was taken ſick the fifth of the Eighth Month, 1733, and departed this Life at my Houſe in <hi>Franckfort,</hi> the 13th of ſaid Month, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ninth Hour, in the Evening of the ſixth Day of the Week, and was carried to the Bank Meeting-houſe of Friends in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and buried from thence on the firſt Day following, being accompanied by many Friends, and others; he was ten years and ſeven Days old, when he died, and, as he was much beloved for the Sweetneſs of his Nature and Diſpoſition, ſo he was greatly lamented by many who were acquainted with him. I have this Account to leave concerning him, not ſo much that he was my Son, as to excite other Youths to ſerve and fear the Lord, and to love him above all, and that they might remember their Creator in their youthtul Days, that it might be well with them in this World, and when Time here to them ſhall be no more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>He was a Lad much inclined to read the Holy Scriptures, and other good Books, eſpecially reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Ones; and was always obliging, obedient and and loving, to his Parents, and ready and willing to
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:006297_0278_10285934B70DD388"/>
do any Service he could to his Friends; any little Services in his Power he chearfully performed, and took delight in; he was very diligent, and ready to go to religious Meetings, and an entire Lover of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious People. In his Sickneſs he behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more like a wiſe Man, than a Youth of that Age, bearing his Pain and Sickneſs with a great deal of Patience. I being in another Part of the World, he would gladly have ſeen me, but ſaid, he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee me any more, and therefore deſired his Mother to remember his dear Love to his Father, and tell him, that he was gone to his Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He was very fervent in Prayer in the Time of his Sickneſs, and prayed that God would preſerve his People all the World over. One time, when in great Miſery and Pain, he prayed to Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sweet Jeſus! Bleſſed Jeſus! give me Patience to bear my Miſery and Pain, for my Miſery is greater than I can well bear! O come, ſweet Jeſus, why art thou ſo long a coming? I had rather be with thee than in the fineſt Place in all the World. Many religious Expreſſions he ſpoke on his dying Bed, greatly to the Satisfaction and Melting of his Friends and Relations who came to ſee him in his Illneſs; one Day he ſaid, My miſery and Pain is very great, but what would it be if the Wrath of God was in my Soul? He believing in the Love of God in Chriſt, made him deſirous of being with him, and ſeeing the Joy that was ſet before him, thought the Time long to be with Jeſus, as knowing that then he would be out of all Miſery and Pain. His Heart was full of Love to his Relations, Acquaintance and Friends, who came to ſee him in his Illneſs; and full of tender Sweetneſs and Divine Love, he took his laſt Leave of them, which greatly affected many. This was one of the moſt pinching Excerciſes I ever met with in all my Days; but as he ſaid in his Illneſs, ſo I now write. The Wiſdom of the Lord is
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:006297_0279_102859379D1BCC28"/>
wonderful. One time in this dear Child's Sickneſs he ſaid, Oh! the good Hand of Thee the Lord help me, give me Eaſe, and conduct me ſafe <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to God's Kingdom, uttering this Verſe:</q>
                        <q>
                           <l>Sweet Jeſus, give me Eaſe, for Mercy I do crave;</l>
                           <l>And if thou'll give me Eaſe, then Mercy I ſhall have.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Altho' this was a great and ſore Exerciſe, and deep Affliction to me, in loſing this promiſing Youth, and my only Son; yet, conſidering that he went off the Stage of Life like a ſolid, good Chriſtian, it was made tolerable eaſy to me; for he departed this Life in much Brightneſs and Sweetneſs, and more like an old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, than a Youth of ten Years of Age.</p>
                     <p>It was uſual for me to adviſe his Mother not to ſet her Affections too much upon him, thinking he was too good to live long in this World, and too ripe for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to ſtay long here on Earth, or in this World of Sorrow and Miſery. This dear and tender Youth, when reading (to which he was much inclined) if he met with any Thing that affected him, either in the ſacred Writings, or other good Authors, he would write it down, and get it by Heart; he was, more than common, affectionately concerned for his Mother, doing whatever he could freely and cheerfully to ſerve her, and told her not to do divers Things which he thought too much for her, ſaying,
<q>Mother, let me do it, if I were a Man, thou ſhould not do any Thing at all (meaning as to Labour,</q>) My dear Wife, being very induſtrious, and apt to overdo her ſelf at times: And ſhe being affected with his filial Love and Care for and towards her in his Father's Abſence, it cauſed her ſometimes to turn about and weep, in Conſideration of his great Care for and Love to her. I thought a little Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum of the Life and Death of this religious Lad was worthy recording, in order to ſtir up other Youths to Obedience and Love to their Parents, who begat them, and carefully and tenderly nouriſhed and brought them up; and alſo to love and obey God, from whom
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:006297_0280_102859396CD591D0"/>
they have their Life, Breath and Being, and to believe in Chriſt, who died for them; who is the glorious Light of all the Nations of them that are ſaved, and walk therein, according to ſacred Writ.</p>
                     <p>As noted above, he got ſeveral Pieces by Heart out of the Bible, and other Religious Writings, firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with his Pen. Two ſhort Ones I may Recite, of which nature were divers others, which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be edifying to ſome, who may caſt their Eye thereon.</p>
                     <p>One Place which much affected my Mind that he wrote down, and got by Heart, was the 15th Verſe of the 57th Chapter of that evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah: For thus ſaith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe Name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy Place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the Humble, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Heart of the contrite Ones.</hi>

He was indeed an extraordinary courteous Man: He died ſoon after, much lamented, as he was much beloved.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Barbados.</note>My Stay at <hi>Barbados</hi> this time was the longeſt I ever ſtay'd, believing it to be the laſt time I ſhould go there, and that I ſhould ſee them no more. My ſo ſaying troubled ſome of them; but growing in Years (being then turned of Threeſcore) I thought it would be too hard for me to undertake ſuch another Voyage; therefore I was at all the Meetings of our Friends on the Iſland.</p>
                     <p>Here I met with <hi>Moſes Aldridge,</hi> a Friend from <hi>New-England,</hi> who came on a religious Viſit to Friends of this Iſland, with whom we had divers good Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, his Service in Preaching the Goſpel being edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acceptable; we were together at the Marriage of <hi>Andrew Dury</hi> and <hi>Mary Lewis,</hi> after which Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Marriage, I was ill of a Fever ſeveral Days, which Diſtemper was very much among the People, of which near twenty Maſters of Veſſels, and ſome Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of People died; and though I had been at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bados</hi> many times, I never had ſo much Illneſs there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <hi>Moſes Aldridge,</hi> and ſeveral Friends of us, had a large Meeting at <hi>John Gibſon's,</hi> where were many People, not of our Perſwaſion, who generally were ſober; but as I was recommending Charity to the People, according to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gift, I adviſed them to ſhow it forth to all People of all Profeſſions, and alſo to their Negroes, telling

them,<note place="margin">1735.</note> that ſome of the Gentry of this Iſland had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to me, that the more kind they were to their Slaves, they had their Buſineſs the better done for it; though I obſerved alſo, that I had been at ſome Places, where I had watched to hear ſome Expreſſions that might look like Charity; but in divers Houſes, and ſome of Note,<note place="margin">Barbados.</note> I could not hear any Chriſtian-like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to their Slaves or Negroes, and that with Sorrow I had ſeen a great deal of Tyranny and Cruelty, the which I diſſwaded them from: This Doctrine ſo exaſperated ſome that were there, that they made a Diſturbance in the Meeting; one of which Perſons meeting me on the King's High-way, ſhot off his Fowling Piece at me, being loaded with Small-ſhot, ten of which made Marks on me, and ſeveral drew Blood; by which unfriendly Action, the Man got a great deal of Diſgrace, it being highly reſented by all who were acquainted with me; the Preſident of the Iſland look'd on it as a very baſe Action, as did alſo divers of the Juſtices and the Gentry, alſo the Veſtry, and ſeveral Clergymen and Lawyers; one of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers told me, "I ſhould not be juſt to the Country, myſelf, nor the Man, if I did not proſecute him;" another, profeſſing the Law, ſaid, "He ought to be abandon'd by all Mankind, if he ſhot at me with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;" many were for proſecuting him, for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally took Notice of it with Abhorrence; but he ſending for me, and ſignifying, he would not do ſo again, I forgave him; and I pray it may not he laid to his Charge in the great Day, and that he may be forgiven, he being ignorant of the Love I had and have for him and all Men, even them whom I know to be mine Enemies. It would be too great a Scandal and Reproach, to expoſe his Name and Station in the World. Some thought I did well in forgiving him, and ſome thought I did ill in it; but I ſpoke my Mind to him alone freely, in which I had Satisfaction and Peace.</p>

                     <p>It was this Voyage that my Friends in <hi>Barbados</hi> publiſhed a little Piece I wrote at Sea, which I called, <hi>Free Thoughts communicated to Free-Thinkers</hi>; done in order to promote Thinking on the Name and Works of God; which had, as far as I underſtand, a good Acceptance among the People; the principal Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man on the Iſland, thanked me for it, and ſaid, "There was need enough of it:" But I could be glad another, or a better Hand, had done ſome Thing of that Nature, and more large.

                     <p>The 23d, being the Firſt-day of the Week, we had a Meeting, in which the Grace of God, that comes by Jeſus Chriſt, was magnified, and a Bleſſing begg'd for all who love and ſerve God, throughout the World, by Sea and Land; alſo a render Petition was put up to Almighty God, that, as he was gracouſly pleaſed to look down or thoſe eight Perſons in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, ſo he would pleaſe to look upon us in our Veſſel; and, that, as, by his divine Providence, they ſafely landed on the Earth, ſo we, if it were his Will, might ſafely land at our deſired Port; yet not that our Wills, but his Will might be done: Which Supplication was put up with great Submiſſion.

                     <p>The 8th of the Fourth Month, being the Firſt-day of the Week, we had a Meeting, in which Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God was exhorted to, ſhewing the Benefit of it, and of loving him above all Things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in his Law, and meditating therein Day and

The 19th, in the Morning, a ſtrong norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wind came up, and blew ſo hard, that we could not carry Sail, but lay to the Wind, under our Mizzen, which was ſplit or torn with the Violence of the Wind, and the Sea roſe high, ſo that it came into the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of our great Cabbin: It was very rugged for the Time, and, though it was Mid-ſummer, it was ſo cold, that we were obliged to cloath ourſelves, as in Winter. The 22d, being Firſt-day, we had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Meeting after the Storm, wherein the great Benefit of true Religion was a little open'd to our ſmall Company, and the Lord, Moſt High, was praiſed for our Deliverance and Preſervation. The 26th, we ſounded, and found about 70 Fathom Depth of Water. The 29th, we were a-breaſt of the <hi>Iſle of Wight.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Engliſh Channel.</note> From the Time we left the Iſland of <hi>Barbados,</hi> to the Time we found Ground, was ſeven Weeks. Thus, through many Perils and Dangers, we came to <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; for all which Mercies and Providences, let my Soul bleſs and praiſe the holy Name and mighty Power of the Moſt High. It was now a Time of very great Preſſing for Seamen, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Men of Wars Boats came on board to preſs our Sailors; but they had prepared a Place in the Veſſel to hide themſelves, and the Men of Wars People could not find them: One Lieutenant, with his Men, came on board, and ſeeing us weakly handed (the beſt of our Hands being hid) he aſked me if I had any more Hands on board? I made him very little Anſwer; he then ſaid, He was ſure I could not bring the Ship from <hi>Barbados</hi> without Hands: I told him, Sailors were hard to be got in <hi>Barbados,</hi> either for Love or Money, to go for <hi>London,</hi> for fear of being preſs'd, and I was oblig'd to take any I could get: He ſaid, It was in vain to talk much, but if I would ſay, I had no more Hands on board, he would be ſatisfied; he having a Belief that I would ſpeak the Truth, though he never ſaw me before; and he ſaid, If I would ſay,
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:006297_0289_102859596B7605B8"/>
there were no more Men on board, he would go away: for then he had no more Buſineſs there: But I made him no Anſwer, not daring to tell a Lie: Now I know that there is Men on board, ſaid he; ſo he commanded his Men to ſearch the Ship to her Keel; ſo they ſtripp'd, and made a narrow Search, and ſweated and fretted, but could not find them. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing civil, I made him, when he went away, a ſmall Preſent; he wiſhed me well; and ſo I carry'd my People ſafe up to <hi>London.</hi>

                     <p>In the Beginning of the Fifth Month,<note place="margin">London.</note> I came to <hi>London,</hi> and lodged at the Houſe of <hi>Simeon Warner,</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and at divers kind Friends and Relations in and about <hi>London</hi>; the tender and brotherly Reſpect which I received from divers, in ſome of thoſe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, in my Sickneſs, will not, I believe, ever be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, while I am in this World, at times, by me; and, I hope, that He, whom I ſerve with my Might and Strength, will be their Reward. When in the Country about <hi>London,</hi> my Reſidence was moſtly at <hi>Edmonton,</hi> at my dear Brother <hi>George Chalkley</hi>'s, who, with my Siſter and Couſins, were a Comfort to me, both in Health and Sickneſs; for I was often in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſorely afflicted with the <hi>Phthyſick</hi> and <hi>Aſthma,</hi> which ſometimes made me very uneaſy; and, though my Affairs required me to be often at the City, yet I was obliged to return into the Country for Air, and, both in Health and Sickneſs, was kindly and very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately received and tended by my dear Brother, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and all my loving Couſins; the Memory thereof is Cordial to me in penning theſe Lines: It may be truly ſaid, We were very joyful in meeting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and our Sorrow in parting not eaſy to be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>London</hi> I ſold my Veſſel, the <hi>Barbados Packet,</hi> and ſettled all my Affairs to general Satisfaction, ſo far as I knew, on which Account I had laboured for ſeveral Years, and was joyful that Providence had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:006297_0290_1028595AF2F253F0"/>
me ſo far as to ſee it accompliſhed; ſo that I now wholly intended to leave trading by Sea, the which I never inclined to, only on a Principle of Juſtice; for I was fully reſolved in my Mind that my Creditors ſhould be paid their juſt Debts, though I might loſe my Life in the Purſuit of it, about which I had no anxious Guilt, becauſe I never was extravagant nor indolent, but met with divers Caſualties by Fire and Water; by the latter I loſt many Hundreds of Pounds for ſeveral Years together; and I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade all in their Undertaking for a Livelihood in this World, to be ſure to have an Eye to Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who will not ſuffer us (if we do well) nor ſo much as a Sparrow to fall to the Ground, without he think it beſt for us, he knowing what is for our Good better than we know ourſelves. Thus when I had paid my Debts, and in a good Degree ſettled my Affairs, I viſited ſeveral of my Relations, as at <hi>Kingſworth, Stains, Guilford,</hi> &amp;c. had a Meeting at <hi>Market-Street,</hi> and one at <hi>Guilford,</hi> another at <hi>Stains,</hi> and one at <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>; in all which I had ſome Service, and my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were joyful to ſee me once more, having never expected to ſee me again; and when I had viſited Meetings in and about <hi>London,</hi> I went towards the North, in order to viſit ſome Places where I had never been, and ſome that I had been at. The Number of Meetings, and the Names of the Places where I had Meetings (while I was this time in <hi>England</hi>) are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: While I was in and about <hi>London,</hi> I was at eighteen Meetings in that great City, at two of which I was with <hi>May Drummond,</hi> a virtuous young Woman, who hath a good Gift in the Miniſtry, and had a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Opportunity of declaring her Convincement to our noble Queen <hi>Caroline</hi> (our great King <hi>George</hi>'s royal Conſort.) The kind Treatment, and good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, ſhe had with the <hi>Queen,</hi> ſpread ſo in City and Country, that many Thouſands flocked to hear her, and more of the Gentry and Nobility, than ever was
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:006297_0291_1028595DDBFEBF80"/>
known before, to our Meetings. I had ſome private Converſation with her, which put me in mind of the Apoſtle's Exhortation, where he adviſeth the primitive Chriſtians, that their Words be few and ſavoury, and that they ſhould be ſeaſoned with Grace for this great Reaſon, that they might adminiſter Grace to the Hearers; and truly I thought there was the Influence of Grace in her Conduct and Converſation, whom I pray God to preſerve in Chriſt to the End.</p>
                     <p>I had a Meeting at the Houſe of my Brother with his Scholars at <hi>Edmonton,</hi>

And, we not knowing whether Death will come in our Youth, our middle, or old Age, therefore, were earneſtly deſired to prepare our Hearts to meet Death, ſo that we might dwell with God and Chriſt in his Kingdom forever. It was alſo obſerved, that though this Friend had lived to a great Age, yet that few lived ſo long, no, not one in a Thouſand, and many die very young; therefore they were earneſtly entreated, in the Love of God, through Chriſt, to prepare for their latter End, and not to ſet their Hearts and Affections on Things below; for, by how much they ſet their Hearts and Affections on natural or outward Things and Objects, by ſo much the harder it would be to part with them, when Death ſhould come. This Meeting ended with Prayer for Reformation and Preſervation to the End of Life; and Praiſes, yea, high Praiſes, were given to Him, who had given to all preſent our Life, our Breath, and our being.</p>

and he would likewiſe thereby have oppoſed the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſaid, "Now is fulfilled the Propheſy of the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> that in the latter Days Sons and Daughters ſhould Prophecy."

I cannot be clear in my Mind without ſaying, that I did not, nor do not ſtudy what I preach to the People, nor did I, or do I receive any Pay or natural Conſideration for Preaching, it being, as I really believe, contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles and Diſciples.</p>

There was a Multitude of People at the Burial, among whom we had a good Opportunity to invite them to lay hold of Truth and Righteouſneſs, and prepare for another World. They were reminded, that neither natural Wiſdom, nor Riches, Youth nor Strength, Crowns nor Scepters, would, nor could ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from the Stroke of Death. <hi>Robert Jordan</hi> was at this Meeting, and had good Service therein; it concluded in Supplication for the Widow and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, and for Mankind univerſally.

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nothwithſtanding Man's Fall, God had Love, Mercy and Compaſſion towards him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Head of the Serpent, who led them aſtray, which Seed was Chriſt, whom all are commanded to hear, believe and follow, in the Practice of his holy Doctrine, which is contained in his Words ſpoken to his immediate Diſciples and Apoſtles, and likewiſe made known and revealed in our Hearts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That now in our Day his righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are abroad in the Earth, as the Sword, and a Threatning of Famine, or want of Bread; all which was ſpoken in the tender Love and Fear of God, and Faith of Chriſt, and all were intreated to lay theſe Things to Heart, and <hi>Turn to the Lord, and he will have Mercy, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon.</hi> In this Meeting God was glorified, and his Name magnified, thro' the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of his dear Son, our Lord.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Cohanſy</hi> I went to <hi>Salem,</hi> and thence to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Davis's,</hi> where we had a Meeting, at which were ſeveral People of divers Profeſſions, who were ſatisfied and edified therein; and thence we went to <hi>Pileſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove</hi> Meeting, afterwards into <hi>Penn's-Neck,</hi> and had a good open Meeting at the Widow <hi>Hughs's,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Woodbery-Creek</hi> Meeting, which, I hope, was ſerviceable; after which I went home with my Friend

                        <hi>James Lord</hi>'s Widow; who, with her Siſter <hi>Ann Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Clews,</hi> went with me to <hi>Glouceſter</hi> Goal,<note place="margin">

                        </note> where we viſited one under Sentence of Death for Stealing; I aſked him, if he truly repented of that Sin of Stealing, of which he had been ſo often guilty? He told me, he hoped he had, and was willing to die. He was recommended to the Grace of God, and to keep in an humble Frame of Mind, and beg Mercy of the Almighty, for the Sake of Chriſt, for all his Sins. While a Friend was praying by him, he was broken into Tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>Here the aforeſaid Friends parted from me; I croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the River <hi>Delaware</hi> to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and ſo home to <hi>Franckfort.</hi> I was at ten Meetings in this Journey beſides the Yearly-meeting at <hi>Salem</hi>) and travelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 150 Miles; but travelling was painful to my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I now more and more felt the Effects of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny old Falls and Bruiſes, which much diſabled and hurt me in Riding.</p>
                     <p>In the Fourth Month I was at divers Meetings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout or near home, as at <hi>Fair-Hill, Germantown,</hi> and at a Meeting at <hi>Thomas Roberts</hi>'s;<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.

In the Beginning of the Fifth Month, I viſited Friends Meetings at <hi>Darby, Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>Haverford</hi>; at the laſt Place the Meeting was large, and very open; wherein the mighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God was exalted over all, and it was plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, that if there was any Virtue, or any good Gift or Genius in the Creature, it derived its Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Creator; and that Man, in his beſt Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, in either natural or ſpiritual Attainments, hath no Cauſe to boaſt or Glory in any Thing or Things, which he, as an Inſtrument in the divine Hand, might help to do or perform; wherefore we ought to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ourſelves under the mighty Hand of God, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no Glory to Self, or the Creature; but all Glory and Praiſe to the Creator, who is in and over all bleſſed forever.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Briſtol.</note> which was large, conſidering the Heat of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Shortneſs of the Notice; next Day, being the Fourth-day of the Week, and the 22d of the Month, I was at <hi>Mount-Holly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mount-Holly.</note> at the Burial of our antient Friend, <hi>Reſtored Lippincoat:</hi> He was, as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, near an hundred Years of Age, and had upwards of 200 Children, Grand Children, and Great Grand Children, many of whom were at his Funeral; the Meeting was large, and thought to be a ſerviceable Meeting by divers. After this Meeting, I went with a few choice Friends to viſit <hi>Suſannah Fearon,</hi> who had been long ill; in which Viſit we were favoured with the divine Preſence and Goodneſs of the Moſt High; for which we returned Him Thanks and Praiſe. After which we went to <hi>Burlington,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> and next Day had a Meeting, which was an acceptable Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to many.</p>
                     <p>Next Firſt-day, being the 27th of the Month, we had a good, ſolid Meeting at <hi>Trenton</hi>; from thence I went, with divers Friends, to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and ſo home to <hi>Franckfort</hi>; and was thankful to the Almighty for the Grace which he was pleaſed to beſtow upon me, a poor Worm; and that, conſidering the extream Heat, I had my Health better than uſual. After coming home, I viſited divers Meetings, at <hi>Philadelphia, Haddonfield, Franckfort,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In the Sixth Month there was a great Mortality in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and many were taken away; on a Fifth-day, I was concerned to put the People in Mind of it, and of their own Mortality, and exhorted them to prepare for it, they not knowing whoſe Turn it might be next, nor the Hour when Death might come to their own Habitations; and was concerned, in the ſame Nature, at ſeveral large Burials; in the Meeting at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> they were told, It was better to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:006297_0330_102859CF032A9BA0"/>
the Hands of the Lord, than into the Hands of Men; and that ſince we had been ſettled in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> we were preſerved from the Hands of Men; there having never been an Enemy in it, in a warlike Way; our Dependance being on Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and our Principle againſt War, and againſt ſpilling of human Blood by Wars and Fighting, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of Chriſt, the peaceable Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; wherefore I believe the Hand of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in preſerving us in Peace: Yet I would not be underſtood to be againſt the Magiſtrates exerciſing the Power committed to them, according to juſt Law; but national Wars, woful Experience teacheth, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the peaceable Religion of Jeſus, to Trade, Wealth, Health and Happineſs. Our dear Lord preached Peace to the People, and againſt Wars; telling his Followers, "That they muſt love and pray for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and rather take a Stroke or a Blow, than give one; and that they ſhould not reſiſt Evil;" which peaceable Doctrine of Chriſt, the <hi>Jews</hi> could not away with; no, no, by no Means; O, ſay they, <hi>If we let this Man alone, the Romans will come and take away our Place and Nation:</hi> Juſt as the People now ſay in this Province, among and to thoſe peaceable Men, who, for the Sake of Chriſt and his Doctrine, cannot uſe the Sword; "The <hi>Romans</hi> will come and take our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, if we don't build Forts and Caſtles, and have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Preparations:" And I wiſh it were not true, that ſome, who profeſs this peaceable Principle; too much endeavour to ſmother, ſtifle and keep under, this peaceable Doctrine, through a ſlaviſh Fear, and too much diſtruſting of the Divine Providence, which may cauſe the Divine Hand to deliver us to the <hi>Romans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; at which I ſhould not wonder, ſince we diſtruſt that Divine Hand, that hath hitherto preſerved us, without our preparing for War, above theſe fifty Years. To which I know that it is objected; "But now there are Abundance of People who are not of that
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:006297_0331_102859D209613AD8"/>
Principle." I anſwer. Then why did they come among us, if they could not truſt themſelves with our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which they knew, or might have known, if they would? The King gave the Province, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it, to our worthy Proprietor, WILLIAM PENN; who was a Man of this peaceable Principle; for which the <hi>Heathens</hi> loved him, and honour his Name and Memory to this Day, and thoſe of his Society and Principles; whereof I am a living Witneſs. The Senſe of the Sweetneſs and ſocial Life that the firſt Settlers of the Province of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and the City of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> lived in, makes me expreſs myſelf in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Oh! that the Inhabitants of the City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, did but live and dwell in that firſt Love, and hold it faſt; and then I believe that the Almighty would not ſuffer any to take our Crown; which Crown is Righteouſneſs, Peace and Love, through true Faith; which true Faith <hi>works by Love,</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>On the laſt Day of the Fifth Month,<note place="margin">Prepares for a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tola,</hi> &amp;c.</note> I acquainted my Friends of the Monthly Meeting of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> with a Concern I had been ſome Time under, to viſit the People in the <hi>Virgin Iſlands,</hi> and more particularly in <hi>Anguilla</hi> and <hi>Tortola</hi>; in order to preach the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt freely, to thoſe who might have a Deſire to hear, as the Lord ſhould be pleas'd to open my Way: And my Friends having Unity with me therein, at their next Meeting, gave me a Certificate of their Concurrence: Soon after which, having ſettled my Affairs, and taken Leave of my dear Wife and Daughter, and the reſt of my Family and Friends, on the 19th Day of the Seventh Month, I embarked at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in the Sloop <hi>John, Peter Blunder</hi> Maſter, bound for the Iſland of <hi>Tortola.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſail'd down the River, and came to an Anchor near <hi>Chriſtine</hi> Creek that Night, in which there was a violent Storm, which drove ſeveral Veſſels on the Marſhes; ſo that when the Tide ebb'd, one might walk round them. Next Day we ſail'd to <hi>Reedy-Iſland,</hi>

where we waited for a fair Wind: We ſail'd down the Bay (in Company with two Sloops, one bound for <hi>Bermudas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">At Sea.</note> the other for the Iſland of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher</hi>'s) and left the <hi>Capes</hi> on the 23d Day of the Month, and in 18 Days, from that Time, fell in with the Iſland of <hi>Thomas,</hi> and in one Day more turn'd up to <hi>Tortola.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Voyage we ſaw nine Sail of Veſſels; but ſpoke with none of them: Had a rough Paſſage, the Wind being high and contrary above a Week, and much Rain; yet, thro' the Mercy and Grace of God, I was preſerved above all Fear, except the holy Fear of the Living Lord, in which I bleſs'd his holy Name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Tortola.</note>On the 12th Day of the Eighth Month, <hi>John Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering,</hi> the Owner of the Sloop (who was likewiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Iſland) with his Spouſe, met me at the Water-ſide, and lovingly embraced me, and led me up to their Houſe, and, the ſame Evening, had a Meeting at his Houſe; and on the 15th of the Month, being the Fifth-day of the Week, we had a large, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Meeting, at which were many People, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them not of our Profeſſion, and, I think, the good Hand of the Lord was with us. I was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Meeting to ſhew. That the laſt Diſpenſation of God to Mankind, in and through his dear Son, was a ſpiritual Diſpenſation; a Diſpenſation of pure, divine Love, which is to laſt and be with the true Believers in Chriſt forever, according to his own Doctrine in the New-Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>On the Firſt-day of the Week, and the 18th of the Month, we had another Meeting, larger than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (and the Governor told me, He had never ſeen ſo large a Gathering on the Iſland, on any Occaſion) My Spirit was much ſet at Liberty in this Meeting, and great Openneſs and Brokenneſs was among the People, ſo that the Goſpel was freely and largely declared to them. The Caſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> going to his Houſe, was treated of, with divers
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:006297_0333_102859D568CD9E20"/>
other Matters, tending to Edification. I was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Power, Spirit and Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that, when the Meeting was over,<note place="margin">Tortola.</note> I withdrew, and, in private, poured out my Soul before the Lord, and begg'd that He would be pleas'd to manifeſt His Power and glorious Goſpel more and more. At this Meeting there was a Woman who had ſuffer'd much for her going to Meetings; her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being a proud, haughty Man, had beat her to the drawing of Blood; he alſo drew his Sword, and preſented his Piſtol, with Threat'nings to kill her; but ſhe thank'd God, that ſhe was reſign'd to loſe her Life for Chriſt's Sake: This Woman expreſs'd ſome Words in Supplication in this Meeting, in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Manner. There was alſo another (a beautiful young Woman) whoſe Father had turn'd her out of Doors for coming to Friends Meetings.</p>
                     <p>I went, with the Governor and his Wife, to viſit a few Families up in the Mountains, and had a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which was great Brokenneſs and Tenderneſs in the Time of Prayer.</p>
                     <p>On Second-day we viſited ſeveral Families in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion caled the <hi>Road,</hi> to which we went by Water in a Coble (ſome-what like our Canoes) there were four of theſe in Company, five Perſons in two of them, and ſeven in the other two. In this viſiting of Families, the People came and filled the Rooms, and we had ſeaſonable Meetings, in which the People were ſo lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and well-affected, that we could ſeldom go in a friendly Way to viſit our Friends, but they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fill their little Rooms, and we ſcarcely could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, without having a Time of Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Next Day we went to viſit a young Man's Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (who had not yet finiſhed his Houſe) and the Neighbours coming in, as uſual, we had a good Meeting.</p>

                     <p>Third-day and Fourth-day, viſited ſeveral Families, and had divers good Opportunities: In one of thoſe Meetings, a young Man, named <hi>Jeremiah Martin,</hi> ſpoke a few Words in Prayer; in which Seaſon, we were, I think, all broken into Tenderneſs; ſo that in Truth we might ſay, That the Power and Spirit of Chriſt was with and among us, and his great Name was praiſed.</p>
                     <p>Fifth-day, being the Week-day-meeting, it was larger than was ever known of a Week-day at that Place; there being divers Friends who came from an Iſland called <hi>Jos. Vandike</hi>'s, and many Neighbours and ſober People, who were very attentive.</p>
                     <p>Sixth-day, was at ſeveral Peoples Houſes, and had religious Meetings; which we could not well avoid, the People were ſo loving and deſirous to hear what might be ſpoken to them; they being many of them like thirſty Ground, wanting Rain, and our good and gracious Lord gave us celeſtial Showers, which were refreſhing to us, and thankfully received.</p>
                     <p>Seventh-day, I went, with ſeveral Friends, to the Houſe of One who, with his Wife, had been at our Meeting on Fifth, day; he kindly invited me to his Houſe; his Name <hi>Blacke</hi>; he and his Wife were

                     <p>On the Firſt-day of the Week, being the 25th of the Month, we had a larger Meeting than ordinary; and, in Expectation of larger Meetings than uſual, the Governor, <hi>John Pickering,</hi> had made ſeveral new Forms to accommodate the People at his own Houſe, which he ſent ſix Miles on Mens Heads, the Roads not being paſſable for Carriage by Carts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I think worth noting, that their Zeal may be had in Remembrance, and that others may be ſtirr'd up to a more religious Concern, who will ſcarce go ſix Steps to a religious Meeting, or will not go at all. In this Meeting I was concern'd to ſpeak of and ſet forth the Doctrine of Chriſt, which he preached on the <hi>Mount,</hi> contain'd in the 5th, 6th and 7th Chapters of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>; and to preſs the People to come to the Practice of what is there commanded by the great Author of the Chriſtian Religion; and to ſhew that the deſpiſed <hi>Quakers</hi> had learn'd out of that excellent Sermon much of their Religion, which diſpleaſes many People, and divers of the great Men of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to urge them to regard the Grace of God, which bringeth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and hath appeared to all Men.

                     <p>A general Invitation was given to Friends and others to his Funeral; where three Teſtimonies were borne, all in great Brokenneſs, under a juſt Senſe of our great Loſs. After which he was decently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd on the Evening of the ſame Day, in a Piece of Ground which is ſince given to Friends for a Burial Place, and on which a Meeting-houſe is built by

                     <p>It is ſaid in the Scriptures, That <hi>the Righteous are taken away, and no Man layeth it to Heart</hi>; but, I hope, it may be truly ſaid, this was not the Caſe at this Time; for Friends, in general, much lamented their great Loſs, in being ſo ſoon deprived of ſo inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive a Friend and Elder, whoſe Care over us was very great; and who, by his loving and exemplary Life, and Tenderneſs to People of all Ranks and Profeſſions, engag'd the Love and Reſpect of moſt of the People in the Iſland.

learned Phraſes, or florid Expreſſions; for many Times, heavenly Matter is bid in mean Sentences, or wrapp'd up in plain Expreſſions. It ſometimes pleaſes God to reveal the Myſteries of his Kingdom (through the Grace of his Son, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) to Babes and Sucklings; and he oftentimes ordains Praiſes out of their Mouths; one of which, Reader, I deſire thou may be.</p>
                     <p>MY Intent in Writing theſe Sheets, is, that they, through the Help of God's Grace, and the good Spirit of Chriſt, may ſtir up true Love in thee; firſt, to God and Chriſt, and then, to Man: Then thou wilt be fit to be eſpouſed to him, who is altogether lovely (that is, Chriſt) which is the Deſire of him, that is thy Friend, more in Heart, than Word.</p>

                        <hi>GOD</hi>'s Great Love to <hi>MANKIND,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>HAVING been concerned for the Good and Welfare of the Children of Men,<note place="margin">1697.</note> in my youthful Days, and taſted of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Love of God, in, and through his dear Son, the holy Lamb Jeſus, who laid down his Life for the Sins of the World; and, in my tender Years, reaped great Benefit, through Faith in, and Obedience unto, him: For, truly, I have found, by ſufficient Experience, that one without the other <hi>(to wit)</hi> Faith without Works, will not anſwer the End of the great Love of Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord, in that he offer'd himſelf a Sacrifice for all Mankind; not for People to live in Sin, but to take away the Sin of the World: In a Word, <hi>Faith, without Works, is dead,</hi> James ii. 20. For my Part, I found it ſo, and ſo muſt all true Believers in the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt he firſt loved us, and paid that Debt for us, that, of ourſelves, we were not able to do. Oh his infinite Love! it hath oftentimes melted my Soul into Tenderneſs. Methinks it is Abundance of Pity, that ever the Sons of Men ſhould requite Evil for Good, or Diſobedience, for ſuch gracious Obedience: I would to God, that all Believers in Chriſt, would live in that Fear of God, and that Love to Chriſt, that keepeth the Heart clean; becauſe nothing unclean can enter the Kingdom of Heaven. I don't mean a ſlaviſh Fear; but Fear, that is wrought by Love: For them
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:006297_0343_102859F6B4B23430"/>
that love the Lord, the Great, Everlaſting God, will fear to offend Him.</p>
                     <p>This is the Matter that chiefly beareth Streſs on my Mind, at this Time, The Neceſſity of Love to God, and Chriſt, and one another: <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entered into the Heart of Man to conceive, the Things that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> prepared for them that love Him,</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 9. For thy Part, I can't pretend to tell thee, O Man! to the Full; but only a little to hint at it: It is, <hi>Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory:</hi> But then we muſt love Him, ſo as to keep His Commandments. This is the Work that I am very earneſt in preſſing People to; whether Youth, or Aged: It is not too ſoon for the Young, neither too late for the Aged, to begin this Work of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, through Faith, and Love to God and Chriſt, if His Spirit is reproving or ſtriving in them. But it is more honourable and acceptable, for a Man to give up the Strength of his Days to ſerve the Lord, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Creator in the Days of his Youth, before Sin is too much rooted and grown in Man; for then it will be much more Labour, to get the Root of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs plucked up.</p>
                     <p>So that in that Ability, which God hath given me, I would endeavour to ſtir up all to ſerve Him, and to be in good Earneſt, and not to put the Day of God, even the Mighty Jehovah, a-far off; but to love the Lord unfeignedly, and with true Obedience; ſince it is that Sacrifice, that is only acceptable to God; that is to ſay, To love Him in Deed, and in Truth, more than in Word, and with Tongue: For againſt ſuch a People, the Lord, by his Servant, complain'd, in old Time; <hi>They, ſaith the Lord, draw nigh to me with their Mouths, and with their Lips do honour me:</hi> But, Oh! their great Miſery was, their Hearts were far from Him; they did not love Him with their whole Hearts; that was their great Fault: This Thing is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a great Evil in the Sight of the Great God, in this
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:006297_0344_102859FAD5A0F4F0"/>
our Age; and it is too frequent in <hi>England,</hi> the Land of my Nativity, as alſo in other Iſlands, and Places, beyond the Sea. What Lamentation ſhall be taken up, for ſuch as do ſo mock the Lord, the Great God of Love? Surely he will render Vengeance, as in Flames of Fire, upon all the Wicked, and Ungodly, and thoſe that forget Him. 'Tis not by Saying, but by Doing, that we are juſtified, through Faith in Chriſt: Not he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aith, Lord, Lord, only; but he that doth his Will alſo, ſhall enter the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Now the Will of God, and Chriſt his Son, is, That we ſhould love Him above all; and in loving Him, we ſhall love one another; for Chriſt ſaw the great Need there was of loving God above all, and alſo of loving one another; therefore he anſwered thus to him that aſked him, Which was the greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment —<hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind,</hi> Mat. xxii. 37.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>is the firſt and great Commandment; and the Second is like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thyſelf: On theſe two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Verſes 38, 39, and 40.</p>
                     <p>Now if theſe two great Commandments were obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would anſwer God's great Love to us, in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son to bleſs us, O! the Glory of God, how it would ſhine! it would make the young Men, as Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the old Men, as Captains of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; then Chriſt would reign gloriouſly indeed, in the Hearts of the Children of Men; here the Lamb and his Followers (that walk in the Light, and that Commandment, that burns as a Lamp) would get the Victory over the Devil, and his Followers: But, on the contrary, this is the great Error of Mankind, they talk of God, and Chriſt, in Words; but deny Him in Works: Nay, ſome will not ſtick to ſay, It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to keep the Commands of Chriſt. It is
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:006297_0345_102859FF1FD52B80"/>
too commonly ſpoken, and alſo believed, That there is no Perfection on this Side the Grave, contrary to the Saying of Chriſt, <hi>Be ye perfect, even as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet, ſay they, it is impoſſible; which is as much as to ſay, Chriſt is a hard Maſter, in commanding what cannot be done, conſequently, out of their own Mouths they will be condemned: for Chriſt is not a hard Maſter. I teſtify againſt all ſuch unholy and imperfect Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, in ſolid Fear before the Lord; but according to ſuch People's Faith, and Belief, he mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and his dear Son, as to ſtrive to do his Commands; for it is impoſſible they ſhould obey, if they do neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, nor endeavour: But let ſuch know, That <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall ſtrive, and ſhall not enter</hi>; much leſs, <hi>enter,</hi> if they do not <hi>ſtrive:</hi> But we muſt, of Neceſſity, <hi>ſtrive,</hi> in Obedience to his Will, and by his Aſſiſtance (not in our own natural Will) <hi>to enter in at the ſtrait Gate:</hi> Man would enter in with all his pleaſant Things, and in all his Bravery, and Gallantry; but God's Will is, That he ſhould be brought low, that he might exalt him. O! this Self, it is a great Enemy to Mankind.</p>
                     <p>My intention is, to awaken People out of the Sleep of Sin, which is Death; and to ſtir them up to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Love to the Lord, and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, even with their whole Heart: This is what my Heart breathes to, and ſupplicates, the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for; Then would the End of my Labour, in his Love, be anſwered; for great is the Love of God, in ſending his Son, and, alſo, in ſending his Servants, and ſtirring them up, to rouze People out of the Sleep of Security, that they might ſee the Danger they are in, and how near they lie to the Brink of the Pit of Burning. O! that People would but ſeriouſly conſider that which is ſhewed and told them in the Love of the Lord. O that it might be laid to Heart. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether they will hear, or forbear, God will be
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:006297_0346_10285A00A673EAF8"/>
clear, and his Servants alſo will be clear. But if we not only hear, but alſo obey, that Peace, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Underſtanding of Men (that our Lord giveth to his Followers) will be our Portion, and the Lot of our Inheritance forever. But this is on Condition of our Obedience, and keeping the Commands of God: <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments</hi> (John xiv. 15.) ſaith the Lord. So, if People live in Saying, and not in Doing, in Profeſſing, and Confeſſing, yet ſtill living in Pride, and High-mindedneſs, and in Sin, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, they do not love Chriſt Jeſus (according to his own Words) neither doth he juſtify them; 'tis only the Doers that he will juſtify. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>If a Man ſays, he loves God, and yet hateth his Brother, he is a Liar,</hi> 1 John iv. 20. and, by plain Scripture Teſtimony, ſuch are not of God: Moreover, if he ſays, He loves Chriſt, yet doth not his Sayings, he is alſo a Liar, and the Truth is not in him, or, Chriſt is not in him; who ſaid, <hi>I am the Truth</hi>; and thus Man becomes reprobated; for <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſaith, <hi>Examine yourſelves, whether you be in the Faith, prove your ownſelves; know ye not, your own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,</hi> 2 Cor. xiii. 5. Which Indwelling of Chriſt, is a great Myſtery to many; although Chriſt within (which the Apoſtles preached) was the Hope of the Saints Glory, <hi>Col.</hi> i. 27. And, Oh! how earneſt was Chriſt in Prayer to his Father, That his Followers may be one in Him, and that they might be united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, <hi>John</hi> xvii. Such was the Love of Chriſt to his Church; now, what remains on the Church's Part, ſince Chriſt has done his Part, ſurely it is, that we love him again; for, ſaith <hi>John, He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is Love,</hi> 1 John iv. 8. They that dwell in Enmity, are not the Children of God; but the Children of Satan; who always hated the Appearance of Chriſt, the Light of the World; and yet ſtirreth up thoſe that are led by his dark Spirit,
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:006297_0347_10285A022C3225E0"/>
to war againſt Him, and his Seed, in his Children; who ſaid, <hi>I am the Light of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But indeed it is as Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Men love Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than Light</hi>; and how ſtrange is it, ſeeing the one is ſo glorious, and the other ſo miſerable? But the Reaſon is, as Chriſt hath ſhewed, <hi>becauſe their Deeds are evil,</hi> John iii. 19. That is indeed the very Cauſe; for if their Deeds were good, they would love the Light which is Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord of Life and Glory; and bring their Deeds to him, that he might judge them; who will give righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every Man according to his Works, <hi>John</hi> v. 29. The Righteous will have their Portion in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Life, Joy and Peace, in the Holy Ghoſt; but the Wicked in the Reſurrection of Damnation. Oh! that I might be inſtrumental in the Hand of the Lord, to open the Eyes of ſome that are ſpiritually blind, that they might ſee the Splendor, the Beauty, and the great Glory, of the dear Son of God, that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Light which God hath prepared, according to good old <hi>Simeon</hi>'s Teſtimony of him, <hi>Thou haſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>prepared him a Light to enlighten the Gentiles, and to be the Glory of thy People Iſrael,</hi> Luke iii. 32. A glorious Light indeed! Truly, methinks every Body ſhould be in Love with him: For my Part, he is my chiefeſt Joy: I would not part with him for all the Pomp, and Vain-glory, of the World; neither would I have the ſhining Beams, and glorious Rays (which comfort me for Well-doing, and reprove me for, and diſcover, the contrary) clouded from my Sight and Underſtanding, for the fineſt Gold, or choiceſt Rubies; ſuch is my Love to Chriſt, the Bridegroom of Souls: But, by the Way, it hath coſt me many a Tear, and many Groanings in my Spirit, before I came thus to enjoy Chriſt; who is the Beloved of all the Redeemed. Oh! may I never give him Cauſe to withdraw himſelf from dwelling in me. Oh! the univerſal Love of Chriſt; 'tis everlaſting to them that are open-hearted

unto him, and to all that will hear his Voice, ſo as to obey it; for, ſays he, <hi>I ſtand at the Door and knock</hi> (that is, the Door of the Heart of Man) <hi>if any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me,</hi> Rev. iii. 20. And <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>And we have known and believed the Love that God hath to us: God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 John iv. 16. A heavenly Habitation, and glorious Dwelling Place! Who would but endeavour to dwell in Love, and forſake Enmity, that they might attain unto ſuch eternal Happineſs, as to have their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode with the Lord.</p>
                     <p>This fulfils the Words of Chriſt. <hi>For he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you,</hi> John xiv. 17. How was he to be in him? A Comforter for Well-doing, that they might have the Hope of Glory, and a Reprover for Sin, Self-righteouſneſs and wrong Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Indeed it was the great Love of God in thus ſending his beloved Son a Light into this dark World, to ſhew People their evil Deeds, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Sin in the Fleſh; for he is the ſinful World's Condemnation, as well as a Saviour and Juſtifier of the Righteous and holy Believer. The <hi>Jews</hi> of Old hated him, and many of them did intend to darken his bright and ſhining Light, but ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> believed on him, and after they came truly to believe on his Name, ſpread his Goſpel of Truth and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidings amongſt the Children of Men, and alſo ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Name's Sake. It is alſo ſaid, <hi>He came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own, and his own received him not, but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I can truly ſay, I would with my whole Heart, that God did dwell a Comforter in all (or Chriſt, or the Holy Ghoſt, or Holy Spirit, which are all one) But this can never be, while Sin remains and has an evil Root in Mankind, <hi>An evil Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit.</hi> By this we may know Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from Anti-chriſtians, and Lovers of Chriſt, from them that love him not; if we love him, we become Subjects to him, ſubject to do his Will. O! it is a brave Station to be the Subjects of the King of Heaven, and if we love him unfeignedly with all our Might and Mind, and our Neighbours (or them that are already his Subjects) as ourſelves, and with the Sword of the Spirit valiantly encounter with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Satan; O then ſhall we be his Subjects, and he will receive us into his Warfare, and through him we ſhall be victorious, for the Lamb and his Followers will have the Victory. I would preſs People in Love into this Warfare, having Commiſſion from my Maſter and Lord (I mean Spiritual) by ſhewing them what Anxiety of Soul, and Diſtreſs of Mind, they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to themſelves, by living in Enmity to the Lord, and his Saints. O my Soul, I charge thee, with all thoſe that have any Regard to the Holy Jeſus, obey the Commands of the Lord, and love his Followers, or thy Neighbour as thyſelf. Let his univerſal Spirit of Love to all dwell in thee, O my Soul!</p>
                     <p>I would have all to caſt down that which they glory in (that is not right in his Sight) at his Footſtool, and do like the poor penitent Woman, that lay and wept at his Feet, <hi>Luke</hi> vii. 38. She thought all little enough to get into his Favour. Chriſt himſelf alſo was meek and lowly, <hi>Learn of me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Matt.</hi> xi. 29.

me,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for an Example,</hi> when he waſhed his Servants Feet. O he was meek and lowly indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeeing his Love was ſo great to them, and is alſo to us, let us love him again, not with feigned Love, but with Love that may manifeſt us to be his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and in this Love let us love one another; for this Intent our Lord iſſued forth his royal Command, which is this, <hi>A new Commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one another: By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have Love one to another,</hi> John xiii. 34, 35. Chriſt's Love was unfeigned to his Diſciples, nay, to all the World in general; for what greater Love can there be, than for a Man to lay down his Life for his Friend; and he not only laid down his Life for his Friends, but for his Enemies alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 10. So that his Love was great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned: We ought with the ſame Love to love him again, ſince that he loved us firſt; and this cannot be without Obedience to his Commands. Thus undoubtedly we ſhould with true Love love him, and one another: This Love is exceeding precious, it thinks no Evil, and we may be ſure, will not do any willingly or knowingly. If a Man ſeeth his Neighbour or Brother in that which is not Right, he prayeth to the Lord to help him, and tenderly admoniſheth him; yea, if having this Love he woundeth, his Wounds are faithful, for <hi>faithful are the Wounds of a Friend, Prov.</hi> xxv. 6. He that is thus endued with Love, is not hindered from reproving his Brother, but if there be a Cauſe, it rather ſtirs him up to be faithful therein, without reſpect of Perſons. O the Love that is raiſed in them that love the Lord above all, it is great to the Sons and Daughters of Men; it doth wonderful Things; it is valiant for God; it overcomes its Enemies: It is not overcome with Evil, but it often overcomes Evil with Good: It ſmiteth Sin in the Gate (that is, in its firſt Appearance) before it be

entered into Man, ſo as to ſubject him thereunto; it gets Victory over the Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he cannot ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God's Love. I would to God that People did but know the Virtue of Love to Chriſt, and one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in him, it would cauſe them, for the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, to forſake all Manner of Enmity one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, and all Things elſe, how near or dear ſoever; yea, though they were as a right Hand or a right Eye, they would be forſaken for its Sake, and for the Sake of him that firſt loved us: And then we ſhould ſtrive, through the Ability of his Grace, (even the Grace or Spirit which he told <hi>Paul</hi> was ſufficient for him) to love him again, and our Neighbour as ourſelf; but this curſed Self is loved too much, and our Neighbour too little.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul,</hi> the Apoſtle of Chriſt, did not after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion hate his Neighbour, nor was he in Enmity with them; indeed when he was <hi>Saul,</hi> he did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and injure his neareſt Neighbours and chiefeſt Friends, for that blind Zeal was part of that Body of Sin and Death that was upon him, and from which, by the Help of Chriſt's Grace, he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and came to love his Enemies; and for their Good hazarded his Life: And for his Love to Chriſt laid it down, as many holy Martyrs have done ſince his Time. Surely they had not much Regard for Self then! Tho' it is a common Expreſſion now a Days, <hi>Every one for himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God for us all</hi>; But if every one were for his Neighbour or his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as much as for himſelf, God would be the more for us all. But this Self Love is in the Sight of the Lord an Abomination, and the Great, Eternal God, abhors it: Therefore were the firſt and ſecond Commandments given forth.</p>
                     <p>If all People would obey theſe two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the whole Law and the Prophets, yea, and the Goſpel too, would be all obeyed.</p>

Chriſt ſaid, <hi>For whoſoever ſhall do the Will of my Father which is in Heaven, the ſame is my Brother, and Siſter, and Mother,</hi> Matt, xii. 50. Therefore my Love is more ſingly unto thoſe.

Surely if People were ſenſible thereof, they would not ſo hardly cenſure one another: For indeed we ought to be well ſatisfied before we give Judgment, and then it ought to be in Love, and not in Enmity. It is better to ſuffer, than to cenſure, or to be judged, than to Judge.—<hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged,</hi> Matt. vii. 1.—ſaid the Judge of Heaven and Earth. But People are too much poſſeſſed with Uncharitableneſs and Revenge one towards another, and are not ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive one another their Treſpaſſes, as the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is to forgive them: Tho' to forgive one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother their Treſpaſſes, be every Chriſtian's Duty, and without which, we cannot juſtly expect God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our Treſpaſſes, as Chriſt Taught, <hi>Matt.</hi> vi. 14, 15.</p>

And a noble King made a Decree, that Men ſhould fear and tremble before the living God, <hi>Daniel</hi> vi. 26.</p>

I deſire all People might thus love the Lord, then ſhould we fear exceedingly to offend him: Alſo if one Man did truly love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very well, were the Caſe thy own, thou wouldſt very unwillingly offend him whom thou loveſt dearly.

Judgment, Judgment is the Lot and Inheritance of all the Wicked, who remain and live in Wickedneſs. Altho' the Lord is ſlow to Anger, and of Great Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Kindneſs, and his Mercy endureth for ever, to them that truly repent of Evil, and do that which is Good: Yet he has alſo prepared Weeping, Wailing, and Gnaſhing of Teeth, for them that continually live in Sin.

But thoſe that are willing to put the Day of God afar off, are ready to ſay, Chriſt is our Advocate with the Father; He maketh Interceſſion for our Sins; (very well) but it is conditionally: It is if thou wilt repent, and ſin no more. (Mark that well!) Repentance without Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning no more, will not do. <hi>John</hi> viii. 11. Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is very Good, but forſaking is abundance better: Confeſſion without forſaking will ſtand in little Stead in the Day of Account.</p>

                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Alſo being drunk with Wine, or with ſtrong Drink; Drunkenneſs is a great Sin: Firſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and ſecondly, the Abuſe of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and good Creatures. And by this Frame of Drunkenneſs, Men are often fitted for any Buſineſs that their Maſter the Devil may call them to: So that this great Sin ought to be ſtrictly watched againſt. Surely if Men had any good Deſires in their Hearts, or any Love to God, they would refrain from ſuch great Wickedneſs. I admire how People can expect Mercy from God, or the Interceſſion of Chriſt, when they are piercing his Sides, and putting of him to open Shame: For thoſe that are ſinning againſt him, are piercing of him. How can ſuch expect He will

interceed for them, when they have dealt ſo ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, and grieved him, and from Time to Time diſobey'd his Voice? Now ſuppoſe a Man ſtood condemn'd before a Judge, and that at the Judge's right Hand there ſat one who had Power in his Hand, and this poor condemn'd Perſon, hopes he will interceed for him; and yet this poor Wretch has come to him as before mentioned. What Grounds can he have, to hope for Interceſſion, Clemency or Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, while he believes he can do no otherwiſe than ſin againſt him all his Days? For my part, I think his Faith, Hope and Belief, is but vain; without any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Ground. But he that loveth Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord of Life and Glory, ſo as to keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, the Lord will love him, and interceed for him, and make himſelf known unto him; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Words, which he ſpake, <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and manifeſt myſelf unto him,</hi> John xiv. 21.</p>

                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry, is alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother great Snare of the Enemy, and many are caught therein. It is in vain for the Covetous to ſay, he hath a Share in the Love of God; for he hath neither Love to the Lord, nor to his Neighbour. A poor naked Man might aſk him long enough for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or for his Coat, before he would give him his Hand to help, or Coat either; or any manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: Altho' Chriſt expreſly commanded it, <hi>Give to him that aſketh, and from him that would borrow, turn not thou away,</hi> Matt. v. 42. How can any be ſo hard-hearted, to ſee his Brother's or his Neighbour's Poverty, and not adminiſter of his Ability to the Needful's Neceſſity?

Perhaps one that is covetous may ſay, that Charity begins at Home. But let him remember, that if it doth begin there, the Conſequence moſt commonly is very bad, when it ends there. Every Chriſtian hath need to have Charity (in his Breaſt) in a two-fold Senſe, or elſe there is no proper Pretence to Chriſtianity; in ſhort, Covetouſneſs is out of the Love either to God or Man: All thoſe (with Abundance more, that I ſhall forbear to mention) are eminent Snares of the Devil; and Satan layeth them according to the Propenſity of Man and Woman, and ſuits them with their Nature. Oh! I'll warrant thee he will colour them finely, and put a pleaſant Gloſs upon them, to betray thy Soul, and keep it in Bondage for ever.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IT is good for Man, whoſe Breath is in his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, to think upon his Maker,<note place="margin">1699.</note> as much as in him lieth, both Night and Day;</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who is the Fountain of all Mens Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Ocean of their Bliſs; not only in this World, but in that which is to come; even to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How ſweet is that Meditation, that is on the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord of Heaven, and on the Prince of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Glory?</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="350" facs="unknown:006297_0361_10285A3201A14838"/>4. No earthly Thing is to be compared with it; all the Glory, all the Pomp, and Vanity, of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, tranſitory World, is not comparable with it: Divine and inward Contemplation upon God, is no leſs than Heaven upon Earth to the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This mine Eye hath ſeen; for which I humbly bow before the great Lord of all; whoſe Goodneſs to Man cannot fully be ſet forth, neither by the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Orator, nor with a ready Writer's Pen.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. God delighteth in thoſe that are intent in looking unto Him; and it is Man's Duty to look to him, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all viſible Things.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. How profitable, and greatly advantageous, it is to the Soul, to be inward with God. Oh! it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether admirable.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The unſpeakable Treaſures of Life, and of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are to be found in inward Meditation, and holy Contemplation, on God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. When a Man, in this Sort, is delighting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Maker, and adviſing with Him, he can want no good Thing. In Days of old God was, now is, and ever will be, found by Man, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Concern of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. A Man in this State, will always curb high Thoughts of Self, as being in the Preſence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; for then he is truly ſenſible of his Preſence: Who is it that will vaunt, or carry himſelf loftily, when God is preſent, and he conſiders it.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Indeed the Preſence of the Almighty is every where, but many have loſt the Senſe thereof, for want of inward Thoughts on God, and ſtudious Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation on the King of Heaven, whoſe Sovereignty is ſweet over the Works of his Hands;</p>
                  <p n="12">12. He is full of Grace, and full of Truth, full of Mercy, and full of Juſtice: His Law is Light, and his Commands are as burning Lamps; in a Word, he is full of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Majeſty, and Divine Power, ſo that no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters can ſet forth the Fulneſs of God.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <pb n="351" facs="unknown:006297_0362_10285A3524B4E960"/>13. Oh! that Man were rightly ſenſible of theſe Things, it would cauſe him, with an humble Heart, to implore the Majeſty of Heaven for his Favour, and petition Him for the Aid and Aſſiſtance of his Grace, to do his holy and heavenly Will.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Man would then ſee his own Weakneſs and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and how unable he is to do, or work, any good Thing of himſelf, without the Help of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Which Gift God, through Chriſt, giveth to that Soul which is inward in its Thoughts upon God; whoſe Wiſdom and Power is paſt finding out, unleſs in this Frame of Mind the Lord reveals it.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But worldly Thoughts, and vain Cogitations, hinder the Mind from being with God, the Fountain of all Good.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Evil Works, or Words, alſo ſtupify the Mind, and deaden the moſt noble Part of Man, ſo that ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Fear, inſtead of that Fear which is mix'd with true Love and Honour, is begotten in the Heart.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. All Things of any evil Tendency entertain'd in the Soul, are an Obſtruction to its Duty to God.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Who would but lay up Treaſure in Heaven, that the Heart might alſo be there? And what Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure like that in Heaven, or what Place ſo fit to lay it in as that is?</p>
                  <p n="20">20. If a Man did but, with conſiderate Thoughts, weigh in his Mind the Shortneſs and Uncertainty of Time in this Life, and the boundleſs Ocean of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; with a Life of Bliſs and Glory, or elſe of Woe and Miſery, that will never end;</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Without his Heart be harder than a flinty Rock, it would lead him into Tenderneſs, ſerious Thoughts on the Name of God, and into Humiliation.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Chriſt Jeſus, the Anointed of God; was found greatly in Humiliation; even he who ſaid, <hi>Learn of me, and follow me, who am meek, and low in Heart.</hi>
                     <pb n="352" facs="unknown:006297_0363_10285A36AAE191D0"/>
God calls for Humility of all Men. He behold the Proud, and Scornful, afar off.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Every proud and exalted Thought God will bring to Judgment, and likewiſe ſuch Words and Actions.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And, indeed, the Thing acted, or done, muſt firſt be conceived, or thought, before it be brought forth; for <hi>out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> and the Man acteth.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Therefore to have the Thoughts of the Heart on God, and to contemplate on Heaven, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things, is truly excellent.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. And although this incumbent Duty of Man is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to him, in his natural State; yet it is moſt eaſy, ſweet, and pleaſant, to the Soul, when the Mind is bent after, and set on, heavenly Things.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. And that which is ſtill more admirable is, that God is the alone Comfort, Joy, Helper, Leader, and Conducter, of ſuch a Soul.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. But, Oh! the Thoughts of Man are too much taken up with earthly and periſhing Things, being content with the Shadow, or Shell, of Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, Righteouſneſs, and true Religion; ſo that too few are earneſtly ſeeking the Subſtance thereof.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. That the noble Creature Man, which God hath made but a little lower than the Angels, and given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="30">30. Which Way can the Soul look, or turn itſelf, but that it muſt needs ſee the Glory of the God of Heaven, unleſs the God of this World hath blinded the Eye of the Mind.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Look upwards, and we may behold the Brightneſs of his Glory in the Firmament, and the
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:006297_0364_10285A386280E6A8"/>
Workmanſhip of his Hands in the Sun, Moon, and Stars:</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Or if we look on the Earth, or in the Sea, we may ſee his great Wonders; and if, in Sincerity, we behold the heavenly Works of his Hands, with an Eye of Faith, Oh! how can it do any leſs but draw deep Conſiderations of the Omnipotence of God.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Thus, beholding the Works of God, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his Works of old, and the noble Acts which he hath done in former Times, will raiſe holy Deſires to be with Him, and to be in his Preſence, when Time to us, in this World, ſhall be no more.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. It will alſo beget a loving Fear of the Lord in the Soul, leſt that it ſhould offend Him.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Such a Soul will be inwardly concern'd before the Lord, and will ſeek Him with unwearied Travel of Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. After this Manner will that Soul cry to God, in the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication, that is travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards the City, whoſe Builder, and Maker, is God;</p>

                  <p>As there are many good Examples in Holy Scripture, whereby young People might be ſtirred up to Virtue; ſo alſo there are Examples of the Judgments of God on diſobedient, impious, vain and ungodly Men and Women, even Young and Old.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.10, 11, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.8.</note> Oh! let our Youth conſider (I beſeech them) wicked, diſobedient <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> and poor <hi>Dinah</hi>; alſo the Prince and the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abitiſh</hi> Damſel, whom zealous <hi>Phineas</hi> ſlew; for God was angry, and is angry with the Wicked every Day.</p>

                     <p>IT is a Thing truly excellent for Mortals to love,<note place="margin">1709.</note> ſerve, and fear Him that made them, and gave unto all Life and Being: And to begin this Work betimes, is very advantageous to the never dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul. It is alſo an indiſpenſable Duty, which is incumbent upon every one, Male and Female; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is found in the Neglect thereof, will certainly have Cauſe dearly to repent it, and unleſs they do repent before they go hence, and ſee Man no more, will be miſerable to all Eternity. Which ſolid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, hath often been weighty on my Mind, and I
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:006297_0377_10285A619E1F8088"/>
could not be clear (as I thought) in the Sight of God, without laying of it before Men and Women.</p>
                     <p>Now, that we may ſo do, conſider, Truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us, Reaſon perſuades us, and Example is very powerful and inviting. Oh! that the Children of Men would be wiſe to Salvation, and embrace the Love of God in his dear and well-beloved Son, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>John</hi> 14.6.</note> who himſelf ſaid, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</hi> Oh! ſurely here is a Three-fold Cord, (<hi>i. e.</hi> Truth, Reaſon and Example,) which is not eaſily broken: God Almighty grant (for Chriſt's ſake) that by it ſome poor Soul might be drawn to him even now in their tender Years: <hi>To Day, to Day</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if any will hear the <hi>Voice of the Lord,</hi> Oh! Let them not harden their Hearts; for that is provoking to him that made us. How know we whether he, who made the Heavens, will be pleaſed to give us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Hour? How know we, but that after this Day we may never open our Eyes, till we open them in Eternity? Oh Eternity, Eternity, that boundleſs Ocean! who can fathom thoſe Words, <hi>for Ever and Ever?</hi> What will this World, and all its Glories and Vanities ſignify, or avail to poor Souls, when rowling from Side to Side on a Dying-bed.</p>
                     <p>It will therefore be well for both Old and Young to note this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Old, becauſe it is not likely they ſhould have many Days, according to the Courſe of Nature, and a common Proverb, i. e. <hi>The Young</hi> (may live, and they) <hi>may die, but the Old muſt die.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Young, becauſe they know not but they may die To-morrow.</p>
                     <p>In the great and notable Day of the moſt High, Oh! then, then, heavenly Things will be found ſerious and ſolid Truths, and not Toys and Trifles, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Things; when <hi>He ſhall come as in Flames of Fire, to render Vengeance</hi> (which is only his) <hi>upon all the Workers of Iniquity, and ſhall come to judge the

Secrets of Mens Hearts by that great Man, and juſt Judge, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore, let me prevail with ſome poor Souls, now in time, to lay the Truth to Heart, and to be found in the Work of God in their Day: That ſo for their Pains here, they may receive their Penny hereafter; and that enlivening, that quickening Anſwer of <hi>Well-doing,</hi> may be their Portion, and the Lot (the glorious Lot) of their Inheritance: <hi>Come ye bleſſed;</hi>

His Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call'd him, and bid him go; he does it, without any Replies to the contrary; not like ſome of the Youth of this Age. And on his Way, being benighted, he lays himſelf down, his Pillow was hard, but his Bed large, and the Heavens was his Curtain; his Sleep was ſweet, and his Dreams precious.

In which Sleep he ſees <hi>Angels</hi>; and when he awakes, he ſays, <hi>Surely this is none other than the Houſe of God, and the Gate of Heaven.</hi> Now he makes the Conditions of his Covenant with his Maker, which (as to outward Things) was as ſmall as well could be, <hi>viz.

to ſet up for himſelf in the World, his Mind was not high, neither ſought he after great Things; notwithſtanding which, the Almighty gave him in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. So onwards he went, and came to <hi>Laban,</hi> and became his Servant. I could wiſh that all young People, that are Servants, would follow his Steps in Faithfulneſs; then might they be a Bleſſing to their Maſters, as he was to his. I ever obſerved in my Travels (having travelled much in divers Nations, and made many Obſervations) that Almighty God hath greatly bleſſed obedient, induſtrious Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: Which Obſervation, I hope, will be of good Uſe to the World, if well conſider'd. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, I have taken Notice of the contrary, and have perfectly underſtood, that God's Hand hath been manifeſtly againſt thoſe that have been diſobedient, and ill-natured, and idle; which may be an uſeful Caution to all. Now the Lord bleſſed the good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and faithful Induſtry, of this his Servant with great Increaſe; as alſo with many Children, for whom he was concerned as a tender Father, even to the very laſt: And (like a pious and godly Father) pray'd to the Lord for their Preſervation; and was zealouſly concerned to cleanſe his Family from Superſtition and Idolatry; and calls them to go up to <hi>Bethel,</hi> or the Houſe of God, Oh! that all Heads of Families, would be concern'd for their Poſterity, and ſeek God, and the Things of his Kingdom, for their Children and Servants, more than the Things of this World; there being too much Care for the one, and too little for the other, generally ſpeaking: So that there is Need of this Caution. Now this good Man was not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for his Family in his Life, but ever at his Death alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For he, waiting for the Salvation of God, and being ſenſible of it, very livingly and ſenſibly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Seed, and was opened in Faith to ſpeak exactly to each of their States and Conditions. I refer to the Hiſtory of it in Holy Scripture, the which I believe will
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:006297_0387_10282E299ABBA890"/>
be affecting to pious Minds. Oh! what a Race he left behind! All his twelve Sons were Patriarchs, and great Fathers of many People, who were highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of God, and had been to this Day, had they walk'd in the Steps of their Fathers <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> From whom came many valiant and noble Men, of and for God; as <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, David, Solomon, Joſiah, Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi>; alſo the Holy Bleſſed <hi>Star,</hi> and <hi>Sun of Rihgteouſneſs,</hi> Holy JESUS, whom the degenerate Offspring of good old <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſlew, and hanged on a Tree: Alſo the holy Apoſtles, were great Examples of Virtue: Alſo the bleſſed Martyrs, and many modern good Men, might be brought in for inviting Examples, to ſtir up the Minds of Men and Women, to ſerve, love, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lord, and to believe in Him, and in his dear Son, and in the Appearance of his Grace working in the Soul, in order to the convincing and converting of it.</p>

                     <head>The PREFACE to the READER, of what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion ſoever.</head>
                     <p>IT being a known Principle of the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> that the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt ought to be preached freely by his Miniſters; yet, notwithſtanding, divers People, of divers Perſwaſions, either for want of Charity, or through Prejudice, or wrong Information,
<pb n="ccclxxviii" facs="unknown:006297_0389_10285A8409BB2278"/>
or all three, do ſay, or believe, that the Quakers Miniſters or Teachers are paid for their Preaching; I do poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the World, that it is an utter Falſhood and Scandal upon the ſaid People: For we cannot in good Conſcience make a Trade of our holy Calling, neither is the Word of God to be bought or ſold for outward Gain; witneſs the Apoſtle's Anſwer to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts <hi>viii. 18, 20.</hi> And if we cannot pay our own, pray how can we pay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and be clear of Guilt, or have the Anſwer of a good Conſcience, we believing it to be Evil? And every Body that knows the Holy Scriptures, knows that <hi>what is not of Faith is Sin</hi>; and yet our Adverſaries would have us commit this Sin; and if we will not do it willingly, they will force it from us by the Power of the Magiſtrates, although the Holy Scriptures and Reaſon is clearly againſt them, as is plainly manifeſted in the enſuing little Tract.</p>
                     <p>And as for my Part, I have travelled many Thouſands of Miles, and preached the Goſpel among the ſaid People many Years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Thouſands of them can witneſs, and never received my Conſideration therefor, neither directly nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly; neither do I reckon they are beholden to me for ſo doing, for <hi>a Neceſſity is laid upon me,</hi> and <hi>woe is me if I preach not the Goſpel</hi>; neither do I boaſt, for I have done but my Duty, and in that Senſe am but an unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant, according as Chriſt taught, for all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is of Chriſt. And if Occaſion were, there are many other Miniſters among the ſaid People, could bear the like Teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oh, but</hi> (ſay the People) <hi>your Teachers are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally rich!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why ſhould any begrudge us that which we have, ſince the Almighty bleſſeth our Induſtry in our honeſt Trades and Callings, which other Teachers, through the like Induſtry and Bleſſing, might obtain, if their Dependency for a Maintenance were more upon God, than the People.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding thoſe Teachers receive ſo much Money of the People, and the Quaker Preachers none at all (except they are poor and neceſſitous) they are full of

                     <p>Chriſt's Miniſters of old, when he ſent them forth, they had no Law, and yet they lacked nothing; Is Chriſt or the Men changed now-a-days? The Men doubtleſs: For now they cry, More, more, mere Money: Let every true Chriſtian judge in this Matter.</p>

<q>That he thinks that there is ſufficient Matter of Conviction in the Texts and Arguments improved.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But every ſincere Soul, when they come to ſee the Texts themſelves, will have Cauſe to think to the contrary; for had they been fairly produced, they would have ſaved the Labour of a further Reply, they being far from countenancing any forced Maintenance to Chriſt's Miniſters. And as for his Arguments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, they ſmell ſo ſtrong of Perſecution, that I would charitably hope no ſober Chriſtian or Magiſtrate, who inclines to Moderation (which ought to appear in all) will take any further Notice of them, than to pity his Ignorance.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding his mighty Arguments and great Improvements, he gives them this Blow,
<q>He has but little hopes of his being convinced, (to whom he writes) becauſe of the Efficacy of Error and Deluſion, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He would have had more Reaſon to have writ ſo, if he had firſt proved Error and Deluſion upon him. And truly, he would have been greatly deluded, if he had believed that great Untruth, That forcing a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for a Goſpel Miniſter was warrantable from the Holy Scriptures; if he be ſober, and in his Wits, one would believe that he cannot (when he ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders of it) but be convinced that he is miſtaken.</p>
                     <p>And as for his Prayers, the Scripture ſays, <hi>We know that God heareth not Sinners:</hi> And that he is a Sinner, is plain, in wreſting and perverting the Scriptures, as he has done, and as I ſhall ſhow through the Help of Chriſt, my Lord and Saviour.</p>

                        <p>NOw,<note place="margin">1713.</note> pray let us obſerve what he ſays to the Matter in hand.</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. As to the Laws of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he ſays, <hi>The Laws of this Province require that the Inhabitants of each Town ſhall take due Care to be conſtantly provided with a</hi> Goſpel Miniſter: <hi>And that each Miniſter ſhall be ſufficiently ſupported and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Inhabitants of the Town.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That all the rateable Eſtates, and Inhabitants in the Town ſhall be aſſeſſed, and pay proportionable to ſuch Maintenance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And that ſuch as refuſe to pay accordingly, ſhall have their Proportion taken from them by Diſtreſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I ſhall not here diſpute the Injuſtice of this Law ſo largely as I might (only I muſt add, they have no ſuch Example from Chriſt nor the Apoſtles, with this Proviſo, that it is made amongſt a Society of Men for themſelves, and thoſe of their own Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) but if this is intended to force thoſe of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:006297_0393_10285B9C7B34CCA0"/>
and who cannot for Conſcience Sake join with them, believing them to be Antichriſtian Miniſters, (as to be ſure all ſuch are as go about to maintain ſuch Doctrine as this Prieſt <hi>Metcalfe</hi> doth, That it is warrantable from Scripture to force Maintenance for Miniſters) Pray would he be willing the Papiſts, or Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould take away from him by Force? Surely no: Then I ſay that it is an unjuſt Law, and far from the Nature of that Royal Law, which ſays, <hi>Do to all Men, as you would that they ſhould do unto you</hi>; Chriſt ſays, <hi>This is the Law, and the Prophets.</hi> And doubtleſs the Goſpel falls not ſhort of it (though this <hi>N. E.</hi> Miniſter doth) tho' I hope it is not the Mind of all in Profeſſion with him. Now the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unjuſt, it is no Crime to reject it: Yet for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Sake, and the Lord's Sake, we ſubmit to it in paſſive Obedience; and it is well known to all that know any thing of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that their Principle is againſt reſiſting the outward Power.</p>
                        <p>Next to the Queſtion, <hi>Whether it be Warrantable from Scripture, and the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to put ſuch Laws in Execution, to take from Men, altho' the Miniſter preaches not to them, for they cannot believe they are ſent of God?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is his great <hi>Queſtion,</hi> as he ſtates it in his firſt Page, which he pretends to anſwer from Scripture, but falls far ſhort of it; and he goes on thus:</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt, <hi>It is Warrantable from Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the Inhabitants of each Town ſhall take due Care, in order to their being ſupply'd with a Goſpel Miniſter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is as foreign from his Queſtion, as <hi>Rome</hi> is from <hi>Boſton.</hi> What is that to the Purpoſe? Let the Impartial judge; if he cannot prove a forced Maintenance from Scripture, he doth nothing to his Purpoſe, nor according to his grand Queſtion in his Title Page, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="383" facs="unknown:006297_0394_10282E47CF924C30"/>Then he goes on to his ſecond Aſſertion, and ſays,</p>
                        <p n="2">2dly, <hi>It is Warrantable from Scripture, that Goſpel Miniſters be honourably ſupported and maintained: Such Maintenance is a Debt due from the People to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in ſtrict Juſtice, and not as a meer Act of Charity: For it is the Hire of their Labour, and the Wages of their Work.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Hereby he owns himſelf, and all that are in his Practice, to be Hirelings, tho' he will not allow others to call him or them ſo; and quotes theſe Texts of Scripture to prove it, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.8. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7, 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17, 18. and adds as falſly, and ſays,</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>The Argument which the Apoſtle uſes for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles Miniſtring to the Jews, reaches this Caſe, Rom. <hi>15.27.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Surely the Man forgets himſelf, for tho Apoſtle only ſpoke of a free Collection for the poor Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as in the two foregoing verſes plainly appears, Verſe 25. <hi>But now I go to Jeruſalem to miniſter unto the Saints,</hi> Verſe 26. <hi>For it hath pleaſed them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution for the poor Saints at Jeruſalem.</hi> When will our greedy Prieſts take ſo much Care of the Poor?</p>
                        <p>As to the Texts of Scripture above quoted, I ſhall take the Pains to ſet them down at large, that the Reader may ſee how they anſwer his grand Queſtion: For what Purpoſe he concealed them (in his) in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, is beſt known to himſelf. Truly if he had ſet them down at large, it muſt needs have been plainly manifeſted, to every Body that ſhould read them, that he was in the wrong: For they aſſert no ſuch Thing, as he would have them to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Maintenance for Goſpel Miniſters. The firſt is <hi>Luke</hi> 10.7.
<q>And in the ſame Houſe remain eating and drinking ſuch Things as they give (What could be more againſt him?) for the Labourer is worthy of his Hire: Go not from Houſe to Houſe, and
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:006297_0395_10282E49578A7570"/>
into what City ye enter, and they receive you, eat ſuch Things as are ſet before you.</q>
Where is legal Force here?)</p>
                        <p>Let this Man have a care left he be one of thoſe that are blinded: For he muſt needs be blind, if he cannot ſee that this holy Text makes not for his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but directly againſt him; here is not a Word of legal Force. It is ſo far from it, that they were only to eat what was ſet before them, if they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them who were true Miniſters ſent of Chriſt, which yet will be hard Work for perſecuting Prieſts to prove themſelves ſo; be they of what Religion they may. Well, what ſhall we do for this legal Force? Why truly we cannot find it in the Goſpel, or the New-Teſtament. Chriſt came to fulfil the Law. and change the Prieſthood, and put an End to carnal Ordinances. But it may be <hi>Joſeph Metcalfe</hi> is an Old-Teſtament Man (as a certain <hi>N. E.</hi> Convert ſaid, on an Occaſion well known to ſome of them) if he be, and will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Letter of the Law, he muſt go to knocking down Oxen, and killing of Sheep, which Work I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they of his Cloth are generally too high for.</p>
                        <p>The next is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.8.
<q>I robb'd other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, taking Wages of them to do you Service.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Surely can any Body be ſo bold as from this Text to ſay that the Apoſtle made a common Practice of Preaching for Wages, as our modern Prieſts do now a days? I hope no Chriſtian will imagine from thoſe Words of the Apoſtle, that he was a Thief, or ſacrilegious Perſon, but only a Freedom of Speech, which he uſed to thoſe whom he loved, as in Verſe 11. is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed. It is a familiar Way of Expreſſion among ourſelves, where we know we may be free, when any Thing is given to us from our Friend, Oh I ſhall rob thee too much: To put any other Conſtruction upon the Apoſtle's Words, would be to make the Apoſtle a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Perſon, and a Robber, which is abſurd. But pray let him ſpeak fairly a little for himſelf, and he will
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:006297_0396_10282E4B0C71A758"/>
wipe off theſe Money loving Prieſts very handſomely. Verſe 7. <hi>I have,</hi> ſays he, <hi>preached to you the Goſpel of God freely.</hi> Oh! that cutting word <hi>freely,</hi> what ſhall we do with it? Tho' it was ſo near our legal Miniſter, yet he thought fit not to meddle with it, and in the 9th Verſe (juſt under, as the 7th juſt above, by which the poor Man is hedged in, how he will get out I know not) the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>And when I was preſent with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no Man.</hi> And tells them in the ſame Verſe, that he kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from being burthenſome to them, and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to keep himſelf ſo. We dare all thoſe that preach for Hire, and have Money for Divining, to come to ſuch a Reſolution. However, if they will not come to this good Reſolution, let them forbear abuſing and perſecuting thoſe that (by the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) are.</p>

<q>Who goeth a Warfare at his own Charges? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the Fruit thereof? Who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that thoſe which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Joſeph</hi> hath left out what he thought made againſt it, from the 8th Verſe to the 13th, and 15th, where ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, (though he had Power to eat and drink Verſe 4. at free Coſt, yet he doth not ſay any where, that he had Power to take it by Force, and we think it ought to be preached from an inward Neceſſity, and not for an outward Maintenance) <hi>I have uſed none of theſe Things, neither have I written thoſe Things, that it ſhould be ſo done unto me.</hi> I wiſh <hi>Joſeph Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calfe,</hi> and others in his Station, could ſay ſo honeſtly.</p>
                        <p>Now I may proceed to ſay ſomething to each Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular above, as it lieth in the holy Text.</p>
                        <p>And, 1ſt, <hi>Who goeth a Warfare at his own Charge?</hi> There are ſome, though very few, I could heartily wiſh that there were more that would follow his Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

that wrote it, who himſelf was one that did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do it, as there, when he wrought at his lawful Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and help'd thoſe that were with him: And bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, there are ſome who do go on in this holy War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of preaching the Goſpel in this Age of the World at their own Charge, who have nothing to boaſt of neither; for a Neceſſity is laid upon them, and Woe is unto them if they preach not the Goſpel. Though if any be poor, and want Help, we have nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, but are for helping of thoſe who can give a good Account of their Calling, and we are ſo free to do it, that we need no Forcing to it, nor no Law for it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2dly, <hi>Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the Fruit thereof?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Well, he that hath planted a Vineyard, let him eat the Fruit of it, and welcome; but let him leave other Folks Vineyards alone, left he be counted a Robber in the worſt Senſe; for if the holy Apoſtle robbed, it was by Conſent; but theſe Preachers now-a-days rob with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conſent, even Vineyards which they never planted, but would deſtroy if they could: Oh! high, baſe, and Antichriſtian Practice, with a Witneſs.</p>

And becauſe the poor Sheep of the true Shepherd Jeſus Chriſt, bleat forth thoſe Things, thoſe inwardly ravening Wolves, who have got only the Sheeps Cloathing outwardly, being known to be ſuch by their Fruits of Perſecution, will needs put the poor Sheep in their Pounds, when and

Oh! this Money, that is a loud Call indeed to our Men-made Miniſters: If at any Time there chance to be two Calls, I always obſerved that the higheſt Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der carried the Prieſt. But where ſhall we find that the Lord hath ordained that a Miniſter ſhall have fifty or an hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> (in all the holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords) for Preaching the Goſpel? No, our great High Prieſt ſaid to his, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give.</hi> But if it had been his Mind, he could as well, and with as great and as good Authority as any of theſe Men, have ſaid, If they will not give it you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, take it by Force. But thoſe Forcers know not of what Spirit they are of; if they do, they muſt needs be the greater Hypocrites, and ſo their Condemnation the greater.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="388" facs="unknown:006297_0399_10282E5614715A48"/>Gal. vi. 6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto him that teacheth, in all good Things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yes, let thoſe which theſe Men teach, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to them; for communicate and legal Force are Words of different Signification. I hope by this Time this Preacher's Eyes will be opened to ſee his Error, in Pleading for legal, forced Maintenance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially from Chriſt's and the Apoſtles Practice and Doctrine, as recorded in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>The next Text which he quotes is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 17, 18.
<q>Let the Elders which rule well, be counted worthy of double Honour, eſpecially they which labour in the Word and Doctrine; for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the Ox that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the Corn, and the Labourer is worthy of his Reward.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Very well, what is this to his legal Force? Here is nothing of it; thoſe that rule well, will not force any Body, nor ſet the Magiſtrates upon their Backs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot conform to their Ways; thoſe muſt be antichriſtian Teachers for certain, being oppoſite to Chriſt: For he indeed was perſecuted, but never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted any, nor forced any, tho' it was in his Power; for which Reaſon we cannot give thoſe Men that dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Honour which they deſire; and for thoſe who ſay they labour in the Word and Doctrine of our meek Lord, to ſet the Magiſtrates upon us, is wicked Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, inſtead of ruling well.</p>
                        <p>And as for the poor Ox that treads out the Corn, I am far from having him muzzled: But when he bites, and with his Horns puſhes the Sheep, and tramples the growing green Corn to Dirt, I think then he ought to be muzzled and hoppled too.</p>
                        <p>In his ſecond Page he ſays,
<q> 3dly, It is the Duty of every Inhabitant in a Town to pay proportionable towards Miniſters Maintenance.</q>
                        </p>

from Chriſt nor the Apoſtles to force, neither legal nor illegal) and are not free in the Choice of ſuch Miniſter: He runs too faſt there, without he is popiſhly inclined, to perſecute every Body into his Perſwaſion, which has been too much the Practice of ſome of the <hi>N. E.</hi> Magiſtrates and Miniſters. I may not here forget, though I forgive, the Salutation of a certain Perſon, when I firſt entered the Streets of their Metropolis of <hi>N. E.</hi>
                           <q>Oh (ſays he) what a Pity it was that they did not hang all the Quakers when they hanged the other four.</q>
Remarkable was the Anſwer that one of his Neighbours made him,
<q>I wonder you are not aſhamed to ſay ſo; for you know that the Judgments of God have been on our Country ever ſince.</q>
I mention this as a Caution to the <hi>N. E.</hi> Miniſters, that they would teach their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more Manners to their Neighbours, and to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and to let them know, that ſometimes the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-named People cannot be quiet in their ſolemn Meetings, for the Worſhip of Almighty God, in their chief Town of <hi>Boſton</hi>; which, as I underſtand, is very much owing to Lies and Reproaches which the People have from their Prieſts and Pulpits. All which is a Shame to moderate Chriſtians; ſome of which, of all Perſwaſions, I hope there are in the Country and Territories of <hi>New-England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For firſt, ſays he,
<q>None were exempted of old from paying of Tithes for the Maintenance of the Miniſtry.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>By his Leave, he is miſtaken, for thoſe that did not join with them in Circumciſion were exempted.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <q>2dly, Every Hearer ought to pay proportionable towards the Maintenance of the Preacher, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 6. And every Inhabitant ought to be a Hearer [what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Conſcience?] for it is Sin to forſake the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling themſelves together, <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 25. And one Sin can never excuſe another.</q>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> If I ſhould aſk him, he being a Preſbyterian, whether it be a Sin to forſake the Aſſemblies of the Papiſts, or Church of <hi>England,</hi> Baptiſts, or Quakers, and come to theirs, I preſume he would ſay no: Then to what a Non-plus he has brought himſelf and Brethren, eſpecially in <hi>Old England,</hi> for forſaking the Church, and ſetting up Meetings of their own: Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he has made them all Sinners in ſo doing; I do not know how his Brethren in <hi>N. E.</hi> will reſent it; but I dare ſay his Brethren in <hi>O. E.</hi> will give him no Thanks for this unlucky Turn; how he will excuſe himſelf in this Sin of Ignorance I know not. Would not this have been a topping Writer for the Papiſts when they burned the Proteſtants for not coming to Church?</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly, In Page 2d he ſays,
<q>The Apoſtle directs in Acts of Charity, that every one contribute in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as God had proſpered him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 2. And that there ſhould be Equality, every one bearing their equal Proportion of ſuch a Burthen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 13, 14.</q>
He goes on,
<q>Much more ought there to be a Proportion or Equality obſerved in the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Miniſtry, which is a Matter of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative Juſtice; ſo it was under the Law, and ſo it ſhould be under the Goſpel.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Notwithſtanding theſe Prieſts will bring thoſe Texts of Holy Scripture, that tend to promote Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Poor, and many Inſtances out of ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors for ſtirring up Charity to the Poor; yet they will not, when it comes to their Caſe, allow it to be as Charity, but a Debt; as ſaith our Author in his firſt Page: And <hi>J. Mather,</hi> in a little Book ſet forth to promote the Maintenance of their Miniſters, in which I obſerve he tells them,
<q>If they will ſtand to the old Law of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they muſt have but a Tenth of the Tenth;</q>
which I ſuppoſe will not ſatisfy thoſe Men that have Hire for Preaching, and Money for Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: And therefore I think it their beſt Way, to let
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:006297_0402_10285A91729B3EF8"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> old Law alone, and take to the new Law and Covenant of our Great Lord Jeſus.</p>
                        <p>And further, if they will bring Inſtances of Charity to the Poor, out of Scripture, and other Authors, let them be juſt, and always when they would make the Application of it to the Miniſtry, to put honeſtly the Word <hi>Poor</hi> before Miniſtry; <hi>viz.</hi> poor Prieſt, poor Miniſter; otherwiſe let them let fall their Argument for Charity for the Poor (which no good Chriſtian will go about to diſpute againſt) and ſee what their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Juſtice in the Caſe will do for them. They ſay it is a juſt Debt, a Matter of communicative Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but when People do not ſee Cauſe to commune with them, but quite the contrary, and buy none of their Ware or Merchandize, pray what Juſtice is there in this? Why truly none, but a great Deal of Injuſtice.</p>
                        <p n="4">4thly, He ſays,
<q>If any Man fail of doing his juſt Proportion, he thereby expoſes either the Miniſter to loſe ſo much of his juſt Due</q>
(but he falls ſhort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it a juſt Due)
<q>or the other Inhabitants to pay more than their juſt Proportion, and ſo he is guilty of manifeſt Wrong and Injuſtice.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>No, where the People are not conſenting (and if they were conſenting, the New-Teſtament is ſilent to any ſuch Way of maintaining Goſpel Miniſters) to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, but ſee an Evil in it; and there is no Force under the glorious Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as I have abundantly and clearly (to thoſe who are not blinded) proved above, even from the very Texts of Scripture which he brings and wreſts to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of which let the Impartial judge. Thus he and they building their Structure of Maintenance upon a bad Foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> Legal Force, it will fall to the Ground, if the Magiſtrates do not help; for whoſe Help he calls very loud, and well he may, conſidering he and others of his Mind are ready to faint and fall without it. But by what hath been ſaid, I would cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably hope, all moderate Chriſtian Magiſtrates will
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:006297_0403_10285A964AC4AEF0"/>
take Care that the Preachers eat only the Grapes of their own Vine, and the Milk of their own Flock, and keep ſo far juſt as to let other Folks Grapes and Milk alone. But if the Prieſts and Magiſtrates will join together in Perſecution, then will we poor Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers appeal from them to our great High Prieſt, and juſt Judge of Heaven and Earth, and through his Grace patiently ſuffer what he ſhall pleaſe to permit to come upon us.</p>
                        <p n="5">5thly, In his 3d Page he ſays,
<q>The publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel in any Town is a publick Privilege, and every Inhabitant is conſidered therein, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in the Privilege: For the Preaching of the Goſpel is the great Engine of Salvation, and Means of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 16. x. 17.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>If he means that there is no other Preaching the Goſpel but from his Sect, we openly declare to the World, that we differ from him in our Judgment, and we believe upon good Grounds too. And what Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or Glad Tidings (which the Word imports) can that be to People to preach to them, <hi>That a certain Number of them are eternally ordained for Damnation</hi>; and for ought theſe knowing Men know, they may themſelves be ſome of them; for they cannot tell who theſe damned Ones are. I think it would be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly better if thoſe prying Miniſters would let the ſecret Will of Him that made them alone; for that belongs to God, and not to Man. <hi>The revealed Truths belong to us, and our Children.</hi> And to tell People they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be free from the Act of Sin while in this World, is really miſerable News, and dreadful Tidings indeed; ſince Sin is the Cauſe of God's Wrath and Damnation, and ſince we cannot in Conſcience join with ſuch Anti-Goſpel Miniſters, they ought not in Conſcience to take our Money or Goods from us.</p>
                        <p>Again he ſays,
<q>Every one is invited to take of the Water of Life freely,</q>
                           <hi>Rev.</hi> xxvi. 17.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="393" facs="unknown:006297_0404_10285A97F8774E98"/>But, by their Leave, theirs is the Water of Death, if we muſt always ſin even in our beſt Duties, then he knows, that <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death</hi>; and may not any good Chriſtians be truly thankful when they are delivered from ſuch a ſinful Miniſtry? And what a Knock he gives himſelf in ſaying, <hi>We take of it freely,</hi> and his Pages are writ on purpoſe to make People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ought to pay for it, and that they may force it from them too. So we may plainly ſee, that their Waters, which proceed from them in ſuch bitter Streams, are the Waters of Death; becauſe we cannot have them freely, according to the Doctrine of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in the Holy Scripture, which he himſelf hath brought.</p>
                        <p>Again, whereas he ſays,
<q>Where there is no Viſion, or Preaching the Goſpel, the People periſh,</q>
                           <hi>Prov.</hi> xxix. 18.</p>
                        <p>This is contrary to what they ſay, when they teach that Viſion and Revelation is ceaſed.</p>
                        <p>He goes on,
<q>Being without God, without Chriſt, without the Covenant, they are in a hopeleſs, periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>If he would infer from theſe Words, that where there is no publick vocal Teaching the People periſh, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has been kinder than this Miniſter; for he has graciouſly promiſed, that he would teach his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple himſelf: <hi>The Children of the Lord are taught of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thine Eyes ſhall behold thy Teachers, who cannot be removed into a Corner,</hi> Iſa. xxx. 20. which cannot be meant of outward Preachers, for they are often removed into Corners, but God, Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit, cannot. And Chriſt promiſed to ſend the Spirit of Truth, which ſhould lead and guide into all Truth (not into Sin.) Now to ſay that ſuch who have not outward vocal Preaching periſh, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; and he muſt want Charity, and then all his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues in his Pulpit are but like ſounding Braſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="394" facs="unknown:006297_0405_10285A9B748CA300"/>But now, ſays he,
<q>Where the Kingdom of God is preached, every Man is at Liberty, and hath an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be preſſing into it</q>
(<hi>and I add, without paying for it</hi>) <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 16.
<q>But where the Kingdom of Satan is preached (<hi>which is Sin Term of Life</hi>) the People have Liberty to fly from it.</q>
Further he ſays,
<q>If any refuſe the Counſel of God againſt themſelves, it is their own Fault.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> If any do ſo, it is their own Fault indeed; but to refuſe the evil Counſel of a ſinful Miniſter, is a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and no Fault at all.</p>
                        <p>Again,
<q>They have a Price put in their own Hand, although being Fools, they have no Heart to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>We are willing to be counted Fools by ſuch Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; but let him know, that Wiſdom himſelf ſaid, <hi>He that will be wiſe, muſt firſt become a Fool.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He proceeds, and ſays,
<q>It was a Privilege to them that were invited to the Marriage of the King's Son, though they made light of the Invitation, and would not come,</q>
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thoſe that rightly come to the Marriage of the King's Son, the Lamb of God that takes away the Sins of the World, muſt put off the Garment ſpotted with the Fleſh, left it be ſaid to them, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having on the Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Let every true Chriſtian fear, left he bring on himſelf that awful Sentence, <hi>Depart from me all ye that work Iniquity, I know you not</hi>; notwithſtanding they had eat and drank in his Preſence, and in his Name they had caſt out Devils, and done many wondrous Works, and he had taught in their Streets; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, becauſe they were found in the Acts of Sin, they muſt depart from him.</p>
                        <p>Now, ſays he,
<q>Every Inhabitant partaking in the publick Privilege of a Goſpel Miniſtry, Reaſon and Juſtice requires, that every one ſhould bear a Part of
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:006297_0406_10285A9EC64404E8"/>
the external Charge, in order to the Maintenance of it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> But every Perſon not partaking of what he calls ſo, and believing that, as theſe erroneous Prieſts preach it, to be a Bondage, and not a Privilege; to force ſuch to pay too, is altogether unreaſonable, and great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; let all ſenſible Chriſtians judge.</p>
                        <p n="4">4thly, He ſays,
<q>It is warrantable from Scripture, that ſuch Inhabitants as refuſe to pay any Thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Support of the Miniſtry, ſhould have their juſt Proportion taken from them by legal Diſtreſs.</q>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> We want him, or any of his Brethren, to ſhew us that Warrant from Holy Scripture; for he hath not done it yet: And where ſhall we find that it is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable from Scripture, and the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? For what he has produced from Holy Scripture, has fairly proved to the contrary; and as for his <hi>Legality,</hi> that great Word, 'tis only what others of his Spirit have pleaded in former Ages. Did not <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> perſecute the Servants of God by a Law? Could not they ſay they ſuffered legally?

                        <p>
                           <hi>Oh, but</hi> (ſay our modem Teacher, who have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for it) <hi>we hope you will not compare us Chriſtians to</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Heathens.</p>
                        <p>Why not, if found in their Practices? For when once People go to perſecute others for their conſcientious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it is moſt certain they go from the Spirit of Chriſt, as may fairly be proved from Chriſt's own Expreſſions; and doubtleſs all Perſecutors are Antichriſts, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their fine Gilding of it over with the Words, <hi>Legal Diſtreſs,</hi> and <hi>Proſecution.</hi>

<q>For it is a juſt and legal Debt, as has already been proved</q>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> But unjuſt and illegal to thoſe that cannot for Conſcience Sake conſent to it, and therefore 'tis a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in him to ſay, 'It has already been proved;' for he hath not, nor can he prove it (to force any by a coercive Power) to be conſonant to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                        <p>In Page the 4th he ſays,
<q>God has given his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters a juſt Right to ſome Proportion of every Man's Eſtate, in the Place where they miniſter.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>What, <hi>Jews, Heathens,</hi> and all? What, every Man whatſoever? Where proves he that?

                        <p>He goes on further, and ſays,

                        <p>Then their Doctrine muſt ſtarve the Peoples Souls, or elſe ſurely they would not let their Bodies ſtarve: That muſt needs be a lifeleſs, dull, dead Miniſtry, that will not open Peoples Hearts, ſo as to keep the Preachers from ſtarving; but I think there is no Fear of their ſtarving, for they generally live like Lords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People.

                           <q>All the Laws of God do ſweetly harmonize both one with another, and the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; there is no Manner of Jarr between any of theſe.</q>

<q>they muſt be forced, to it, whether they will or no.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the divine Nature of Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſays, <hi>Freely you have received, freely give.</hi> Matt. x. 8. If their Goſpel is not free, they have not received it from Chriſt. Alſo, if they have not received it freely, they may call it their own Goſpel, but it is not Chriſt's. And tho' Chriſt's Miniſters had Power to eat and drink, and to forbear, working, yet, ſays the divine Nature in the Apoſtle, <hi>I have uſed none of thoſe Things; neither do I write, that it ſhould be ſo done unto me,</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 15.

Miniſters taken by Force, within theſe fifty Years, from ſuch as for Conſcience Sake, could not put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Mouths; and then War has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt thoſe poor Sheep. Well, let the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judge, not the Self-Righteous (I do not mean them) but thoſe which are cloathed upon with the Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as He wrought it outwardly for them, and alſo as He works it by his Holy Spirit, in their Hearts.</p>
                        <p>Next to his 3dly, Touching Government and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, which the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> ever own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and honoured in their Way, though they could not cringe, ſcrape and bow, after the common Mode of the ſinful Times, nor give Titles to them in Flattery: But we reckon that thoſe Magiſtrates that are a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to Hypocrites and Evil-doers, ought to have a hearty inward Reſpect and Honour ſhown to them generouſly in Action and courteous Expreſſion, and not in a Parcel of idle Compliments. Such Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates as the above, were never a Terror unto us, but we have bleſſed God on their Behalf in our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſemblies publickly, and alſo often in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of our, Souls privately; and many times prayed for our Perſecutors alſo. I wiſh this Prieſt be not too much inclining to ſuch. May his Eyes be opened!</p>
                        <p>He goes on, and endeavours to animate and ſtir up the Magiſtrates to Perſecution, by inſinuating, that thoſe who for Conſcience Sake cannot give any Thing to the Prieſt, are evil, unjuſt and wicked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; who, notwithſtanding, take them in a general Way, and their Converſations are as juſt as the brighteſt of their Church Members, as divers of themſelves are forced to acknowledge.</p>
                        <p>If for this Teſtimony to our Innocency, any ſhould imagine we boaſt, it is he, and ſuch as he, that are the Occaſion of this confident Boaſting, and we have our great Apoſtle, even <hi>Paul,</hi> for our Example.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="400" facs="unknown:006297_0411_10285AADC3042010"/>Now I hope the Magiſtrates will take Care not to perſecute the Juſt, but to turn the Edge of their Swords againſt the Evil-doers; and then doubtleſs they will not bear their Swords in vain, and let the Edge of it be as ſharp and keen as it will, we fear it not: For againſt true Men there is no Law (which is upon a juſt Baſis or Foundation) that will harm them.</p>
                        <p>I tenderly and lovingly, as a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and true Lover of good Government, exhort and warn all Magiſtrates to be careful to keep within their own Province: For <hi>Conſcience</hi> is none of theirs; it is the peculiar Province of Jeſus Chriſt; the great Territory of the King of Kings, and Judge of the Quick and Dead; and he will render unto every Man a Recompence.</p>
                        <p>Now if Conſcience were only a Cloak for Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it ought to be ſtript off, but it is plain that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be our Caſe: For we loſe much more by our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial (and ſometimes a great deal more, than as much more) by our not paying freely, as is above ſaid. But we may (I hope) preſume that the Magiſtrates know their Duty, without being taught it from the Pulpit: I would have no free-ſpirited Magiſtrate to let Prieſts ride them: For if they do, it is to be doubted they will ride them to Death: For perſecuting Men of their Cloth, ſeem to have but little Mercy. I once heard a Prieſt ſay to a Couple of Juſtices (a <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Preacher for Money, but as himſelf ſaid to ſome of his Neighbours, a <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> in his Heart) <hi>Do your Office,</hi> which was upon my poor Self, who had been preaching againſt Sin and Evil, according to the beſt of my Underſtanding (why what's the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?) <hi>He has been preaching,</hi> ſays the Prieſt, <hi>in a Place not Licenc'd, and has broke the Law. Well,</hi> ſays ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juſtice beſide the aforeſaid two, <hi>Then you have broke the Law firſt, for you preached there before him</hi>; and tho' it was our Meeting by Appointment, yet we
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:006297_0412_10285AAF95D90480"/>
quietly heard him read his Sermon, and I dare ſay, he never had quieter Hearers in all his Days than we were.</p>
                        <p>And indeed Reading is the general Practice of ſome modern Teachers, far from the Practice of Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and primitive Chriſtians, when Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity ſhone in its primitive Beauty and Glory, and when Chriſtians depended more upon the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt (or Spirit) and leſs upon natural Parts and human Inventions, which is worthy of the ſolid Conſideration of all true Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>I have alſo obſerved that thoſe Magiſtrates which have joined with perſecuting Prieſts in perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men of ſober Lives and Converſations for their religious Diſſent and Perſwaſion, that they have not proſpered; and many ſober People, not of our Society, have taken notice of the ſame. This is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſerious Conſideration of Men of high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree (in Reverence and great Humility.)</p>
                        <p>And tho' <hi>J. M.</hi> flatters the Magiſtrates, telling them, they bear the viſible Image and Character of Gods, in order to flatter them into a perſecuting Spirit, yet I hope, and believe, that he will not find many Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates nor Miniſters of his Mind: For if all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Miniſters in <hi>N. E.</hi> were as much for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution as he ſeems to be by his writing, what might all thoſe expect, who differ from the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Way in <hi>N.

But bleſſed be God, I certainly know that there are divers moderate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are againſt Perſecution, even amongſt the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi>

                        <p>In his 8th Page, he brings divers Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prove the Power of the Magiſtrates, which we never denied, eſpecially when he exerciſes his Power and Authority to the Terror of Evil-doers, and the Praiſe of them that do well.

He ſpeaks of Submiſſion to better Judgments, and I would have him, if he dare to do it, ſubmit to the Judgment of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who I think have fairly decided the Queſtion in favour of the poor abuſed <hi>Quakers,</hi> that it is not according, but contrary to the Language of the Holy Ghoſt, in the Holy Scripture, that Goſpel Miniſters Maintenance ſhould be forced by a coercive Power.

I Query, upon this great Word <hi>Call,</hi> whether the Sheep uſe to call the Shepherd, or the Shepherd the Sheep? Do not they ſtrangely invert the Order of Nature here in their pretended Call from the People? Chriſt the true Shepherd ſaid, <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice.</hi> So that He and his Servants, or Miniſters, call the Sheep, and not the Sheep them; and thoſe holy Shepherds called their Sheep freely, though theſe muſt have Money for their Calling, and the Sheep call them too: Neither will that ſatisfy ſome of thoſe Shepherds, but they will needs have Money from ſome poor Sheep that never called them; and if they cannot give it them freely, they will have it by Force. A young Shepherd ſaid to one at <hi>Salem</hi> in <hi>N. E. That tho' Paul had Power, and did not uſe it, yet he would uſe his Power.</hi> But that bleſſed Apoſtle never pretended to any forcible Power, except the Force and Power of Love.</p>
                        <p>He, the ſaid <hi>J. M.</hi> complains of his ſmall Income for Preaching, and of his Poverty; tho' it is probable he has more than all the twelve Apoſtles, and ſeventy Diſciples, when they were ſent forth by their great Lord and Maſter; and to be ſure he has more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for Preaching, than they all had. But he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his Call is not Divine, therefore not from Chriſt; for <hi>he ſays,</hi>
                           <q>If he had a divine Call, he could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go

every Thing in the World.</q>
And ſo he is but a legal literal Preacher, and Miniſter: A Miniſter that forces himſelf to offer, and would alſo force thoſe who receive not his Offering, to pay him, tho' againſt their Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>And as for his Family's Starving, I never heard nor read of any Chriſtian Miniſter's Family's Starving, eſpecially in a Chriſtian Country; nor I believe he nor any Body elſe. Certainly there is need to cry out to thoſe Men, <hi>O ye of little Faith! Who cloaths the Lilies, and feeds the Sparrows, ſhall be not take Care of you? O ye of little Faith!</hi> I fear they forget the Doctrine of Him, whom they ſometimes call the Lord.</p>
                        <p>As to what he writes in his ſecond Page of his Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, if he duly minds what I have writ in anſwer to his, I think he cannot imagine that the flaming Vengeance there poured out by him upon us, can any way touch us; but let him and them which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Work (for I underſtand he had the Help of a cunning Man in this Work) have a Care, that it fall not on themſelves: And truly the poor <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> may be truly thankfull that the flaming Sword is not in their Hands; for if it were, Experience, yea, woful Experience, hath taught us, that we might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but little Mercy from ſome of them. And pray why cannot they be more patient, ſince they hold that God hath ordained whatever comes to paſs? For they ſee it come to paſs that we cannot join with them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not they let the Ordinance of God alone? I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber an Expreſſion of <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> in one of his ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Pieces, that the beſt Way to deal with the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> was to let them alone. Then, according to <hi>C. M.</hi> this Man, and he that helped him, has taken the worſt Way to deal with us: And truly they loſe Ground generally when they meddle with us.</p>
                        <p>As for his fooliſh Pity and bitter Lamentation over us, we deſire that they would lament over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Children, as our Saviour did over the <hi>Jews</hi>
                           <pb n="407" facs="unknown:006297_0418_10285AC5334FB630"/>
when they perſecuted; and truly thoſe who juſtify their Fore-fathers in Hanging the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their other Ways, of ſo bitterly perſecuting them as they did, had not only need to lament, but to repent too. And even now, they prove themſelves to be the Perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (and not we) by Forcing their Maintenance from us. The <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> in <hi>O. E.</hi> alias <hi>Great Britain,</hi> they are one with us in this Doctrine, that Forcing a Maintenance for Miniſters from them that do not hear them, is altogether wrong and unjuſt: And how comes it to paſs, that the ſame People are otherwiſe minded in <hi>New-England?</hi> Let them reſolve this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall conſider thoſe Texts of Scripture which he has thrown at us (and gently return them unto him again.)</p>
                        <p>At the End of his Poſtſcript <hi>he ſays,</hi>
                           <q>The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are a great Deep.</q>

                        <p>He goes on, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 10, 11, 12. <hi>They received not the Love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved; and for this Cauſe, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſion, that they ſhould believe a Lie; that they all might be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who believed not the Truth, but had Pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs.</hi> And <hi>Jude</hi> 8, 10, 11, 12, 13.

                     <p>But the greateſt End I had in this Undertaking was, That the Profeſſors of the Name of Holy JESUS might live and walk in his Truth, and in the Doctrine which he has there laid down for his Followers to practice; and that

in ſo doing, they might have Peace to their Souls here, and Reſt in the Kingdom of Glory for ever.</p>
                     <p>It is by ſome accounted and lock'd upon in Youth to be a commendable and worthy Practice to write down Sermons, and to copy and read them over: And, I believe, it will be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged, that there was never any Sermon preached in the World, that can be compared with this of Chriſt, which he preached in the <hi>Mount,</hi> and is recorded by the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew,</hi> in his <hi>5th, 6th,</hi> and <hi>7th</hi> Chapters; which if our young and riſing Generation would often read, and ſometimes write it down (if Time would admit) but be ſure to take Care to practiſe it; this would be truly noble in them; and which if they find they want inward Strength to perform, then that they would ſeek it in Secret at the Hand of the Almighty <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> in whom is everlaſting Strength; and 'tis recorded in Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The Chriſtian Religion being run into many Diviſions and Sub-diviſions, this Holy Sermon, if Chriſtians would walk according to it, might and would help to heal their Differences, and to ſoften them in their Sentiments one of another.

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for Righteouſneſs-Sake, is not fit for <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> much leſs for the Profeſſors of our meek Lord; his Diſpenſation and Goſpel being abſolutely the Reverſe to it, which is a ſhameful Sin to all Men, in all Nations: But however, the Perſecuted have this Comfort in the Midſt of all their Sufferings, they are bleſſed of Chriſt their Lord; who himſelf ſuffered for them, and are promiſed by him the Kingdom of Heaven. By which Doctrine, it may be ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the Members of his true Church never perſecuted any, though they have been often perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by many, as the large and voluminous Books and Tracts (of perſecuting for Religion) now extant, do plainly make appear; by which the Eyes of many are open to ſee the Uglineſs of it; and a Spirit of Moderation begins to grow and ſpring a little in the Earth, in divers Parts thereof.</p>

                     <p>The Chriſtian Religion, in its Purity, according to the Doctrine of the Founder of it, is a compaſſionate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and full of Pity, as well as Piety; it is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Compoſition of Charity, and Goodneſs.

We ſhould be good to All, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Chriſt's Members, or the Houſhold of the Faithful Keepers of his Commandments; and Alms-deeds have the Approbation of Goodneſs from the univerſal Teſtimony of all Men, in a general Way.

This is Chriſt's Order for particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a general Way; but is not intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch who are rightly concern'd to pray in the publick Aſſemblies, or Gathering of the Church; for we have Chriſt for our Example, who prayed open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and publickly with his Diſciples.</p>

                     <p>Our kind and tender Redeemer would ſtir up and provoke Souls to Prayer and Supplication; he has been liberal in his holy Advice; and to ſtir us up to it, here are moving Expreſſions, if thy Heart be open to receive them: Can we have eaſier Terms if we were to make them ourſelves with the Lord, than to aſk, and have; ſeek, and find; knock, and the Gates are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; provided we aſk in Faith tenderly, and ſeek in Humility, and knock with Divine Wiſdom and Submiſſion? Our Lord's own Practice ſhews that we ſhould be tender, ſubmiſſive, and ſervent in Prayer; and then the ſervent Prayer of the Righteous availeth much with the Lord. Chriſt urgeth us to it, and brings ourſelves for Example; <hi>What Man is there among you, who if his Son aſk Breed, or a Fiſh, will he give him a Stone, or a Serpent?</hi> Surely no: No Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would deal thus with his Child; But when his Child is hungry, and wants and aſks Bread, he gives it to him: So when the Almighty ſees our Hunger, and we tenderly ſeek Divine Aſſiſtance and Refreſhment from Him, He, in his own Time, ſatisfies ſuch Souls with Bread from above, and the Thirſty with Living Water out of the Wells of Salvation: Oh! bleſſed be his Holy Name for evermore. Evil Men know how to give good Things to their Children, therefore we may well conclude that our heavenly Father knows how to give with much more Diſcretion and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the good Things of his Kingdom, to true, aſking, ſeeking, knocking, or praying Souls.</p>
                     <p>Verſe 12. <hi>Therefore all Things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi>

We are generally apt to ſay, when any One doth Ill to another, "Would he be willing to be ſo ſerved himſelf?" And if we followed this Rule in all our Concerns, it would be well; whether in Relation to publick or private Buſineſs; whether in Trade or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or in our domeſtic Affairs: The Law and the Prophets point at it, and our Saviour plainly lays it down for a Rule for us to walk by.</p>
                     <p>Verſe 13. <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait Gate; for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way, that leadeth to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and many there be which go in thereat.</hi>

                     <p>It is afflicting to conſider how natural it is for Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to walk in this broadWay, and they who walk in it are many; for here is Room for People to walk if they are Proud, Whoremongers, Adulterers, Thieves, Swearers, Liars, Drunkards, Covetous or in any other evil Courſe of Life, this broad Way hath Room enough in it for them to walk in; but let them know, it leadeth to Deſtruction, and the End is eternal Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and their many Companions will adminiſter no Conſolation to them, when they lift up their Eyes in Hell. And whereas the Way that leads to Life, is called ſtrait; it is only ſtrait to Fleſh and Blood, or the Will of unregenerate Men: Oh! 'tis a pleaſant Way, exceeding pleaſant,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The great Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls, ſhews the Care which he takes of his Sheep, and forewarns them to be careful of falſe Prophets, and Deceivers; who though they may clothe themſelves with Words like the true Ones, yet inwardly they would deſtroy all that do not join with, or receive them; and they are for biting the poor harmleſs Sheep of Chriſt, and if they could, or it were in their Power, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them, their Minds being in the ravening Nature. But our Holy, and All-wiſe Biſhop, that we might be preſerved from them, tells us how we may infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly know them: Saying, <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their Fruits,</hi> giving us to underſtand, the Reaſonableneſs of his Doctrine and Aſſertion of knowing <hi>them by their Fruits. Do Men gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thiſties,</hi> ſays Chriſt? Surely No. That is altogether unnatural, as well as unreaſonable and impoſſible. In the Grape there is a ſweet and pleaſant Nouriſhment, theſe Fruits being cordial and wholeſome; but it is bad
<pb n="459" facs="unknown:006297_0470_10285B683AE10368"/>
meddling with Thiſtles and Thorns, they being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very unprofitable to Mankind, and hurt the good Seed, wherever they grow among it. Well, where muſt we go for the Grapes, and the Figs? To be ſure we muſt go to the Vine, and the Fig-Tree: Chriſt is the Body of this Vine, and his People are the Branches, who bring forth ſuch Fruit (according to the Divine Life or Sap which they receive) as he taught, and teaches, to his Followers. So that if Mens Words be like the Words of Angels, if they have never ſo great Parts and Endowments; yet if their Fruit be evil, if they live in Sin, and do Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and bring forth the Fruits of Malice and Rage, or devouring Perſecution, they then are none of Chriſt's Sheep, though they my have their Clothing: <hi>For every good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit; and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit.</hi> So if the Fruit be evil, the Tree is certainly corrupt. Our Lord elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaith, <hi>Make the Tree good,</hi>

                        <hi>and the Fruit will be good alſo</hi>; and to be made truly good (ſince we are all corrupt by Nature, and in the Fall) we muſt be cut off from that Nature, and grafted into Chriſt, who ſaid, <hi>I am the Vine, and ye are the Branches:</hi>

                           <hi>John</hi> 15.5.</note> And then our Lives and Fruits will be changed. And then, <hi>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, nor can a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup Tree bring forth good Fruit: And every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the Fire.</hi> It would be very unnatural, and a meer Prodigy, for one Tree to hew down another, and caſt it into the Fire, as they are natural Trees:<note place="margin">

This is not a deſtroying the Bodies of Men that Chriſt ſpeaks of but an inward work in the Soul, ſhewing the powerful Nature of the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is not material Cutting, or Burning with material Fire, or Sword: But Chriſt's Word is a Fire

                     <p>It is not our Profeſſion that will give us Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into Heaven, nor a Name of Religion, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Performances, if we love Sin and Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor our praying, preaching, hearing, reading or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of, or arguing for Chriſt, if we do the Works of Satan; for there are many who may yet go farther than this, and yet not have Admittance into the Kingdom of God and our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, as is plainly manifeſt in the next Verſe.</p>
                     <p>Verſe 22. <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that Day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt cut Devils, and in thy Name have done many wonderful Works?</hi>

that truly, that all theſe proceed from the Devil, who is an evil Spirit; yet it may alſo be ſaid, that there are many evil Spirits; and if all theſe evil Spirits are caſt out of Man, and others of an evil Nature enter him again, his laſt State is worſe than his Beginning, as Chriſt ſpeaks about the ſtrong Man armed, who kept the Houſe till a ſtronger than he came, who,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.45.</note> when he came, ſpoiled his Goods, and diſpoſſeſſed him; but coming again found the Houſe (or Heart) ſwept and garniſhed, ſwept from many Immoralities, and garniſhed with Self-righteouſneſs and carnal Security; and the Man off his Watch, and not at home with Chriſt, who is ſtronger than Satan, he then re-enters, and ſeven worſe Spirits with him. So that we had need to be on our Watch, and keep near to Chriſt, leſt after all our Experience, and wondrous Works, our laſt State be worſe than our Beginning, and we ſhut out of the Kingdom in the End. For theſe ſay, that they had done many wonderful Works in Chriſt's Name: So that we may work miraculous Things, and be ſenſible of wonderful Power and Strength from Chriſt; and yet, without perſevering in the Way of Holineſs and Self denial, may fall ſhort of Heaven. Wherefore it is bad, and of dangerous Conſequence, to live in Sin and Iniquity; or to lean towards it, ſo as to plead for it, or believe we cannot live without it while in this World. For if we live and die in it, we may juſtly (according to the above Doctrine, of Chriſt) expect that he will ſay unto us in the great Day; <hi>Depart from me, ye that work Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>

AS to the Reading the Holy Scriptures, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther privately or openly, that I am not againſt, but would encourage it in all Chriſtians and true Believers in Chriſt, and we ought to excite one another thereto, and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to put in Practice what we read to be our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, otherwiſe the holy Letter will kill (as ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 6.) which is to be underſtood when we practice contrary to what we read therein. As for Example, where our Lord ſaith, <hi>Every idle Word that Man ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give Account thereof, in the Day of Judgment,</hi> Matt. xii. 36. Again, "God will not hold him guiltleſs, that taketh his Name in vain." <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7. "That Servant that knew his Lord's Will, and did it not, ſhall be beaten with many Stripes," <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 47. Theſe, and many more Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Holy Scripture, are condemning and killing to thoſe who live in Sin and Evil, which the Letter is abſolutely againſt, and without true Repentance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Amendment of Life, though the Holy Bible be read every Day, it will but add to our Condemnation. But if People truly repent of the Evil of their Ways, and awake to Righteouſneſs, and ſin not, as the Holy Scriptures themſelves hold, and
<pb n="467" facs="unknown:006297_0478_10285B829BB17E28"/>
Chriſt taught, then unto ſuch Souls they are a rich Treaſure, and as a Cabinet full of precious Jewels, "able to make the Man of God wiſe to Salvation, through Faith" in Chriſt (by the Influence of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt or Spirit) It is not the Reading (divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Writings, or) the Bible, which is ſcrupled; but the formal Reading of formal compoſed Prayers and Songs, at ſet Times, inſtituted by ſuch whoſe Principle is, that there is now no Divine Revelation, and that we can't live without ſinning, while we are in this Life, according to the Tenor of the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; holding, that we ſin as long as we live, as if God's Power were not ſtronger to preſerve out of Sin, than the Devil is to keep us in Sin, contrary to the Work and Doctrine of the Holy Apoſtles, who were ſent of God to turn People from Satan's Power, to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God; whoſe Glorious, Eternal Power, is above the Power of Sin, Death, and the Devil.</p>
                  <p>In the Common Prayer ſome unſound Words, and alſo ſome Scripture Expreſſions, perverted to a wrong Uſe, I would a little open, or write a few Words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning.</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> "As to that Expreſſion in the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that we are miſerable Sinners."</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> "And that we are full of Bruiſes and putrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sores."</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> "And from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, there is no Soundneſs in us."</p>
                  <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> "And that we have left undone the Things which we ought to do, and do thoſe Things which we ought not to do; and this to be repeated for Life."</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> then, If People muſt be miſerable Sinners all their Days, to what End did Chriſt come into the World and preach the Goſpel, and ſuffer Death, the painful Death of the Croſs? Did he not come to put an End to Sin, and to deſtroy the Works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, whoſe Works are Sin? Did he not preach againſt Sin, both within, and without? Witneſs the 5th, 6th,
<pb n="468" facs="unknown:006297_0479_10285B842198FF78"/>
and 7th Chapters of the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew.</hi> Yea, his Birth, Life, Preaching, Suffering, Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and Aſcenſion into Glory, were all againſt Sin, the Devil, Death and Darkneſs, and all the Works and Deeds thereof. Chriſt died for our Sins, and we ſhould die to them, and live to him: He came to ſave us from the Act of Sin, as well as the Imputation of it; and takes away the Guilt of Sin, on Condition of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Amendment of Life, as the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles do largely and plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, as any who are come to the Years of Diſcretion, and who can but read the Holy Scriptures, may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever Things are holy, whatſoever Things are pure, juſt, and of good Report, ſeek after thoſe Things.</hi> And again, <hi>No unclean Thing can enter the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; but certainly all Sin is unclean. Read over the Holy Scriptures, from the Beginning to the End, their Nature and Tendency is againſt all Sin; and as it is true, that we all have been Sinners, ſurely therefore all true Chriſtians, and true Believers in Chriſt, have Cauſe reverently to bow, and to be truly and humbly thankful, that Chriſt, our great Lord, by his offering himſelf for us, hath taken away that Imputation; ſo that now through true Faith, and Belief in Chriſt, accompanied with true Repentance, and Amendment of Life, the Imputation of our former Sins is taken away; for which Cauſe we praiſe God, and adore his Eternal Majeſty for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> As to the Word <hi>miſerable,</hi> a Chriſtian may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be poor; but ſince Chriſt is come to make us happy and comfortable, through the Hope of eternal Salvation, in his Name and Power (as we are not to think ourſelves better than we are) ſo we cannot ſay nor think we are miſerable, unleſs we are without God and Chriſt; and then we are miſerable indeed; but no Mortal can be miſerable, who hath Chriſt; <hi>for he that
<pb n="469" facs="unknown:006297_0480_10285B85A742BC48"/>
hath the Son, hath Life</hi> (Eternal Life) <hi>abiding in him:</hi> To be truly in Chriſt, is to be truly happy; this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is as clear as the Sun at Noon-day, or as a Morning without Clouds: A Soul, when it comes to ſee itſelf undone without a Saviour, and ſee Sin to be exceeding ſinful, and is ready to cry to the Almighty, Lord, Help, or I periſh! Save me, or I am undone for ever! Then the Soul ſeeth itſelf miſerable; but it is for want of Chriſt: And when Chriſt is come into, or unto the Soul, then its Miſery vaniſheth, or flieth away; but from Day to Day, and Week to Week, yea, all the Days of one's Life; to be miſerable Sinners, is a miſerable Caſe indeed, deſtroying the very Nature of Chriſtianity: Wherefore, ſome tender, conſcientious Souls, cannot join with ſuch miſerable Sinners and Sayers, who neither ſay nor do that which they ought.</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> As to theſe Sayings, <hi>We are full of Bruiſes and putrifying Sores, from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, and that there is no Soundneſs in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Can any Congregation of ſuch People as theſe (if they ſay truly, and if they do not ſay truly, what will the Conſequence be, let the wiſe in Heart judge) can, I ſay, ſuch a people be the Church of Chriſt, or his Spouſe, or beautiful Bride? Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If the Inſide be clean, the Outſide will be clean alſo</hi>; And he came to cleanſe the Souls of poor Mortals, and to heal them, and waſh them from Sin, and doth it by his ſpiritual Baptiſm, and the Fire of his Word; alſo the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Church and People, contrary to this putrified and unſound, conſtant and continual Confeſſion, do both <hi>promiſe and vow, that they will forſake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, and walk in God's Holy Will and Commandments, all the Days of their Lives:</hi> The very higheſt Pitch of Perfection any Man or Chriſtian can attain in this Life! and yet contrary to thoſe Vows and ſolemn Covenants, they tell the Almighty, from Time to Time, that they are unſound,
<pb n="470" facs="unknown:006297_0481_10285B89437F2828"/>
nay, that there is no Soundneſs in them; but that they are putrified from Head to Foot (as above) and by their common Practice intend to tell Him ſo as long as they live in this Life: This is unſound Work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: And truly thoſe who are tenderly conſcientious, may well ſcruple to join with it, or with thoſe who are in ſuch Ways, Words and Works.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe bruiſed, putrified, ſore and unſound Souls, are therefore tenderly, in Chriſtian Love, adviſed to come to Chriſt, the Phyſician of Value, and great Doctor of the Soul, that he may heal them, and waſh their ſinful, putrified Souls, and unſound Hearts, "by the Waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of his Word and Spirit." <hi>Ye are clean through the Word which I have ſpoken unto you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> xv. 3. They were cleanſed, by putting his Word in Practice; for, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 24. <hi>He that heareth theſe Sayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him to a wiſe Man</hi>; ſo, conſequently, he that doth them not, is fooliſh, ſinful, and unclean.</p>
                  <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> And further, ſay they, <hi>We have left undone thoſe Things which we ought to have done.</hi> Now, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth, and doing that which is right, is what we ought to do; and committing Sin, is that which we ought not to do: Certainly any Man of Senſe and Underſtanding, would think it Mockery, if his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Servants ſhould ſerve him ſo from Time to Time, and make a common Practice of it: By this Confeſſion (if it be genuine) they muſt needs know better than they practice or do, they knowing what they ought to do, but not doing it; and our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſaith poſitively, <hi>He that knows his Maſter's Will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many Stripes:</hi> And again, <hi>Be ye not like the Scribes and Phariſees; for they ſay, and do not; therefore be ye not like unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what can be expected from thoſe who ſay they ſin in their beſt Duties? And if ſo, they ſin whenever
<pb n="471" facs="unknown:006297_0482_10285B8D96D467F8"/>
they read the Common Prayers; and by the ſame Rule, the oftner they read them, the oftner they ſin; wherefore, how can a ſincere, devout Soul, who unfeignedly loves the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo as to keep his Commandments (for that is to love him truly, and according to his own Definition of it; <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments,</hi> ſaith Chriſt) I ſay, how can any ſuch ſincere Soul join with ſuch wrong Doers and Sayers; it muſt needs be an unſafe Practice to do what One knows ſhould not be done; the Nature of ſuch Doings being very provoking, either to God or Man: What Man in the World would like it, in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son or Servant?</p>
                  <p>Oh! what would become of poor, degenerate Man, if the Lord Almighty were not very indulgent, if he were not a God gracious and merciful, ſlow to Anger, and of great Loving-kindneſs to poor Mortals!</p>
                  <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> And as to their ſinging <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms in Metre; how often do they ſing that which is not true as to themſelves, and alſo that which is not according, but contrary to their States and Conditions? As when they ſing, "That they water their Couch with their Tears; and that they practice what they know, when they confeſs they do that which they ought not to do, and leave undone that which they ought to do."</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſaid, he would <hi>ſing with the Spirit, and with the Underſtanding alſo.</hi> And again, <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itſelf maketh Interceſſion for us, with Groanings which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uttered,</hi> Rom. viii. 26. In the primitive Times of Chriſtianity, they pray'd and ſung as they were helped by the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit, and not by Book, or ſtinted or ſet Forms; but Oh! the primitive Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtianity is too much loſt and defaced; and therefore ſome who deſire to come again to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soundneſs and Purity of the Chriſtian Religion, ſcruple to join with ſuch unſound Formalities, and that
<pb n="472" facs="unknown:006297_0483_10285B9053A02F68"/>
conſcientiouſly, for the Reaſons above, and more which might be given.</p>
                  <p>When ſuch Scruples are mentioned, the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> uſually reply, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vindicate them in their Form, which, how well they do ſo, let it be freely and fairly examined; not for Contention, but for Edification in the pure Love of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> "The Scripture ſaith, that there was a People that was full of Bruiſes and putrifying Sores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But that was in the Time of the Law, when the People had tranſgreſſed the Law, and were under the Law; for had they done their Duty, and kept the Law, they could not truly have ſaid ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> i. 6. They were then indeed gone aſtray like loſt Sheep, and that brought them into that ſore, putrified State, and bruiſed Condition, and "their Law did not make the Comers thereunto perfect; yet (as ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) the bringing in of a better Hope did," which was the Hope of the Goſpel; ſo that the Apoſtle preaches Perfection under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, though ſome of our worldly-wiſe Men will not allow of it; and I hope we are not under the Law, but under Grace; "and the glorious Law of the Spirit of Life, in Chriſt Jeſus, hath and doth ſet the true Believers free from the Law of Sin and Death;" ſo that a true Chriſtian cannot ſay truly (with the falſe and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom the Prophet there ſpeaks) "That he is full of putrifying Sores, and that there is no Soundneſs in him, and ſay it all the Days of his Life."</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Again the Scripture ſays, <hi>Pſa.</hi> li. 5. <hi>I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Pſalmiſt was at that Time under deep Convictions for the great Sins he had been guilty of, in the Matter of <hi>Uriah</hi>;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.5.</note> but by his Expreſſions in the 9th, 10th, and 11th Verſes of the ſame Pſalm, it is plain he believ'd a better State attainable; and ſurely theſe Expreſſions cannot be applicable to all Men, at all Times; for we read of them who were ſanctified from the
<pb n="473" facs="unknown:006297_0484_10285B9302BF8978"/>
Womb; neither can it be reaſonably or charitably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that all Women (eſpecially chaſte and virtuous Chriſtians) do all conceive their Children in Sin, and bring them forth in Iniquity; and if it were ſo (which God forbid) it don't follow, that we muſt live in it all our Days; no ſurely, if we believe Chriſt, and the Holy Scriptures, whoſe Doctrine is holy, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Holineſs, in both Teſtaments. And if People would walk in the Holy Light of Chriſt, who enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens every Man that cometh into the World, as record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Holy Scriptures, they would then be cleanſed from their Sin, from both the Act and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> "There is none that doth God, no not One," <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is beyond all Doubt the Apoſtle ſpoke of the People in their unconverted State; for if they had been come to the Work of Converſion and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they muſt, and it is impoſſible but they ſhould, do ſome Good; and though there was a Time that none did Good, it was under the Law, and not under Grace; and ſpoken of the Unbelievers, and not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; eſpecially ſince Chriſt has brought a Covenant of Grace, in order to teach and help us to live righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, virtuous, holy, religious, and ſober Lives and Converſations, <hi>Titus</hi> ii. 11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> They object the Words of our Saviour to the young Man in the Goſpel, where he calls Chriſt Good Maſter, aſking him, "What good Thing he ſhould do that he might inherit Eternal Life?" Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Why calleſt thou me good? There is none good but One, that is God,</hi> Mat. xix, 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> And true it is, in our Lord's Senſe, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Men to Chriſt (who is God) there is none good; the young Man thought he had been ſpeaking to a Man like himſelf, and knew not that he was
<pb n="474" facs="unknown:006297_0485_10285B94B05EEF40"/>
ſpeaking to the Good and Gracious Son of the Moſt High God; but if we compare Men with Men, it muſt be granted that there is, was, and will be, ſome good Men, Women, and Children, in that Senſe and Conſideration; and our Lord ſheweth how we may know theſe good Men, Women, and Children, <hi>By their Fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; <hi>Men do not gather Grapes of Thorns, nor Figs of Thiſtles: A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can an evil Tree bring forth good Fruit; wherefore by their Fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> How plain is the Doctrine of Chriſt, if People would but lend an obedient Ear, and give him a faithful and ſincere Heart, and ſerve him in a pure Mind, without Deceit, or Guile, taking up his holy Croſs (to the corrupt Will of Man) in true Self-denial: The Scripture ſays, <hi>If we confeſs our Sins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9.</note> 
                     <hi>he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all Unrighteouſneſs:</hi> Where then is the Sin, when God has cleanſed us from all Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Indeed it is very meet, and our Duty, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our Sins; they truly ſay, That,</p>
                  <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> The Scriptures in ſundry Places excite us to confeſs our Sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> For poor Mortals have all ſinned, and, by their ſinful Nature, we are all Children of Wrath, and this is a ſtrong and mighty Motive for us in Truth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our Sins, becauſe God is ſo juſt and merciful to forgive and to paſs be our Iniquities; and indeed if the Weight of our Sins were upon us, and the true Senſe of the Heinouſneſs of Sin and Evil, it would certainly bow us in deep Reverence and Humility before the Throne of Grace, and melt our Spirits into true Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs before the Moſt High and Immortal JEHOVAH; and then it is that he forgives us, and cleanſeth us from all Iniquity, and would (according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Doctrine) <hi>purify us to Himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of</hi> (and for) <hi>good Works,</hi> and againſt bad Works, and Words, and Thoughts alſo: And when God hath ſo cleanſed the Soul, then of Courſe theſe

common, and often repeated, dry Confeſſions full of Sin and Putrefaction, muſt fall, and we ſhould fear to offend any more. Let it be tenderly, and in Chriſtian Love, aſked, How often do our Common Prayer Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple go into their Cloſets, or privately retire into ſome ſecret Place, and there pour out their Cries and Tears to the Almighty, and humbly confeſs their Faults to Him alone? I aſk, would not ſuch an Exerciſe be more acceptable to God, than a popular Repetition daily and formally made? This I leave to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all ſober Chriſtians, and to the Judgment of the truly Pious. And how like Mockery it looks, as ſoon as they come from their Prayers and Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they (many of them) will vainly laugh, and be full of idle Words and Diſcourſe, and ſome of them curſe and ſwear, and take the Awful and Sacred Name which they have been addreſſing (or pretending to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs) in vain, and profane that Holy Name of God and Chriſt, which they have been uſing in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I have been an Eye and an Ear Witneſs of many a Time, to the Sorrow and Grief of my Soul, and which hath, in Part, occaſioned theſe Lines; as alſo hoping it may be a Motive to ſtir up ſome to more holy Living, and that the Name of God and Chriſt might be glorified, and the precious, dear-bought Soul ſaved. Let us alſo remember, that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to abundantly require and command us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our Sins; the Holy Text ſays, <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his Sins, ſhall have Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> And whereas the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in his firſt General Epiſtle, Chap. i. Verſe 8. writes, <hi>If we ſay we have no Sin, we deceive ourſelves</hi>; from whence it is objected, we ought always to confeſs our Sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, we ſhould do ſo when ever we commit any, or knowingly do Evil; but when the Almighty hath cleanſed us from all Unrighteouſneſs, then our Sins are done away by the Grace of his Son, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and we are waſhed by Regeneration;

then it cannot be true to ſay we are miſerable and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified Sinners, when at the ſame Time alſo Chriſt hath purified and ſanctified his Church and People.</p>
                  <p>It is true which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith. Chap. i. Verſe 10. (that opening and explaining the 8th Verſe) <hi>If we ſay we have not ſinned, we make Him (i. e.</hi> God) <hi>a Liar</hi>; for that all have ſinned; ſo that it is plain that he ſpeaks of the State of Man before he comes to the Work of Converſion, or to be renewed by Grace; for when we come truly to know Chriſt, and to ſee and believe in him, then we witneſs a Change from our corrupt and evil Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſinful Courſe of Life, which is as clear as the Shining of the Sun without Clouds at Noon-day from the ſame Apoſtle's Words, which I ſhall tranſcribe for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and Edification of any who may ſee this.</p>
                  <p>The firſt General Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> (the beloved Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our Lord Jeſus) 3d Chap. 6th Verſe to the 10th:—<hi>Whoſoever abideth in him (i. e.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>ſinneth not: Whoſoever ſinneth, hath not ſeen him, neither known him. Little Children, let no Man deceive you: He that doth Righteouſneſs, is righteous, even as he is righteous: He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil; for the Devil ſinneth from the Beginning. For this Purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil. Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſir, becauſe he is born of God.

                  <p>This is naked Truth, without any Covering, and the very Sum and Subſtance of true Religion.

of ſome ill-natur'd Over-lovers of Strong-liquors, th which hath been experienc'd by the Author, through ſome of the former Impreſſions; yet they having found ſuch general Acceptance in many Parts of the World, and being ſerviceable to People of all Perſwaſions, I, for the further Service of poor Mortals, adventure to put forth this Tenth Edition, with this additional Preface, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (if poſſible) to perſwade all rational Souls to forſake ſo deſtructive and vile an Evil: Which groſs Sin hath theſe had Effects attending it (with many more that might be ſet down) which affects both the Aged and the Youth; for whoſe Sakes (<hi>viz.</hi> the Youth) it was at firſt chiefly intended, in order to ſtir them up to the Love of pure Religion, and pious and virtuous Living.</p>
                     <p n="1">

And as it is in that, ſo it is in all other Evils, Parents Examples are very hurtful in evil Things, tho' very helpful in that which is good. If a Man ſees a Youth to be out of Order, and reproves him for being in Drink, Evil-ſpeaking, Pride, Covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and be guilty of the ſame, his Child may anſwer, <hi>Why, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I had not done ſo, if I had not ſeen thee (or you) do it?</hi> And it being an incumbent Duty in a Father, Mother, Maſter, or Miſtreſs, to reprove their Youth for Evil; if we are not clear in ourſelves of what we reprove in our Children or Servants, and our Children or Servants miſcarry through our bad Example, what a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Reflection will that be to us, if rightly conſider'd! which indeed would be this, <hi>I have been inſtrumental to my poor Child's Ruin and Deſtruction!</hi> A melancholy Reflection to any ſober Chriſtian!</p>
                     <p>Alſo, except there is a large Income, inſtead of taking Care to put the Youth in a reputable Way to live in the World, it brings them to Poverty: And if there is a large Eſtate, it puts them in the Way to ſpend it.

Several terrible Inſtances of this Nature I have met with in my Travels among the Children of Men; three or four of which I may inform thee of; and it may be affecting unto thee, as it hath often been to my Mind, when I have thought thereon.</p>

                        <head>The firſt Inſtance of a young Man, given to ill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and hard Drinking.</head>
                        <p>THE firſt is of a certain <hi>Beautiful</hi> young Man, a Phyſician by Profeſſion, who was much addicted to ill Company, and to drink hard, and was ſometimes viſited with ſtrong Convictions; in one of which Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations he ſent for me, and told me his Condition, and made <hi>ſolemn Covenants, if God would but that once ſpare him, he would not do the like Evil again.</hi> At that Time it did pleaſe the Almighty to ſpare him; but he ſoon forgat how it had been with him; and fell into the ſame <hi>Sin</hi> again; altho' he had a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Admonition in a <hi>Dream,</hi> but a little before. His Dream was this, which is very remarkable, we being then at Sea, in Sight of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> he ſaw in his Dream a great and ſpacious Town, the Buildings high, and Streets broad; at which he landed, and going up the Street, he eſpied a large Sign, on which was written in great Golden Letters, <hi>SHAME,</hi> to
<pb n="485" facs="unknown:006297_0496_10282E7A563A3F20"/>
which he went, and at the Door ſtood a Woman, with a Cann of drink in her Hand; who aſked him to drink? To which he reply'd, <hi>With all his Heart, for he ſaid, he had drank nothing but Water a great While:</hi> So he took the Cann, and drank a hearty Draught, which, as he ſaid, <hi>made him merry,</hi> and he went reeling up the Street, when, behold on a ſudden, a grim Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low met him, and arreſted him in the Name of the Governor of the Place, before whom he brought him. This Governor, he ſaid, was like a great <hi>Black Dog,</hi> the largeſt that ever he ſaw, who grinned at him, and <hi>paſſed Sentence</hi> on him, and ſent him to Priſon, there to lie for ever. He told me this Dream, with ſuch an <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> as made me to tremble, which was thus interpreted to him; I told him, that he was an ingenious young Man, and might eaſily diſcern the Interpretation of this Dream, which to me ſeem'd to be ominous to him: <hi>The great Town and high Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is thy great and high Profeſſion; the Sign, on which</hi> SHAME <hi>was writ, with the Woman with the Cann</hi> at the Door, ſheweth the great Shame <hi>of the Sin of</hi> Drunkenneſs, <hi>and that it is thy Weakneſs; and that grim Fellow, that arreſted thee, is</hi> Death, <hi>who will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt all Mortals; and the great black Dog, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Place, is the</hi> Devil; <hi>who, when his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have ſerved him to the laſt, will torment them for ever.—God forbid, it is but a Dream,</hi> was his Anſwer to me. I ſaid, it was a very ſignificant one to him.</p>
                        <p>About three Days after, the ſame Perſon went on board a Ship, whoſe Loading was <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Brandy</hi>; the Maſter gave a Cann of Wine to him, and ſaid the ſame Words, as the Woman ſaid to him in his Dream, and he anſwered with the ſame Expreſſions, and it had the ſame Effect upon him; for he took ſuch a hearty Draught as made him <hi>too merry,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he overſet the Boat, and was drowned, <hi>much in Drink:</hi> And I ſeeing him ſink down, and

His Death was ſudden; and, as was reaſonably ſuppoſed, he deſtroyed himſelf by <hi>Drinking</hi> and <hi>undue Company-keeping,</hi> and ſitting long at it. A Perſon, to whom he himſelf had told it, told me,
<q>That he and Four more, at one Sitting, drank above twenty Quarts of double-diſtilled Rum-Punch; which put him in a violent Fever:</q>
So that he ran about the Streets, with a naked Sword, and talked of killing one of the

                        <p>He ſeem'd to fall out with <hi>Religion</hi> too; for he ſaid, <hi>He would come no more to Worſhip, till he ſhould have Juſtice done him, as to the Reports:</hi> Tho' poor Soul, he had the more need to preſent himſelf before his Maker, and bow before the Moſt High God, and repent in great Humiliation. The ſame Day in which he <hi>neglected his Duty,</hi> he was taken ſick, and that Day-week was buried. He ſent for me, and I went to him: He had but little Senſe of his End, as I could perceive, and remained ſo till the Night he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I was by him when he died, and ſaw him fetch his <hi>laſt Breath.</hi> A few Minutes before he gave up the Ghoſt, he trembled and ſhook exceedingly, and ſhrieked out, to the Aſtoniſhment of all thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which pierced my very Soul within me: For he ſeemed to go out of the World in an extream great Agony.</p>
                        <p>I never ſaw any depart the World any ways like him; and indeed it was very amazing, and greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected my Mind with Sorrow: For I thought he was very unfit to die. Oh! methinks I could heartily wiſh, that ſuch Objects might be as ſo many ſtrong Motives, to ſtir up and to awaken the <hi>Offspring</hi> of good Men and virtuous Women (as alſo any profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>) to fear the Lord, and walk in his Ways, whoſe <hi>Ways</hi> lead to <hi>Life,</hi> in which the Sting of Death is taken away.</p>

                        <p>THE fourth Inſtance, which I ſhall give thee, is concerning a <hi>young Woman,</hi> of about 25 Years of Age; who was brought up very finely, tenderly, and delicately, with her <hi>Lockets,</hi> and <hi>Chains</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Waiting-Maid:</hi> But her Parents living too high for their <hi>Income,</hi> broke in Peoples Debt; and their Children, as they grew up, were put to their <hi>Shifts.</hi> What pity it is! that <hi>Youth</hi> are not brought up to ſome Buſineſs, whereby they may get a Livelihood in the World, if their Parents ſhould drop before them: And though Parents may have a handſome Intereſt in this World, yet it has been thought by ſome great, as well as wiſe Men, that to put out <hi>Youths</hi> to Trades and Buſineſs, is both profitable and honourable: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the evil Conſequences of the contrary, have been very many, as woeful Experience doth daily teach us; and this <hi>young Woman</hi> was one: For falling into evil Company, ſhe ran into Debt, and was put into Priſon; where was a <hi>Murderer,</hi> whom, it is ſaid, ſhe was acceſſary to <hi>looſe from his Chains</hi>; and for ſo doing was put in <hi>Chains</hi> herſelf, along with him, when he was taken again: And now, inſtead of her <hi>Gold Chain,</hi> ſhe muſt take up with an <hi>Iron</hi> One; and in a little Time, is to be <hi>tried for her Life:</hi> And in Expectation
<pb n="490" facs="unknown:006297_0501_10282F0040F6CBB0"/>
of <hi>Death,</hi> and being in great Diſtreſs, ſhe ſent for me, and entreated me to come and ſee her die, and much lamented her Condition:
<q>Oh! ſaid ſhe, that that I might be a Warning to all <hi>young People,</hi> to be careful that they keep not <hi>evil Company,</hi> and ſpend their Time which ſhould be ſpent in Worſhip, in airy Company, and other vain Diverſions, when they ſhould be doing their Duty to God.</q>
And then ſhe would weep bitterly; ſhe being very peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, it very much affected me; and I told her,
<q>That I did believe, if ſhe in her Heart was clear, and no ways conſenting to the Murder, her Life would be given her: But then Woe and Miſery would be her Portion, if ſhe did not amend her Ways.</q>
And as I was leaving her, ſhe charged me,
<q>to warn <hi>young People</hi> that they might be careful that they ſpend not their Time in Vanity, and to keep out of vain and wicked Company,</q>
which ſhe ſaid had brought her to that Miſery and Shame:
<q>And that they ſhould take the Counſel and Advice of good Friends (which if I had done, ſaid ſhe) I had not brought Reproach on my Friends, and on my Parents.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In a little Time after, ſhe was brought to Trial, and <hi>acquitted</hi> by the Jury. I ſaw her once ſince, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded her of her Duty; which, ſhe ſaid,
<q>She hoped to perform; and that it ſhould be a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her, while ſhe lived in this World:</q>
And that ſuch <hi>Examples</hi> may be a <hi>Warning</hi> to all People, is the earneſt Deſire of a Lover of Souls, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Jeſus.</p>

Oh! ſaith my Soul, that thou may more and more grow

                  <p>Dear Friends, it is in my Mind to viſit you with the Salutation of Brotherly Love, in our holy Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and may let you know, that though I have been long abſent from you in Body, yet have I been often preſent in Spirit with you, and you have been often in my Mind, with Prayers to the Lord for your Growth in the holy Truth which he hath been pleaſed to make known to you, and many times I have deſired of the Almighty, that he would be pleaſed to preſerve a Seed in your Parts that ſhould ſerve him, and be accounted to him for a Generation. I have alſo deſired that the Lord would viſit your young Ones, and bring them to the Knowledge of his Truth: And I pray God, that the tender Viſitation that was on divers of them, when I was preſent with you, may by them never be forgotten, but that they may be Plants of Righteouſneſe, of God's own Right-hand planting.</p>
                  <p>And, Dear Friends, forſake not the Aſſembling of yourſelves together, in the Name of Chriſt, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring how you have been viſited with the Heart-melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power, and the ſweet Preſence of the Moſt High, in your ſilent waiting on, and worſhiping him in his
<pb n="494" facs="unknown:006297_0505_10285BBA2902D720"/>
Holy Spirit and Truth, as well as when you have been vocally viſited by the Miniſters of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Such Worſhippers (as our Lord ſaid to the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>) the heavenly Father ſeeketh to worſhip him; and thoſe whom God finds under ſuch Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, ſuch find him to be unto them all in all; He is unto them Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Juſtification, Sanctification, and Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Oh! Dear Souls, look to him (who is inviſible to the outward Eye) who is God over all, and is bleſſed for ever, and may you, if this comes to you, feel the Divine Life and Spirit of Chriſt, in the Reading of this little Epiſtle of Brotherly Love.</p>
                  <p>Live in Love, for God is Love, and all thoſe who dwell in Divine Love, they dwell in God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore love one another, that thereby you may be known to be Chriſt's Diſciples: <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another,</hi> or <hi>if ye love one another</hi>; as one of the Evanglieſts hath it.</p>
                  <p>And keep low in Mind, and humble in Spirit; for the Humble God will teach of his Ways, and the Meek he will guide in Judgment, and thoſe whom he teaches, are taught the Myſteries of his Kingdom, which Myſteries he teaches to Spiritual Babes and Sucklings (Glory to his holy Name!) He often hides thoſe holy Myſteries from the Wiſe and Prudent, and reveals them to ſuch Men, Women, and Children, as are little in their own Eyes, and deſpiſed by the Wiſe in natural Wiſdom, or the Wiſdom of this vain World.</p>
                  <p>Oh! mind your heavenly Guide Dear Friends, let me entreat you; for he leads out of all Sin, and out of all Vanity and Evil, of what Kind ſoever; and as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>into all Truth.</hi> When Chriſt comes by his Grace and Spirit into the Heart, then He opens the Soul, and enlightens the Underſtanding, even in our common Converſation; and much more

(at Times) in our ſolemn Meetings, when we meet together to worſhip and ſerve him; ſo that 'tis good to wait upon the Lord, and to ſeek him with the whole Heart.</p>
                  <p>Dear Friends, though my Heart is full of Love and Good-will to you at this time, as at many others alſo, I muſt now conclude, and commit you into the holy Arms of him, who is all Divine Love, begging the God of Love and Peace to keep you, and preſerve you to his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be all Glory, and Praiſe, Might, Majeſty, and Divine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, through his dear Son, and the Holy Spirit, for evermore.</p>

                        <hi>IN order to promote and exalt the Kingdom of the dear Son of God (according to the Gift and Meaſure of Grace received) I was concerned to write the following Tract at Sea; and conſidering the evil Tendency of the Belief and Principle which hath overſpread a great Part of the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, that we cannot be free from Sin in this Life; and that it is contrary to the Doctrine of the holy Scriptures of both the New, and Old Teſtament; I could not be eaſy in my Mind, without oppoſing ſuch a dangerous Tenet: For if we believe that we muſt always ſin, this being a ſinful Faith, "according to our Faith, ſo it will be unto us;" and if we die in our Sins, Chriſt hath told us, "where he is gone, we cannot come." And holy Record informs us, "that no unclean Thing can enter God's Kingdom."</hi>

Then would they witneſs the Truth of that Saying of the Apoſtle, "That the Weapons of this Warfare are not carnal, but mighty, through God, to the pulling down the ſtrong Holds of Sin and Satan." Oh! down with thoſe ſtrong Holds, down with them; let every Lover of Jeſus Chriſt ſay, and pray, That

the Kingdom of God, and his Chriſt, may be exalted over all, for ever. Sin is the chief Support of Satan's Kingdom, which Chriſt came to deſtroy and put an End to, and to bring in Righteouſneſs, actual Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as well as imputative; he came to ſave his People from their Sins, not only by Imputation, but by holy Action alſo; as his holy Doctrine in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sermon on the Mount, and his many other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Expreſſions, do plainly and abundantly manifeſt. Now conſidering the great Evil of this dangerous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, I have been deeply affected on Account of poor Mankind, to whoſe utter Ruin and eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction it moſt certainly tends. If we were to reaſon as Men and rational Beings, with what Spirit and Courage ſhould we undertake any Buſineſs, Journey, or Concern, if before-hand we were grounded in a Belief that we could not perform our Undertaking? Or what Nation or People in the World would have any Courage to engage their common Enemies, if at the ſame time they did believe they ſhould never overcome them, would not this abundantly diſpirit and diſcourage them in their Engagement, let any rational Soul judge? Oh! this Belief of Sinning to the End of our Days, is a mighty Engine of Satan, in order to ſupport his Kingdom, and a wonderful Prop to uphold it. Pray what ſignifies all the Preaching and Writing in the World againſt Sin, though never ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly or ſcholaſtically wrote or delivered by the greateſt of Orators or Miniſters, if, at the ſame Time, this Doctrine be upheld and maintained in Pulpits, Prints, and otherwiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and received and believed by the People? Let Truth and right Reaſon in this Matter bear Rule and be Judge, and the Cauſe will be determined againſt the Kingdom of Sin and Satan: But the.

One great and wily Way which he uſeth to uphold his Kingdom, is to wreſt and abuſe the Holy Scriptures, and ſtrain them to his evil Purpoſes, as he ſerved our Lord, the Captain of our Salvation, as will be ſhewn hereafter: And indeed when he makes Uſe of any of the Words of God, it is for an evil End, and that End muſt needs be wicked, which is to keep People in Sin, or to create a Belief that we cannot live without it in this World; the which, if he can obtain, and cauſe People to believe, he knows he hath a great Advantage over them: For how ſhould Clay, or Duſt and Aſhes, overcome Sin, who confeſs they are, and believe they always ſhall be, Sinners?

To conſtrue Chriſt's Words other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, would be to abuſe the Holy Scriptures, which Satan makes a common Practice of doing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Another is that Expreſſion of <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the 8th Chapter of 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> Verſe 46. <hi>There is no Man that ſinneth not.</hi> The Learned ſay, this ſhould be interpreted, and who may not ſin. But though it may truly be ſaid of Men in one Part of their Lives or other, or in the State of Man in the Fall or Degeneration (in which State of Unconverſion) there is no Man that ſinneth not: Yet in the Regeneration or new Birth, the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in the 3d Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle, and 9th Verſe, ſaith, that <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth in him: And be cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> It is this Seed which would beget this new and living Birth, which makes us Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and Heirs of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which Satan would deſtroy; for he knows he ſhall have an Enemy of every ſuch Soul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the Devil's Intereſt and Endeavour to deſtroy every ſuch Birth and ſuch Belief, that Chriſtians can poſſibly attain to live without Sin in the World.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly, Prov.</hi> 20th Chapter, 9th Verſe, Who can ſay, <hi>I have made my Heart clean, I am pure from my Sin,</hi> the
<pb n="504" facs="unknown:006297_0515_10285BD825A613A8"/>
Words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Son of <hi>David,</hi> who prayed to the Almighty in his Pſalms: <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, and renew a right,</hi> or pure <hi>Spirit within me</hi>; which Prayer was no doubt anſwered: But this is the Work of God, and to him all Things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, even that which looks impoſſible to Men; for <hi>He can make a Man more pure than Gold.</hi> So it being the Work of God, no Man can ſay, that he hath done it, that he hath purified himſelf, or made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf clean. Can the Almighty make a Man pure? It might with much Truth be anſwered he can; and it is ſuppoſed no good Chriſtian can, or will deny it: And then what will become of that abſurd Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and Antiſcriptural Tenet, that we cannot be clean or pure from Sin, in this World?</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid, if there are any who live without Sin, they are but very few (a ſorrowful Truth indeed!) but is it not every One's Intereſt to ſtrive to be one of thoſe Few, as it is alſo his indiſpenſible Duty: Our Lord alſo ſaith, that <hi>the Way</hi> to his Kingdom <hi>is ſtrait and narrow, and</hi> that <hi>there are but few that find it.</hi> Muſt we therefore give up the Cauſe, and not ſeek the Kingdom, and becauſe of the Difficulty of Chriſt's Croſs here in this World, muſt we go in the broad Way, where there is much Room and Company. May every true Chriſtian ſay, the Lord forbid (I humbly pray) and not only ſay, but do that which is right in the Sight of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> The next is an Expreſſion of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, Eccleſiaſtes, Chapter 7th, Verſe 20. <hi>There is not a juſt Man upon the Earth that doth Good, and ſinneth not.</hi> This ſhould be interpreted as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>and who may not ſin:</hi> He ſpeaketh of a Man in the State of his Vanity and Sin, before a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for Divine Wiſdom, and the Fear of the Lord (which he taught) keeps the Heart clean, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves from the Snares of Sin, Death, and the Devil: So that this State of Sin that he here ſpeaks of, muſt be before Man attains to the Wiſdom of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="505" facs="unknown:006297_0516_10285BDB2AA6DE78"/>
he comes truly to live in his Fear. Therefore he muſt certainly do Good, who lives in the Fear of God,
<q>which (as the ſame <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays) is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Wiſdom; and to depart from Iniquity, is a good Underſtanding.</q>
So that he ſhews Man his State of Vanity, and alſo his State of Sin, as above, and teacheth People how to avoid it, by fearing the Lord, and walking in the Counſel of Wiſdom (<hi>i. e.</hi>) Chriſt's Counſel, who is the Wiſdom of God to Salvation. That all Men are Sinners, before the Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, is true, and that the Devil deſigns to keep them there to their Lives End, is as true; and no likelier Way can he do it, than by keeping them in a Belief that they muſt live in Sin, and cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it whilſt they live in this World; and when they come to die, then Fear ſurpriſes the Hypocrite, and Terror takes hold of the Ungodly: And many times, when too late, they ſee the Snares which the Devil and Sin hath brought them into. Oh! what pity it is, that this Veil of Darkneſs is not done away, in time of Youth, Strength, and Health, when the Bones are full of Marrow, and the Veins are full of Blood: But the Deſign of Satan is to lead People on in this pernicious Principle till Death, and then before they are aware, they may drop into Eternal Woe and Miſery, where the Wicked and Ungodly muſt be turned, with all them that forget God: For into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where Chriſt is, "if we die in our Sins,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>John</hi> 8.21.</note> we (as Chriſt ſaid) cannot come."</p>
                     <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Chapter 1. Verſes 8, 9, and 10. writes thus, <hi>If we ſay we have</hi> had (as it may be turned) <hi>no Sin, we deceive ourſelves, and the Truth is not in us. If we confeſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. If we ſay we have not ſinned, we make him a Liar, and his Word is not in us</hi>; which anſwers to the 8th Verſe, <hi>If we ſay we have no Sin, we deceive ourſelves.</hi> The 9th Verſe fully lets us into the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="506" facs="unknown:006297_0517_10285BDCE4EA8020"/>
of the 8th Verſe <hi>(i. e.) if we confeſs our Sins,</hi> for all ought to confeſs, and alſo to forſake their Sins,
<q>all having ſinned, and being by Nature Children of Wrath;</q>
otherwiſe we have no Aſſurance of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Holy Scriptures: Then he (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
<q>is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all Unrighteouſneſs.</q>
And pray what Sin is there, when we are cleanſed from all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs? And then in the 10th Verſe he ſays, <hi>If we ſay we have not ſinned, we make him a Liar.</hi> There is no doubt but that we have ſinned, which is what the Apoſtle plainly points at in the 8th Verſe. And if any Man ſins (when he repents and forſakes) <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt, the Righteous: And God is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins.</hi> But then we muſt repent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, if we expect to find Mercy; though we have Sin, or have had Sin, we muſt not always have it, for if we have it always, Woe will be to us, according to the Words of God and Chriſt. Thus we ſee how Satan is put to his Shifts to ſupport his ſinful Kingdom, and how he abuſes the Holy Scriptures, when he makes uſe of them, as will be further made manifeſt in what fol|]ows, as the ſame Apoſtle doth plainly demonſtrate in his third Chapter of the above Epiſtle, Verſes 7, 8, 9, and 10, ſaying, <hi>Let no Man</hi> (nor the Devil nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſay I) <hi>deceive you: He that doth Righteouſneſs, is righteous: He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil.</hi> This is plain and naked Truth, let who will like, or diſlike it. Further, in the 9th and 10th Verſes he again repeats to the ſame Purpoſe, ſaying, <hi>In this the Children of God are manifeſt, and the Children of the Devil: Whoſoever doth not Righteouſneſs, is not of God. (Ergo,</hi> then he muſt be of the Devil, while he is in Unrighteouſneſs.)</p>
                     <p>There are divers other Places in the Holy Scriptures, which he abuſeth in like Manner, and which he and his Children wreſt to uphold him and his Kingdom of Sin and Unrighteouſneſs, and
<pb n="507" facs="unknown:006297_0518_10285BE00747D4A0"/>
themſelves therein: So by and through the Grace of God, we may ſee his Wiles and Deluſions, and the Rottenneſs of his Cauſe, as alſo the unſafe and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Foundation of his Building, through endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unduly to ſupport the ſame, by that which was always deſigned to deſtroy him and his Kingdom <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Holy Scriptures. May all Men judge in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whether that Spirit which would bring, pick, and cull out a few Verſes, and ſometimes a few Words out of a Verſe, in order to make them ſpeak contrary to the whole Scope and Tenor, or Tendency of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and to plant a Belief that we ſhall never overcome Sin and Unrighteouſneſs in this World, tho' they <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Holy Scriptures all along exhort, and teach us to avoid Sin and Unrighteouſneſs, and live a holy righteous Life in this preſent World; I ſay, may all Mortals judge whether ſuch a Spirit can be of God, or whether it be not of, and from the Father of Lies: Wherefore, if it be plainly proved, that there have been thoſe who have overcome Sin and Satan, and that Chriſt repeatedly, and his holy Apoſtles (he in them, and they in him) exhorted to fight againſt Sin and the Devil, who is the Author of all Sin; and Chriſt faithfully promiſing moſt ſweet and gracious Rewards to thoſe who ſhall overcome, in order to encourage the ſpiritual Warrior to a faithful Perſeverance, and reſiſting of Sin and Satan: Then it is hoped that Satan will be wounded, his Kingdom ſhaken, and this evil deſtructive Principle, in ſome Meaſure laid waſte in ſome poor Soul or Souls, into whoſe Hands theſe may come.</p>

Oh! that our young Men of this Generation, would take thoſe young Men for their Examples, to make War with this wicked One, and truly endeavour to pull down his Kingdom. It is worth our Notice, that thoſe young Men had the Word of God abiding in them; by this Sword of the Spirit they overcame, by it they were cleanſed, by taking heed to walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its Directions,<note place="margin">

So here were young Men who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually overcame Sin and Satan, that this holy Servant of Jeſus wrote to, by way of Encouragement. Is the Arm of the Lord ſhortned?

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Rev.</hi> ii. 7. <hi>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches, to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the Midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> Here is an excellent Promiſe and bleſſed Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſuch as believe, and are faithful, and are deſirous to fight in the Lamb's War againſt Sin and Satan: The ſame Apoſtle gives a Deſcription of this Tree of Life, in the aboveſaid Book; "That it bears twelve Manner of Fruits, and bears its Fruits every Month, and its Leaves are for the healing of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;" which myſtically points at Chriſt, who is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his precious Promiſes and Doctrine, and has that Virtue in him, that, through Faith, will heal the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Wounds which Sin has given them. Thoſe who continually eat of the Tree of Life, ſhall live for ever; but a flaming Sword will turn every Way, to keep the unbelieving Sinners from it: None in a State of Sin and Diſobedience can come to enjoy the Paradiſe of God. The above is an excellent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to all thoſe who overcome Sin, and the Devil, who is the Author of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To the Church of <hi>Smyrna, Rev.</hi> ii. 11. <hi>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaith to the Churches, He that overcometh ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond Death:</hi> Which is that eternal Death which is in Hell, or that Lake of Fire which burns for ever, where the Worm never dieth, and the Fire never goeth out. This holy Warfare is certainly a Fighting

for Life, againſt eternal Death and Hell; which is of much greater Conſequence than natural Life and Death. Oh! Fight for your Lives againſt Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, againſt Pride and Vanity, and all Manner of Wickedneſs; put on the whole Armour of Light; look unto God, through Chriſt the victorious Lamb, that you may be ſaved from the eternal Lake of Fire, and not be hurt of the ſecond Death. Oh! may we know a dying daily to Sin, to the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, that we may live unto God, through Faith in his dear Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To the Church of <hi>Pergamus, Rev.</hi> ii. 17. <hi>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches, To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden Manna; and I will give him a white Stone, and in the Stone a new Name written, which no Man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth it.</hi> Here are four excellent Promiſes to him that overcometh, the Lord opens his Treaſury of Life, and of Wiſdom, in order to invite Souls to the mighty Battle of the Lamb, who is not like the Princes of this World, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times promiſe great Things to their Soldiers or Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and do not perform; but God's Promiſes are all Yea and Amen for ever.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Promiſe is, <hi>to eat of the hidden Manna:</hi> The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> eat Manna (outwardly) as it is written, in the Wilderneſs, and are dead; but thoſe who eat of this hidden Manna, this Angels-food, and who are hid with God in Chriſt, theſe ſhall never die (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſpiritually) for this hidden Manna is the Fleſh and Blood of the Son of God, who ſaid, <hi>Except ye eat my Fleſh, and drink my Blood, ye have no Life in you,</hi> John vi. 31, 49, 50, 51, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Second Promiſe is, <hi>to have a white Stone</hi>; this Stone is Chriſt, who is the chief Corner Stone of God's Building or Church, the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> which the wiſe Letter-learned Maſter-builders ſet at nought; but He is the Head of the Saints Building or Corner, and
<pb n="511" facs="unknown:006297_0522_10285BED138B95F8"/>
a Holy Precious Stone, the Elect or Choſen of God, the Gift of God, to all thoſe who truly believe, and overcome Sin, as he did; and as it is written. <hi>If he give us his Son, ſhall he not with his Son give us all Things?</hi> There is Abundance of Talk and Writing about the Philoſopher's Stone; but this <hi>White Stone</hi> (which is the Gift of God to thoſe who overcome Sin, and Satan) is the true Philoſopher's Stone. (A Philoſopher is a Lover of Wiſdom, and Chriſt is the Wiſdom of God:) This Stone will certainly do Miracles for them that have it, through the Virtue of its Power, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Joy in Tribulation, Patience in Afflictions, Health in Sickneſs, Riches in Poverty, Strength in Weakneſs, Liberty in Bonds, and to ſum up all (which indeed is a great Sum) <hi>Life in Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Third Promiſe, <hi>and in the Stone a new Name:</hi> How many gay Sparks and Beaus would do Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to gain Honour or a Name among Men? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is dear to them in this World, neither their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, nor the neareſt Relation they have in the World, ſo that they may gain a Name here below; no, not even their own Lives; but, Oh! did Mortals know the Virtue of this Name, and were they in Love with it, then the World, and all its fading Beauty and Vanity, would be nothing to them in Compariſon of this Name, which is better than the Names of Sons of worldly Glory, and Maids or Daughters of Honour; for thoſe outward Names are fading, <hi>viz.</hi> To-day a King, a Prince, a Duke, an Earl, a Lord, a Knight, and (has been, and may be again) To-morrow on the Scaffold: But this Name which the King of Kings giveth thoſe who overcome Sin and Satan, is a Name which will outlaſt Time, and it will endure to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>Fourth Promiſe is, "That it ſhould be ſecret (on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the World) but ſurely known to him that hath it." Great Men, when their Acts and Titles of Honour are blazoned abroad in the World, they have many
<pb n="512" facs="unknown:006297_0523_10285BEF2F0D6900"/>
Enemies many Ways, who envy them; and yet ſome are ſo vain as to love Grandeur and Popularity, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding; but he that hath a Name that Chriſt gives, ſo long as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſenſible of it in himſelf, he is therewith ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>Now as this is the Portion (and more, which is hereafter mentioned) of thoſe who overcome the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed One, then, on the contrary, what will become of thoſe who live and delight in Sin, and are daily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with it? For the Holy Scriptures are poſitive, That <hi>the Wicked, with all thoſe that forget God, ſhall be turned into Hell.</hi> This is the determinate Will of God: And that we may take the more Notice of it, to obſerve and do his Will, he hath cauſed it to be written down in the Language of the Holy Spirit, in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures of Truth, which are of no private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; but naked, and open to mean Capacities. The Holy Scriptures are not to be interpreted to the private Intereſt of any particular Perſon or Sett of Perſons only; but are a general Benefit unto all the faithful Believers and Followers of Chriſt, through the whole World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To the Church at <hi>Thyatira, Rev.</hi> ii. 26. to the End; <hi>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my Works unto the End, to him I will give Power over the Nations, and I will give him the Morning-ſtar. He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi> The Spirit ſtill continues promiſing his gracious Privileges upon Condition of overcoming: Wherefore, if it had been impoſſible to have overcome Sin and Satan, then all theſe Promiſes would have been in vain, and the Holy Scriptures deceiving, which would be to make Chriſt and the Apoſtles Deceivers; but Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and the Holy Scriptures, are true, and every One that contradicts God, is a Liar.</p>
                     <p>Let it be obſerved, that there muſt be a keeping the Word to the End alſo; for divers have run well for a Time, and overcome many Sins, through the
<pb n="513" facs="unknown:006297_0524_10285BF5434C5088"/>
Help and Goodneſs of God, and yet afterwards have run into Sin again, whereby they have grieved the good Spirit of God, by which they ſhould have been ſealed to the Day of Redemption, and ſo the Lord hath taken his good Spirit and Gift of Light and Grace from them, and left them to themſelves, and their own Hearts Luſts; but ſuch as hold out in Well-doing to the End, the ſame ſhall be ſaved, and <hi>thoſe ſhall have Power over the Nations</hi>; the Laws of Men, or Powers of the Earth or Hell, cannot hurt them; but they will be as Kings and Prieſts unto God, ruling over their own Spirits; ſuch an One is greater than one that ruleth a City, and cannot govern himſelf. Another excellent Gift is promiſed here to the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtian Warrior, <hi>viz. I will give him the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtar</hi>: 'Tis indeed a very comfortable Gift, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Morning-ſtar, after a long, tedious, ſtormy Night, earneſtly waiting for the Morning: Oh! 'tis wonderful pleaſant. This Morning-ſtar the Writer of theſe Lines hath witneſſed, both as to his natural and ſpiritual Travels; but eſpecially to his inward State and Condition as a Chriſtian. Thoſe that have a true Sight and Senſe of this Divine Star, are made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice; for then they do infallibly know, that the Day of the Moſt High is at Hand, and that his Kingdom draws near unto them. Amen, Holy Lord Jeſus!</p>
                     <p>As the Day-ſtar is a Fore-runner of the natural Day, ſo is the heavenly Morning-ſtar a Fore-runner of the Day of the Moſt High to the Soul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To the Church of <hi>Sardis, Rev.</hi> iii. 5. <hi>He that overcometh ſhall be clothed in white Raiment, and I will not blot his Name out of the Book of Life; but I will confeſs him before my Father, and before his Angels. He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi> Theſe Promiſes of God, through his Spirit, and through his Servant, to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> is, "That thoſe who overcome ſhall be clothed in white Raiment;" and he ſays in the 4th
<pb n="514" facs="unknown:006297_0525_10285BF8D4B289C8"/>
Verſe of the ſame Chapter, "That that Church had a Few in her who had not defiled their Garments, who ſhould walk with him in White, for (ſaith he) they are worthy." So that there were a Few undefiled Ones, who had overcome; although others were blameable, whom the Spirit reproved ſharply; but alſo, as above, promiſed that thoſe who overcame ſhould be clothed in white Raiment; which Raiment is that clean Linnen called <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the Saints,</hi> or elſewhere, <hi>the Wedding Garment,</hi> and <hi>the Garment unſpotted of the World,</hi> without having which, we may expect to be aſked, how we dare to preſume to approach the Holy Preſence of a Juſt and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity with Allowance or Approbation, as it is written, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou hither not having on the Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> And by the Promiſe to the Church, that thoſe who overcame, "their Names ſhall not be blotted out of the Book of Life." It plainly appears, that thoſe who fight the Lamb's Battle, and overcome Sin and Satan, their Names are upon Record in Heaven, and written in the Lamb's Book of Life: It alſo appears, that we may have done well or valiantly in ſome Things, yet if we ſuffer ourſelves to be overcome of Sin, there is Danger, though our Names are in, we may have them blotted out of, the Book of Life.</p>
                     <p>Third Promiſe is very excellent and glorious, <hi>viz. But I will confeſs him before my Father, and before his Angels.</hi> Oh! wonderful Honour! to have Chriſt confeſs that we are his, and belong to him, and have been Men of Courage in this holy War, and overcame the Enemy, and been victorious in this Fight of Faith; to confeſs us there before God and his Angels, muſt needs be unſpeakable Honour done us before the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in Heaven, He expreſſed again his repeated Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to thoſe who have Ears, ſaying, <hi>He that hath an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches:</hi> Which is much wanting among Men, and alſo a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="515" facs="unknown:006297_0526_10285BFCA54F0298"/>
Heart: I query, Is not God, Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt, ſtronger than the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil? But is not this Belief of it not being poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overcome Sin, and ſaying, that we can't do it while we are here in this World; as much as to believe and ſay, that Satan and Nature is ſtronger than God and Grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To the Church at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the Spirit ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 12, 13. <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out: And I will write upon him, the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi> Here is Promiſe upon Promiſe, all to perſuade, excite, and invite People to fight the Fight of Faith, believing they ſhall obtain the Victory, and to deſtroy the Principle of Unbelief: The Overcomer, through Grace, is to be made a Pillar in the Temple of God; that is, one of his Church, who helps to ſupport the Credit of it, through a true Chriſtian Reputation in his Converſation. Such an One is a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the Church-militant here on Earth, and will, if he is faithful to the End, be alſo of the Church-tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in Heaven;
<q>and he will not go out any more, but will abide in, and with Chriſt, for ever.</q>
Here are Goſpel Promiſes and Privileges, happy are they who through Faith attain thereto: How much have Chriſtians need to be concern'd before God, for the excellent Gift of Faith, ſince
<q>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</q>
And as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If ye had Faith but as a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed, ye might ſay to this Mountain, be removed, and caſt into the Sea, and it ſhould be ſo.</hi> Now though Sin indeed is grown a very great Mountain, in this Age and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet through true Faith it is removed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctrine of Chriſt (bleſſed be his Holy Name.) Upon thoſe Overcomers, the Lord hath alſo promiſed as above, to
<q>write upon them the Name
<pb n="516" facs="unknown:006297_0527_10285BFE820E7D40"/>
of God, and the Name of the City of God, which is new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which cometh down from Heaven, which is the Mother of all Saints.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26.</note>
                        </q>
Here is a train of glorious Expreſſions, and mighty Promiſes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to inſpire the tender Soul with ſtrong Deſires after God and Chriſt, and his Kingdom. My Heart is deeply affected at this Time, in the Senſe of the Love of our heavenly Father; and my Spirit is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned for the Welfare of the Children of Men, my Fellow Mortals. Oh! that they might believe, and that believing they might have life, through the Name of Chriſt. It is obſervable, that to overcome, is the Condition of obtaining all theſe great and glorious Promiſes; and Overcoming is repeated ſeven Times, once to every Chucrch. And to ſay after all thoſe glorious and fair Promiſes, that Sin and Satan cannot be overcome, is not the Conſequence of ſuch Saying or Belief, to make Chriſt a Deceiver? Which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and Antichriſtian Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> To the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Rev.</hi> iii. 21.22. <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne. He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches.</hi> What greater Promiſe could Chriſt make to his Church than this, to take her into his Throne, and into his Father's Kingdom, into his Boſom of Love? This is wonderful kind indeed. But then, Oh! Chriſtian, the Condition is to overcome, as Chriſt overcame.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince it may be beneficial to Chriſtians to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and to conſider duly, this great Fight or Battle, and how this great Conqueror overcame; and becauſe we are to follow him, and to take him for our Example, let us have a Deſcription of it, it being the greateſt Encounter or Battle, that ever was in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince of Life, and the King of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit. The Hiſtory of which, is worth the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the greateſt Prince or Monarch on Earth, ſince
<pb n="517" facs="unknown:006297_0528_10285C02DCDE4DF8"/>
they muſt leave this low World, and lay down all their Crowns when Death calls, them to fight this Battle, and to follow this Monarch, who hath all Divine Power in Heaven and Earth, and to take his Direction, is every Man's Duty and Intereſt, both Noble and Ignoble. The holy Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> give us an Account of this great Fight, in the 4th Chapter of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and 4th Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> and agree in the moſt weighty Matters, though they did not exactly word it alike, yet the Subſtance is the ſame, and the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Conflict or Battle, all one. 1<hi>ſt,</hi> Satan bids Chriſt (as <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> has it)
<q>command the Stones, or Stone, to be made Bread. 2<hi>dly,</hi> To caſt himſelf down from the Pinacle of the Temple. 3<hi>dly,</hi> To worſhip the Devil, or fall down to him.</q>
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> Chap. 4th, 1ſt Verſe, to the 11th. <hi>Then was Jeſus led up of the Spirit into the Wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil. And when he had faſted forty Days and forty Nights, he was afterward an hungred. And when the Tempter came to him, he ſaid, If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe Stones be made Bread. But he</hi> (i. e. Chriſt) <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, it is written, Man ſhall</hi> (or doth) <hi>not live by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God. Then the Devil taketh him up into the holy City, and ſetteth him on a Pinacle of the Temple, and ſaith unto him. If thou be the Son of God, caſt thyſelf down: For it is written, He ſhall give his Angels Charge concerning thee</hi> (it is obſervable that the Devil was here at his old Trade of perverting of the Holy Scriptures: The Scriptures ſaying, that <hi>He ſhall give his Angels Charge concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy Ways,</hi> &amp;c. as in the <hi>Pſalms</hi>: Which Words Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan left out, for they gave much Light to ſee his Temptation. thoſe Words which expoſed him he hides, for he hates Light and Truth) <hi>and in their Hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy Foot againſt a Stone. Jeſus ſaid unto him, It is written again, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the Devil taketh him up into an exceeding high Mountain,
<pb n="518" facs="unknown:006297_0529_10285C046168FA80"/>
and ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them. And ſaith unto him, All theſe Things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: For it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve. Then the Devil leaveth him, and behold, Angels came and miniſtred unto him.</hi> Behold how the Saviour of the World overcame the Devil, and his Temptations. As he did, ſo ought all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to reſiſt the Tempter, as it is written, <hi>Reſiſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and he'll fly:</hi> Here we may ſee he is a conquered Enemy; and we are told,
<q>By Chriſt's Spirit we muſt overcome, as he alſo overcame.</q>
After our Lord had faſted forty Days, and forty Nights, he was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, at which Time the Devil urged him, if he was the Son of God, then to make the Stone or Stones Bread, knowing him to be hungry: Thus after the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he tempts us poor Mortals, by laying his Snares, and baiting his Hook, according to the Nature and Propenſity of the Perſon he is engaged withal: If a Man, Woman, or Child, be addicted to Paſſion, Pride, Swearing, Lying, Drunkenneſs, taking the ſacred Name in vain, idle or vain Diſcourſes to ſteal away our precious Time: Let the Sin be what it will, that which we are moſt naturally addicted to, there will he lay his Temptations, for he preys upon our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and plies the weakeſt Part in us moſt; for which Reaſon, we have need to keep a ſtrict Watch: As Chriſt adviſed to
<q>watch and pray continually, left we ſhould enter into Temptation;</q>
for it is no Sin to be tempted, but the Sin is to entertain, and enter into the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if we overcome, as Chriſt did, it is an Honour to be tempted, and a ſecret Joy ſprings in the Soul, in a Senſe of its Victory, in ſore Conflicts between the Enemy and the Soul; the Lord manifeſting his Divine Grace for our Aſſiſtance and Help. Here we can take the Advice of the Apoſtle, when he ſays, <hi>Count it all Joy when ye fall into divers Temptations</hi>; and alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them as Chriſt did, by Reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="519" facs="unknown:006297_0530_10285C0614E5ABA0"/>If it be objected, though Chriſt overcame, yet I'm a poor ſinful Creature, and have no Power; but he had and hath all Power, both in Heaven and Earth, committed into his Hands, ſo that he might well overcome him. It is well if thou ſeeſt thou haſt no Power, and if thou alſo ſeeſt that Chriſt hath wonderful Power; then ſince we have no Power of ourſelves, we muſt, by Prayer and humble Supplication, apply to him for it, in time of Need; believing, that he who hath made ſo many encouraging Promiſes as are before recited, hath alſo Grace, and will give both Grace and Glory to thoſe who diligently ſeek him: Elſe why did he make ſo many excellent Promiſes to the ſpiritual Warriors? This is worthy of the Notice of all, that Satan is a conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and limited Enemy and Adverſary. 'Tis a ſweet Portion of Goſpel Tidings, and good News, that the Devil cannot force any One whether he will or not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin; for if he could, no Fleſh could be ſaved.

Chriſt did not do as the Devil tempted him, or perſwaded him to do; but he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Temptation, with this Reply, <hi>It is written, Man lives not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God:</hi> For there is Life in every Word of God. Thus our Lord overcame him; for Satan can't reſiſt, ſo as to make void, or
<pb n="520" facs="unknown:006297_0531_10285C0AAE8ECED8"/>
lay waſte the Words of God in the Holy Scriptures of Truth, when they are bro't into our Minds by his Spirit to uphold and promote the Kingdom of God and Chriſt, and to deſtroy the Kingdom of Sin and Satan; though he (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Devil) makes Uſe of thoſe Sacred Writings, often wreſting them, and bringing them for evil Uſes, and wrong Purpoſes, as moſt certainly he doth, when he alledgeth from them, that People can't live otherwiſe than in Sin.</p>
                     <p>"Then (as <hi>Matthew</hi> has it) he had our Lord to the Pinacle of the Temple, and bid him caſt himſelf down; for, ſays Satan, it is written, he ſhall give his Angels Charge concerning thee, left at any Time thou daſh thy Foot againſt a Stone." Though he was once overcome, yet he has the Boldneſs to tempt yet again: As Chriſt overcame him by his Power, making Uſe of the Holy Scriptures, he now tries what he can do with the Scriptures, he tempts Chriſt with them, that he might tempt his Father; and ſo he tempts poor Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals by the Scriptures, to keep them in Sin, by making a wrong Uſe of them, and miſapplying them; and if he can hold them in Sin, he knows 'tis the ready Way to cauſe the Almighty to be angry with them; and if they hold out in it to the End, to turn them at laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, where the Wicked muſt be turned. And he begins his Temptations with an, <hi>If thou be the Son of God,</hi> though he knew very well that he was the Son of God; yet like ſome of his evil Seed, or Seed of Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, tempted him to ſhew a Sign; but our Lord did not gratify either him or them, but rebuked them both, as they well deſerved; and ſo by Denial and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he overcame, and we alſo muſt the ſame Way. After this our Lord makes a true and right Uſe of the Scriptures, ſaying, <hi>It is written again, thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> And truly, thoſe who read the Holy Scriptures, and know how much they ſpeak againſt Sin, and for Righteouſneſs, and who yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding live in Sin and Ungodlineſs, and plead for it even from theſe Sacred Writings, which were

wrote on purpoſe to deſtroy Sin, ſhould ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether they are not guilty of tempting of God, which Chriſt ſays it is written thou ſhalt not do. Oh! that People would turn away from Sin and Satan, and break off from their Sins by Repentance, and their Iniquities by Amendment of Life, which is the Way to have the Days of their Tranquility lengthened out in this World, and to be happy in that which is without End to come; for, as it is written, <hi>The Wicked do not live out Half their Days</hi>; which, according to my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, is a true general Rule. How many have been taken off in their Prime and Strength, and in the Flower of their Years, who might, according to the Courſe of Nature, have lived many Years, had they been ſober and temperate, and lived in the Fear of God? If it be aſked, do not pious young People die alſo? Yes, but not ſo frequently as intemperate Ones; I have had Occaſion to obſerve it in divers Parts of the World; and beſides, if pious young People leave this World, their Exchange is glorious; whereas the Wicked and Ungodly make a ſad and bitter Exchange; and ſince Life is ſo uncertain, and Death ſo ſure and certain to all, even to Male and Female, what Care and Fear ought there to be on all, of offending ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful? God, and ſo ſweet a Saviour, who overcame, to ſhew us the Way to overcome alſo; and died for Sin, that we might die to the World, and the ſinful Part of it, and live to him, exhorting of us to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as he alſo did, and then promiſeth to take us for his Companions with himſelf, and his Father, in his heavenly Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Satan repeats his Temptation again a third Time; for he is an unwearied Enemy, and will tempt poor Mortals over and over, many Times; but he is to be reſiſted as often as he tempts, if we will follow the Counſel and Example of Chriſt; and this was his laſt Temptation for that Conflict, as one of the Evangeliſts obſerves, "he takes him up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an exceeding high Mountain, and ſheweth him all

Truth for ever: Nor do we read or underſtand of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Alteration thereof by Chriſt: Indeed the Miniſters of Antichriſt have made an Alteration (contrary to this Doctrine of his) in their Miniſtry; but the Holy Apoſtles, who after Chriſt were the firſt Planters of Chriſtianity in the Earth, when it ſhone in its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Beauty and Glory, they followed the Counſel of their Lord and Maſter, and miniſtred freely: Then was the Power of Chriſt's Miniſtry and Goſpel through his Miniſters and Servants great, and the Glory and Beauty thereof raviſhing to pious Souls. Oh! may every true Miniſter, and every ſenſible Soul, bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Moſt High, and bleſs the Holy Name of Him that lives and reigns for ever, for this unſpeakable Gift of Chriſt's Holy Miniſtry, which always was, now is, and ever will be, convincing and converting unto Souls, who are not ſlow of Heart to believe in God, and in his dear Son, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is our great High Prieſt, and the Biſhop of Souls; he ſaw the Need that his Church had of this his Miniſtry, and therefore he eſtabliſhed it in his Church, and among his Followers, to the End of Time.</p>
                  <p>Now, in order to this great and wonderful Work, he told his Diſciples (when he was going into his Glory and Kingdom of his Father) <hi>That he would pray to the Father, and he would ſend them another Comforter,</hi>

Oh that the Children of Men might love that which
<pb n="526" facs="unknown:006297_0537_10285C1AE1BE88D8"/>
appears to them, and convinceth them of their Sins; and ſurely it is a great Sin not to believe in the Spirit and Light of Chriſt: Such unbelieving Souls are in Darkneſs, and not yet turned from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the Power of Satan, to the Power of God, which was the very Work Chriſt's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were ſent of God to do.</p>

                  <p>"Beauſe I go to the Father," is the wonderful Cauſe given by Chriſt, for it is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs that muſt ſave the Soul, and Chriſt being gone to the Father, the Soul muſt go there to him, for all his Gifts and Favours, Mercies and Bleſſings, and muſt witneſs him in Spirit to be with them, and in them, as He is in the Father. When Chriſt was perſonally on Earth, He taught us by Words vocally expreſs'd; but "henceforth know we him ſo no more." Now He teacheth us by his Spirit, Light, and Life, which convinceth us of Form without Power, and Letter without Spirit, and Religion without Life, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs without Grace, and Light and imputative Righteouſneſs, without actual Righteouſneſs, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or formal Righteouſneſs in our own Wills (only) All

it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him: But ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> Oh! ye Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in this his Gift is your Strength, your Comfort, and your exceeding great Reward, both here and hereafter, for ever; far exceeding Silver or Gold, or the Diadems of Princes: The whole World wanting this, lieth in Wickedneſs, and muſt lie there unavoidably, if they have not the Senſe of this unſpeakable Gift: There cannot be Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, nor any ſaving Miniſtry without it; it being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely needful, to the Being and Well-being of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt: And indeed the holy Text is plain, and poſitive, that <hi>he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, is none of his</hi>; none of his Miniſter, none of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: Oh! No, they cannot be his in any good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whatſoever, without his Spirit. But if it ſhould be objected. How ſhall we do to know the Miniſter or the Man who hath this Divine Gift, or Spirit of Chriſt, ſince it may be pretended to both by Miniſters and People; and yet they may not have it in Reality? This indeed is a great Point, and highly neceſſary to be ſearched into, which is to be known by our Lord's Rule, which he has preſcribed for that End. <hi>Do Men</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>gather Grapes off Thorns, or Figs off Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles?</hi> (Surely No. The Grape is gathered from the Vine, and the Fig from the Fig-tree.) <hi>Wherefore by their Fruits ye ſhall knew them.</hi> Now thoſe (according to this true Rule) who have the Spirit, or Holy Ghoſt, they bring forth the Fruits of it: <hi>Which Fruits are Love, Charity, Meekneſs, Temperance, Patience, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, Hope, Faith, and Wiſdom from above, which is pure and peaceable, gentle and eaſy to be intreated,</hi> to all, and every Thing that is Good. And thoſe who have the Holy Spirit, bring forth the Fruits of it as naturally, as the Vine doth the Grape, and the Fig-Tree the Fig. Alſo, <hi>Whatſoever Things are holy, juſt, honeſt, pure, and of good Report,</hi> or tends to Piety, or Virtue; in a Word, every Thing that is Good, is
<pb n="529" facs="unknown:006297_0540_10285C2457B4C578"/>
the Fruit of the Spirit of God and Chriſt: And they are brought forth with Divine Life and Power in that Miniſter and People, who through true Faith in the bleſſed Jeſus, have received the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Miniſter of the Goſpel being thus fitly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every good Word and Work, he is ready to anſwer the Call of his great Lord and Holy Maſter, which is in Heaven; he wants not the Call of Man, nor Authority from Man, nor Wages of Man. But thoſe who bring forth Fruits contrary to the above, can neither be true Miniſter, nor Chriſtians, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctrine of our Holy Lord. Being thus qualified by the Moſt High, thoſe Miniſters are freely given up to ſerve the Lord, and go whereſoever he is pleaſed to ſend them, though he ſend them as Lambs among Wolves: And it is worth noting, that Chriſt's Meſſengers and Miniſters are called and ſent of him; they do not run of themſelves, nor in their own Will; which if they did, their End would be like the forward falſe Prophets of old, who did not profit the People at all.</p>
                  <p>Our great Lord ſeeing what Need the World had of true Teaching, and of true Teachers, ſends his Miniſters forth into it, ſaying. <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. 18, 19, 20. <hi>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth: Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all Things whatſoever I have commanded you: And lo, I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many of his excellent Sayings and Commands may be found in that wonderful Sermon which he preached on the Mount, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5th, 6th, and 7th Chapters.</p>
                  <p>Here Chriſt ſhews has Miniſters his Power, and ſends them forth in his own Name, for there is none other given under Heaven for Salvation; and Chriſt comforts his Miniſters with a glorious Promiſe, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with them to the End of the World. Oh the wonderful Sweetneſs of this gracious Promiſe! and ſuch are all his Promiſes, for they are Yea, and Amen, for ever. Wherefore Chriſt's Miniſters may well go forth without Doubting, having their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the King of Kings.

But this Thought of ſtarving, is for want of the Gift of God, and Power of Chriſt; which Power in the Miniſtry would wonderfully open Peoples Hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and thoſe who are his true Servants and Miniſters; who ſaid, <hi>freely ye have received, freely give.</hi> Oh! faithleſs Generation, what, ſhall we miſtruſt him who provides for all his Creatures, even to the Ravens and Sparrows, and will He not much more provide for his Servants and Miniſters?

                  <p>Chriſt ſends his Miniſters into the World, in order to propagate his Goſpel of Salvation, and to let the World know that he is come to put an End to Sin, and bring Life and Peace to the Soul, according to the Angels Teſtimony of him, that <hi>his Name ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Jeſus</hi> (which is a Saviour) <hi>for he ſhall ſave his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their Sins,</hi> Matt, i. 21. The Apoſtles of Chriſt alſo, according to their holy Commiſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that
<q>God had ſent his Son to bleſs us,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26.</note> in turning of us from the Evil of our Ways.</q>
But that Doctrine muſt certainly be oppoſite to this of the Angels, Chriſt, and his Diſciples, which teacheth, that we muſt live in Sin while on this Side the Grave, and that there is no being free from it while we are in this World; though Chriſt himſelf came for that very End and Purpoſe, to put an End to it, and to ſave us from it, and to bring unto, and into, the World, everlaſting Righteouſneſs; as alſo is that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which maintains, that there is no Perfection that we can attain to in this Life; though Chriſt ſays, <hi>Be ye perfect</hi> (for or) <hi>as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect</hi>; as he is perfect in Fulneſs, ſo are we to be perfect, according to the Meaſure of Grace received.
<pb n="532" facs="unknown:006297_0543_10285C2B9C99A7C0"/>
This Faith and Belief is much wanting in this unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generation, which is the Reaſon that People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their Sins, and the Peoples Leaders cauſe them to err, and their Miniſters miniſter in their Sin, and miniſter Sin to the People. Oh! that the Great Lord of All, may grant the Faith which purifies the Heart unto the Children of Men, and eſpecially to his Miniſters, that they might be inſtrumental to the convincing and converting Souls to Chriſt, and his "Goſpel, which is the Power of God to Salvation, to all them that believe." And as without believing, and being baptized, we can neither be ſaved, nor truly preach the Goſpel; How do we believe in Chriſt if we remain in our Sins? For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If ye believe not that I am He, ye ſhall die in your Sins</hi>: So it is plain, that the true Faith and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in Chriſt taketh away our Sins, and that if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in our Sins, it is evident that we have not the true Faith of Chriſt. It is not enough to have a noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal or hiſtorical Faith or Belief that Chriſt is the Son of God, but we muſt alſo believe that <hi>this is He,</hi> that as the Angel declared to <hi>Joſeph, ſhould ſave his People from their Sins.</hi> This was before he was born of the holy Virgin and thoſe People mightily miſtake the Doctrine of Chriſt in the Holy Scriptures, who think or believe they ſhall be ſaved in their Sins; and thoſe Miniſters muſt needs be antichriſtian, who preach and write, that there can be no living here in this World without Sin, which is alſo contrary to their own Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine at other Times, and to their ſolemn Covenant in the Water Baptiſm (or Sprinkling) in which they promiſe for their Children,

                  <p>Surely that Soul who cannot by all this ſee that there is an Overcoming, muſt certainly be blind as to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sight of the Doctrine of Chriſt; and what is it but to make Chriſt and the Holy Spirit a Deceiver, to promiſe all thoſe great Things to his Churches, if they cannot perform the Conditions He preſcribes; and if it were true (as it is not) that it is impoſſible to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Sin and Satan, then would Chriſt be a hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which is abſurd and wicked to ſuggeſt. But this Overcoming muſt not be in our own Wills, nor in our own Time, nor with our own Weapons, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Teſtimony of the Saints Weapons, and their Warfare, and alſo of his own Fight and Victory, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 4. <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong Holds</hi> (Satan's Holds of Sin are ſtrong Ones, if never to be overcome.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="535" facs="unknown:006297_0546_10285C33DD4C9470"/>But with theſe Weapons we may overcome: And He bids the Chriſtian put them on, and calls them the whole Armour of Light (oppoſite and contrary to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's dark Power) and he names them after this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>Stand therefore, having your Loins girt about with Truth, and having on the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, and your Feet ſhod with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace; above all, taking the Shield of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked, and take the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,</hi> Eph. vi. 13—17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have fought a good Fight, I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs; which God, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge, ſhall give to me at that Day, and not to me only, but to all them who love his Appearing,</hi> 2 Tim. iv. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Saints and primitive Chriſtians were vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious in this Chriſtian and Spiritual Warfare, and they encouraged others to follow them, as they did Chriſt. The very Belief of this Doctrine, that we can never overcome Sin and Satan, is contrary to the Faith of Chriſt, and is a mighty Engine of the Wicked One to deſtroy Souls; for what Encouragement can any have to the Work of Reformation, or to believe in or preſs after the New Birth, if they do not believe in the New-birth, or that they may or can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or created again a-new in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good Works, and that they muſt not walk after the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof. Oh that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and People would conſider that awful Sentence of Holy Scripture, <hi>viz. If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if ye, through the Spirit, mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. viii. 13. (The Want of a lively Hope and Faith in Chriſt, the Great Lord of Heaven and Earth, is great, very great indeed.) Oh that true Faith in him might abound and increaſe in the Earth more and more! then would he inſpire the Soul
<pb n="536" facs="unknown:006297_0547_10285C37B0C2FC88"/>
with inward Strength and Grace to reſiſt the Devil, and overcome him, and actually to do the Works of God, and to forſake the Devil, and all his Works, and then, and not until then, is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto us; ſo that true Chriſtians are truly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not only by Imputation, but by Action alſo. Oh that thoſe who make Profeſſion of Holy Jeſus would deny themſelves, and take up their daily Croſs, and follow him in the Regeneration! otherwiſe, how can they be his Diſciples or Miniſters? And then would true Chriſtianity flouriſh in the Earth; then would Chriſt be exalted over all, who, with the Father and Holy Spirit, is God bleſſed for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now to return a little to Chriſt's Baptiſm, <hi>viz. He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Here our Great Baptizer, and Chief Miniſter, is poſitive, that they ſhall be ſaved who are baptized with his Baptiſm; from which, with ſtrong Reaſon, we may conclude, that the Baptiſm which is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation is not Water-baptiſm, which was <hi>John</hi>'s, but Spiritual-baptiſm, which is Chriſt's; and for this Reaſon alſo, that moſt Chriſtians that have any Spiritual Underſtanding, do plainly ſee, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding People being baptized, or ſprinkled, with elementary Water, many live wicked, ungodly Lives, and die in that State; but quite the contrary Effect hath that Baptiſm which is of the Holy Ghoſt, and Spiritual Fire, which is Chriſt's Baptiſm; for that where it is witneſſed, and where People not only talk of it, but live according to its holy Operation on the Soul, it ſaveth and cleanſeth from Sin and Evil, it waſheth by Regeneration, and reneweth the Soul by Grace, with Divine Life and Power.</p>
                  <p>The Call of a true Miniſter, is from and by Chriſt, he muſt come to the School of Chriſt, and take his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees there; in the univerſal Love of God he muſt learn and experience Patience, Humility, Faith, Hope,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29.</note> and Charity; <hi>Learn of me,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>for I am meek and lowly in Heart</hi>; and yet, notwithſtanding,
<pb n="537" facs="unknown:006297_0548_10285C3A5D1E6050"/>
He was the great Heir of all Things, and all Power in Heaven and Earth was given unto him, He humbled himſelf to the Death of the Croſs, for the Sake of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and as the living Father ſent his Son, ſo the Son ſends his Servants contrary to the Will of Man, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>But I certify unto you, Brethren, that the Goſpel which was preached of me, is not after Man; for I neither received it of Man, nor was I taught it but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. i. 11, 12. Hereby it is plain he thought there was no abſolute Neceſſity of outward Learning, nor outward Call by Man.</p>
                  <p>And as there is no abſolute Neceſſity of outward Learning to make a Miniſter of Chriſt, ſo there is no Need to force an outward Maintenance; for Chriſt will take Care of his Servants, and feed and clothe them, when he ſends them, as he did his Diſciples, who went forth <hi>without Staff or Scrip,</hi> yet acknowledged; after their Return, <hi>they lacked nothing.</hi> And as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give</hi>; ſo there is no outward Compulſion or Force in Chriſt's Doctrine or Religion: Some are indeed of another Opinion, and have practized the contrary, and bring thoſe Words of Chriſt to uphold them in the Practice of forcing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where he ſays, in the Parable of the Marriage Supper, <hi>Go, compel them to come in</hi>; which was no other Compulſion or Force but that of Love, which is the greateſt Power in Heaven or Earth; to conſtrue our Saviour's Words in any other Senſe, would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and contrary to the whole tenor of his Doctrine and glorious Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>Thus then the Work of Chriſt's Miniſters is to bring the People to Chriſt, as He is their Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Saviour from Sin, and as He is their Comforter, and good Remembrancer, and their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guide into all Truth, in the Performance of which Work, they will have their Reward in this World, and in the World to come everlaſting Life. <hi>Amen.</hi>

This he wrote when he was illuſtrating the invincible and mighty Power of Faith, by the many wonderful Works that had been done thereby; and doubtleſs the Faith there ſpoken of, is the true Faith; and whatever is foretold in and through true Faith will moſt certainly be fulfilled, as this great and ſignificant Bleſſing of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to his Sons was: The good, old Man, calls his eldeſt Son to him, being diſpoſed to bleſs him, and bids him ſeek Veniſon, and make him Savoury Meat, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxvii. 3.4.

                  <p>It is hoped that no Chriſtian Ear will be offended to hear of the Converſion and great Change of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Perſon, who, though he was not favoured with the Bleſſing of Preference, or the natural Bleſſing of Birth-right (which he ſought with Tears, and could not find, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxvii. 38.) yet the Bleſſing of God's Grace and Favour (being the free Gift of the Almighty to him) with the Fatneſs of the Earth, he had, and it was delivered to him by his Father by Faith, as ſaith the Apoſtle, in the fore-cited Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. xi. 20.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Bleſſings have not only Reſpect to their own proper Perſons, but alſo to their Poſterity; but far from pre-ordaining them, or any of them, to Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and we have good Ground to believe, from (what is above, together with) the Reformation wrought in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> himſelf, much better Things of him; for it is written, <hi>When the wicked Man turneth away from his Wickedneſs which he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his Soul alive,</hi> Ezek. xviii. 27. <hi>So when a righteous Man turneth away from his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and committeth Iniquity, and dieth in them, for his Iniquity which he hath done ſhall he die,</hi> Verſe 26.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far taken Notice of the Purport of the Bleſſings of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> relating to their Perſons; who were both bleſſed with the Dew of Heaven, and the Fatneſs of the Earth, I would add this Remark, "Let none curſe him or them whom God hath bleſſed."</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Apoſtle, reciting the Words of the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> ſaith, Jacob <hi>have I loved, but</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated,</hi> Rom. ix. 13. This was not ſaid of them before they were born, or had done either Good or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
<pb n="542" facs="unknown:006297_0553_10285C4814A1BD00"/>
but was juſtly denounced by the Almighty for the Cruelty and Hatred of the Children of <hi>Eſau</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as is fully and clearly expreſſed by the Prophets, <hi>David, Ezekiel, Amos,</hi> and <hi>Obadiah; Pſalm</hi> cxxxvii. 7. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> xxv. 15. xxxv. 1—15. xxxvi. 5. <hi>Amos</hi> i. 11, 12. <hi>Obadiah</hi> 10, to 16. and was written many Ages after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The next Text under Conſideration is, "that the Lord hardened the Heart of <hi>Pharaoh," Exod.</hi> vii. 13. But it ſhould be obſerved, he had firſt harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf againſt God and his People, and then God hardened him yet harder, in order to ſhew his great Power to Mortals, which well conſiſted with his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the Wicked and Unmerciful; for as God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to the Righteous, ſo He is Juſt in his Judgment to the Ungodly.</p>
                  <p>So that God was clear of that evil Heart of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief in him, and it is but juſt, and alſo reaſonable, that when Man, having been often viſited, refuſeth the Offers of God's Love, that He ſhould viſit ſuch in and with his righteous Judgment (who have ſlighted his Mercy and Grace) And then, according to Holy Scripture,
<q>his Deſtruction is of himſelf, but his Help is in the Lord,</q>
                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> xiii. 9. So that
<q>God is true, and and every Man, contradicting him, is a Liar,</q>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 4.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore may all have a Care of hardening of their Hearts as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, for that is provoking to the Almighty, and then He juſtly gives them over to an evil Heart of Unbelief, and to a reprobate Mind, and ſo they depart from the living God. The Lord ſaid unto <hi>Pharaoh, let my People go,</hi> over and over, and it was the Mind of God he ſhould have done it: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe Men who hold the contrary, would make the Almighty ſuch an one as themſelves, to ſay one Thing, and mean another. What is that but to charge the Almighty with Hypocriſy? A Thing hated of him, and his Dear Son, Chriſt Jeſus. No, no, <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
                     <pb n="543" facs="unknown:006297_0554_10285C49AD57CDA8"/>
might have obeyed the Lord in a Day of Viſitation: But he refuſed, and ſaid, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his Voice, to let Iſrael go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Iſrael go,</hi> Exod. v. 2. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to harden himſelf againſt God, and his People, cruelly perſecuting them, and forcing them to make Brick without Straw, before we read that the Lord hardened his Heart. Oh! that all hard heared, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting, unbelieving People, might take Warning by him in time, before it be too late.</p>
                  <p>It is clear, he might have let the People Go; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God by <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded him ſo to do. And who can deny, that what God did, was more proper to ſoften, than to harden his Heart, by letting him ſee the Miracles wrought in his Name, and the Ceaſing of the Plagues he had inflicted; therefore it was poſſible for him to have done what God required of him; he was not predeſtinated to that Obduration, until he had hardened his own Heart; and then it was, is, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will be, juſt with God to ſuffer his, or any other Man's Heart to become hardened, and give them up to a reprobate Mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The following Scripture is wreſted, and falſly made uſe of, viz. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxvii. 11. <hi>He that made them, will not have Mercy on them; and He that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, will ſhew them no Favour.</hi> This Text hath, in ſome of the Writings of thoſe that eſpouſe the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Doctrine, been brought to vindicate that deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deſtructive, evil Principle, of Pre-ordination of particular Perſons to Deſtruction and Damnation: But this Text, with the reſt, brought for that End, is groſly perverted; for in the ſame Place the Caſe is fairly ſtated, and the Reaſon clearly ſhewn, why God will ſhew them no Favour, <hi>viz.</hi> "Becauſe they were withered Branches, and People of no Underſtanding; therefore he that made them, would not have Mercy upon them, and he that formed them, would ſhew them no Favour." From whence it appears, they might have
<pb n="544" facs="unknown:006297_0555_10285C4C32A024E0"/>
been fruitful, but would not, and had been green, but were withered from their Greenneſs; much like thoſe who Chriſt expoſtulates with, when He ſays, <hi>How often would I have gathered you as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not,</hi> Matt. xxiii. 37. <hi>If thou badſt known in this thy Day, the Things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thy Peace, but now they are bid from thine Eyes,</hi> Luke xix. 42. Which ſhews the great and fervent Deſire of Chriſt to ſave Souls, and his tender Love to poor Mortals, and that they had a Day of Viſitation, in which they might have been gathered, which is far from ordaining them to Deſtruction from all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>So that God is fully clear of all Men, and their Blood is on their own Heads, and their Deſtruction is of themſelves; whereas they might have Help in the Lord, and his Chriſt, through Faith, which he offers to Man freely; but Man will not receive or embrace it. And further, it ſhould be obſerved, that if the whole Texts of the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his 37th Chapter be conſidered, it will plainly appear, that he is ſo far from uttering an expreſs or poſitive Decree of their final Deſtruction, that he clearly and fully foretels their Recovery and Reſtoration out of that State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They argue from the Words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Hath not the Potter Power over the Clay, to make of the ſame Lump one Veſſel to Honour, and another to Diſhonour?</hi> Rom. ix. 21. Yes, doubtleſs he hath; but the Potter doth not make Veſſels with Deſign to deſtroy them, or to break them to Pieces, but for Uſe and Service; and it is contrary to his Will and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, when any Veſſel marrs under his Hand. And it is very plainly expreſſed by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> after mentioning his beholding the Work of the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the 18th Chapter, 6th, 7th, and 8th Verſes, <hi>O Houſe of Iſrael, cannot I do with you as this Potter? ſaith the Lord? Behold as the Clay is in the Potter's Hand, ſo are ye in mine Hand, O Houſe of Iſrael. At what Inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="545" facs="unknown:006297_0556_10285C52A44D26E0"/>
a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it: If that Nation againſt whom I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</hi> All which is contrary to the Doctrine of an abſolute, unconditional Predeſtination: The Lord, in his Wiſdom, and to ſhew his Power, doth make Souls more or leſs honourable, as he pleaſeth; but it is very plain, from Scripture, and right Reaſon, that He makes none with Deſign to deſtroy them, or hath ordained any to eternal Damnation. Though He hath ordained Damnation for wicked and ungodly Men, yet he never ordained that Men ſhould be wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They urge the Apoſtle's Words, but to as little Purpoſe as the former, <hi>Rom</hi> ix. 18. <hi>He will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will be hardeneth.</hi> 'Tis true, that God hath abundantly ſhewn us in the Holy Scriptures on whom He will have Mercy, <hi>viz.</hi> He hath Mercy on the Poor in Spirit; the Humble He teaches of his Ways; the Meek He guides in Judgment; He clothes the Meek with Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He hath the Righteous in everlaſting Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; He loveth them which love him; He ſaveth them who love his Dear Son, and believe in him; He giveth to them eternal Life, and Chriſt loveth them, and manifeſteth himſelf unto them. And his beloved Diſciple <hi>John</hi> declared, <hi>If any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt, the Righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the Sins of the whole World,</hi> 1 John ii. 1, 2. And the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith, <hi>But we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the Suffering of Death, crowned with Glory and Honour, that he, by the Grace of God, ſhould taſte Death for every Man,</hi> Heb. ii. 9. And all who believe in, and obey him, will partake of the Benefit of his Death and Suffering; <hi>but the
<pb n="546" facs="unknown:006297_0557_10285C542B19DFE0"/>
Wicked is ſnared in the Work of his own Hands,</hi> Pſal. ix. 16.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was in my Mind, and hath been, for ſome Years, to ſhew to the Preſbyterian, Independent, or Baptiſt People, or any other, who hold the Doctrine of particular perſonal Election or Reprobation, the Weakneſs of ſome of (what they call; their Proofs, for this (as I take it) corrupt and dangerous Doctrine of theirs, and the Miſapplication of thoſe Texts of Scripture, which they advance to maintain their abſurd Notion, of Souls being fore-ordained to Damnation eternally, whether they do Good or Evil, and that it is ſo determined, before we are born into the World, Oh! that thoſe People might come to true Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and lay hold of the univerſal Love of God to eternal Life, through the living Faith of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, in the tender Bowels of whoſe Love to all are thoſe Lines written, and in great Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will they are invited to ſearch the Scriptures, and to ſee whether the whole Scope of them do not ſhew the contrary to what they hold in Relation to perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to Deſtruction, fore-ordained before we are born, or have done either Good or Evil; there not being one Text to be found to prove that Doctrine: But there are abundance which ſet forth the Love, Mercy, and Goodneſs of God, to Mankind; only two of which I ſhall add hereunto, <hi>viz. And God ſaw that the Wickedneſs of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only Evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made Man on the Earth, and it grieved him at his Heart,</hi> Gen. vi. 5, 6. <hi>And Jonah aroſe, and went unto Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh, according to the Word of the Lord, and entered, and ſaid, Yet forty Days, and Nineveh ſhall be overthrown. So the People of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a Faſt, and put on Sackcloth, from the greateſt of them, even to the leaſt of them. And God ſaw their Works, that they returned from their evil Way, and God repented of the
<pb n="547" facs="unknown:006297_0558_10285C57441CE6F8"/>
Evil that he had ſaid he would do unto them, and be did it not,</hi> Jonah iii. 3, 4, 5, 10. I heartily deſire that theſe two Texts may be duly conſidered, and weighed, therein the Mercy, Loving-kindneſs, and long For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God, being ſo clearly and fully manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I think may be ſufficient to convince every unprejudiced Mind of the Error of believing in that Principle of the abſolute Predeſtination of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any Part of Mankind to Deſtruction.</p>

I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a few Days ago, I having been viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People along the Sea-ſhore in the <hi>Jerſeys</hi> (in the Love of Chriſt, hoping to bring ſome to him) among whom, in a general Way, the Goſpel which I had to preach in his Name, found Acceptance, for which I was truly thankful; and tho' I had no earthly Conſideration for ſo doing, yet I had that inward Satisfaction, that I thought I would not exchange or part with it for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Revenue: And at my Return I received thy friendly Letter, which I was glad of, and that
<pb n="549" facs="unknown:006297_0560_10285C5DCFB00590"/>
mine to thee found that Acceptance, ſo as to anſwer my Requeſt.</p>
                  <p>And whereas thou ſay'ſt thy Aim and Hope hath been to perſwade us who call ourſelves Friends (we profeſſing ourſelves Friends to all People) that our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Streſs ſhould be upon the grand Point of <hi>Chriſt within</hi>; we having found, by Experience, living and bleſſed Experience, the great Benefit and Comfort of his moſt ſweet and glorious Preſence, by the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Power, Spirit and Grace, in and to our Souls, we cannot do otherwiſe than lay the greateſt Streſs thereon, our Benefit therein, and thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not eaſily expreſſed, ſo as to be underſtood by the carnal Mind, or to thoſe who are in a State of Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; <hi>Chriſt within</hi> was, is, and ever will be, the Hope of the ſanctified Soul's Glory, though a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hid from Ages of unregenerate People, or from thoſe who are in the Reprobation; <hi>Know ye not your ownſelves, that Chriſt is in you, except ye be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 5. <hi>Col.</hi> i. 2.</p>
                  <p>From the above I would not be underſtood, as though I believed that Chriſt is no where but in his People; neither did I ever underſtand any of our Friends ſo, though we have been often miſrepreſented on that Head.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Ceremony of the Hat, and the Plural Language to ſingle Perſons, I thus anſwer, that many of us left that Way of Salutation and Speaking, thro' ſtrong Conviction, accompanied with theſe Reaſons;</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> It being a Reſpect we pay Almighty God, <hi>He being our Head, is honoured by uncovering our Head</hi> (as ſaid the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 4.) We think for that Reaſon it is not right to uncover our Heads to Men; but that to give one another our Hands, in an inward and hearty Reſpect, is better.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> We read in the Holy Scriptures, that <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi> could not bow to <hi>Haman</hi> for Conſcience Sake, <hi>Eſther</hi> iii. 4. and I think it may ſafely be concluded,
<pb n="550" facs="unknown:006297_0561_10285C5F72ADEC38"/>
that he did not take off his Hat, or uncover his Head, though he was in Danger to have ſuffered for it. And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The three Children of God walked in the Preſence of the great King of <hi>Babylon</hi> (and thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him) with their Hats on; and they ſtood the King's Fury, and the Fire, though ſeven Times hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than uſual, with their Hats on, as there related in <hi>Dan.</hi> iii. 21.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech thee, my good Friend, to conſider the Tenor of the Holy Scriptures maturely, and then I hope thou will not think the Hat, and the Language of <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to a ſingle Perſon, to be needleſs Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Incumbrances, according to our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Practice; I do not write thus to thee for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, nor in a contentious Spirit or Mind, but in the innocent Love of our dear Lord Jeſus, and for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, or, if Need be, for Information.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, as to <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to a ſingle Perſon, I anſwer, That the Holy Scripture (or the Words of God therein recorded) is by all Proteſtant Profeſſors of Chriſt, acknowledged a Rule to us all, next to the Holy Spirit, from whence they came, or the Holy Ghoſt, that our Saviour promiſed "ſhould lead into all Truth, and abide with the true Believers for ever;" and that God and Chriſt's Spirit, doth not contradict the Holy Scriptures, which came and proceeded from thence: This general Propoſition we all agree to, if we rightly underſtand one another.</p>
                  <p>Then, according to this Rule, our plain Language is right, otherwiſe I ſhall be obliged to thee to ſhew us wherein we err from that good Rule. Now, the Moſt High thought good to teach and uſe that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in the Beginning to our firſt Parents; ſo that it is our Mother Tongue, and it is the Language of the Bible, or Holy Scriptures, from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> I ſuppoſe I need not tell thee, that <hi>You</hi> to a ſingle Perſon had its Riſe from Pride and Flattery; and
<pb n="551" facs="unknown:006297_0562_10285C6262B40498"/>
thyſelf knoweth, that <hi>You</hi> to a ſingle Perſon, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor good Grammar.</p>
                  <p>And if I am rightly informed, your Forefathers, as well as ours, made uſe of this plain Scripture Language of <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to a ſingle Perſon, in their firſt Separation from the common Sinners of their Times.</p>
                  <p>Though I thus apologize for the plain Scripture Language, yet in Reſpect of Faith or Grace, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to be believed, which are abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, I call theſe but ſmall Things; but we are not to deſpiſe the Day of ſmall Things, if we are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the little, or leſs, we have the Promiſe of more or greater Things, <hi>Luke</hi> xix. 17.</p>
                  <p>I pray thee excuſe this long Letter of Epiſtle; for it ſeems to me but meet that we ſhould render a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for our Diſuſe of thoſe Things uſed by ſome (of moſt Societies) profeſſing the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                  <p>And in Reſpect of Water-Baptiſm, and the Bread and Wine: 1ſt, As to Water-baptiſm, I have this to anſwer, the which I hope thou wilt charitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Account that we have of it, is from <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who firſt practiſed it, according to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Evangeliſts give concerning it, and he ſaid, <hi>I indeed baptize with Water, but he</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire</hi>; plainly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between the two Baptiſms, and the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of them; adding, <hi>I ſhall decreaſe, but he ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi>: He ſpoke not of their Perſons; but of their Diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Dell,</hi> a bright and learned Man in his Day (and, as I take it, when he flouriſhed moſt in Divine Religion) wrote an excellent Piece on the Subject of Baptiſm, which be pleaſed to peruſe; it is very evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, and well worth reading; I ſhall take Care to procure thee one of his Books; I am the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about this Subject, becauſe thou art poſitive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our coming to it, if we improve in Wiſdom:
<pb n="552" facs="unknown:006297_0563_10285C663235CA50"/>
But I would hope to be in ſome Meaſure inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to convince thee that there is no abſolute Need (in order to Salvation) to go into or unto the Water or Element; but that it is abſolutely neceſſary for us to go unto and into Chriſt, that being the Way to be new Creatures, as it is written, <hi>He that is in Chriſt, is a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 17.</p>
                  <p>Our dear Lord on this Subject ſays, <hi>John truly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with Water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Here our Saviour, as well as <hi>John,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth between the two Diſpenſations: <hi>John</hi>'s was indeed a glorious Diſpenſation in its Time; but Chriſt's far exceedeth it in Glory, and is to endure for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> remembred this Doctrine of Chriſt, when the Holy Spirit's Baptiſm was come, <hi>Then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I remembred the Word of the Lord, John baptized with Water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts xi. 16. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſays, <hi>He was not ſent to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but to preach the Goſpel</hi>; which, when truly preached, hath a ſpiritual baptizing Power attending it; and if we come rightly to be baptized with the Holy Spirit, and Fire of the Divine Word, we ſhall witneſs a Renovation, and the Work of Reformation and Regeneration will go forward more and more, both without and within, in Body and in Spirit, for which every true Chriſtian and Miniſter of Chriſt longs and prays with fervent Deſires; the Apoſtle ſays (and pray be pleaſed to judge for what Reaſon) <hi>That the Kingdom of Heaven is not Meat or Drink, but Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>

                  <p>I know I am writing to one who in many Things is far before me; ſo that I write in a Fear, mixed with Chriſtian Love; and if it meet with the ſame Love in thee, that will cover a Multitude of Faults.</p>

                     <pb n="553" facs="unknown:006297_0564_10285C67B6BDAFE8"/>And as to the Supper or Ceremony of Bread and Wine (which is called a Sacrament, which Word we find not in the Bible) we do not underſtand that our Lord laid it as an Injunction on his Followers to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve or practice to Perpetuity; or that the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, and that his Church ſhould be in the Practice of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of either Water to dip in, or ſprinkle with, or Bread and Wine to eat or drink, as a laſting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to be obſerved by his Believers in an outward Way for ever.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me</hi>; which to me ſeems to leave it indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Alſo from the Debates and Contentions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians about it, and the Blood that hath been ſpilt and ſhed in this Controverſy, and the many Doubts ariſing concerning it, I think it is evident, that Chriſt was not poſitive that his Followers ſhould be found to Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity therein; and where he ſays, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you,</hi> or for many; <hi>and drink, this is my Blood which is ſhed for many</hi>; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is not to be doubted but that he pointed at his Fleſh and Blood, rather than the Bread and Wine (as in a Figure) and that alſo he had an Eye to his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fleſh and Blood or Body, as where he ſays, <hi>Except ye eat my Fleſh, and drink my Blood, ye have no Life in you</hi>; the which every true Chriſtian ſhould daily feed upon, and without which we have no Divine Life in us; and as himſelf alſo ſaid, <hi>My Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is worthy of note, that much of his Holy Words, and heavenly Doctrine, was ſpiritually to be underſtood; <hi>My Words</hi> ſays he, <hi>are Spirit and Life</hi>; a glorious Speech to ſuch as truly witneſs and underſtand it, which is much better felt by a true believing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian than expreſſed: Ohmay we ſo open our Hearts to our beloved Jeſus, that he may come in unto us, and that we may ſup with him, and he with us, and that

                     <p>ONE of the firſt Things pious and good Chriſtians generally endeavour to inſtil into their Children, in their Youth, is,<note place="margin">1730.</note> the true Knowledge of God; and that he made them, and for what End.</p>
                     <p>The Almighty made us all on Purpoſe for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that we ſhould ſerve and worſhip Him, as ſaid the Four and Twenty Elders who ſtand before the Throne of God, and worſhip Him continually, ſaying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power: For thou haſt created all Things, and for thy Pleaſure they are, and were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> Rev. iv. 8,—11.</p>
                     <p>Man being a noble (if not the nobleſt) Piece of this viſible Creation, was doubtleſs made and created for a Purpoſe of his Glory.</p>
                     <p>But Sin is of the Devil, and did, and (if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of) always will diſhonour God, and bring Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in upon both Body and Soul.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, O Youth! be prevail'd upon before it be too late, rightly to <hi>remember thy Creator in thy Youthful Days, before the evil Day come.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it will be an evil Day to thy Soul, when God by his Spirit leaves ſtriving with thee, and leaves thee to thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: For he hath ſaid, His <hi>Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man, for that he alſo is Fleſh,</hi> Gen. vi. 3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="558" facs="unknown:006297_0569_10285C758D26B6E8"/>While therefore God by his Spirit is ſtriving with thee, and calling thee by his Grace to Repentance, and to turn from the Evil of thy Ways, ſaying, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die? Turn at my Reproof, and I will pour out of my Spirit upon you, and make myſelf known unto you.</hi> Again, <hi>I ſtand at the Door and knock</hi> (here's a holy Stroke at the Heart) <hi>if any Man will hear my Voice</hi> (ſee the univerſal and unlimited Love of God in Chriſt to poor Mortals) <hi>and open the Door, I will come in to him,</hi> Rev. iii. 20.</p>
                     <p>If Man will open the Door of his Heart to his Maker and Saviour, he will come unto, or into his Soul. O Soul! no Gueſt in the World like this heavenly Gueſt; no Companion, no Friend in the World, like this great, this choice Friend, Almighty God. Oh! <hi>ſeek him while he is yet to be found, and call upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forſake his Way, and the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man his Thoughts</hi> (that are evil) <hi>and return to the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him</hi> (and as ſay the Righteous, who ſeek the Glory of God, and the Good of Souls) <hi>and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. lv. 7.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, <hi>Turn, turn, O turn! why will ye die,</hi> ye curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Workmanſhip of God's holy Hands, ye fine and beautiful young Men and Women?</p>
                     <p>The Youth ſhould alſo gratefully and obediently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their careful Fathers, and indulgent and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mothers: Unto ſuch Youths God has promiſed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the which Promiſe I have ſeen fulfill'd in many Thouſands; and God is more and more fulfilling of it every Day; and will fulfil it to the End of Time.</p>
                     <p>And how reaſonable is it that we ſhould remember with Tenderneſs, our Father who begat us, and not to diſobey him in his lawful and juſt Commands, nor wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly or willingly vex or grieve him?</p>
                     <p>Pray how ſhall we be ever able to pay or retaliate him for all his Care, and the Coſt and Charge he hath been at in bringing of us up, till we come to be young
<pb n="559" facs="unknown:006297_0570_10285C77422A3300"/>
Men and Women? Can we ever do enough for him that hath done ſo much for us?</p>
                     <p>Oh! how unhandſome it is, as well as irreligious and unchriſtian, for a young Man or Woman, when their Parents are old, and perhaps full of Aches and Pains, or otherwiſe in Years and in bad Health, to treat them with Scorn and Contempt, or be ſurly and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and flout at and diſobey their wholeſome Counſel and Advice.</p>
                     <p>On ſuch young People I have ſeen the heavy Hand of God in my Day, and made Obſervations thereof, many and many a Time. O! the many diſobedient Youth that I have ſeen, that have been Examples and Warnings to others, of the juſt Judgment of God Almighty, upon diſobedient and prophane young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and indeed too many old Ones too.</p>
                     <p>But the Youth are too apt to think and ſay, Our Bones are full of Marrow, and our Veins of Blood, and our Blood is warm; we cannot be ſo dull and heavy as old Men.</p>
                     <p>Well, who hath fill'd, and by whoſe Providence are your Bones and Veins full of Marrow and Blood? Is it not God? Is it not in Him you <hi>live, move, and have your being?</hi> What hath the Devil and Sin to do with all this? Should not God have the Marrow of your Days? And ſhould not Youth ſerve Him with their pureſt or fineſt Blood? And ſhould they not be warm, and not lukewarm or cold, in and towards the Things of God and Heaven?</p>
                     <p>Thus to be vigorous and manly in the Work of God, is truly and rightly to honour our Parents, as God commands.</p>
                     <p>It is not to honour them with the Mouth and Lips only, but with the Heart, and with ſerving God; for that is the Honour ſpoken of in the Holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>None can rightly honour their Parents, who diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God. If a young Man or Woman is reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and of a diſcreet Conduct, and of a ſober and
<pb n="560" facs="unknown:006297_0571_10285C7A4A9B7C10"/>
juſt Converſation: That indeed is a real Honour to, and honouring of our Parents. For, ſay People, when they behold juſt and religious Youths, when their Father is living, <hi>Oh! how happy is that Man in his Children!</hi> And indeed it is an honourable Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: When, on the other Hand (Pity! Oh! Pity! Pity!) how many fine Youths, to look at (at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to outward Appearance) have, through their Diſobedience, and vile Practice, brought down the grey Hairs of their careful and tender Parents, with Sorrow to the Grave.</p>
                     <p>And, as if their own Ruin and their Parents was not enough, bring, through their Intemperance and Folly, Ruin and Deſtruction on their Poſterity alſo; and what their Parents have with great Labour gain'd to bring them up, and educate them till they come to Maturity, they in a little Time ſpend extravagantly and intemperately, as well as fooliſhly and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; and ſo bring Ruin and Deſtruction ſwiftly on themſelves and Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>And another Subject but ſeldom ſpoken of, or han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, is the extraordinary Regard we ſhould have to oblige our Mothers, and the tender Care we ſhould take to nouriſh and comfort them in Age; and not vex or grieve them, if poſſible we could help it, for many Reaſons, beſides our religious Duty, as above, in Relation of Honour to Parents. And let me remind the Youths of this Age, of either Sex, that in the Time of the Law (the Law of God under the <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Diſpenſation) the diſobedient Youths were to be brought out of the Camp or City, and all the People were to ſtone them to Death.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, our Goſpel-diſpenſation, or the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſweet Jeſus, is not ſo rigorous; but much more mild and gentle, as to the Body; yet, as to the Soul, without Repentance, the Diſobedient to natural Parents in general (beſides to our Father in Heaven in particular) entail, upon them an eternal Curſe in the
<pb n="561" facs="unknown:006297_0572_10285C7F4ABF53D8"/>
World to come, and many Croſſes and Difficulties in this World. And herein the Goſpel exceeds the Law, it gives Time for Repentance, mixes Mercy with Judgment, and ſanctifies our Troubles, Croſſes and Afflictions, to us, through Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life; whereas the Law in old Time was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted without Mercy or Pity, and with fierce Wrath, Vigour and Anger.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the tender Mother. Oh! the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Soul of the tender Mother, how it yearns over the diſobedient Son or Daughter! And who that hath not a Heart of Flint or Adamant, but would comply or yield to the wholeſome Advice and Counſel of ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Parent, who brought us into the World? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to ſuch a near Parent, one would think ſhould conſtrain us to it.</p>
                     <p>However, if Religion or Affection is not ſo predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, let Reaſon do it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis a rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that thy Mother ſuffered many Pains, and much Sickneſs, which thou wert the Occaſion of, even before thou wert brought forth into the World, beſides the dolorous, bitter Pangs and Pains of Child-birth, which have coſt the Life of many a tender Mother.</p>
                     <p>And conſider the firſt Month after thou wert born, O the Care and tender Concern, the Watching, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Charge, cannot eaſily be expreſs'd! What running to the Phyſician upon every Symptom or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of being ill, or out of Order? And muſt all this be forgotten? O Height of Ingratitude! which too many poor young People are guilty of.</p>
                     <p>Though bleſſed be the Almighty Lord, there are ſome who are truly and humbly thankful to God and their Parents for their Being, and their Well-being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they can never fully requite Him or their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                     <p>Now, after our firſt Month, what a deal of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue and Trouble we give our Mothers, who ſtill, if they give us Suck (as many Mothers do; even
<pb n="562" facs="unknown:006297_0573_10285C81F52AB7C0"/>
Queens and Princeſſes, and many noble Women, not diſdaining to give their Children Suck from their own Breaſts, which certainly is the moſt natural Way of bringing up and nouriſhing them; though, on ſome Conſiderations, a Nurſe may be diſpens'd with) how do we partake of their own Blood, to the waſting of their Spirits, and oftentimes their Fleſh alſo?</p>
                     <p>Surely nothing but Love and Duty could engage a Mother to the great Care and Fatigue which ſhe is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to in Nurſing and Suckling her Children, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if before-hand in the World? Who can expreſs the Toil and Care to keep the poor unthinking little Ones quiet, and the many weary Steps and Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to keep them from Crying? Although, by the Way, when they grow up, their Mothers may cry Night and Day too, and they take but too little No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the rebellious, ingrateful, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Youth.</p>
                     <p>O Youth! muſt all this be forgotten? Muſt all this have no Conſideration with you, and bear no due Weight upon your Minds! Oh! ſurely no: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid!</p>
                     <p>The firſt Year being gone (which is oftentimes but the Beginning of Sorrow to the Parents) then they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be truſted alone, or out of Sight, except in ſome good Hand; and if 'tis never ſo little miſſing, then cries the Mother, <hi>Oh! where's the Child? What have you done with my Child? Who has got it?</hi> And never reſts till ſhe's ſatisfy'd about it; and when 'tis brought to her, O how ſhe embraces and kiſſes it, as if ſhe would wrap its Soul up in her own! and then the Heart, the Boſom, and the Breaſt, are all open to it. What endearing Expreſſions are pour'd out to it from its tender Mother! as, <hi>My Dear, my Love, my Jewel,</hi> &amp;c. and ſometimes from ſome Sort of Perſons ſuch fond Expreſſions as are not juſtifiable.</p>
                     <p>But, O melancholy Conſideration! all this Love and Tenderneſs is too often rewarded with Hard-heartedneſs
<pb n="563" facs="unknown:006297_0574_10285C8397FDEFF0"/>
and Cruelty; the Mother may cry, and die too, if ſhe will, for her <hi>Dear Love,</hi> and <hi>Precious Jewel,</hi> when grown up to Man or Woman's Eſtate! From ſuch Ingratitude may the Lord deliver us!</p>
                     <p>This Conſideration is remarkable, as we are alſo the Workmanſhip of God, and human Creatures, That of all the Creatures God hath made, there's ſcarcely any ſo helpleſs ſo long as Man; ſo that Man is ſo much the more obliged to his Parents, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly his Mother, who feeds us when we can't feed ourſelves, and carries us long before we can go alone, and defends us from Harm, or we muſt periſh. After all this, to be unkind and diſobedient to our Parents, is great Ingratitude; and I ſcarce ever ſaw it go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, even in this World: And pray let the Youth conſider how it is like to fare with them in the next; for I addreſs myſelf to thoſe who believe the ſacred Writings of the Holy Scriptures; for to others, ſome Things herein may ſeem fabulous, as <hi>Judgment to come</hi> doth to the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> tho' divers of them feel it begin to come before they go out of the World, as hath been the Caſe of many which might be mentioned.</p>
                     <p>From the Breaſt, and the Arms, to the ſeventh Year of our Age, who can relate the World of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our parents have with us to keep us out of Harm's Way, to keep us from bad Company, to keep us in Health as much as lays in their Power, to clothe us, and keep us whole and clean, and take Care that we learn no ill Words or Manners; for about this Time, little Youths are very apt to learn Good or Evil; and the careful, virtuous Parents, would do well to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cultivate their tender Minds, and to plant Things good and profitable in them betimes. It often turns to good Account (though not always) and when it doth not, the Parents, having done their Duty are clear of their Blood, and of what Miſchief may befal them through their Ungodlineſs, and Folly, and Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, afterwards.</p>

A good Underſtanding, good Manners, and good Principles, a religious, wiſe and diſcerning, Parent, would eſteem before Letters and Figures; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to be well inſtructed in theſe alſo, is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the other preferable. And here let Teachers and the Youths be careful of Idleneſs, for that is the Mother of many Miſchiefs; and bad Words, bad Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and bad Company, ought to be avoided, which taint and corrupt the Minds of the little tender Youths.</p>
                     <p>'Tis melancholly to think of it, that ſome Youths, who never heard bad Words in their Father's Houſe, ſuch as taking the Sacred Name in vain, Curſing, Swearing, Talking rudely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould come from School full with it, ſo that the good Intention of the Parents in giving their Youth Schooling, is then cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented in a great Degree; to regulate which, the Parents and Tutors ſhould join together in a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Diſcipline. Some indulgent Parents mightily hurt their Youth by tying up the Hands of their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from diſcreet Correction. No diſcreet Teacher will uſe Broom or Mop-ſtick, or Door and Window-bars, to correct their Youths; that would be unmanly, as well as unwiſe; but the Rod never did hurt, in a ſkilful Hand. And both at Home and at School, 'tis profitable for the Youth to be diligent in Reading the Holy Scriptures, which are preferable to all other Books, though other good Books are profitable alſo, and beneficial to improve the Underſtanding; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as filthy and irreligious corrupt Romances, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Play-Books often poiſon, and are the Bane or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

in of Youth; and when once they come to be in Love with thoſe black dark Works, ſacred Truths are of little Value with them, which is an evident Token or Sign of the evil Tendency of evil Books: Though there may be ſome Sort of Philoſophy in ſome of them, yet, it 'tis vain, and Lies, and Deceit, we had Need to be careful our Youth are not ſpoil'd therewith; and indeed thoſe of riper Years are often hurt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, elſe why did the learned Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> write to the primitive Chriſtians, to <hi>beware leſt any of them ſhould be ſpoil'd through</hi> [wrong] <hi>Philoſophy, and vain Deceit,</hi> Col. ii. 8. If all this Care and Pains, beſides Charge, ſhould be forgotten, it betokens great Stupidity.</p>
                     <p>From Fourteen to Twenty-one, more Care comes on a-freſh upon the Heart and Mind of the faithful and loving Father, and affectionate and tender Mother, that their Offspring may do well, both as to this World, and alſo to that which is to come. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed commendable, and alſo a Duty in the Parents, to take Care in putting their Children in a Way, as much as lies in their Power, to live in the World; but, above all Things, to endeavour to promote their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs and Intereſt in the Life to come. This is ſo much the more honourable, by how much the one is external, and the other eternal. O Eternity! Eternity! that we did but think more upon it, tho' we thought leſs of the Externals; although ſome think too little upon the ſubſtantial Part of them too, and forget to be juſt in the Things of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> or between Man and Man.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Youth; and as to Trade, the Law of Nations forbids them to trade, or to trade with them, till they arrive at the Years of Twenty One, as ſuppoſing their Underſtanding not fully ripe for Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs till that Age; and therefore many, and ſome of the wiſeſt Heads on the Earth, and Men of vaſt Eſtates, have thought it rational and proper for Youth to be put Apprentice for ſeven Years: This is look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="566" facs="unknown:006297_0577_10285C8A8EA79258"/>
as expedient, although they have many Thouſands to give them when they come to Age: And indeed many Youths have been ruined and undone for Want of ſuch Service; and ſome of the brighteſt and fineſt of our young Men have ſpent more before they arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that Age, than their Parents had to begin the World withal; nay, ſome, many times more, for want of Employ in ſome commendable Calling; for having ſo much idle Time on their Hands, they have taken to idle Company, and become idle Companions themſelves alſo; and ſo the Youth have corrupted one another, to their geat Hurt and Damage, as to their outward Subſtance; and which is yet worſe, as to their Soul's Welfare; and ſuch <hi>evil Communication corrupts good Manners</hi>; and if they were employed in Buſineſs, they in this Reſpect would be out of Harm's Way, out of the Way of thoſe Rooks that would make a Prey of them.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Well-doing and Being of the Youth in the Time of his ſeven Years Servitude, we ought to be very careful to chuſe ſuch Maſters as are of good Report: Firſt, as to their Religion, Ingenuity, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Juſtice and Temperance, and one who hath acquir'd to a Way of living well: Such a Maſter is worthy, and ought to be obey'd. It often happens, that before this Time is over, the Youth are uneaſy, and are wont to go home to their Parents, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; but without a real Occaſion or Neceſſity. It is far better, and much more honourable for young Men to ſtay out their appointed Time: And then when they come to have their lawful Liberty, it will be more ſweet to them; and People will be the more free and engaged to deal and trade with them, and the Parents will have the greater Encouragement to ſet them up in their Calling. A common Maxim, which is generally fulfilled, is worthy of Note here <hi>(i. e.) Thoſe that are good for their Maſters, are good for themſelves,</hi> and it moſtly happens ſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="567" facs="unknown:006297_0578_10285C8ECF76D4F0"/>And as to Maſters, ſince they are generally Gainers by the Service and Work of their Servants, they ought to uſe them well, as to their Accommodations, and not to exact their Labour to Oppreſſion, <hi>remembering we have all a Maſter, which is in Heaven,</hi> and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of us (let our Condition be what it will in this World) muſt be accountable for the Deeds done here on Earth, to him in his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>It muſt not here be forgotten, that Servants ought not to ſerve their Maſters with Eye-ſervice; but juſtly do their Duty as though they were actually preſent, or really in View. And as their Indentures bind againſt Cards and Dice, and all unlawful Games, and Gaming being very deſtructive to Youth, as well as to their Maſters Intereſt, it is in an eſpecial Manner to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; for Gaming leads into many other Evils, and, at the beſt, tends to draw the Heart and Mind from heavenly to earthly Things. Alſo the Servant is not to ſee his Maſter any Ways defrauded, it being all one in the Foundation, whether the Servant doth it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or ſees (with Approbation) another do it; and that which would make the Time the pleaſanter, and ſeem not ſo long and tedious, is to be chearful and good natur'd, and to be ſure to frequent the publick Worſhip of Almighty God; and Maſters would do well to let their Servants go ſometimes to more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Duty; and if the Servant be conſcientious, the Maſter will be no Loſer by ſuch Indulgence. Alſo Servants ought to be kind to their Maſters Children, which is reputable; and Maſters ought not to let their Children inſult their Servants; and if the Servants me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Correction, let it be done prudently, and not in a Fury, or in the Heat of Paſſion; for ſuch Correction, in the Heat of Paſſion, oftner hardens the Heart, than amends the Manners of the Youth ſo corrected.</p>
                     <p>Both the Maſter and the Servant ought ſtrictly to obſerve, and not to break their Covenants which they have mutually agreed to in their Indentures, ſign'd and ſealed before Witneſſes, or elſe they loſe their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="568" facs="unknown:006297_0579_10285C92A2F99D00"/>
to Juſtice, and as it is not prudent nor juſt, neither is it lawful ſo to do. It is a great Hapineſs in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily when the Maſter and Miſtreſs, Men-Servants and Maid-Servants, live together in Love and Good-will, and endeavour to promote each others Intereſt: Then when there is Occaſion to part, the good Wiſhes of each other go along with theſe who go, and ſtay with thoſe who ſtay. And the Care of Parents in this Affair, is worthy the Youth's ſolid Thought and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                     <p>Thus after the fine and ſprightly young Man hath faithfully ſerved his Apprenticeſhip, and is arrived to the Age of one and twenty Years, when it is lawful for him and others to deal and trade one with another, then it may be ſuitable for him to marry according to the Ordinance of God, and his early Inſtitution in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, who then ſaid (and his Word is the ſame to this Day) <hi>It is not good for Man to be alone,</hi> whatever others may ſay to the contrary. Oh! what Pity and Shame it is, that ſo many (otherwiſe) great Wits, and fine flouriſhing young Men, ſhould plead and practiſe againſt lawful Marriage, to their laſting Reproach and Infamy; and if they ſhould have any Poſterity, it is a Scandal on them alſo, tho' they are innocent; for through their Parents Faults, they are pointed at as il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate: And the inevitable Conſequences of ſuch filthy Mixtures, are monſtrous Confuſion.</p>
                     <p>But let us hope and endeavour better for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent riſing Generation, and our hopeful and flouriſhing Youths: And ſince the State of Marriage is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding happy State of Life, if perform'd in the Fear and Love of God, and with Conſent of Parents and Parties concern'd; and otherwiſe the Reverſe: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidering the Baſhfulneſs of ſome Youths (and ſometimes to a great Fault) it might be well for the Parents in Time to propoſe Marriage to their Children, who ſometimes have been loſt for Want of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it in the Fear and Love of God; and indeed it being one of the greateſt Concerns in Life, and being
<pb n="569" facs="unknown:006297_0580_10285C94276F8520"/>
for Life, a young Man and a young Woman ought therefore to act therein with the greateſt Care and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ought the Parents alſo. And let the Parents be helpful to their Youth, according to their Ability, and according to the Induſtry of the Youth, and ſtill be helping them, which is an Encouragement to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and virtuous young People. By being too ſtrait-handed, there may be a wiſhing for the Death of the Parents, ſaying, <hi>They cannot carry it with them to their Graves</hi>; yet the Parent is not to impoveriſh himſelf for his Children; for that hath ſometimes ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd both Parents and Children alſo.</p>
                     <p>The Parents may propoſe, but the Youth ought to chuſe, becauſe they muſt live and die by it; the chief Motive of Marriage ought to be pure and true Love, which the Parents cannot give to the Children for each other; they may give them Money, and give them Advice, but they cannot give them Love; and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, by over-awing and over-perſwading them, have brought Ruin on many a beautiful Son and Daughter.</p>
                     <p>In this Caſe of Marriage, the Choice (if we deſign to be happy for Term of Life) ought to be a virtuous Perſon: That ought to be our chiefeſt Aim. Our Happineſs doth not conſiſt in either Riches, or Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for <hi>Riches make themſelves Wings, and fly away,</hi> Prov. xxiii. 5. And Beauty is a fading Flower: Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is much more preferable and enduring; to have all theſe together in one Perſon, is ſuch a Rarity as is hard to be found. And in this great Caſe of Marriage, it is an excellent Thing to be equally match'd, or in the Apoſtle's Words, <hi>equally yok'd:</hi> Not one of one Perſwaſion in Religion, and the other of another; not one very old, and the other very young: <hi>Firſt,</hi> For where Two of different Perſwaſions marry, and have Children, which Way muſt the Children ſteer their Courſe? After the Father, or the Mother? And if the Parents are both true to their contrary Principles, who muſt prevail in relation to their Childrens Way
<pb n="570" facs="unknown:006297_0581_10285C95AD7F79E8"/>
and Worſhip? Many Inconveniencies, and much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, muſt naturally be the Conſequences of ſuch Marriages.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who marry on Account of Riches, are very often diſappointed; for they very ſoon are on the Wing; they'll fly away, ſometimes in the Flames, and ſometimes they will ſteal away in the dark by Theft; and ſometimes they will ſwim away by Water, or fly away with Canvas Wings, and never return; and ſometimes by the Intemperance and Extravagancies of the Man or Woman, are moſt profuſely waſted. And here let it be noted, that to live comfortably in the World, there muſt be both in the Man, and alſo in Woman, Induſtry and Frugality; for otherwiſe, if One hath a hundred Thouſand a Year, it might all, and more than all, be ſpent in Exceſs; and if the Man be extravagant, the Woman and her Family muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and likewiſe, if the Woman is extravagant, and lives to Exceſs, that Man cannot thrive in the World; ſo that both muſt manage their Affairs with Frugality and Induſtry; and then no Doubt, but through the Bleſſing of God, they may be very happy in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in their outward Affairs, and in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Lord: But then the Bleſſing of God muſt be ſought chiefly, and above all.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the very Old marrying with the very Young, is moſtly attended with Inconveniency, as daily Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teaches; for too generally ſuch Matches are on the one Side for Riches; for where do we find a young Man that marries a poor old Woman, or a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that marries a poor old Man? And how often have we heard young Ones ſay, <hi>They would never mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old Ones any more?</hi> And one may well ſuppoſe, they had not married thoſe old Ones they did, if it had not been for their Riches; and many Times Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has diſappointed them in the Enjoyment of what they ſo much ſought for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="571" facs="unknown:006297_0582_10285C98E2357240"/>We now ſuppoſe our blooming young Man and Woman well married and ſettled in the World, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own, and Parents, and Relations Liking and Choice; and now, according to the Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of themſelves and others, they are in a happy State, and are really ſo in one another: Oh the Love and Endearments of ſuch a Pair, who can fully expreſs it? It hath ſomething of the Reſemblance of the State of our firſt Parents in Paradiſe; and happy, yea, thrice happy would they be, that make it their Care and Study to live ſo, and do live ſo until they die; and then when one of theſe happy entire Lovers dies, it ſometimes happens that the other cannot ſurvive long, but ſhortly doth die too.</p>
                     <p>But as our Parents in Paradiſe, ſo we in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſical State, have the ſame ſubtle, ſerpentine Spirit to war withal; for Satan envies us this Happineſs, and uſes all his Craft and Subtlety to break the Love and ſtrict Union between Man and Wife, and to turn it to Hatred and Bitterneſs; ſo that inſtead of dying for one another, they wiſh one another dead; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the innocent Sufferer dies indeed, with Sorrow and Grief; and the Survivor meets with one who pays off all former Scores.</p>
                     <p>In order to circumvent our grand Enemy, and keep to our firſt Love as much as lies in our Power, we muſt ſtrictly avoid Anger, Jealouſy, Intemperance, wilful Separation, and the one too much inſiſting in his or her Will, againſt the others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in Caſes dubious, or difficult, the Author of all Things hath given the deciſive Power to the Male, becauſe the <hi>Female was firſt in the Tranſgreſſion</hi>; but it were better if theſe Two had but one Will, as they are one Fleſh, and that there were no other Power between them two, but the ſweet and cordial Power of Love; in that Mortals (eſpecially when it is in that which is divine) ever were, and ſtill are, and always will be, happy.</p>

In a Heat or Rage, that may be done or ſaid in an Inſtant, which one or both may have Occaſion to repent of all their Days; and when once done, it cannot be undone. Again, and as often as a Man is angry with his Wife, or a Woman with her Huſband (without a ſufficient Cauſe) ſo often do they make Work for Repentance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Fault cannot be done clean away. Let the angry Perſon remember the good Advice in ſacred Record, <hi>Let not the Sun go down on thine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> Eph. iv. 26. And if it was not to go down on the Anger of the common People, much more it ought not between a Man and his Wife. And let ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Care be taken, that both be not angry together; for that would be the Way to fire the whole Houſe preſently, ſo that the Houſe would be too hot to hold them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Jealouſy. Oh cruel Jealouſy! Jealouſy is cruel as the Grave, and burns as a Fire in the Soul, and will certainly conſume it, if it be kept alive. It ought indeed to be carefully watched againſt, and each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to avoid all Actions that might give, or have any Umbrage that Way. A free, open Diſpoſition, would mightily help to quench the burning Flames of Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. And Love, ſincere Love, will mightily circumvent our fiery Enemy, the <hi>Prince of evil Flames,</hi> who ſtrives to ſtir up that (and not only that, but other) and all falſe Fires whatſoever. If we would live in Peace and Love, let us put on Charity; and that will lead us to put the beſt Conſtruction, and not the worſt, on the Words and Actions one of another. This is a ſafe and good general Rule for a Man and his Wife to obſerve; and not only for a Man and his Wife, but for all others on all Occaſions of Difference. For what ſad Work would it make in the World, and who could eſcape from Cenſure, if the worſt Conſtructions were put on all their free Words and Diſcourſes? Yet

fatal to our firſt Parents, and ſeems to infect the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity to this very Day. Fair <hi>Eve</hi> leaving her dear <hi>Adam,</hi> coſt her dear. She had not been ſo open to the Intrigues of vile Satan, if ſhe had had her <hi>Adam</hi> with her; and though the Female is generally the weaker Veſſel, yet her Strength is greatly augmented with the Preſence and Company of her Huſband; and ſo is the Huſband in the ſame Conſideration. Daily Experience teaches, that it is of ill Conſequence for Women to go much abroad without their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, or young Women, without ſome Body to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend them, from the Inſults of rude Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, except on Family, or ſome other laudable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.

And Men and their Wives to ſleep ſeparately if in Health (or by Conſent, without good Reaſons) is very unnatural, and often tends to leſſen the Love and Affection they ought to have for each other.</p>
                     <p>It is good for married People to adviſe with each other, about the Affairs of their Families, they being ſo nearly related; and to be ſubject to one another in Things indifferent; and not ſtrenuouſly to inſiſt on their own Wills, one againſt another; for that often breeds Contempt and Diſcontent, and mightily tends to leſſen the Love and Affection, which they ought to have for one another. It would be well for married People to diſcloſe their Differences as little as may be, to any but themſelves; and not to be contented or ſatisfied, till they are made up again; always remembering their Marriage-Covenant, which is to be loving and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful till Death.

                     <p>THE Author, in the Courſe of his Converſation, having met with ſome Perſons, who avowing the Principles he oppoſes in the following Tract, have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to aſſume the Character of <hi>Free-thinkers,</hi> might have thereby been determin'd to ſuch a Title and Direction of his Work. And as it is to be fear'd, the Number is too great of thoſe who love a falſe Liberty both in Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Speaking, it is not to be wonder'd at, ſhou'd they endeavour to juſtify themſelves therein by ſo ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Pretence as that of Freedom.

to every Man, that, without it, none could poſſibly be prais'd or condemn'd for any Determination or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever; but it muſt be imputed to that Power alone, which impoſes a Neceſſity towards either Good or Evil; ſo that in ſuch Caſe, all Diſtinction of Virtue and Vice muſt ceaſe in our Apprehenſions of Morality, and human Society lie in the greateſt and moſt deplorable Confuſion for Want of it.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1735.</note>HAVING had ſome Diſcourſe with a young Man of bright natural Parts, concerning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World, and of leaping out of this into that in the Dark, which muſt needs be very dangerous; and fearing that many take that great Leap out of this World into the next in that Manner, I have been induced to write theſe Lines.</p>
                     <p>Upon which I cannot forbear immediately asking, What Man in his Senſes will venture (naturally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to leap in the Dark, he knows not where? Or into a Pit, he knows not the Bottom of? To think of it is terrifying, and muſt needs ſhock any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Free-thinker.</p>
                     <p>Now, though a Man, having a bright Genius, and a large Share of natural Parts, may acquire much literal and natural Knowledge; yet, for Want of a ſpiritual Underſtanding, which is derived from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, he may greatly err concerning true Faith and Religion, and have no Apprehenſion of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Kingdom and Judgment of God, or of another World; which it might be well for the ungodly were not, or were never to be at all: Which, were it to be ſuppoſed, yet to live virtuouſly (as the Biſhop of <hi>Sarum</hi> obſerv'd to that great Libertine the Earl of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>) would be an Advantage to Men, even in this World.</p>
                     <p>But if there ſhould be an eternal, righteous King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (of which we may be internally and ſpiritually ſenſible) and a State of Life therein to come; then, O then, what will become of the Wicked, and all who forget God! and what Perturbation of Soul muſt attend ſuch, when, under the Convictions thereof, they
<pb n="579" facs="unknown:006297_0590_10285CB007CDDD20"/>
ſhall be ready to launch into Eternity. I beſeech thee (O Soul) ſeriouſly to conſider, before it be too late.</p>
                     <p>The great Saviour of the World ſays, <hi>The Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> Luke xvii. 21. That is, inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritually, to be known and perceived. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſays, <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> John viii. 12. He, by his divine and ſupernatural Light, lights us through this dark World to his ſpiritual and glorious Kingdom, where he rules and reigns in tranſcendent Majeſty and Brightneſs; of which his faithtul Subjects are in ſome Meaſure ſenſible: Glory to the King of Kings for ever.</p>
                     <p>And that eminently wiſe Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>He was ſent to turn Men from Darkneſs to Light.</hi> Darkneſs he calls the <hi>Power of Satan,</hi> and Light <hi>the Power of God.</hi> Now as a Man walking in outward Darkneſs is in continual Danger of falling, not knowing whither he goeth; ſo alſo a Man living and walking in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Darkneſs (which is the Power of <hi>Satan,</hi> where the wonderful Power and Works of God cannot be ſeen nor underſtood) muſt needs be in the greateſt Danger of falling into the bottomleſs Pit of Perdition, where horrible Darkneſs and unutterable Miſery prevails for ever.</p>
                     <p>The many bitter Cries, dreadful Shrieks, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Groans, which my Ears have heard from ſuch dark Souls, ready to depart the Body, have been enough to convince me of the Judgment of another World, tho' there had been no other Demonſtration of it to me. May our fine Wits, and ſprightly Youths concern'd, repent in Time. Oh, my Heart is pain'd for them; and my Soul mourns in ſecret for many of my former and latter Aquaintance, as I have alſo tender Deſires for the Well-doing and Well-being of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in General.</p>
                     <p>If any, by duly thinking of theſe Things, ſhould be awaken'd and convinc'd of their State, and their former Lives and wicked Practices; and have ſo much
<pb n="580" facs="unknown:006297_0591_10285CB1DAAEFA78"/>
Light as to ſee the Danger of living without God in the World; but be ready to conclude, that if there be indeed a righteous God, who will reward every Man according to his Works, there can then be no Hope for them, ſuch wretched Sinners. Oh Souls (if this be the Caſe of any) look not at ſuch Thoughts, which (in the midſt of your juſt Apprehenſions) Satan taking Advantage, may thus ſuggeſt to you; who having got you deep already in the Mire of Sin, wou'd by ſuch Infuſions plunge you deeper both into Sin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
                     <p>Be it remembered that Chriſt died for Sinners, <hi>even the Chief</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays) and he can make a chief Saint of a chief Sinner, as appears in the Caſe of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle by his own Teſtimony: God hath, and can do it, though it be wonderful!</p>
                     <p>Wherefore abide not in Darkneſs, but repent, and turn to the Light of Life! ſtrive and ſtruggle for Life, the Life of God in the Soul of Man! turn ye to the Divine Light, turn to God, who is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all! live and walk in the Light of God, which is far above the Light of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Reaſon; therein ſhall we have Fellowſhip with the Father of Lights, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt; whoſe Religion is Spiritual: <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him</hi> (aright) <hi>muſt worſhip him in Spirit and Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God muſt be worſhipped in Thought, Word, and Deed; that is, in all Things we ought to expreſs an humble Reverence and Adoration to the Sovereign Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, frequently meditating on his great Name; but all Evil and ſinful Thinking we muſt refrain from with Abhorrence, as diſpleaſing to him; and is of the Devil that evil Spirit; and which indeed is contrary to the Nature and End of <hi>Free-Thinking</hi>; which is a ſincere Exerciſe of the rational Faculty, in order to diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil, Truth and Falſhood, that we may chuſe and acknowledge the one, and avoid
<pb n="581" facs="unknown:006297_0592_10285CB48C1C99E8"/>
and reject the other. And here it may not be unfit to recommend the Care of all our Thoughts, from whence proceed our Words and Actions as naturally, as good and evil Fruit from the different Seed ſown in the Earth.</p>
                     <p>And as the trueſt and moſt ſublime End of thinking (which is the reaſonable Service of every intelligent Creature) is the Contemplation, Fear, and Adoration, of the Almighty Creator; ſo are we thereto great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encouraged by that Scripture of <hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 16, 17, 18. which I am concern'd here to tranſcribe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, and is as follows, <hi>Then they that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another, and the Lord heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and heard it, and a Book of Remembrance was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name. And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in that Day when I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare them as a Man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him. Then ſhall ye return and diſcern between the Righteous and the Wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which Scripture we may obſerve how great and glorious a Reward is promiſed to thoſe that ſanctify the Name of the Lord; the Conſideration of which, muſt needs raiſe their Love and Admiration, and add to their preſent Delight in ſuch holy Thoughts.</p>
                     <p>But, on the contrary, it is to be feared, that evil Thinkers and Actors, when the Divine Spirit and Light wou'd inſpire them with good Thoughts, or convince them of their Sins, endeavour to ſtifle or overcome ſuch Thoughts or Motions as would awaken them to Righteouſneſs, or reſtrain them from Sin; and ſtrive, by their natural Wit, to reaſon the good Spirit out of their Souls; at the ſame Time opening their Hearts to the evil Spirit and his Suggeſtions, which they hug, to their own Deſtruction. But indeed to judge rightly of theſe Things, if a Man have ever ſo much natural Wit, and ſtrength of Reaſon, it muſt
<pb n="582" facs="unknown:006297_0593_102884D48CE9E0B0"/>
be ſanctified through his faithful Subjection to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, and rais'd by divine Inſpiration; which as far ſurpaſſes human Reaſon, as Heaven is above the Earth. May our Men of bright natural Thought think clearly and ſeriouſly of this. This is evident in the Caſe of that great Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> in the perfect Manner of the Law, yet, by all his Knowledge, could not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh concerning Religion, but was a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church of Chriſt: But when his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Spirit came to be ſanctified by the Grace and Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then, and not till then, he became of great and good Uſe and Service to his Maker and Mankind. Then his Reaſon and Religion became Spiritual,
<q>who had not conferred with Fleſh and Blood, but had been obedient to the heavenly Viſion,</q>
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 16. And he ſays (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 19.) <hi>If in this Life only we have Hope in Chriſt, we are of all Men moſt miſerable.</hi> So that his Hope and Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (as of all faithful Believers) muſt have been of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Life, and the Kingdom of God hereafter; <hi>For here</hi> (ſays he) <hi>we have no continuing City, but ſeek one to come,</hi> Heb. xiii. 14. And though the Condition of ſuch, in this Life, is often expoſed to much Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and Trouble for their Faith's Sake, towards the Name of God, and Teſtimony againſt this World, and the evil Spirit ruling therein; yet, bleſſed be the moſt High, He gives them Strength, and the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Favour, whereby they endure to the End, as well as that he refreſhes them with his outward Bleſſings and Comforts: So that they may well ſay with his ancient Servant <hi>Job, Shall we receive Good at the Hand of the Lord, and not Evil?</hi> Job ii. 10. Thus Afflictions have been indeed uſually call'd, but they often, in the Hand of God, are Means of redeeming the Soul, and raiſing up many excellent Virtues, when they are rightly ſubmitted to.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="583" facs="unknown:006297_0594_1028845EEBA7A0F0"/>But to return. I would enquire what Subject we can poſſibly chuſe ſo worthy of our Meditation, or from whence ſo great Benefit can redound both to Spirit and Body? The Fear and Thoughts of Almighty God, which are inſpir'd by his Grace, ſanctifying our Hearts, thereby render us more fit to receive his Favours both to Spirit and Body, which he multiplies according to his Wiſdom and good Pleaſure; and all our Faculties and Paſſions being redeem'd and govern'd by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faith, we ſhall poſſeſs and enjoy all Things in a more regular and excellent Manner. But who is there that hath not been ſo great a Partaker of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bleſſings, with which the infinite Creator filleth the World, and in an eſpecial Manner encompaſſeth Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as not to be thereby oblig'd to a continual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment thereof, and Remembrance of the great and bountiful Author? The State therefore of the Wicked and Rebellious, is ſtigmatiz'd in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with this Character in particular, that <hi>God is not in all their Thoughts,</hi> Pſalm x. 4. And indeed for this came his Judgment upon the old World of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, who cannot be ſuppoſed ever to have thought of the adorable Lord, ſince <hi>every Imagination and Thought of their Hearts were only Evil continually,</hi> as the Almighty himſelf hath complained. <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 5.</p>
                     <p>But inſtead of the Returns of Faith and Love, how ſad a Conſideration is it, that there ſhould among Men be found any ſo vile and fooliſh, as even to deny the divine Exiſtence, and the Effects of his infinite Power in the external Creation, and to affirm that all Things have come by Nature, without God, or any ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power; which evil Tenet, ſome have endeavoured to juſtify and ſupport by natural Reaſon: (<q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Name thereof may indeed be abuſed; but Reaſon itſelf, which concludes nothing without E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, can never declare in Favour of a Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which, not only none can appear, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the whole World is full of it. But
<pb n="584" facs="unknown:006297_0595_102884607147D070"/>
let this be diſpoſed for the Judgment of Reaſon. When therefore it is ſaid. That all Things have come by Nature; if thereby we are to underſtand that natural Things are ſeverally Self productive, this will be diſpoſed by daily Experience; for we may obſerve, that they depend one upon another, and upon various Cauſes for Production and Subſiſtence, without which, neither, in a State of Nature, could poſſibly be. But if it be meant of the univerſal Syſtem of natural Things collectively, this will leſs be allowed of many, than of any Particular of them; becauſe that would deſtroy the Nature of a Self-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive Power, which cannot be limited from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinite, and therefore can be but one: One In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Supreme Nature therefore only can have ſelf-exiſted, and muſt have been the ſupernatural Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Power, by whom all other Beings have exiſted: Which refutes the above Error, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally proves and eſtabliſhes the great Truth in the Queſtion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this the Chriſtian Religion teaches in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Perfection, that the Creator of all Things is God, an Infinite Eternal Spirit, who filleth all Things; who having been pleaſed to manifeſt his eternal Power and Godhead in the viſible Frame of the Univerſe, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Witneſs of himſelf therein, by his Providence and Judgments; and in every Soul of Man by his inward Inſpirations; eſpecially the ſincere Believer, in whom his Spirit dwells and operates.</p>
                     <p>Oh! that Men therefore would lift up their Minds, and open their Hearts to him, when by his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit He reproves them for Sin, and brings a Damp upon their Spirits for Evil; from which they would, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps if they could, run, or divert themſelves from the Senſe of it: But alas! there is no fleeing from his Preſence, who is every where; nor avoiding his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whoſe Kingdom comprehends all Things: (but Woe eſpecially is to them with whom his Spirit ceaſes
<pb n="585" facs="unknown:006297_0596_1028846249FA8508"/>
ſtriving!) Holy <hi>David</hi> certainly was very ſenſible of this, when he wrote that admirable Deſcription of the Divine Onmipreſence, <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxxxix. 7th Verſe to 12. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit, or whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence? If I aſcend up into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt Parts of the Sea, even there ſhall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand ſhall hold me. If I ſay, ſurely the Darkneſs ſhall cover me, even the Night ſhall be Light about me, yea the Darkneſs hideth not from thee; but the Night ſhineth as the Day: The Darkneſs and the Light are both alike to thee.</hi> With theſe Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the infinite Power, and Preſence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, I ſhall paſs to the Relation promis'd in the Title Page, which may here be properly inſerted.</p>
                     <p>My Author was <hi>Jonathan Dickinſon,</hi> Merchant in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> who was preſent with the young Men, whom this extraordinary Providence befel, at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> in <hi>Jamaica</hi>; he gave me the following Account. Two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious young Men (who were lately arriv'd at <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> from <hi>London</hi>) diſcourſing about Earthquakes, aſſerted that all Things came by Nature; and ſo argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereupon, that it brought Terror upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who were many at Dinner in an upper Room: That whilſt this laſted (to the Aſtoniſhment of all preſent) the Earth began to move and tremble, which put moſt of them to Flight in ſuch Haſte, that they ran one almoſt over another, ſome down Stairs, others leaping over the Balcony. But my Author ſaid, he conſider'd that there was no running from Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and that the ſame Hand which moved the Earth, was able to preſerve him; in which he truſted, and was preſerv'd: (And not only then, but at other Times, eſpecially among the <hi>Cannibals</hi> of <hi>Florida</hi>; as his Book of <hi>God's protecting Providence, &amp;c.</hi> ſignally evinceth.) Thus as he continued with the young Men in the ſame Room (Oh! terrible to relate, and my
<pb n="586" facs="unknown:006297_0597_10288464B52218B8"/>
Heart and Hand tremble in the Writing thereof) the mighty Hand of an offended God ſtruck theſe young Men with Death, and they fell down, and never roſe more, being in all Appearance unprepar'd for ſo ſudden a Change. And how many other gay witty young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been ſuddenly ſnatch'd away by Death, tho' perhaps not ſo immediately, nor in ſo extraordinary a Manner, ſeems worthy of Reflection. The Author of this Account added, that he took up the young Men, and laid them one upon a Bed, and the other upon a Couch; but that they never ſpake again after their Blaſphemy againſt God and his Works. Upon which I think it very natural, as well as neceſſary, to remark, that this was indeed an eminent Inſtance of the juſt Judgment of God againſt ſuch as deny his wonderful Power and Providence in the Creation; with this terrible Circumſtance, that theſe unhappy Perſons were cut off in the midſt of their ungodly Diſcourſe and corrupt Reaſoning, without ſo much Time afforded them as to ask Pardon, and crave Mercy of a provok'd Lord; which is very dreadful to conſider: And I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially recommend it to the ſerious Reflections of all ſuch as affect the Name of <hi>Free-Thinkers</hi> (as they are commonly diſtinguiſhed) that they may no longer (under ſuch a Pretence) abuſe their Underſtandings with a Latitude of profane and evil Thinking; who, as they muſt needs be ſenſible, they have not conferr'd the excellent Faculty of Reaſon upon themſelves; ſo they may as certainly conclude they never receiv'd it to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Exiſtence, Power and Providence, out of the World, who gave it them; nor to employ it to their own Deſtruction, by ſuch a Perverſion thereof, which muſt inevitably be the Conſequence, without timely and due Repentance; but that they may apply themſelves to him for true Wiſdom, who is the eternal Fountain of it, who would direct all their Thoughts aright there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then would they find a ſubſtantial and enduring Happineſs and Satisfaction, in the honourable Thoughts
<pb n="587" facs="unknown:006297_0598_102884674DEC9EF8"/>
and Practice of true Religion and Virtue; and that all vain and evil Thoughts, directly tended to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and Deſtruction of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, if any Expreſſion in this ſhort Tract ſhould prove ſucceſsful to promote, in any Meaſure, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Divine Being; the Conſideration of Man's Duty to him, his Almighty Creator, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince but one Soul of the Error of his Thoughts and Ways; the Author will think himſelf richly rewarded for his Endeavours, and reverently aſcribe the Glory and Praiſe to God, the prime Author and Mover of every good Thing, who is worthy for ever.</p>

                  <p>IF we duly conſider the Nature of human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as we ſhall neceſſarily be led to admire the wonderful Author of ſo excellent a Gift to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, according to the Power and Extent thereof; ſo ſhall we be forced to acknowledge its Imperfection, not only where the Natures of Things exceed its Views, but alſo in tracing and explicating that Evidence which many of them afford; but eſpecially as to its Influence in a moral Reſpect, how ſubject is it to be obſcur'd, and its Faculties diſabled by the Violence of thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Affections with which human Nature is too ordinarily agitated. So that Man cannot but want ſome extraordinary Aſſiſtance; and he under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Obligation to ſubmit every Faculty and Affection to the Direction and Diſpoſal of that infinite Power and Wiſdom, which having ſo wonderfully conſtituted, can beſt preſerve, and conduct him to a State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                  <p>Can it then be thought unrighteous in the Supreme Diſpoſer of all Things, ſo to have faſhion'd our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

and ranged them (though above many other Beings, yet) in ſuch a State of Dependance, as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to expreſs his Sovereign Power and Rectitude? Since by our entire Reſignation to his Divine Hand, we may be transformed to a greater Likeneſs of him, and have a Spirit and Nature ſuperinduc'd of Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction from the Father of Lights; whom to know and contemplate, through the Revelation of his Son Jeſus Chriſt (his infinite Love to Mankind) is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and ſupreme Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Which Myſtery, far above human Underſtanding, He hath been pleaſed to reveal by his Spirit, who ſearcheth the deep Things of God, in order to work in us Faith in, and the higheſt Admiration of that exalted Name, by whom he hath viſited our low Eſtate, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it in him, into the greateſt Dignity it is capable of. The Particulars of whoſe Incarnation, Paſſion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and Aſcenſion into eternal Glory, though highly admirable, and which the bleſſed Apoſtle, who had been an Eye-witneſs of his Glory, ſays, <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels deſire to look into,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 12. can none of them however be perverted to a Senſe of being repugnant to Reaſon; becauſe not impoſſible to infinite Love, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power; who could abaſe himſelf from his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and be made Fleſh in a Virgin; could work all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and the greateſt of all, the raiſing himſelf from the Dead; and could aſcend up where he was before. All which are agreeable to right Reaſon, and appear ſo with Raviſhment to that enlightened and ſanctified, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially with the Evidence of the Holy Spirit the Comforter, which confirmeth the humble Believer in the ſaving Faith and Knowledge of theſe Things to the End. And I am glad of this Occaſion to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh to thee (<hi>ingenious Reader</hi>) that though no divine Truths are contrary to natural Reaſon; yet, as they far tranſcend it, they are not comprehenſible by it, as other Truths within the Reach of its Capacity are: As no Nature below Man, nor qualified with Reaſon as
<pb n="589" facs="unknown:006297_0600_1028846C34184208"/>
he is, can poſſibly know as he knows. Which Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is not of the leaſt Importance to us: For if it therefore follows, <hi>that no Man knows the Things of God, but by the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 11. then can no Man without the Revelation of the ſame Spirit, know the Myſtery of the Divine Power, by which he was created, and by which he muſt be eternally ſaved and bleſſed. Grace therefore (or the Divine Spirit by its Influence and Inſpiration) muſt be received and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed as an infallible Oracle, if we would know and purſue thoſe Things which tend to our preſent and future Happineſs; as alſo the Authority of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſubmitted to, as having proceeded from the ſame Grace, of which they faithfullly teſtify, and of that which is neceſſary to be by us believed and practiſed.</p>
                  <p>The Excellency and Neceſſity of which divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to Himſelf, Man certainly muſt acknowledge, when he conſiders, that That alone has given him an Account of his own Origin (which, what Man could have known?) And that he ſtill may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand himſelf, of his Lapſe and Corruption from that Excellency and Glory of his Nature (in which he was created) by departing from the Truth, into a Fable and Notion of Independency of Nature, and Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Wiſdom without God. So that he is become as the Beaſts which periſh, as to the Neceſſity of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to his mortal Part; and in his greateſt natural Honour, may, in that Reſpect, be compared to them; which is ſufficient to humble him under the Senſe of his weak elementary State, with all the Glory and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that may attend it.</p>
                  <p>But if Man will not be convinced of the Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Vanity of his Nature, by the Infirmities and Miſeries to which it is continually ſubject; nor of the Glory of the Eternal Majeſty, by the infinite Wonders thereof, throughout the Univerſe; rejecting the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his own Senſes, of every created Thing,
<pb n="590" facs="unknown:006297_0601_1028846EAA4380F8"/>
and of the Scriptures of Truth; nor yet behold His Glory in the Appearance of the Saviour, which he reveals in every Conſcience; then muſt his Blindneſs be concluded incurable, and his Deſtruction unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
