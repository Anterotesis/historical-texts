            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PLAIN TRUTH, &amp;C.</head>
            <p>IT is said the wise <hi>Italians</hi> make this proverbial Remark on our Nation, <hi>
                  <abbr>viz.</abbr> The</hi> English FEEL, <hi>but they do not</hi> SEE. That is, they are sensible of Inconveniencies when they are present, but do not take sufficient Care to prevent them: Their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Courage makes them too little apprehensive of Danger, so that they are often surpriz'd by it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of the proper Means of Security. When 'tis too late they are sensible of their Imprudence: After great Fires, they provide Buckets and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines: After a Pestilence they think of keeping clean their Streets and common Shores: and when a Town has been sack'd by their Enemies, they provide for its Defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Kind of AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER-WISDOM is indeed so common with us, as to occasion the vulgar, tho' very significant Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>When the Steed is stolen, you shut the Stable Door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the more insensible we generally are of publick Danger, and indifferent when warn'd of it, so much the more freely, openly, and earnestly, ought such as apprehend it, to speak their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that if possible, those who seem to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005948_0004_0F6438E9C1756DA8"/>
sleep, may be awaken'd, to think of some Means of Avoiding or Preventing the Mischief before it be too late.</p>
            <p>Believing therefore that 'tis my DUTY, I shall honestly speak my Mind in the following Paper.</p>
            <p>War, at this Time, rages over a great Part of the known World; our News-Papers are Weekly filled with fresh Accounts of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction it every where occasions. <hi>Pennsylvania,</hi> indeed, situate in the Center of the Colonies, has hitherto enjoy'd profound Repose; and tho' our Nation is engag'd in a bloody War, with two great and powerful Kingdoms, yet, defended, in a great Degree, from the <hi>French</hi> on the one Hand by the Northern Provinces, and from the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> on the other by the Southern, at no small Expence to each, our People have, till lately, slept securely in their Habitations.</p>
            <p>There is no <hi>British</hi> Colony excepting this, but has made some Kind of Provision for its Defence; many of them have therefore never been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Enemy; and others that were attack'd, have generally defended themselves with Success. The Length and Difficulty of our Bay and River has been thought so effectual a Security to us, that hitherto no Means have been entered into that might discourage an Attempt upon us, or prevent <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> succeeding.</p>
            <p>But whatever Security this might have been <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> both Country and City were poor, and the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be expected scarce worth the Hazard <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Attempt, it is now doubted whether we can <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> safely depend upon it. Our Wealth,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005948_0005_0F6438EAB1188AE0"/>
of late Years much encreas'd, is one strong Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, our defenceless State another, to induce an Enemy to attack us; while the Acquaintance they have lately gained with our Bay and River, by Means of the Prisoners and Flags of Truce they have had among us; by Spies which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every where maintain, and perhaps from Traitors among ourselves; with the Facility of getting Pilots to conduct them; and the known Absence of Ships of War, during the greatest Part of the Year, from both <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> ever since the War began, render the Appearance of Success to the Enemy far more promising, and therefore highly encrease our DANGER.</p>
            <p>That our Enemies may have Spies abroad, and some even in these Colonies, will not be made much doubt of, when 'tis considered, that such has been the Practice of all Nations in all Ages, whenever they were engaged, or intended to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in War. Of this we have an early Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Book of <hi>Judges</hi> (too too pertinent to our Case, and therefore I must beg leave a little to enlarge upon it) where we are told, <hi>Chap.</hi> xviii. <hi>v.</hi> 2. That <hi>the Children of Dan sent of their Family five Men from their Coasts to spie out the Land, and search it, saying, Go, search the</hi> LAND. These <hi>Danites</hi> it seems were at this Time not very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox in their Religion, and their Spies met with a certain idolatrous Priest of their own Persuasion, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and they said to him, <hi>Who brought thee hither! what makest thou in this Place? and what hast thou here?</hi> [would to God no such Priests were to be found among us.]
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005948_0006_0F6438EB382E33C0"/>
And they said unto him <hi>verse</hi> 5. <hi>Ask Counsel of God, that we may know whether our Way which we go shall be prosperous? And the Priest said unto them, Go in Peace; before the Lord is your Way wherein you go.</hi> [Are there no Priests a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, think you, that might, in the like Case, give an Enemy as good Encouragement? 'Tis well known, that we have Numbers of the same Religion with those who of late encouraged the <hi>French</hi> to invade our Mother-Country] <hi>And they came,</hi> Verse 7. <hi>to Laish, and saw the People that were therein, how they dwelt</hi> CARELESS, <hi>after the Manner of the Zidonians,</hi> QUIET <hi>and</hi> SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURE. They <hi>thought</hi> themselves secure, no doubt; and as they <hi>never had been</hi> disturbed, vainly imagined they <hi>never should.</hi> 'Tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely that some might see the Danger they were exposed to by living in that <hi>careless</hi> Manner; but that if these publickly expressed their Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the rest reproached them as timorous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, wanting Courage or Confidence in their Gods, who (they might say) had hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected them. But the Spies, Verse 8. returned, and said to their Countrymen, Verse 9. <hi>Arise that we may go up against them; for we have seen the Land, and behold it is very good! And are ye still?

What then may be expected, now those Forces are, by Orders from the Crown, to be disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when our boasted Expedition is laid aside, thro' want (as it may appear to them) either of Strength or Courage; when they see that the <hi>French,</hi> and their <hi>Indians,</hi> boldly, and with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, ravage the Frontiers of <hi>New-York,</hi> and scalp the Inhabitants; when those few <hi>Indians</hi> that engaged with us against the <hi>French,</hi> are left exposed to their Resentment: When they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these Things, is there no Danger that, thro' Disgust at our Usage, joined with Fear of the <hi>French</hi> Power, and greater Confidence in their Promises and Protection than in ours, they may be wholly gained over by our Enemies, and join in the War against us? If such should be the Case, which God forbid, how soon may the Mischief spread to our Frontier Counties?

               <hi>Great Britain,</hi> still more distant, groan'd under heavy Taxes in Supporting the War, we threw in our Mite to their Assistance, by a free Gift of <hi>Three Thousand Pounds:</hi> And shall Country and Town join in helping Strangers (as those compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively are) and yet refuse to assist each other?</p>
            <p>But whatever different Opinions we have of our Security in other Respects, our TRADE, all seem to agree, is in Danger of being ruin'd in another Year. The great Success of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in two different Cruizes this last Summer in our Bay, must give them the greatest Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to repeat more frequently their Visits, the Profit being almost certain, and the Risque next to nothing. Will not the first Effect of this, be, an Enhauncing of the Price of all foreign Goods to the Tradesman and Farmer, who use or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them? For the Rate of Insurance will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in Proportion to the Hazard of Importing them; and in the same Proportion will the Price of those Goods increase.—If the Price of the Tradesman's Work and the Farmer's Produce would encrease equally with the Price of foreign Commodities, the Damage would not be so great: But the direct contrary must happen. For the same Hazard, or Rate of Insurance, that raises the Price of what is imported, must be deducted out of, and lower the Price of what is exported. Without this Addition and Deduction, as long as the Enemy cruize at our Capes, and take those Vessels that attempt to <hi>go out,</hi> as well as those that endeavour to <hi>come in,</hi> none can afford to trade, and Business must be soon at a Stand.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005948_0011_0F6438EFD6C02C48"/>
And will not the Consequences be, A discourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many of the Vessels that us'd to come from other Places to purchase our Produce, and thereby a Turning of the Trade to Ports that can be entered with less Danger, and capable of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing them with the same Commodities, as <hi>New-York,</hi> &amp;c. A Lessening of Business to every Shopkeeper, together with Multitudes of bad Debts; the high Rate of Goods discouraging the Buyers, and the low Rates of their Labour and Produce rendering them unable to pay for what they had bought: Loss of Employment to the Tradesman, and bad Pay for what little he does: And lastly, Loss of many Inhabitants, who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to other Provinces not subject to the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies; whence a Lowering of the Value of Lands, Lots, and Houses.</p>
            <p>The Enemy, no doubt, have been told, That the People of <hi>Pennsylvania</hi> are <hi>Quakers,</hi> and against all Defence, from a Principle of Conscience; this, tho' true of a Part, and that a small Part only of the Inhabitants, is commonly said of the Whole; and what may make it look probable to Strangers, is, that in Fact, nothing is done by any Part of the People towards their Defence. But to refuse Defending one's self or one's Country, is so unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual a Thing among Mankind, that possibly they may not believe it, till by Experience they find, they can come higher and higher up our River, seize our Vessels, land and plunder our Plantations and Villages, and retire with their Booty unmolest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Will not this confirm the Report, and give them the greatest Encouragement to strike one
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005948_0012_0F6438F0E4F476E8"/>
bold Stroke for the City, and for the whole Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the River?</p>
            <p>It is said by some, that the Expence of a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to guard our Trade, would be very heavy, greater than perhaps all the Enemy can be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to take from us at Sea would amount to; and that it would be cheaper for the Government to open an Insurance-Office, and pay all Losses.—But is this right Reasoning?—I think not: For what the Enemy takes is clear Loss to us, and Gain to him; encreasing his Riches and Strength as much as it diminishes ours, so making the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference double; whereas the Money paid our own Tradesmen for Building and Fitting out a Vessel of Defence, remains in the Country, and circulates among us; what is paid to the Officers and Seamen that navigate her, is also spent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore, and soon gets into other Hands; the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer receives the Money for her Provisions; and on the whole, nothing is clearly lost to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try but her Wear and Tear, or so much as she sells for at the End of the War less than her first Cost. This Loss, and a trifling one it is, is all the Inconvenience; But how many and how great are the Conveniencies and Advantages! And should the Enemy, thro' our Supineness and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to provide for the Defence both of our Trade and Country, be encouraged to attempt this City, and after plundering us of our Goods, either <hi>burn it,</hi> or put it to Ransom; how great would that Loss be! Besides the Confusion, Terror, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, so many Hundreds of Families would be involv'd in!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005948_0013_0F6438F157014840"/>The Thought of this latter Circumstance so much affects me, that I cannot forbear expatiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing somewhat more upon it. You have, my dear Countrymen, and Fellow Citizens, Riches to tempt a considerable Force to unite and attack you, but are under no Ties or Engagements to unite for your Defence. Hence, on the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, <hi>Terror</hi> will spread over All; and as no Man can with Certainty depend that another will stand by him, beyond Doubt very many will seek Safety by a speedy Flight. Those that are reputed rich, will flee, thro' Fear of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to make them produce more than they are able. The Man that has a Wife and Children, will find them hanging on his Neck, beseeching him with Tears to quit the City, and save his Life, to guide and protect them in that Time of general Desolation and Ruin. All will run into Confusion, amidst Cries and Lamentations, and the Hurry and Disorder of Departers, carrying away their Effects. The Few that remain will be unable to resist.—<hi>Sacking</hi> the City will be the first, and <hi>Burning</hi> it, in all Probability, the last Act of the Enemy.—This, I believe, will be the Case, if you have timely Notice. But what must be your Condition, if suddenly surprized, without previous Alarm, perhaps in the Night! Confined to your Houses, you will have nothing to trust to but the Enemy's Mercy. Your best Fortune will be, to fall under the Power of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of King's Ships, able to controul the Mariners; and not into the Hands of <hi>licentious Privateers.</hi> Who can, without the utmost Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005948_0014_0F6438F1F9B56830"/>
conceive the Miseries of the Latter! when your Persons, Fortunes, Wives and Daughters, shall be subject to the wanton and unbridled Rage, Rapine and Lust, of <hi>Negroes, Molattoes,</hi> and others, the vilest and most abandoned of Mankind <note n="*" place="bottom">By Accounts, the ragged Crew of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Privateer that plundered Mr. <hi>Liston's,</hi> and another Plantation, a little below <hi>Newcastle,</hi> was composed of such as these.

A dreadful Scene! which some may represent as exaggerated.—I think it my Duty to warn you: Judge for yourselves.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, with very little Notice, the Rich may shift for themselves. The Means of speedy Flight are ready in their Hands; and with some previous Care to lodge Money and Effects in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and secure Places, tho' they should lose much, yet enough may be left them, and to spare. But most unhappily circumstanced indeed are we, the middling People, the Tradesmen, Shopkeepers, and Farmers of this Province and City! We cannot all fly with our Families; and if we could, how shall we subsist?—No; we and they, and what little we have gained by hard Labour and Industry, must bear the Brunt: The Weight of Contributions, extorted by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (as it is of Taxes among ourselves) must be surely borne by us. Nor can it be avoided as we stand at present; for tho' we are numerous, we
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005948_0015_0F6438F39EBB7268"/>
are quite defenceless, having neither Forts, Arms, Union, nor Discipline. And tho' it were true, that our Trade might be protected at no great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and our Country and our City easily defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if proper Measures were but taken; yet who shall take these Measures? Who shall pay that Expence? On whom may we fix our Eyes with the least Expectation that they will do any one Thing for our Security?—Should we address that weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and powerful Body of People, who have ever since the War governed our Elections, and filled almost every Seat in our Assembly; should we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to consider, if not as Friends, at least as Legislators, that <hi>Protection</hi> is as truly due from the Government to the People, as <hi>Obedience</hi> from the People to the Government; and that if on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their religious Scruples, they themselves could do no Act for our Defence, yet they might retire, relinquish their Power for a Season, quit the Helm to freer Hands during the present Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, to Hands chosen by their own Interest too, whose Prudence and Moderation, with regard to them, they might safely confide in; secure, from their own native Strength, of resuming again their present Stations, whenever it shall please them: Should we remind them, that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Money, raised <hi>from All,</hi> belongs <hi>to All;</hi> that since they have, for their own Ease, and to secure themselves in the quiet Enjoyment of their Religious Principles (and may they long enjoy them) expended such large Sums to oppose Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and engage favourable Representations of their Conduct, if they themselves could by no
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005948_0016_0F6438F451E1FCD8"/>
Means, be free to appropriate any Part of the Publick Money for our Defence; yet it would be no more than Justice to spare us a reasonable Sum for that Purpose, which they might easily give to the King's Use as heretofore, leaving all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation to others, who would faithfully apply it as we desired: Should we tell them, that tho' the Treasury be at present empty, it may soon be filled by the outstanding Publick Debts collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or at least Credit might be had for such a Sum, on a single Vote of the Assembly: That tho' <hi>they</hi> themselves may be resigned and easy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this naked, defenceless State of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it is far otherwise with a very great Part of the People; with <hi>us;</hi> who can have no Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that God will protect those that neglect the Use of rational Means for their Security; nor have any Reason to hope; that our Losses, if we should suffer any, may be made up by Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our Favour at Home. Should we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure them by all the Ties of Neighbourhood, Friendship, Justice and Humanity, to consider these Things; and what Distraction, Misery and Confusion, what Desolation and Distress, may possibly be the Effect of their <hi>unseasonable</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy and Perseverance; yet all would be in vain: For they have already been by great Numbers of the People petitioned in vain. Our late Governor did for Years sollicit, request, and even threaten them in vain. The Council have since twice remonstrated to them in vain. Their religious Prepossessions are unchangeable, their Obstinacy invincible. Is there then the least
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005948_0017_0F6438F501748B18"/>
Hope remaining; that from that Quarter any Thing should arise for our Security?</p>
            <p>And is our Prospect better, if we turn our Eyes to the Strength of the <hi>opposite Party,</hi> those Great and rich Men, Merchants and others, who are ever railing at <hi>Quakers</hi> for doing what their Principles seem to require, and what in Charity we ought to believe they think their Duty, but take no one Step themselves for the Publick Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They have so much Wealth and Influence, if they would use it, that they might easily, by their Endeavours and Example, raise a military Spirit among us, make us fond, studious of, and expert in Martial Discipline, and effect every Thing that is necessary, under God, for our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. But ENVY seems to have taken Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their Hearts, and to have eaten out and destroyed every generous, noble, Publick-spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sentiment. <hi>Rage</hi> at the Disappointment of their little Schemes for Power, gnaws their Souls, and fills them with such cordial Hatred to their Opponents, that every Proposal, by the Execution of which <hi>those</hi> may receive Benefit as well as themselves, is rejected with Indignation. <hi>What,</hi> say they, <hi>shall we lay out our Money to protect the Trade of Quakers? Shall we fight to defend Quakers? No; Let the Trade perish, and the City burn; let what will happen, we shall never lift a Finger to prevent it.</hi>—Yet the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have <hi>Conscience</hi> to plead for their Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to fight, which these Gentlemen have not: <hi>Conscience</hi> with you, Gentlemen, is on the other Side of the Question: <hi>Conscience</hi> enjoins
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005948_0018_0F6438F5B955CBA0"/>
it as a DUTY on you (and indeed I think it such on every Man) to defend your Country, your Friends, your aged Parents, your Wives, and helpless Children: And yet you resolve not to perform this Duty, but act <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>your own</hi> Consciences, because the Quakers act <hi>according</hi> to <hi>theirs.</hi> 'Till of late I could searce believe the Story of him who refused to pump in a sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ship, because one on board, whom he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, would be saved by it as well as himself.

The very Fame of our Strength and Readiness would be a Means of Discouraging our Enemies; for 'tis a wise and true Saying, that <hi>One Sword often keeps another in the Scabbard.</hi> The Way to secure Peace is to be prepared for War. They that are on their Guard, and appear ready to receive their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, are in much less Danger of being attack'd, than the supine, secure and negligent. We have yet a Winter before us, which may afford a good and almost sufficient Opportunity for this, if we seize and improve it with a becoming Vigour. And if the Hints contained in this Paper are so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to meet with a suitable Disposition of Mind in his Countrymen and Fellow Citizens, the Writer of it will, in a few Days, lay before them a Form of an ASSOCIATION for the Purposes herein mentioned, together with a
