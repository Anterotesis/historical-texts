            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> Endeavours of a worthleſs Worm to refreſh you! If ſo, it will rejoyce me much: But whether it pleaſe Him to uſe a poor nothing Creature as an Inſtrument or no; I am perſwaded he will in his own Time revive you, and I rejoyce and praiſe him on your Behalf, by Grace: that he will turn your Captivity; and that He will bruiſe <hi>Satan</hi> under your'Feet ſhortly, and make him gladly quit the Field, and leave you to enjoy your God. For bleſſed be God, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is ſtronger than <hi>He</hi> and all his combin'd Legions; and he can't reſiſt his Power, tho' he has audaciouſly ſtruck at his Honour, and endeavour'd to impede his bleſſed Work in your Soul. Do's or has the bold-daring Spirit preſumed to inſinuate that all <hi>Religion,</hi> is <hi>vain, imaginary,</hi> and <hi>deluſive</hi>? Do's he pretend that none can know they are right?—ell him from me, <hi>He is a Liar,</hi> and I am bold to ſay, I have prov'd him ſo. He has told me the ſame Tale: But bleſſed be God, I do know that <hi>Religion</hi> is no imaginary Thing, but a <hi>ſubſtanital Reality.</hi> I do know that there is GOD of boundleſs Perfections, Truth any Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; that will not deceive, no nor forſake the Soul that puts its Truſt in him.</p>
            <p>But now perhaps you'll ſay, Aye, <hi>but bow do I know this God is mine; and that I myſelf and not deceived?</hi> I <hi>anſwer,</hi> by the <hi>Evidences</hi> of a <hi>Work of Grace</hi> wrought in my Soul. And now as God ſhall enable me, <hi>my dear Friend.</hi> I'll tell you truly what GOD has done for my Soul, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007523_0004_102BA022FA304D20"/>
what I call <hi>Evidences</hi> of a <hi>Work of Grace.</hi> This <hi>Queſtion</hi> I could never fully verbally anſwer, when with you, which makes me now attempt to explain myſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> then, I do know that God has by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> convinced me of <hi>Sin, Original</hi> and <hi>Actual</hi>; that I was by Nature a Child of Wrath, an Heir of Hell, an Enemy to Him, and his Ways, yea, Enmity itſelf; <hi>Dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins</hi>; and that I was both utterly, <hi>unable,</hi> and <hi>unwilling</hi> too, to help myſelf out of this miſerable State, being averſe to the Goſpel-Way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wrought out by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I plainly ſee the Cauſe of that Complaint, <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</hi> God convinced me alſo that <hi>by the Deeds of the Law, no Fleſh living ſhould be juſtified,</hi> and that He and his Throne would be ſpotleſs forever tho' He ſhould caſt me off, and condemn me to the hotteſt Hell: Since He ow'd me nothing nor was any Way bound to beſtow his Grace upon me; and if he did, it would be abſolutely free and ſovereign.—GOD ſhew'd me I was, utterly unworthy that he ſhould help me.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, tho' I had thus deſtroyed myſelf, yet in <hi>Him</hi> was my Help. Yea He <hi>diſcover'd to me,</hi> that <hi>he had laid Help</hi> upon <hi>ONE</hi> who is <hi>mighty to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by Him</hi>; even a glorious CHRIST the Great EMANUEL God-Man, even one Co-equal with Himſelf, <hi>the expreſs Image of his Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whom dwells, all the Fulneſs of the Godhead bodily</hi>;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007523_0005_102BA0250619D808"/>
One every Way compleat and ſuited to all my wants; and that He was not only thus qualify'd and ſealed and ſent by the FATHER, but that he was abſolutely <hi>willing</hi> as well as <hi>able</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the great Work; and would by no means caſt out any that come to him.</p>
            <p>Well upon <hi>this Diſcovery</hi> of the amiable and lovely JESUS, if I know that I have a Being, I do know that God compell'd or <hi>ſweetly conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me</hi> to <hi>throw down</hi> the Weapons of my Rebellion and to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to HIM as <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> to be ſaved by him in his own way, and upon his own Terms; that he ſhould be the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> and the <hi>Omega,</hi> the Foundation and the Topſtone in my Salvation. Yea, God <hi>caus'd my Heart to go out after Him</hi> in ſtrong and <hi>vehement Deſires,</hi> and to <hi>chooſe Him</hi> in <hi>all his Offices,</hi> with <hi>all his Benefits,</hi> to be <hi>my Portion</hi> forever. Yea <hi>He appear'd to me</hi> to be <hi>in Himſelf the moſt love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deſirable Object,</hi> the faireſt of ten thouſand Fairs: and God enabled me to <hi>give myſelf,</hi> my <hi>whole Soul and Body</hi> with <hi>all my Concerns</hi> for Time and Eternity into his merciful and faithful Hands: and had I a thouſand precious Souls, I would gladly venture them all with him; for <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded</hi> he will keep by his mighty Power what I have committed to his Charge; nor ſhall all the Hoſts of Hell, ever be able to pluck me out of his Hands.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; upon <hi>this choice,</hi> and <hi>ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to CHRIST as <hi>Mediator,</hi> GOD the FATHER <hi>manifeſted</hi> himſelf to me, as my reconciled GOD

and <hi>Father</hi>; the <hi>bleſſed</hi> SPIRIT took up his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode with me, afforded me his Influences and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance daily; and God made with me an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant,</hi> never to be forgotten, <hi>Even the ſure Mercies of David</hi>: and <hi>I ſolemnly gave myſelf up,</hi> all I have, am, or can do, both in Life and Death, in Time, and for Eternity, to GOD the FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST, to be his own, in a Covenant Way, to be diſpoſed of as ſhall moſt conſiſt with his Glory; and choſe the glorious TRINITY for my <hi>Portion</hi> forever, in oppoſition to all Others, even a GOD of infinite Perfections. Oh happy Choice! oh happy I, that I liv'd to ſee that Day wherein GOD betroth'd me to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in loving Kindneſs and tender Mercy!</p>
            <p>Thus I was <hi>effectually called</hi> and <hi>made willing</hi> in the Day of GOD'S Power to <hi>receive</hi> Him: and <hi>to as many as receiv'd Him to them gave He Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to become the Sons of God, even to thoſe that believe on his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Foundation</hi> of my <hi>Hopes</hi> are laid upon the <hi>Rock of Ages.</hi> And agreeable to thoſe covenant Engagements, a faithfull GOD, has ever ſince dealt with me. And ſurely I can ſay; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as as I was born blind, now I can ſee; <hi>old Things are done away, all Things become new.</hi> Now thro' Grace I dare appeal to a Heart-ſearching GOD and ſay; that none of his Commands are griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; I eſteem them all <hi>holy, right, juſt,</hi> and <hi>good</hi>; and long to yield a <hi>univerſal Obedience</hi> to them all: yea GOD does excite in me ſtrong and <hi>vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Deſires</hi> after an <hi>entire Conformity</hi> to his <hi>Law,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007523_0007_102BA02913E1B8C0"/>
as tho' my whole Salvation depended thereon while at the ſame Time, he will not ſuffer me to depend on any thing but CHRIST alone; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a ſtrong <hi>Properſity</hi> to cleave to the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi>; but enables me to <hi>account all Things as Loſs and Dung and filtby Rags, in point of Juſtification</hi>; nor would I for a Million Worlds appear before GOD, in the beſt Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance I ever did: No 'tis in <hi>that ſpotleſs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> which CHRIST has wrought out, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to me, and in that only I dare appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD. But he gives me to ſee a <hi>Beauty</hi> in <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which far exceeds the Luſtre of all created Things. Nor do I know what Deſire means, after any, or all the <hi>Enjoyments</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Senſe, compar'd</hi> with thoſe ardent <hi>Longings,</hi> and <hi>Pantings,</hi> which He at ſometimes excites in my Soul, after the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of <hi>Himſelf</hi>; and for <hi>ſanctifying Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' Grace is not always alike in Exerciſe; (no I am ſometimes dull and lifeleſs as to Exerciſe) yet bleſſed be GOD its has been the habitual, and ſettled Bent of my Soul for many Years; to chooſe GOD, his CHRIST, and <hi>Grace</hi> for my Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all Conditions, both adverſe and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Bleſſed be GOD, my Faith has not been ſtagger'd. Sometimes He has bereav'd, cut off the Streams of earthly Comforts, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and then cauſed me to juſtify him, and fly to <hi>Him</hi> as my all. Sometimes He has hid his Face, and cauſed me to mourn after <hi>Him,</hi> and, refuſe all Comfort till <hi>He,</hi> return'd. Sometimes

He has permitted <hi>Satan</hi> to tempt and tyranize over me for a Seaſon; and many a precious <hi>Jewel</hi> has he ſtolen from me by clouding my Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and infinuating that all was Deluſion and Hypocriſy; and how many diſtreſſing gloomy Days I have had GOD only knows: but <hi>Satan</hi> could not keep, <hi>them</hi>; for a faithful GOD would not ſuffer me to be tempted above that I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but made way for my eſcape.</p>
            <p>Sometimes He has permitted the <hi>Remains</hi> of <hi>indwelling Corruption</hi> to rally all its Force and ſtrive for Maſtery; but at the ſame time ſtir'd up an inveterate Hatred and an Abhorrance of it, and myſelf for it, becauſe 'tis the abominable Thing which His Soul hates. And ſometimes <hi>Unbelief,</hi> has ſo far prevailed, that I have cry'd out <hi>I ſhall-one Day periſh by the Hands of theſe Enemies,</hi> or I ſhall at leaſt fall <hi>fouly</hi> to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of the dear Name by which I am called, if not <hi>finally.</hi> But for <hi>more than Sixteen Years</hi> has GOD preſerv'd me from open ſcandalous Sins. (Yea, bleſſed be <hi>God,</hi> thro' reſtraining Grace, all my Life long,) and from ever making a League with Sin, ſince I have thro' Grace proclaim'd War with it: And by Grace aſſiſting I am determin'd never to lay down my Arms, but to fight till I die, under the Banner of <hi>the great Captain of my Salvation</hi>: Yea, and Truth and Veracity itſelf has ſaid, <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you,</hi> and <hi>my Grace ſhall be ſuffcient for you.</hi> And here (my Dear,) my great Strength lies: For <hi>all the Promiſes are Yea and Amen in</hi>

CHRIST JESUS: And ſince <hi>my</hi> LORD is mine, <hi>all</hi> is mine, and I ſhall come off more than a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror thro' Him that has loved me and given himſelf for me. Tho' now I groan under <hi>a Body of Sin and Death</hi>; and may I never ceaſe to mourn, but daily look on Him whom I have pierc'd: Oh it was <hi>Sin, my Sin,</hi> that pierc'd his ſacred Head and Side, that put all the bitter Ingredients into the Cup, that extorted that heart-piercing Cry from him, <hi>My God my God, why haſt thou forſaken me</hi>: And never does it appear more odious, than when I am well ſatisfied it never will prove my Ruin. GOD diſpoſes me to chooſe any Affliction, or all the Affictions in this World rather than <hi>Sin.</hi> I do eſteem it the worſt of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; yea I had rather have all the Furies of Hell let looſe to perplex me, than to be given over to the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>my own</hi> inbred <hi>Luſts,</hi> and <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> O thanks be to GOD, He has ſaid, <hi>I will ſubdue your Inquities!</hi> Oh how ſweet here to conſider CHRIST as my <hi>King,</hi> that will e're long ſet his Foot on the Necks of theſe Enemies! how ſweet to eſpouſe his Cauſe! bring forth the Traytors, and entreat him to ſlay every one that ſays they will not have him to reign over them! Oh that CHRIST would intirely poſſeſs his rightful Throne in my Soul, wholly ſway the Sceptre there, fill every Room; that not a Luſt, a Uſurper, might ever dare to lift up its venemous Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain! O tranſporting Thought; one Everlaſting Day, this ſhall be the happy Caſe!</p>
            <p>Again, GOD cauſes me <hi>to love his Image</hi>

            <p>But <hi>theſe,</hi> my dear Friend, are what I call <hi>Evidences</hi> of a <hi>Work of Grace</hi>: and for my part I had rather be able to read them, than to hear a Voice from Heaven telling me, <hi>I am a Child of</hi> GOD. If you aſk again, <hi>if I can always, or of myſelf read them to my Satisfaction?</hi> I <hi>anſwer,</hi> without CHRIST I can do nothing; I am not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for one good Thought; all my ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is of GOD: But GOD has taught me to live <hi>more</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>leſs</hi> by <hi>Senſe,</hi> than I us'd to do; and therefore if he hide his Face, I do not immediately raze Foundations as formerly, and draw up hard Concluſions againſt myſelf: But having treaſur'd up the <hi>Experiences of many Years,</hi> I repair to them in a dark and cloudy Day, and find, <hi>thus, and thus,</hi> GOD <hi>has done for me, and appear'd for my Help in Times paſt:</hi> and this as an Anchor holds me ſure, and He will in his own time return, and revive me; He has begun that good Work in me, that he will carry on till the the Day of JESUS; HE was the <hi>Author,</hi> and he will be the <hi>Finiſher</hi> of <hi>my Faith:</hi> And ſo he makes me hang on the <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of a <hi>Covenant-</hi>GOD, who will not deceive nor make any aſhamed of their Hope, that put their Truſt in him.</p>
