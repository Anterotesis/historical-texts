            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Theſe muſt be ſuppoſed to be the real Sentiments of all thoſe, who endeavour to proſelite Men from every Sect to the Communion of the eſtabliſhed Church; and I will offer ſomething for Confirmation hereof before I finiſh. But ſhall begin with conſidering Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Objections.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As they ſeem to be levelled againſt the Safety or Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this Communion, eſpecially in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> where his Diſcourſe was delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:006081_0005_102781E77A15C040"/>
I ſay <hi>ſeem</hi> to be levelled, becauſe moſt of his Readers will underſtand that to be the Sequel of his Objections; and that they would not be worth the Pains he takes, if this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was not to be inferred: Although he has not indeed put his Arguments in Mood and Figure.</p>
            <p>To be <hi>Fellow-Labourers,</hi> he calls an <hi>Important Part of the Miniſterial Character.</hi> Page 10. I ſhall not crack my Brains to comprehend the Profundity of this Aſſertion. But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Theme of his Diſcourſe; he would have his Hearers conſider and comprehend, that all Miniſters of Chriſt, are <hi>Fellow-Labourers.</hi> Thus he explains his Senſe of being <hi>Fellow-Labourers;</hi> ſome would think he <hi>ſeems</hi> to conclude, that Men can't be Miniſters of Chriſt, if they don't anſwer his Deſcription in that <q>
                  <hi>Important Part of the miniſterial Character:</hi>
               </q> And then, he tells, us, Page 20. <q>
                  <hi>There are ſeveral Things oppoſite hereto,</hi> and which, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they obtain, prevent Miniſters acting in the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under which they are mentioned in his Text,</q> i. e. <hi>Fellow-Labourers.</hi>— Then he adds, <q>A <hi>fixed PRELACY</hi> in the Church is another Thing repugnant to, deſtructive of that Equality which renders Goſpel-Miniſters <hi>Fellow-Labourers.</hi> This you all know (quoth he) obtains in the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
               </q> The Conſequence muſt at leaſt, <hi>ſeem to be,</hi> that the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is unſafe, Men can't ſafely or lawfully in the Sight of GOD join with them, becauſe ſo <hi>important</hi> a Part of the miniſterial Character is wanting among them. He lays ſo much Streſs upon this <hi>Important</hi> Matter, that I can't think any indifferent Perſon will ſay I have put a forced Conſtruction upon his Diſcourſe, when I make the Concluſion to be a <hi>ſeeming</hi> to ſay, that our Miniſtry is ſo defective in an <hi>Important</hi> Part of the Character, that no ſerious Perſon ſhould venture to join him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch a Communion. What he ſays more largely and particularly, of the Imperfection of the miniſterial Character, Page 21, &amp;c. muſt be underſtood as delivered with a Deſign to <hi>ſeem</hi> at leaſt to conclude, that ſo important Defects attend the Miniſtry of our Church, that a ſerious Chriſtian ſhould be afraid to become one of our Communion.

Another Objection lies againſt the Safety and Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of joining with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> where his Diſcourſe was delivered, <hi>viz.</hi> That by leaving the Aſſemblies of Worſhippers there formed, and going over to the Church of <hi>England</hi> Profeſſion, he ſays, <q>They contract the awful Gum of Schiſm, run into Parties, promote Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, divide and diſturb the Peace of the Church, rend, not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

With Reſpect to the Apoſtles who were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately authorized to gather and govern the Church by this Commiſſion, it ſeems to make them Equals in that Power: Certainly it does not ſubject ſome unto any one of their Number: In ſhort there is no Pope eſtabliſhed by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: And yet I care not ſay, that a Primate among the Apoſtles was repugnant to any Thing contained in this Commiſſion, provided he had been regularly choſen by the College of Apoſtles, who ſeem to have a very ample Power given them, and much leſt to their Wiſdom and Prudence; eſpecially under the Guidance of <hi>Inſpiration.</hi> And if for the more effectually promoting the great Deſign of their being authorized with this ample Power, they had thought fit, or ſhould have been afterwards directed by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to appoint a Preſident and Vice-Preſident out of their Number, and then ſhould have decreed, that in ordaining Colleagues in the Apoſtolate one of theſe ſhould preſide, and no ſuch Ordination performed without the Preſident or Vice Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: And if they had been directed by the Holy Ghoſt, to eſtabliſh Preſidents and Vice Preſidents ſo many as ſhould be ſufficient for Admiſſion of Colleagues into the Apoſtolate in all Ages and Places, I can't conceive any Clauſe of the Commiſſion <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. would have been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened thereby, I ſee no Clauſe ſorbidding ſuch an Imparity, when it ſhould be regularly eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>And as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> allows, that this Commiſſion, enabled them to provide a Succeſſion in their Office, Page 18. — I think we many fairly ſuppoſe alſo, it ſufficiently authorized them to concert ſuch Meaſures, and eſtabliſh ſuch Rules, as might ſeem convenient in an Affair of ſo much Importance to the Church, as the Succeſſion in the Apoſtolate, or Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate which is the ſame, ſhould be; that faithful Men in every Age, might ſucceed in that ſacred Office, and the

            <p>That the <hi>Deacons</hi> were an Order inferior not ony to the Apoſtles, but to other Miniſters then in the Church, Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> allows. Page 16. That they were appointed by the Apoſtles, an <hi>Order</hi> inſtituted for <hi>ſome</hi> Services in the Church, choſen and ordained, Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> allows; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though only ſeven are mentioned as ordained at the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of that Order, yet more were added afterwards; and <hi>their Order,</hi> diſtinct from and inferior to the Preſbyters,

            <p>At the firſt Appointment of this Order, the Apoſtles direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Brethren to look out ſeven Men <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And St. <hi>Stephen</hi> who was one of them, is ſaid to be full of Faith <hi>and Power,</hi> and that be <hi>aid great Wonders and Miracles among the People.</hi> Acts 6.8. He diſputed againſt the Synagogue of Libertines &amp;c. Ver. 9. And <hi>they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Wiſdom and Spirit by which be ſpake,</hi> ver. 10. He preached a long and excellent Sermon. Acts 7. <hi>Philip</hi> who was alſo one of the Seven, preached Chriſt unto them of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Acts 8.5. He wrought Miracles and caſt out unclean Spirits, ver. 5, 7. And baptized his Converts, ver. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13: But confirmation and giving the Holy Ghoſt by Impoſition of Hands, was reſerved to the highest Order. The Apoſtles ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> for this. Ver. 14, 15. &amp;c. Here is a clear Account of one of the loweſt Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (but not ſo low as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> would make him) performing the ſacred offices of Religion, and in the ſame Chapter we are told of his preaching and baptizing, ver. 29, &amp;c. Ver. 40. We find Deacons as well as Biſhops mentioned in the Apoſtle's Salutation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructs <hi>Timothy</hi> about the Qualifications for <hi>Deacons</hi> as well as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.8; <hi>Ignatius,</hi> one of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Chriſtian Writers, mentions Deacons as an Order of the Clergy, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the ſecond Century, mentions the Deacons Power of baptizing with the Preſbyters, as being both alike derived from the Biſhop, and in Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to him. So that we are to look upon Deacons as Miniſters in the Church, deriving their Inſtitution from the Apoſtles, having their Power to preach and baptize in the Name of Chriſt, by Virtue of the Commiſſion Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles, but never were though: <hi>equal Officers</hi> to the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcus</hi> was allowed to be what Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> means by a Miniſter properly ſo called. He is one of the <hi>Synerg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> with St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Text; but the Imparity in this Inſtance I have already proved. And although Mr. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:006081_0016_10278208534E0058"/>by inferring Equality from the Word <hi>Fellow-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers</hi> in his Text, muſt be underſtood to ſay that <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> &amp;c. were equal to St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles; and when he argues Equality among all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, from their deriving Power from the Commiſſion immediately given to the Apoſtles; he muſt mean that all Miniſters, muſt be equal with the Apoſtles, and that therefore the Apoſtles themſelves could not be Prelates, i. e. as having any Authority or Juriſdiction over other Miniſters of the Goſpel, yet I can't believe that Mr. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart</hi> himſelf, or any other Perſon of tolerable Senſe will deny (upon cool Reflection) the <hi>Imparity</hi> in Office and Power, that ſubſiſted between the Apoſtles and other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; I mean <hi>Preſbyters</hi> as well as <hi>Deacons,</hi> ſo long as the Apoſtle themſelves lived and preſided in the Church.</p>
            <p>I don't know of any that pretend to more Orthodoxy than Quakers, that have denied an Order of Elders or Preſbyters ſuperior to Deacons, and inferior to the Apoſtles, of whom Mention is ſo often made in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as by the very firſt Chriſtian Writers and in all later Accounts of Chriſtianity. So that I need ſay no more upon it, and will mention only two Texts in the Writings of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to put the Matter out of all Doubt, that in the firſt planting of Chriſtianity, GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf eſtabliſhed <hi>Imparity</hi> among the Miniſters whom he ſent to preach the Goſpel of his Son; and did not think it was neceſſary all his Miniſters ſhould have one <hi>Office,</hi> and <hi>one Work;</hi> becauſe one Commiſſion to the Apoſtles, was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed ſufficient to convey Power from GOD to every Order and every Individual in each Order to the End of Time; as thereby a Succeſſion might be provided, of ſuch as were well authorized to give Power to as many in each Rank, or Degree of Order and Office, as the Churches Needs ſhould require.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, GOD hath ſet in his Church</hi> firſt Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that <hi>Helps, Governments,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. Then to declare their <hi>Inequality</hi> as much as Words can expreſs, by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006081_0017_10278209D5DFA3D0"/>implying Negation, he adds, ver. 29. <hi>Are all Apoſtles? Are all Prophets?</hi> &amp;c. Meaning no, by no Means. The other Text I ſhall refer to is Eph. 4.11. ſpeaking of the Gifts beſtowed by our Lord upon his Church at his Aſcenſion, <hi>And he gave, ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. I will leave this without a Comment, ſuppoſing the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity made by GOD himſelf at that Time to be very clear and evident; and as ſuch <hi>Imparity</hi> has always in Fact been found in the Church, in every Age, we muſt have better Arguments than ſuch as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has brought, to make any Man of Senſe believe the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Church unſafe meerly becauſe ſuch an <hi>Imparity</hi> is found among her Miniſters: Nay it ſhould on the other Hand be rather thought dangerous to be of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, without Prelacy, eſpecially when all the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Power they have, is claimed from a Commiſſion never given by Chriſt to the Claimants themſelves; nor to any of ſo inferior a Rank as they value themſelves upon, whether of the Laity or ſuch Renegado Preſbyters as threw off their Subjection to their Biſhops, and invaded the ſacred Office contrary to their Ordination-Vow and Promiſe, and Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays Oath too.</p>
            <p>Now, as in all Governments, the Head muſt be the Fountain of Power; what could derive from ſuch whoſe higheſt Station was a State of profeſſed Subjection? And neither GOD nor Man had ever given them the Power of authorizing others, any farther than as Reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits every Man to make a Repreſentative or Attorney for himſelf; but none for another Man, much leſs for GOD; without a ſpecial Authority. So that there is Reaſon to be doubtful, whether after all their Solemnities, they have any more than Deputies from Men, who pretend to act with them in Things pertaining to GOD: And this Doubt muſt be increaſed from what Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſays, Page 17, ſpeaking of the Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles, and in them conſtituting an Order of Prelates, to be continued by regular Succeſſion, viz. Vicarious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from them: Says Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> 
               <q>They to whom it does not belong, are no Miniſters of Chriſt,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006081_0018_10278211B6327F18"/>nor do they derive any Authority from him.</q> — I hope ſome that are ſerious and intelligent, will reflect upon this Paſſage, and conſider how much depends upon Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s being in the Right, in this Argument; in which I think I have ſufficiently proved him miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhould think, the has either proved Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters equal to the Apoſtles; or at leaſt that the Power of ordaining others to the Miniſtry, was committed to them in Equality: and may therefore be claimed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So, Government is neceſſary, but no more neceſſary in the Church to have every Miniſter veſted with the higheſt and chief Power, than in the State to have every Juſtice of Peace, veſted with Power to determine Titles of Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and give final J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<list>
                  <item>1.

                  <item>3. I hope Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> will allow that lawful and juſtifiable Separations contract no Guilt of Schiſm, much leſs ſuch as doing Men's Duty to GOD makes neceſſary. —</item>
                  <item>4. It will lie upon Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> to prove their Societies to be regularly conſtituted Churches of Chriſt, before the Guilt of rending the Body of Chriſt can be fixed upon Separators from them; this will prove a very hard Taſk; but he muſt go through it before his Charge of Schiſm will lie againſt any Sort of Separators from them. And then</item>

            <p>The Method I propoſed in the Beginning of this Letter, will make the Conſideration of ſome Particulars properly fall under my third Head of Diſcourſe, which may help to form a Judgment upon the Charge of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> objects againſt thoſe who leave their Congregations and conform to be Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore I refer to that Place what might otherways have been properly offered here.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I now proceed to take Notice of his Objections that may be conſidered as drawn from the Inexpediency of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> If Perſons of Sob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I deſign here to conſider only what he has ſaid in Relation to the Inundation of Vice, Looſeneſs, Prophaneſs and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality mentioned in the above Paſſage, and much more with great confidence in the ſame Page: confirmed by his own Obſervations in his Travels through half the Plantations in <hi>North-America,</hi> and what he has heard of the Iſlands: How good and regular their Conſtitution is has had ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and ſhall have more under the next Head. — I am willing here to ſuppoſe the Matter doubtful, whether it be very good or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay I would ſuppoſe it not ſo good as it ſhould be in Point of Regularity; ſprung up in Diſorder, and needing ſomething to recommend it beſides its Agreement with the Goſpel; and the Countenance it
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006081_0029_1027822F2BD1A6C0"/>may pretend to have humane Laws: This may ſeem to be, according to Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> a particular Aptneſs in their Conſtitution to promote Virtue and Piety: ſo that although ſo no Objections might be laid againſt the Manner of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and Regularity of their Conſtitution in ſome Points, yet if it has an Aptneſs in any peculiar Manner, to promote real Goodneſs, and ſave a Nation from an Inundation of Vice, or preſerve a Country from growing Immorality and Profaneſs; it might claim an Approbation; at leaſt as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Expedient to preſerve the Country from Wickedneſs and Ruin, which muſt unavoidably come in like a Flood, if the national Eſtabliſhment ſhould prevail, and Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> is to be believed.</p>
            <p>I only therefore propoſe to conſider under this Head, whether ſo much as Inexpediency may be argued againſt conforming to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> on Account of what Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſuggeſts of <hi>

            <p>Every new Sect pretends a Neceſſity of ſeparating from the impure Maſs of Mankind, and have the Vanity to think themſelves the only Saints, and Darlings of Heaven: And commonly they ſeduce well-meaning People into their Snares by Appearances of Piety, and Pretences to a more ſtrict Virtue than other People, upon whoſe Faults and Failings they are very ſharp-ſighted; and take Pains to exaggerate in ſuch Inſtances as they have no great Temptation to be like

The People of <hi>England</hi> were a very religious and pious People before any Independents or Preſbyterians opened Meeting-Houſes in <hi>England,</hi> this is well known to all that are acquainted with our Hiſtory and the Genius of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe Days. And there are remaining to this Day <hi>Monuments</hi> of the Virtue, Piety and practical Godlineſs of our Forefathers, in the Endowments of Churches, Hoſpitals, Colleges and Charity Schools, and many other Inſtances that our deſpiſing Neighbours can't pretend to vie with; and notwithſtanding the large Strides that Vice, Irreligion, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and Profaneneſs have made in their Advances, ſince the Phanatick Phrenzy opened the Sluce of Impiety and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and demoliſhed all the Hedges about Religion and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, when they overturned the Conſtitution of the Nation, pulled down Monarchy in the State, and Prelacy in the Church. Yet vital Piety and Religion fruitful in ſolid Virtue and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Goodneſs is yet to be found in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in a Degree not to be parallel'd by any of her boaſting Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The printed Sermons and Diſcourſes of our Divines are ſufficient Monuments of their laudable Endeavours to put a Stop to the Flood of Atheiſm and Immorality that has been flowing in upon us, the Progreſs of which, although it ought to be lamented, is not owing to the Tendency of any Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, taught by our Church; or any Faults in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> But to the Diſorders and Confuſions introduced by a Variety of Sectaries, all weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Churches Diſcipline, and with much Zeal propagating Notions and Opinions naturally deſtructive of Vertue, and reproachful to Chriſtianity; thus by <hi>ſeeming</hi> very zealous for Godlineſs, in a Way of Strife, Diſorder and Confuſion, and declaiming againſt Morality, and Self-Righteouſneſs, and other Methods which I care not to mention, we have ſeen Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity expoſed to the Contempt of Infidels, and careleſs Living and Vice encouraged by Methods pretending to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Glory of ſovereign Grace.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> had well underſtood, the true Cauſes and Springs from which the Immorality, Atheiſm and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the preſent Age is derived, he could never have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it to any Defects in the Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> in his Diſcourſe there is <hi>Fallacia non Cauſae pro
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006081_0032_10278239DD540E80"/>cauſa,</hi> The Fault he might have found at Home, which in vain he ſeeks abroad. And as the late ſcandalous Efforts of fanatick Zeal ſo diſreputable to Chriſtian Religion, and well known to have direct Tendency to Profaneneſs and impure Living, were an Improvement upon the Doctrines common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received in this Country, and might have made a much greater Progreſs, if the Obſtructions and Checks it met with from the Church of <hi>England</hi> Congregations had been out of the Way, (altho' it muſt be confeſſed to the Honour of many not of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Communion, that they ſhewed a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Diſcountenance to thoſe Diſorders, and did their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to ſuppreſs them.) So, what might be univerſally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of the Temper and Tendency of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Principles with Reference to this Flood of Impiety, Profaneneſs and Licenciouſneſs, the Country was in Danger of being over-run by, may convince every Conſiderate unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd Perſon, that the Danger Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> would alarm People with, of Vice and Wickedneſs coming in among them by Means of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">III. As Objections againſt the Neceſſity of going over to the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Point of Duty. Thoſe that propagate the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> would not put themſelves to ſo many Difficulties, and take ſo much Pains, if they did not believe the Glory of GOD the Welfare of many Souls, were to be promoted thereby, nor ſhould we endeavour to proſelyte <hi>ſome,</hi> if we did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it the Duty and Intereſt of <hi>all</hi> to become Proſelytes. And that it would be every Way, for the Benefit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Country, for the preſent Age, and for Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to have all Parties and Sects ſaid aſide, and the national Conſtitution ſubmitted to, by all the Colonies depending on

            </p>
            <p>The viſible catholick Church of Chriſt, or Chriſtian Church militant, as making one Body <hi>viſible,</hi> of which Chriſt is the Head; may be conſidered with Reſpect to its Parts either <hi>Heterogeous</hi> or <hi>Homogeneous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Heterogeous</hi> Parts, are the various Orders of Clergy and Laity of which the Church is compoſed; and might all be conceived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o belong to the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if the Conſtitution of the Church had been perfectly compleated, before it extended its Limits beyond that large City. The Apoſtles as Colleagues veſted with all the Powers in the Commiſſion, Matth. 28.19. might chuſe St. <hi>James</hi> or any other of their Number, to be their Preſident, and make ſuch <hi>Rules</hi> or <hi>Canons</hi> as they might think proper, eſpecially by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Holy Ghoſt, for regulating the Methods each ſhould purſue, for Preſervation of Unity and Order, in the Execution of the Authority each was inveſted with, by that Commiſſion, to <hi>make Diſciples, baptize,</hi> &amp;c. They might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and determine, what Aſſiſtants ſhould be employed in this Work, and what Manner of Ordination they ſhould have, and what Powers given by ſuch Ordinations; and may be conceived at leaſt, to have not only filled the Place of <hi>Judas</hi> in their own Order, but to have ordained Preſbyters, and Deacons, and appointed each their Truſt and Duty; and with about 5000 Converts to Chriſtianity, as the Laity join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and continuing in their Doctrine, and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; we may conceive this to be then the <hi>viſible</hi> Catholick Chriſtian Church; the <hi>Parts</hi> of different Names and Uſe, the <hi>Apoſtles, Elders and Deacons</hi> for clerical Offices, and the <hi>Laity</hi> according to their ſeveral Stations.—And according to ſuch a Model, under the Preſidency of ſome of the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Order, when People of other Nations embraced the Faith of Chriſt, the Church might extend its Limits; and as many Societies as ſhould be thus formed in different Places, might be called Parts or Members of the one Church.</p>

               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:006081_0034_1027823FE8293448"/>
The <hi>Homologous</hi> Parts therefore, are ſuch Members of the Catholick Church in any Parts of the World, formed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtolical Model; who may be ſaid to be in <hi>their</hi> Doctrine and Fellowſhip; having at leaſt one <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> or a <hi>Succeſſor to the Apoſtles,</hi> in the Fulneſs of Power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>them</hi> by our Lord's Commiſſion, to preſide in Juriſdiction and Ordination. Such Churches are true Parts of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, whether conſiſting of many or fewer Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and may be united into one, although gathered out of ſeveral Nations; if not interfering with the Orders and Rules of the Church Catholick; and may be Churches in ſuch and ſuch Nations, although thoſe Nations may not be chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. But when any Nation becomes Chriſtian, i. e. by any authentick, national Act eſtabliſheth Chriſtianity for the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of ſuch Nation, and receives ſuch a Model of the Church of Chriſt as was ſettled by the Apoſtles, that makes a <hi>nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Church;</hi> the Largeneſs of which may require many of the ſuperior Order of Officers or Succeſſors to the Apoſtles, to anſwer the Ends of Government and Ordination, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although thoſe by Office are equal, the Preſervation of Order in the Church will require Rules for Precedency; hence we find early in the Church <hi>Metropolitans, Primates, Arch-Biſhops,</hi> as well as among the inferior Orders, Arch-Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Arch-Deacons, Deans, Prebends and Canons. And ſuch is the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> firſt a Civil Society Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; having a Right to govern it ſelf, and make Laws to regulate its own moſt important Affairs, without being lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Controul of any Power upon Earth; then adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtianity into their Conſtitution, and by authentick Laws making it the Religion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Support and Dignity of Biſhops, and the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the inferior Clergy, and for the decent Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Chriſtian Worſhip; and thus become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, the <hi>Church of England:</hi> Which is the ſame as the Nation of <hi>England</hi> become Chriſtian, and a true Part or Member of the one Catholick Church.</p>

            <p>Our Conſtitution has been ſo often proved truly primitive and apoſtolical, i. e. agreeing well with the apoſtolical Practice and Rules; and the Practice of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, that I will ſuppoſe nothing needs to be added here upon this Head: Eſpecially conſidering what I have ſaid already in Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Objections againſt the different Orders in our Church. And if we may ſuppoſe the Conſtitution of our national Church to be regular and good, our Prelates, Succeſſors to the Apoſtles in their Power of Ordination and Juriſdiction; and this Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, which I hope may be ſaid truly as well as boldly) it may ſurely be urged upon every Man, that is <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that belongs to his Nation, and is properly a Part of it, in whatever Corner he may live, that his Duty obliges him to be of the Commuion of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And not to make Profeſſion of any Sort of Religion that is oppoſite thereto. If it be every Man's indiſpenſible Duty to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the ſame Duty will oblige him to be and continue a Member of the Church of Chriſt which is his Body, to preſerve and maintain the Peace, Order and Unity of the Body, and eſpecially that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006081_0036_102782446765E448"/>Part to which he particularly belongs; which will infer the Duty of reverencing and ſubmitting to the Officers regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly preſiding and governing in ſuch Church; which being the Biſhops of the Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Neglect, Contempt and Diſobedience ſhew'd to theſe, is therefore a very great Breach of Duty, theſe are ſuch as the Apoſtle commands Chriſtians to obey ſubmit to, Heb. 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit yourſelves; for they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give Account that they may do it with Joy and not with Grief; for that is unprofitable for you.</hi> The Greek Word here rendered <hi>them that have the Rule over you,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Governors,</hi> ſuch as Prelates are in the Church: There are many Texts in the New-T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And become <q>Inſtrumental in deſtroying an eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution ſo exactly agreeable to the Goſpel.</q> — Now if he had proved as well as ſaid, that the Congregations in <hi>Connecticut</hi> are a Communion of regularly inſtituted and well-governed Churches, that have a Conſtitution eccleſiaſtical exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Goſpel; it would have been very much to the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006081_0037_1027824602CA2C20"/>Purpoſe, and indeed no Pleas without this can be of any Force, to take off the Neceſſity I have been urging; and if what he depends upon to ſupport this Pretence proves a Miſtake, the Neceſſity lying upon every Man to conform to the Church, will revolve in full Strength; and muſt be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Without a Clergy regularly authorized to miniſter in the Church of GOD, he will not pretend an eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution agreeable to the Goſpel. What Countenance he pleads to their Manner of ordaining from the Ordination of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> I have already conſidered, as alſo his Plea, that Chriſt's Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, was a Commiſſion to every Miniſter, and therefore conveyed the Right of <hi>ordaining</hi> to every Miniſter, as well as all other Powers given by that Commiſſion, Math. 28.19. unto the Apoſtles; the Abſurdity of this Suppoſition I have alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and refuted, and ſeeing he confeſſeth Page 17. <q>All to whom this <hi>Commiſſion</hi> belongs have full and equal Right to uſe all the Power and Authority contained in it, and they to whom it does not belong, are no Miniſters of Chriſt, nor do they derive any Authority from him.</q> I aſſume, this Commiſſion belongs not to their Miniſters, i. e. as a Commiſſion given by Chriſt to any of them, much leſs all and every Sort of them, he makes the Concluſion himſelf, which I hope will be attended to, more ſeriouſly as coming from him. And their Confidence muſt abate, in Proportion to the Uncertainty of their Plea, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in <hi>their</hi> Commiſſion to act in the Name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It ought to be conſidered that this Opinion is contrary to the Senſe of all Chriſtians that own an <hi>Inequality</hi> of Order, and therefore all the famous and noted Churches from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for my Part, I don't believe the reſt ſubſiſt upon any better Foundation; becauſe ſuch Ordainers, receive no Power from, by or under, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given to the Apoſtles, for the Work of ordaining, and were guilty of Uſurpation, and Diſobedience to the lawful Authority of the Church, in pretending to it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>awful Guilt of Schiſm,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> juſtly calls it, was contracted by thoſe who began the Separation in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> renounced the Authority of their Governors, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited diſcontented People to join in their Diſobedience; to deſpiſe their lawful and faithful Guides, and ſet up Parties againſt them, in Defiance of the Laws both of Church and State, and after the Guilt contracted by ſuch Diſobedience and ſchiſmatical Separations, what In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This needs but little Anſwer; for ſuch an Argument would have the ſame Force in Behalf of the moſt corrupt Religion, and againſt the moſt neceſſary Duty, if Men muſt think themſelves obliged to abide by the Choice of their Parents in their Behalf, when they come to be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Errors.

If Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> has any Thing of this Nature to produce it may be called <hi>ſignally</hi> owned of GOD; but if he means nothing but their boaſted Converſions and ſome Inſtances of Zeal in their Ways of Religion; it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The whole deſerves to be written in Letters of Gold.— This Letter was ſigned by <hi>John Winthrop</hi> Governor, <hi>Richard Saltonſtall, Iſaac Johnſon, Thomas Dudley, William Coddington,</hi> and many more.— Thus ſpake the good Fathers and Founders of <hi>New-England;</hi> and would to GOD Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> and all their Children had the ſame bleſſed Temper which they had, and would ſtill and forever ſpeak as they did.</p>
