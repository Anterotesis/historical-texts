            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE eternal Jehovah ruleth in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can ſtay his hand, or may ſay unto him, What doſt thou? But his government of his church, hath ever been diſtinct from his general government of the world. And from his calling Iſrael out of Egypt, unto the building of his temple by Solomon, their nation was a growing church, diſtinct from all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon earth. But becauſe Solomon ſet up high places for idolatry, God rent away ten tribes from his ſon; and both kingdoms were followed with warnings and corrections, until they were all deſtroyed or carried into captivity. And the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Iſrael never returned from captivity as a nation, but only as individuals; and the kingdom of Judah was always tributary to heathen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, until Chriſt came, exactly according to the voices of the prophets concerning him. Yet when he came, the teachers and rulers of the Jews were
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024061_0005_0FC2FCFA30334F48"/>all againſt him; and after he had cleanſed ten lepers, and one of them had glorified God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, the Phariſees demanded of him, when the kingdom of God ſhould come? He anſwered them and ſaid, The kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation. Neither ſhall they ſay, Lo here, or lo there; for behold, the kingdom of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you.</p>
            <p>The Son of God was born <hi>within</hi> that church, of the ſeed of David, in the town of Bethlehem, according to the prophecy which ſays, <hi>This man ſhall be the peace.</hi> Micah v. 1—5. And when he entered upon his public miniſtry, and appeared in Galilee, the people who ſat in darkneſs, <hi>ſaw great light.</hi> Iſaiah ix. 1—6. Mat. iv. 14—16. Yet many in our day have imagined, that our text proves, that there is a <hi>light within every man,</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the holy ſcriptures. In the year 1773, a paper was printed at Providence, and alſo at Norwich, which repreſented the doctrine of God's electing a certain number of the children of men to holineſs and eternal happineſs, while the reſt are left to periſh in their ſins, to be as cruel as the heathen, "who <hi>ſacrificed their ſons and daughters unto devils.</hi>" And the paper cloſed with ſaying, "Reader, from this, and many other hurtful er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, you would ſoon be diſentangled, could you only ſhake off the chains of <hi>tradition.</hi> The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cry of, <hi>Lo here, or lo there,</hi> in this or that outward communion, would never engage you in any fierce contentions, but rather paſs away unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by you. And the only poſſible way, (believe it, or not) to avoid every prevailing error, and of finding every ſaving truth, is to liſten, ſolemnly, attentively to liſten, agreeable to the written word, <hi>to the ſtill ſmall voice within you.</hi>"</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:024061_0006_0FC2FD041117FDE8"/>
This paper was publiſhed, and was ſpread through New-England, by miniſters who were ſent from Great-Britain, to propagate Epiſcopacy in our land. And after their nation had <hi>murdered</hi> many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, in attempting to bind us in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, the <hi>voice within them,</hi> conſtrained them to make peace with America, to avoid ruin to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Yet in the cloſe of the war, a book from England was reprinted at Philadelphia, which ſays, "If God diſpoſeth the ſtate of events in ſuch a manner, that ſin will moſt certainly follow, and that he alſo permits, or doth not hinder it, he muſt be the ſole <hi>Author</hi> of ſin himſelf, and thoſe who are called the actors, or committers of evil, are only <hi>ſubjects</hi> by whom he effects it:"<note n="*" place="bottom">Phipps againſt Newton, 1783, p. 95.</note> And the author, who gives this aſſertion, refers us to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay, who ſaid, "The kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation, neither ſhall they ſay, <hi>Lo here, or lo there,</hi> for behold the kingdom of God <hi>is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you."</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 205.</note> And ſays his defender, "The <hi>Quakers</hi> neither read the ſcriptures, nor any thing elſe, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their worſhip, as a part of it; but after that is over, they uſually once in the year, take the opportunity, before the congregation ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, to read thoſe ſhort informations and advices which are tranſmitted from the yearly-meeting in London. Theſe advices always conſiſt of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-quotations, and doctrines agreeable to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to the beſt of their knowledge; but the reading of them is no more a part of their worſhip, than the reading teſtimonies of denial againſt immoral members, or the ſubſtance of briefs recommended by the Crown, at ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities." <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 153.</note>

Thus Epiſcopalians and Quakers were agreed, in ſitting up a rule within themſelves above the word of God. Yea, many of them will not allow the holy ſcriptures to be the word of God. But Jeſus ſaid, I am come a <hi>light</hi> into the world, that whoſoever believeth on me, ſhould not abide in darkneſs. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not <hi>my words,</hi> hath one that judgeth him: the <hi>word</hi> that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day. John xii. 46—48. His <hi>words</hi> and his <hi>word</hi> are the ſame, even the will of God revealed by his Spirit. And an inſpired apoſtle ſays, "We are not as many, who <hi>corrupt the word of God;</hi> but as of <hi>ſincerity,</hi> but as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt.—We have renounced the hidden things of <hi>diſhoneſty,</hi> not walking in <hi>craſtineſs,</hi> nor handling <hi>the word of God deceitfully,</hi> but by <hi>manifeſtation of the truth,</hi> commending ourſelves to every man's <hi>conſcience</hi> in the ſight of God. 2 Cor. ii. 17. iv. 2. The body of Jeſus ſaw no corruption, even when it lay in the tomb; therefore the holy ſcriptures are the only word of God that men can corrupt; and they do it, by handling the word deceitfully. And were it not for this wickedneſs, the kingdom of God would be eaſily underſtood, and rejoiced in, under every view of it in his word.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, it means the proclamation of the goſpel to a ſinful world. Therefore the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger who came to prepare the way of the Son of God, ſaid to the Jews, Repent ye; for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is at hand. Mat. iii. 2. And after Jeſus was baptized, and had endured the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the devil, he came into Galilee, preaching
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024061_0008_0FC2FD0E1B202B08"/>the goſpel of the kingdom of God, and ſaying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye and believe the goſpel. And after his death and reſurrection, he appeared unto the <hi>eleven,</hi> and ſaid unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned. Mark i. 14, 15. xvi. 15, 16. This commiſſion was given to the <hi>eleven,</hi> who were all born again. In the covenant of circumciſion, the regenerate and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate were bound together in a national church. Therefore when Chriſt ſent out the <hi>twelve,</hi> he ſaid, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not. But go rather to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, and as ye go, preach, ſaying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Judas the <hi>traitor</hi> was included in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Mat. x. 1.—7. But after Chriſt by his death had diſannulled the covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, he gave the pure goſpel commiſſion to none but regenerate perſons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> ſenſe in which the kingdom of God is taken in his word, is the change of heart which is produced thereby. When the Son of God, the great <hi>light of the world,</hi> came to his own people, they received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believed on his name; who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And Jeſus ſaid, Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God. John i. 12, 13. iii. 3. But men have been ſo far from believing him, that they have gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally held to the bringing of perſons into the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024061_0009_0FC2FD0F63B75F20"/>kingdom of God by blood, by their own wills, or by the wills of other men; and from thence have come all national churches. But God ſays, Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.—Him that is weak in the ſaith receive you, but not to doubtful diſputations.—For the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Rom. x. 17. xiv. 1, 17. But men have commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived perſons into the church, without any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their being <hi>in the ſaith;</hi> and they have purſued all with <hi>doubtful diſputations,</hi> who have refuſed to obey man in the things of God. He requires each one to act ſaithfully and kindly in every ſtation of life, as they can anſwer it to their great Judge. And he ſays, If any man each other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and conſent not to wholſom <hi>words,</hi> even the <hi>words</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine which is according to <hi>godlineſs;</hi> he is proud, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, but doting about queſtions and ſtriſes of words, whereof cometh envy, ſtriſe, railings, evil ſurmiſings, <hi>perverſe diſputings</hi> of men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds, and deſtitute of the <hi>truth,</hi> ſuppoſing that <hi>gain is godlineſs:</hi> from ſuch withdraw thyſelf. Yet, becauſe <hi>godlineſs</hi> and <hi>boneſty,</hi> are connected with prayer for civil rulers, many have imagined that they ought to ſupport religious teachers by <hi>force.</hi> Whereas this practice came from <hi>ſeducing ſpirits, and doctrines of devils.</hi> But <hi>godlineſs</hi> is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 1 Tim. ii. 2. iv. 1—8. vi. 1—5. And, to guard againſt anxiety about food and raiment, our Lord ſays, Seek firſt the kingdom of God, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you. Mat. vi. 33. How much then are all men
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024061_0010_0FC2FD10B88BAD70"/>deceived, who uſe ſecular force to ſupport religious teachers? In them the prophecy is fulfilled, which ſays, All ye beaſts of the field, come to devour, yea, all the beaſts of the foreſt. His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; ſleeping, lying down, loving to ſlumber. Yea, they are <hi>greedy dogs,</hi> which can <hi>never have enough,</hi> and they are ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds that cannot underſtand: they all look to their <hi>own way,</hi> every one for his <hi>gain</hi> from his quarter. Iſaiah lvi. 9—12. What a hand have ſuch teachers had in all the wars among the nations?</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> ſenſe of the kingdom of God, is his government of his viſible church. Our Lord ſaid, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence. Pilate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid unto him, Art thou a king then? Jeſus anſwered, Thou ſayſt that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the <hi>truth.</hi> Every one that is of the <hi>truth,</hi> heareth my voice. John xviii. 36, 37. Fighting with the <hi>ſword,</hi> is neceſſary in the government of this world; and ſubjection thereto ought to be a matter of <hi>conſcience</hi> with every ſoul. Rom. xiii. 1—5. But the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of the church ſhould be as diſtinct from all worldly ſtates, as the power of <hi>truth</hi> on the mind, is from the <hi>ſword</hi> on the body. For Jeſus ſaid to the <hi>eleven,</hi> All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſoever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024061_0011_0FC2FD1A7011E498"/>alway even unto the end of the world. Amen. Mat. xxviii. 16—20. It was before obſerved, that this commiſſion was given to the <hi>eleven,</hi> without any <hi>traitor</hi> among them. But God ſays, In the laſt days perilous times ſhall come; for men ſhall be lovers of their ownſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, <hi>traitors,</hi> heady, highminded, lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God; having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof: from ſuch turn away. 2 Tim. iii. 1—5. Language cannot deſcribe our times more exactly, than was thus done by inſpiration above ſeventeen hundred years ago. And a great means of theſe evils, hath been the uſe of the ſword in religious affairs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the command of Chriſt, who ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who ſowed good ſeed in his field; but while men ſlept, his enemy came and ſowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was ſprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares alſo. So the ſervants of the houſholder came and ſaid unto him, Sir, didſt thou not ſow good ſeed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He ſaid unto them, An enemy hath done this. The ſervants ſaid unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he ſaid, Nay; leſt while ye gather up the tares, ye root up alſo the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harveſt; and in the time of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt I will ſay to the reapers, Gather ye together firſt the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.—He that ſoweth the good ſeed is the Son of man: the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024061_0012_0FC2FD1BF46A59A8"/>field is the world: the good ſeed are the children of the kingdom: but the tares are the children of the wicked one: the enemy that ſowed them, is the devil; the harveſt is the end of the world, and the reapers are the angels. Mat. xiii. 24—30, 37—39. Accordingly he ſaid unto hypocrites in the Jewiſh church, Ye are of your father the <hi>devil,</hi> and the luſts of your father ye will do: he was a <hi>murderer</hi> from the beginning, and abode not <hi>in the truth,</hi> becauſe there is no <hi>truth</hi> in him. When he ſpeaketh a <hi>lie,</hi> he ſpeaketh of his own; for he is a <hi>liar,</hi> and the <hi>father of it.</hi> John viii. 44. And it is impoſſible for the ſervants of Chriſt to root up all hypocrites out of the world, without deſtroying the ſaints with them. Yea, and the uſe of the ſword in religious affairs; arms the enemies of God againſt his children, as the experience of all ages hath demonſtrated. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the kingdom of God, means his coming in the laſt day, to judge the world in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; when the wicked ſhall go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment, and the righteous be received into life eternal. Therefore Jeſus ſays unto his diſciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and follow me. For whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it: and whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall find it. For what is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul? For the Son of man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then ſhall he reward every man according to his works. Mat. xvi. 24—27. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily verily I ſay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear ſhall live. For
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024061_0013_0FC2FD296236E940"/>as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf; and hath given him authority to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man. Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection of damnation. John v. 25—29.</p>
            <p>And theſe five ſenſes are perfectly harmonious. For the proclamation of the goſpel, believed with the heart, and obeyed in the church, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring any man in the world, as each one can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to God in the laſt day, is a glorious kingdom which cannot be moved. And if the church of Chriſt was governed wholly by his laws, enforced in his name, ſhe would be an infinite bleſſing to human ſociety. For juſtice, mercy, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are the effence of all the revealed will of God. And he ſaid of Abraham, I know him, that he will command his children and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken of him. Gen. xviii. 19. Juſtice and judgment, is the only way to enjoy the promiſed mercy of God to ſinful men. Only a <hi>remnant</hi> of the children of Iſrael, were ſaved by the Son of God, whoſe goings forth have been from of old, from everlaſting. And when they enquired about the way of acceptance with him, he ſaid, He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is <hi>good;</hi> and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? Micah v. 1—5. vi. 8. And when one ſaid to Jeſus, <hi>Good</hi> maſter, what good thing ſhall I do that I may have eternal life?
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024061_0014_0FC2FD2AA8FB9F78"/>Jeſus ſaid, Why calleſt thou me good? there is none good but one, that is <hi>God.</hi> And when he parted with Jeſus, rather than to part with his riches, in acts of mercy, Jeſus ſaid, It is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When the diſciples heard it, they were exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amazed, ſaying, Who then can be ſaved? But Jeſus beheld them, and ſaid unto them, With men this is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Mat. xix. 16—26.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible with men, to convince any ſoul that Jeſus is truly <hi>God,</hi> and that all <hi>good,</hi> for time and eternity, is only to be enjoyed by ſaith in his <hi>perfect righteouſneſs,</hi> and obedience to his <hi>holy word.</hi> But the Spirit of God convinced three thouſand ſouls hereof in <hi>one day;</hi> and to them it was ſaid, The <hi>promiſe</hi> is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, <hi>even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.—Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized.</hi> Acts ii. 37—41. Chriſt hath redeemed us from the <hi>curſe</hi> of the law, being made a <hi>curſe</hi> for us—that the <hi>bleſſing</hi> of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt; that we might receive the <hi>promiſe of the Spirit through faith.</hi> And they who think to receive it in any other way, are <hi>bewitched.</hi> Gal. iii. 1—14. For by thy <hi>ſorceries</hi> were all nations <hi>deceived.</hi> Rev. xviii. 23. If men were not <hi>deceived,</hi> they would never claim the promiſes of God, in a way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to his precepts. And as the church is preſented as a <hi>chaſte virgin to Chriſt,</hi> it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any men to have a <hi>commanding</hi> power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But all <hi>deceitful teachers,</hi> are <hi>miniſters of the devil.</hi> And Paul appealed to the church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth againſt ſuch, and ſaid, In the mouth of two
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024061_0015_0FC2FD2BB76BAAF8"/>or three witneſſes ſhall every word be eſtabliſhed. 2 Cor. xi. 2—15. xiii. 1. Exactly according to the law of Chriſt, who ſays to his church, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven. Mat. xviii. 15—18.</p>
            <p>But this government of his <hi>holy city,</hi> hath been trodden under foot, ever ſince the <hi>beaſt</hi> aroſe out of the bottomleſs pit, who received his power from the <hi>devil.</hi> Rev. xi. 2—10. xiii. 1—8. <hi>Force and cruelty,</hi> is the way of the <hi>beaſts,</hi> from whom our ſpiritual <hi>David</hi> will deliver his flock. Ezek. xxxiv. 4—25. Proteſtants have exerciſed all the power of the firſt beaſt at Rome, and have carried blood and ſlavery around the world, in galleys and gallant ſhips. But the church of Chriſt will yet be a quiet habitation; For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king, he will ſave us. And he ſays to Babylon, Thy <hi>merchants</hi> with whom thou haſt laboured from thy youth, ſhall wander every one to his quarter; none ſhall ſave thee. Iſaiah xxxiii. 20—22. xlvii. 10—15. Rev. xviii. 23. The reaſon why piety, religion, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, are eſſentially neceſſary for the good order of human ſociety, is becauſe they are as much above the <hi>commanding</hi> power of man, as the ſhowers and ſhines of heaven are. Therefore Moſes ſays, My doctrine ſhall drop as the rain, my ſpeech ſhall diſtill as the dew, as the ſmall rain upon the tender herb, and as the ſhowers upon the graſs. Becauſe I will publiſh the name of the Lord: aſcribe ye greatneſs unto our God. He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is he.—But Jeſhurun waxed fat, and kicked—then he forſook God which made him, and lightly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024061_0016_0FC2FD2DE6A566F0"/>eſteemed the Rock of his ſalvation.—To me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vengeance and recompenſe; their foot ſhall ſlide in due time. Deut. xxxii. 2—4, 15, 35. From whence an inſpired apoſtle ſays, Dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, avenge not yourſelves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, ſaith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink: for in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evil with good. Rom. xii. 19—21. Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; (for he is faithful that promiſed) and let us conſider one another, to provoke unto love, and to good works; not forſaking the aſſembling of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting one another, and ſo much the more as ye ſee the day approaching. For if we ſin <hi>wilfully,</hi> after that we have received the knowledge of the <hi>truth,</hi> there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. He that deſpiſed Moſes law died without mercy, under two or three witneſſes: of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done <hi>deſpite unto the Spirit of grace?</hi> For we know him that hath ſaid, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompenſe, ſaith the Lord. Heb. x. 23—30.</p>
            <p>The body of the Son of God never was trodden under foot; but his holy laws have been, and his blood hath been counted an unholy thing, and great deſpite hath been done to the Spirit of grace.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024061_0017_0FC2FD3872668EB0"/>The devils believe that there is one God; and they tremble before the Son of God. And all men who profeſs faith in Chriſt, and do not obey his laws, have only a dead faith. For as the body without the ſpirit is dead, ſo faith without works is dead alſo. James ii. 19—26. From whence I conclude, that the killing of God's two witneſſes, is triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the revealed will of God, which uſed to torment the conſciences of men. Rev. xi. 9, 10. But God ſays, Behold, the day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name, ſhall the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ariſe with healing in his wings; and ye ſhall go forth and grow up as calves of the ſtall. And ye ſhall tread down the wicked, for they ſhall be aſhes under the ſoles of your feet, in the day that I ſhall do this, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. Mal. iv. 1—3. And an inſpired apoſtle ſays, We, according to his promiſe, look for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. 2 Peter iii. 13. All which proves that piety, religion, and morality, are as much above the commanding power of men, as the ſhowers of heaven are, or the ſun in the firmament.</p>
            <p>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and obedience to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God, INDEPENDENT of the world, is the only way to eſcape <hi>everlaſting burnings.</hi> For he ſays, He that walketh righteouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly, he that deſpiſeth the gain of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that ſhaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that ſtoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and ſhutteth his eyes from ſeeing evil; he ſhall dwell on high, his place of defence ſhall be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024061_0018_0FC2FD39E9D30800"/>the munition of rocks, bread ſhall be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure. Thine eyes ſhall ſee the King in his beauty; they ſhall behold the land that is very far off. Iſaiah xxxiii. 13—17. But the general cry of the world is, Caſt in thy lot among us, let us all have one purſe.—Their feet run to evil, and make haſte to ſhed blood. Surely in vain the net is ſpread in the ſight of any bird. And they lay wait for their own blood, they lurk privily for their own lives. So are the ways of every one that is <hi>greedy of gain;</hi> which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. Prov. i. 14—19. Which paſſage is expreſsly applied to <hi>all the world.</hi> Rom. iii. 15—19. And what a <hi>net</hi> did Great-Britain lay for their own <hi>feet,</hi> when they were lately ſo <hi>greedy of gain!</hi> Yea, how many <hi>lives</hi> did their <hi>bribery</hi> take away! For their national debt <hi>bribed</hi> all parts of the kingdom, to purſue their was againſt America to the laſt extremity. And the ſame <hi>merchandiſe</hi> is now carried on in our land; for our public ſecurities are daily bought and ſold <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> ſo <hi>that truth is fallen in the ſtreet, and equity cannot enter.</hi> But the eternal Father ſays to his Son, My <hi>Spirit</hi> that is upon thee, and my <hi>words</hi> which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and forever. Iſaiah lix. 14, 20, 21. And this is the only way for any to be <hi>ingrafted</hi> into the church of Chriſt, which is <hi>life from the dead.</hi> Rom. xi. 15—27. For he ſays, It is the <hi>Spirit</hi> that quickneth, the <hi>fleſh</hi> profiteth nothing; the <hi>words</hi> that I ſpeak unto you, they are <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and they are <hi>life.</hi> John vi. 63. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, and receive with meekneſs the <hi>ingrafted
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024061_0019_0FC2FD3B6D090D80"/>word,</hi> which is able to ſave your ſouls. James i. 21. Being <hi>born again,</hi> not of corruptible ſeed, but incorruptible, by the <hi>word of God</hi> which liveth and abideth forever.—Ye are a choſen generation, a royal prieſthood, an holy nation, a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called you out of darkneſs into his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light. 1 Peter i. 23. ii. 9.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the only <hi>prieſthood,</hi> and <hi>holy nation,</hi> that God hath under heaven. And to them he ſays, Submit yourſelves to every <hi>ordinance of man</hi> for the Lord's ſake. 1 Peter ii. 13. While he alſo ſays to them, Beware left any man ſpoil you through <hi>philoſophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt. —After the commandments and doctrines of men, which things have indeed a ſhew of wiſdom in willworſhip and humility, and neglecting of the body, not in any honor to the ſatisfying of the fleſh.</hi> Col. viii. 22, 23. Yet after the apoſtolic age, philoſophy and vain deceit, ſpoiled the church in ſuch a manner, as to call her officers the <hi>prieſthood,</hi> in diſtinction from the brethren; and they pretended to make child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren <hi>holy,</hi> without their own knowledge or choice. And this <hi>willworſhip</hi> hath been handed down by <hi>tradition</hi> through the church of Rome, who is the <hi>mother of harlots,</hi> and full of <hi>robbery</hi> and <hi>murder.</hi> The national church of Iſrael <hi>robbed God,</hi> when they neglected to communicate the tithes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings which he required of them. Mal. iii. 8. But when ſhe ſaid, I will go after <hi>my lovers,</hi> that gave me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink, <hi>ſhe played the harlot.</hi> And God ſaid of her officers, As <hi>troops of robbers</hi> wait for a man, ſo the company of <hi>prieſts murder</hi> in the way by conſent; for they commit
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024061_0020_0FC2FD3CE7D02B50"/>
               <hi>lewdneſs.</hi> Hoſea ii. 5. vi. 9. The <hi>heads</hi> thereof judge for reward, and the <hi>prieſts</hi> thereof teach for hire, and the <hi>prophets</hi> thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. Micah iii. 11. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord hath ſpoken, I have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have <hi>rebelled</hi> againſt me.—When ye come to appear before me, who hath <hi>required</hi> this at your hand to tread my courts?—Your hands are full of <hi>blood.</hi> Iſaiah i. 2, 12, 15. And he ſays to the Chriſtian church, The prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt. But there were falſe <hi>prophets</hi> alſo among the people, even as there ſhall be falſe <hi>teachers</hi> among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable <hi>hereſies,</hi> even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwiſt deſtruction. And many ſhall follow their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious ways, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of. And through <hi>covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſhall they with feigned words make <hi>merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of you:</hi> whoſe judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation ſlumbereth not. 2 Peter i. 21. ii. 1—3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rebellion,</hi> in the old teſtament, and <hi>hereſy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goſpel, evidently mean the ſame thing. Therefore when Chriſt had diſannulled the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of circumciſion, and had eſtabliſhed the new covenant with his church, the Jews called it <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> a <hi>ſect,</hi> and <hi>hereſy.</hi> Acts xxiv. 5, 14. And <hi>diviſions, ſeditions,</hi> and <hi>hereſies,</hi> are works of the <hi>fleſh.</hi> But the fruit of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is love, joy, peace, long ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, temperance: againſt ſuch there is no law.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024061_0021_0FC2FD4661F0DBA8"/>And they that are Chriſt's have <hi>crucified the fleſh,</hi> with the affections and luſts. 1 Cor. xi. 18, 19. Gal. v. 20—24. And God ſays, A man that is an <hi>heretick,</hi> after the firſt and ſecond admonition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; knowing that he that is ſuch, is ſubverted, and ſinneth, being condemned of himſelf. Titus iii. 10, 11. Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the law and the prophets. And men who aſſume the place of judges of others, while they diſregard this rule of equity themſelves, are <hi>hypocrites, dogs, ſwine,</hi> and <hi>wolves.</hi> Mat. vii. 5 6, 12, 15. They <hi>deſpiſe government,</hi> and are <hi>ſelf-willed,</hi> under the name of liberty. The <hi>dog</hi> is turned to his own vomit again; and the <hi>ſow</hi> that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire. 2 Peter ii. 10, 19, 22.</p>
            <p>Known laws, well executed, within certain lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, is the eſſence of all government among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And the laws of Chriſt, executed by his church, where all are to act as little children, is his plan of government therein. And he ſays, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall not receive the kingdom of God as a <hi>little child,</hi> he ſhall not enter therein.—The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> exerciſe <hi>lordſhip</hi> over them—but ſo ſhall it not be among you. Mark x. 15, 42, 43. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall tread the <hi>holy city</hi> under foot forty and two months.—Power ſhall be given unto the <hi>beaſt</hi> to continue forty and two months. Rev. xi. 2. xiii. 5. But God ſays to his children, Ye know that no whore-monger, nor unclean perſon, nor <hi>covetous man who is an idolater,</hi> hath any inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the kingdom of Chriſt, and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words; for becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience. Be not ye therefore
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024061_0022_0FC2FD476FFB7668"/>partakers with them. Eph. v. 5—7. Come out from among them, and be ye <hi>ſeparate,</hi> ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty. 2 Cor. vi. 14—18. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares deceitful teachers and profeſſors, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, who are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the vengeance of eternal fire. Deut. xxxii. 31.—34. Iſaiah i. 9—15. Jer. xxiii. 14. Ezek. xvi. 46—50. Jude 7, 8. And men who ſin againſt the light of the goſpel are worſe than Sodom. Mat. x. 15. xi. 24. Luke x. 12. And they who have <hi>a form of godlineſs,</hi> while they <hi>reſiſt the truth,</hi> are like the magicians of Egypt. 2 Tim. iii. 1—8. And the great city, in the ſtreet of which the two witneſſes will lie dead, three days and an half, is <hi>ſpiritually</hi> called Sodom and Egypt, where alſo our Lord was crucified. Rev. xi. 7—10. He was crucified by <hi>hypocrites</hi> and <hi>infidels;</hi> and how do ſuch now hold his church in bondage? They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to allow her to ſerve God according to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, without injuring any man in the world. And a church of Chriſt, governed wholly by his laws, is not eſteemed a corporation ſtrong enough to ſecure worldly property that is <hi>conſecrated</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious uſes. Many BANKS are formed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of earthly gain, while few give their ſervices and money into the Lord's BANK. Yet he ſays, Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom. Sell that ye have, and give alms: provide yourſelves bags which wax not old, a treaſure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth.
