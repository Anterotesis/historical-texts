            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SHORT HISTORY OF THE YELLOW FEVER, <hi>That broke out in Philadelphia in</hi> 1797.</head>
            <p>ABOUT the end of July, 1797, the yellow fever again made its appearance in Philadelphia. It conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to extend through various parts of the City and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for about three months. Towards the cloſe of October, ſome days of cold weather, or perhaps ſome natural cauſe beyond the reach of human conception, by degrees, abated its violence. Its ravages have now ceaſed; or, if a few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining patients can be found, they are only to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as convaleſcents, and rare exceptions to the general ſtatement, that the city is now reſtored to its uſual propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of healthineſs.</p>
            <p>The citizens became more early aware of their danger than in 1793; and the ſpeedy flight of many thouſands of them into the country, ſeems to have been the chief cauſe why the mortality of this contagion has been ſo much leſs violent than that of the former. By the way, though not ſo generally known as to create alarm, it is true, that in the fall of 1794, Philadelphia had a tranſient viſit from this fatal ſcourge. A ſmall number of perſons, perhaps twenty or thirty, died of it. The unexpected intervention of one or two days of a wind more than uſually cold for that ſeaſon of the year, was the apparent cauſe of its abrupt extinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Perhaps the infection might be leſs violent in its nature than that of the former year. It is well known, that the plague, while remaining identically the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, hath yet very different degrees of violence in its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032138_0003_0FF1531F6BF26978"/>viſitations. In 1794, the ſickneſs was kept a ſecret by thoſe who had an opportunity to be acquainted with its having reached the city. The news was, on every account, unwelcome; and, happily, there did not occur any poſitive occaſion for its being generally divulged.</p>
            <p>As the conſequences of the preſent fever have been much leſs dreadful than of that in 1793, an account of it will be far leſs intereſting; beſides, the ſubject has loſt much of novelty. The ſilent deſolation of our ſtreets in one year, diſplays a cloſe reſemblance to the ſame ſcene in another year. But ſtill it may be proper that ſome compendious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhould be given of this calamity, that hath again ſo abruptly ſwept away ſo many of our relations and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances.</p>
            <p>On the 11th of Auguſt, 1797, the governor of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania iſſued a proclamation. He mentioned the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of a contagious diſeaſe exiſting in the Weſt-Indies. He enjoined that every veſſel from the Iſlands, from New-Orleans, or from any French, Dutch, or Spaniſh ports on the Main, ſhould perform quarantine for five days, at the health-office, on State-Iſland; or for ſuch longer time, as the reſident phyſicians and officers of the health-office ſhould adviſe.</p>
            <p>A ſecond copy of this proclamation was iſſued on the 15th of Auguſt, with the addition of "<hi>Britiſh</hi>" ports on the Main. On the 14th, the governor wrote a letter to Dr. John Redman, preſident of the college of phyſicians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting a ſtate of facts as to the origin and progreſs of the contagion. The anſwer, dated Auguſt 16th, ſaid, in a few words, that "a malignant contagious fever has lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Penn-ſtreet, and its vicinity, of which ten or twelve perſons have died." He promiſed to communicate, as ſpeedily as poſſible, the advice of the college.</p>
            <p>The following piece appeared, on the 16th of Auguſt, in the newſpapers:</p>

                  <p>A conſiderable alarm having been created in the city, reſpecting the prevalence of the yellow fever, in conſequence
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032138_0004_0FF1531614C1A8E0"/>of the death of ſome perſons in the neighbourhood of Penn and Pine-ſtreets; and as ſome have attempted to trace the diſeaſe to certain veſſels from the Weſt-Indies, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for me to aſſure the citizens, that as every veſſel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the port of Philadelphia from a foreign port, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes an examination at their arrival off this place, I will pledge my reputation, that no perſon, ill with the <hi>yellow fever, or other contagious diſeaſe,</hi> has paſſed through my hands from ſea into the city, during the preſent ſummer.</p>
                  <p>The armed ſhip Hinde, from Cape Nichola Mole, has been accuſed of importing the diſeaſe,<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſhip Hinde arrived at Philadelphia on the 3d inſt. and lay in the ſtream till Sunday the 6th, the day <hi>after</hi> the deceaſe of Mr. Nathaniel Lewis.</note> although that veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel lay at a diſtant part of the city from Pine-ſtreet wharf. It has been aſſerted publicly (and by thoſe whom I ſhould have expected would have aſcertained the fact, before cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating a report, ſo abſurd in its nature, and injurious to my character) that the above veſſel was never examined previouſly to her arrival, but permitted to paſs, after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring where ſhe was from!! The falſity of this ſtory may at once be proved by referring to the files of the health-office, Philadelphia, where the uſual official interrogatories of the captain of the Hinde are preſerved, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the maſters of all foreign veſſels, at their arrival at the health-office, State-Iſland.</p>
                  <p>The ſhip Arethuſa, from Havannah, in ballaſt, arrived healthy, and continued ſo after five days quarantine, on the 24th of July, when ſhe came up to the city. She has alſo been accuſed of infecting the people of Penn-ſtreet; but it has never been proved that any of the citizens who have died were nigh that ſhip. The pilot, it appears, from imprudently ſleeping on deck during the quarantine, was ſeized with a fever on his way up to the city. Dr. Currie, his phyſician, informed me, that it was attended with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory bilious ſymptoms, and that he was well in five days. For the ſatisfaction of the public, I ſhall make a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtatement of the deaths on board this ſhip during the voyage, before her arrival at the Havannah.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:032138_0005_0FF153020C9EA6E0"/>On the 16th of Auguſt, a proclamation was iſſued from the health-office. Citizens, in general, and eſpecially thoſe keeping lodging-houſes for ſailors, and paſſengers from veſſels, were adviſed to give notice of any ſuch perſons, if ſeized with indiſpoſition, having the appearance of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, to the health-office; to Dr. Samuel Duffield, No. 12, Cheſnut-ſtreet; to captain William Allen, No. 2, Key's-Alley, or to any of the inſpectors of health in the City or Liberties, that the patients might be removed to the city hoſpital, where every accommodation was provided for their reception.</p>

I have ſince found that the Hinde lay very near to Pine-ſtreet wharf, and that the pilot of the Arethuſa attributes his cold and ſubſequent fever to ſleeping in the cabin the evening before going to town, in a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock, and to the rain which beat in through four win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows upon him. Neither of theſe facts, however, will tend to prove the above veſſels were concerned in producing the diſeaſe of Penn-ſtreet.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032138_0007_0FF152F3E3AB0310"/>veſſels; from the time, the place and the manner that the diſeaſe (which has lately appeared in this city) commenced and has progreſſed, and from the moſt perfect reſemblance of the fever to the yellow fever of the Weſt-Indies, there can be no heſitation with thoſe that have a competent knowledge of medical hiſtory, in pronouncing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, or the contagion which gave riſe to the diſeaſe, to have been imported in ſome veſſel from the Weſt-Indies, though no perſon ill of the diſeaſe, had arrived from ſea with it.</p>
                  <p>And that the diſeaſe was introduced by ſome articles on board the Arethuſa, the following circumſtances render more than probable:</p>
                  <p>The ſhip Arethuſa tranſported fifty-ſeven ſlaves from Jamaica to the Havanna, ſome time in June laſt; and loſt three men on the paſſage with the yellow fever: to the truth of this, Mr. Philip Kingſton, who was paſſenger on board, has ſubſcribed; nor is it pretended to be denied by the captain or mate. The captain alſo omitted making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the phyſician of the health hoſpital, of a boy that died on board after Mr. Kingſton left the veſſel. The veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel arrived at the fort on the 18th or 19th of July, with eleven hands, all apparently healthy; performed five days quarantine; left the mate at the hoſpital, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained twelve days, with ſymptoms of diarrhoea, or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery.</p>
                  <p>The pilot was conveyed to his lodgings in Shippen-ſtreet ſoon after his arrival: I viſited him the next morning, and found him labouring under ſymptoms of high fever, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe of the inflammatory kind, with a pain in his head and back; red eyes, tinged with yellow; had been delirious in the night; all theſe ſymptoms ſubſided the day following, ſucceeded by great debility and ſickneſs at ſtomach. Theſe gave way to evacuating remedies, and he had no more complaint of fever after the 5th day. I ſuſpected the caſe, at the time, to be the ſame as the yellow fever of the Weſt-Indies, which has been uſually, but very improperly, called the inflammatory bilious fever; and in compliance with common language, in converſation with Dr. Meaſe, did mention that the fever was attended with inflammatory bilious ſymptoms, inſtead of inflammatory
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032138_0008_0FF152D7901B5A20"/>ſymptoms, ſucceeded by thoſe of a bilious nature, which I declare was the fact, and ought ſo to have been ſtated to expreſs my preciſe meaning.</p>
                  <p>Five days after the arrival of the Arethuſa, while lying along-ſide of her, five of the crew of the Iris were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with ſymptoms of the yellow fever; all on the ſame day, or within one day of each other, and a few days after, two more of the crew: one of theſe, whoſe name was Flood, died with unequivocal ſymptoms of the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; among other ſymptoms, he had the black vomiting to a high degree.</p>
                  <p>Theſe facts can be ſubſtantiated by unqueſtionable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. I, therefore, have thought proper to make this haſty ſtatement for the information and ſatisfaction of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>

                     <p>P. S. The diſeaſe almoſt invariably gives way to judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bleeding and mercurial purges, when application is made ſoon after the attack. The attack is generally ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and begins with pain in the head and back, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with chills. The patient, though uneaſy at ſtomach, ſeldom has any puking before the end of the ſecond day. The diſeaſe terminates on the third or fourth day when properly treated. This diſeaſe may be effectually eſcaped, by avoiding all communication with the ſick, and the houſes where they have been ſick.</p>

            <p>The following letter was tranſmitted from Dr. Redman, to governor Mifflin, in anſwer to his requeſt for the advice of the college of phyſicians:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>The college of phyſicians having attentively conſidered your requeſt "of giving an opinion on the beſt mode of averting the calamity which threatens us," have directed me to communicate to you the following methods: 1ſt. For preventing the ſpreading of contagious diſeaſes when intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced amongſt us, and 2dly. For preventing the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſuch diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. To prevent the ſpreading of contagious diſeaſes when introduced;—we recommend the moſt ſcrupulous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to cleaning and watering the ſtreets, particularly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032138_0009_0FF152D93062CB88"/>waſhing out the gutters, habits of temperance, caution as to cloathing, fatigue of body, and expoſure to the ſun and night air. When it is aſcertained that ſuch diſeaſes exiſt, let the phyſicians of the city be enjoined to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to the board of health, to whom they ſhould daily report ſuch caſes as may occur. Let all unneceſſary intercourſe be ſuſpended with that part of the city where the diſeaſe firſt appears. Let ſuch of the ſick and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, who reſide in any part of the city where their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may prove hurtful or dangerous, be immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. When the diſeaſe is aſcertained to exiſt in ſeveral houſes near to each other, in any part of the city, let all the neighbouring families who have eſcaped infection, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and all communication between the infected fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and the city be ſuſpended, by preventing any perſons except thoſe whoſe viſits are eſſentially neceſſary to the ſick, previous to their removal, from entering into that part of the town. For this purpoſe, mercantile buſineſs muſt, of courſe, be ſuſpended there, and the veſſels removed from the adjoining wharves. All ſuſpected wharves and houſes, particularly ſuch as have been occupied by the ſick, ſhould be purified by order of the board, in the manner former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended by the college.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. To prevent the introduction of contagious diſeaſes, we recommend, that a new law on this ſubject be made, conſtituting a board of health, conſiſting of five perſons, including two phyſicians, of whom three ſhall be citizens of Philadelphia, one an inhabitant of the Northern Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and one an inhabitant of Southwark; who ſhall meet daily during the months of June, July, Auguſt, and Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. They ſhall have full power to do every thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reſpecting the quarantine to be performed by veſſels arriving in this port, as well as to direct the removal of any veſſels, after their arrival at the city, which may be found or ſuſpected to be unhealthy. A conſulting and a reſiding phyſician ſhould be appointed; the former to dwell in the city, and the latter to be generally at the health office on State-Iſland, from which he is never to be abſent during the above-mentioned months. Every veſſel which arrives from the Weſt-Indies, from the American Main to the ſouthward of Florida, or from the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032138_0010_0FF152ACA7A60A28"/>during theſe months, ſhould perform a quarantine of not leſs than thirty days; and all ſuſpected veſſels ſhould have every article, wrought or unwrought, which is uſed for cloathing or bedding, or which may be ſuppoſed to contain infection, particularly thoſe which are compoſed of cotton, wool and ſilk, unladen and purified at the iſland.</p>

            <p>Hopes were ſtill entertained that the progreſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion might be checked. On the 21ſt of Auguſt, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectors of the health office publiſhed an addreſs to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. They began with aſſuring the public that the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which had made its appearance in Penn-ſtreet and its vicinity, was ſo limited in its extent, that, by proper exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it might, in their opinion, be entirely removed. They next publiſhed a ſeries of reſolutions, to which was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined a note ſigned by Mr. Dallas, as ſecretary of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania: he ſignified the approbation of the governor. The reſolutions directed, that every perſon infected with the yellow fever, and whoſe caſe would admit of removal, ſhould be conveyed by his friends, or the health officer, to a proper ſituation diſtant from Philadelphia. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining inhabitants were directed immediately to remove; a yellow flag was to be placed to houſes containing, or which had recently contained, the ſick. No perſon, the needful attendants excepted, was to enter any ſuch houſe, till it had been properly cleanſed. Phyſicians were requeſted to give notice of ſuch contagious caſes as came under their obſervation. The board farther announced, that a number of houſes and tents had been procured for accommodating the healthy people who might remove from the city. At the ſame time, there was publiſhed a liſt of the inſpectors, being twenty-four in number, with the reſpective places of their reſidence. A note, of the 21ſt of Auguſt, from their chairman, John Miller, jun. ſtated, that ſince the 17th inſt.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032138_0011_0FF152DE810ADC68"/>ten caſes of fever had occurred ſouth of Pine-ſtreet, and moſtly in Penn-ſtreet, of which ſeveral had been ſent to the hoſpital. Two others in the city had been traced back to Penn-ſtreet.</p>
            <p>The newſpapers now began to be crouded with publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſpecting the yellow fever. Dr. Caldwell, in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 21ſt, ſaid, that the report of the committee of health, exhibited but "a very faint and imperfect image of the health of the city, relative to the prevailing malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever." On the 22d, Drs. Dobel, Cox, Pleaſants, and Church were appointed to viſit the City and Liberties, in queſt of new caſes. On that day, only three were reported to the board of health. The Wigwam Tavern, out Race-ſtreet, near Schuylkill, ſome years ſince converted into an hoſpital, was made uſe of for the reception of the ſick. It was ſaid that ſome dead bodies were removed from it, about this time, back into the city, for interment. If it was intended to ſpread the diſorder, a more apt method could not have been contrived. The idle parade of a number of people at burials, ought to have been forbidden, as alſo the cuſtom of ringing bells for the dead, which ſerved only to alarm the ſick. However irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious it may ſeem, places of worſhip ought to have been univerſally ſhut up. To aſſemble a thouſand or fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred people, of all ages, and from all parts of the city, into one place of meeting, in weather which was moderately warm, and during the prevalence of ſuch a diſtemper, was certainly imprudent, as it could not fail to promote the diſorder.</p>
            <p>Another miſtake was, the enduring of a public market in the midſt of the city. This ſpot was frequently, upon market days, ſo crouded, that one could not walk twenty yards through it without joſtling againſt perſons on every ſide. Their very breath and clothes were ſufficient to convey contagion. This fever may well be termed a younger branch of the plague. In countries where the latter prevails, if as little attention was given, as has lately been exhibited in Philadelphia, to keep people at a diſtance from each other, the human race would, perhaps, in theſe parts of the world, be extirpated. It would have been very eaſy to adjourn the market to a ſpot on the commons,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032138_0012_0FF152E8044FA728"/>where people ſhould not have been under the neceſſity of ſqueezing each other in this way. Taverns, as another ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle of infection, ſhould have been diſcouraged from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept open, unleſs ſuch as were deſigned for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of travellers from the country. The latter exception would have been neceſſary for ſecuring ſubſiſtence to the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The alarm continued gradually to increaſe: on the 23d of Auguſt, the board of health reported that fifteen new caſes had occurred ſince the day before, and that the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diligence would be neceſſary to prevent the diſorder from ſpreading. The inhabitants began to move into the country; and, in a ſhort time, they emigrated in ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious numbers, that the city was ſaid to be half empty. On every road from Philadelphia were ſeen waggons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying families and their effects to the country. Many merchants removed to Wilmington, where they began buſineſs. Germantown, Cheſter, Wilmington, Frankfort, Darby, Trenton, Bordenton, Eaſton, and Burlington were more or leſs crouded with fugitives, who fled in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Sometimes they carried the diſeaſe along with them; as in the inſtance of Mr. Robert Cary, glazier, who died at Burlington of the diſorder; which, almoſt at the ſame time, cut off his ſon Mr. James Cary, a clerk in the office of the Philadelphia Gazette. He had remained in the city, and was univerſally lamented, as a young man of uncommon merit. So greatly was Philadelphia thinned, within the ſpace of a week or two, that almoſt nobody was to be ſeen upon the ſtreets. Even of thoſe who ſtaid in town, many ſhut themſelves up in their houſes, as in ſo many caſtles, and entertained no commerce with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, unleſs when they ventured out to market; and that, above noticed, was a dangerous ſervice. Among other misfortunes, the markets grew dearer than uſual, and ſome of the bakers made their bread as light, it is ſaid, as when flour had been at fifteen dollars per barrel. We muſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, take into account, the very great riſk which they ran, by ſtaying, upon any terms, in the city.</p>
            <p>The appearance of the ſtreets was not, upon the whole, ſo exceedingly diſmal as in the fall of 1793. Sometimes one met a cart driving at conſiderable ſpeed to Potter's
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032138_0013_0FF1531014FC3528"/>field. The man who took care of it was frequently ſinging. The dead bodies were not, on every occaſion, very decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put into coffins; but this is a topic too delicate to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon. One cart broke down, above the corner of Cheſnut and Seventh-ſtreets; and the body, which was not removed for ſeveral hours, annoyed the neighbourhood with a moſt intolerable ſmell.</p>
            <p>An alarm had now ſpread over the continent. On the 18th of Auguſt, the governor of New-York publiſhed a proclamation, directing that all veſſels from Philadelphia ſhould, till further orders, perform quarantine. On the 23d, the governor of this ſtate iſſued a proclamation.— He therein ordered that all communication ſhould be cut off with the wharves, houſes, and inhabitants ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Spruce and Front-ſtreets, to extend from the river to the weſt ſide of Front ſtreet. Neceſſary attendants only were to be admitted within this ſpot. Poles or fences were to be placed acroſs the ſtreets and avenues leading to it. The ſhipping were to be removed from the wharves, and yellow flags to be placed at the corner of each of the ſtreets leading to the reſt of the city. An injunction was added for the removal of the ſick, if the caſe would admit of it, and the inhabitants were alſo to remove upon orders from inſpectors of the health office. Yellow flags were to be ſuſpended from the tops of the houſes, wherein the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had appeared. The phyſicians were requeſted to give notice to the health office, of all caſes within their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. A fine of three hundred dollars was to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on any perſon obſtructing the execution of this order, or neglecting to pay obedience to it.</p>
            <p>The latter part of this proclamation met with an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate refuſal; for, on the very next day, the 24th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, the inſpectors informed the public, that they could no longer tell whether any new caſes had occurred, becauſe the phyſicians had not given them any communications. A miſunderſtanding had taken place: The doctors declined to name the number of their patients, becauſe the latter were liable, when diſcovered, to be hurried off to the Wigwam in carts. This treatment gave general offence. Had a coach been employed for that end, as it was in the ſequel, and ſomething more of gentleneſs been diſplayed,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032138_0014_0FF152BEB935C080"/>the ſcheme would have ſucceeded much better. It is here ſtated, on reſpectable authority, that an Engliſh gentleman was hurried away to the hoſpital, although he offered five hundred dollars for leave to continue where he was, and although the people where he lodged were willing to have kept him. It is added, that he died ſoon after his removal.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance is generally reported and believed, of a woman being hurried off, as in a yellow fever, and who next morning was delivered of a child. Very ſtrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections were made to the peremptory orders of removal, as both inhuman and impracticable. Dr. Caldwell, in a letter to the printer of the Philadelphia Gazette, of the 28th of Auguſt, inveighed ſeverely againſt it. He related that he had on Saturday, the 26th, been called to a patient. This man was ſeized with illneſs on the Wedneſday preceding, and had forborne, as he ſaid, to call in aſſiſtance, for fear of being conveyed to the hoſpital. He mentioned another caſe of a man, who, when dying, ſent for him to enquire if any thing could be given to alleviate his pain. He did not expect to be cured, but had merely ſent for aid in the hope of obtaining a mitigation to the agony of his laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Dr. Caldwell added, that many other caſes of this ſort had occurred. He farther ſaid that he had lately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the crowd of the court houſe in Cheſnut-ſtreet, three perſons who, a few hours before, had been viſiting patients ill of the fever. He had them called out, and perſuaded them to go away. On the 28th, the inſpectors advertiſed that a coachee was kept in readineſs at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable's office, at the corner of Front and Almond ſtreet, for the removal of thoſe who <hi>deſired</hi> to be ſent to the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, as alſo that a hearſe was kept at the ſame place. But it was more eaſy to raiſe an alarm than to ſuppreſs it.</p>
            <p>The incloſure recommended by the governor, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the yellow flags, were pulled down, in ſpite of the threatened penalty of three hundred dollars. Indeed, the beſt ſafe-guard was the removal of the inhabitants into the country, which, of courſe, crippled the progreſs of the contagion. Much of its violence may be aſcribed to the wretched practice common in Philadelphia, as well as in all other large towns, of jamming and heaping houſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as if the ſurface of the country did not afford room
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032138_0015_0FF152C1650543B0"/>for holding them. Nothing can be more completely ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, than that, in a continent twelve hundred leagues wide, and where land is ſo extremely plenty, that conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould be promoted by the narrowneſs of the ſtreets. In 1793, only thirty-nine perſons died in the whole extent of Market-ſtreet, from the Delaware to the Schuylkill; whereas, in Pewter-Platter-Alley, containing perhaps forty houſes, thirty-two perſons died; in Elfrith's-Alley, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-three, in Combes's-Alley, twenty-nine; and in Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian-Alley, thirty-ſeven. Theſe make, in whole, an hundred and twenty-one deaths, in only four alleys. If each of them had been as wide as Market-ſtreet, the chance is, that at leaſt half of theſe lives would have been ſaved. If Water-ſtreet, and ſeveral others, were near an hundred feet broad, the ravages of this dreadful diſorder would ſurely have been leſs fatal; as ventilation is an evident preventative. This appears from the diſtemper having made ſuch very ſmall progreſs in the country. It would have ſaved many lives annually, if every ſtreet in the City and Liberties had been thirty or forty yards broad, even if there never had been a yellow fever. In the hot ſummer months, Philadelphia is far from being a healthful ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to children it is extremely fatal. Two or three hundred additional acres of ground, which at the planning of the city was not worth twenty dollars per acre, would have ſaved, by this time, thouſands of lives. It is well known that previous to the great fire in London, in 1666, the plague had ſeldom, if ever, been entirely out of that city. But after it was burnt, the ſtreets being rebuilt on a wider plan, that diſtemper has never ſince been known to infeſt it.</p>
            <p>The aſſembly of the ſtate met on the 29th of Auguſt, and, on the ſame day voted ten thouſand dollars to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated for the accommodation, employment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the ſick and indigent, during the prevalence of the fever. The money was acceptable and uſeful; yet, if the ſum given had been even conſiderably larger, there was no want of objects of charity to receive it. The ſtate is worth ſome millions of dollars, and an additional donation could ſcarcely have injured its intereſt.</p>
            <p>A committee from the health-office were appointed to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032138_0016_0FF152B3615BCF68"/>viſit the hoſpitals, at State-Iſland, and the Wigwam, which they did on the 26th of Auguſt. They reported, that at the former place they found only thirteen patients; all of whom appeared to be on the recovery. At the Wigwam, forty-eight had been received, of whom ſixteen were dead, and moſt of the remainder either cured, or in a ſtate of convaleſcence.</p>
            <p>It has already been hinted, that a miſunderſtanding had ariſen between ſome of the phyſicians and the inſpectors of the health-office, in conſequence of which, the former had declined giving in any further reports of their patients.<note n="*" place="bottom">On the 29th of Auguſt, a letter appeared in the newſpapers from Dr. Currie. He therein ſtated, the reaſon for the phyſicians not giving in liſts of their patients to the board of health, as ariſing from want of time to do ſo. He ſaid, that it was the duty of the board to ſend for ſuch a liſt. He ſubjoined a catalogue of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had been infected, from the 22d of July to the 25th of Auguſt. On the 1ſt of September, the number of houſes ſhut up, was ſuppoſed to be thirteen hundred and ſixty-five, beſides thoſe in the incloſures of Penn-ſtreet, &amp;c. to which acceſs had been forbid by the governor's proclamation.</note> On the 1ſt of September, 1797, the board publiſhed a narrative of their proceedings, in conſequence of the governor's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation. They denied that force had been employed, or even contemplated, for the removal of the ſick to the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital; and that no ſuch removals had taken place, unleſs when the attending phyſician declared the meaſure to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. As to the former aſſertion, the general belief is otherwiſe; though force might be uſed, and undoubtedly was uſed, by ſome agents of the board, perhaps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their knowledge. If the phyſicians had in every caſe been conſulted, they could have had no reaſon to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, as they certainly were, when they declined the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of caſes. The board further ſaid, that all perſons near the ſick, neceſſary attendants excepted, had been ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly adviſed to remove. They mentioned, that the City-Hoſpital had been kept in a ſtate of complete preparation for the receiving of patients; and that five phyſicians, Drs. Cox, Dobel, Pleaſants, Church, and Leib, had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in different parts of the city, to ſeek out and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter relief to ſuch perſons as required aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:032138_0017_0FF152A1C909B880"/>After giving this view of the ſubject, the inſpectors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a hope, that all ſick or indiſpoſed perſons, as well as thoſe employed in the care of them, would ſee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of an early application either to their family-phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, to Dr. Duffield, conſulting phyſician of the port of Philadelphia, or to ſome of the medical gentlemen above named. There was a poſtſcript at the bottom of this notice, which muſt have been the conſequence of ſome heſitation among the members of the board themſelves. It was ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by four members, who ſaid, that during the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this addreſs, they had requeſted and obtained leave to withdraw. The burials at this time began to be more numerous. An account appeared in the Philadelphia Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, ſtating, that, during the forty-eight hours preceding Monday, the 4th of September, at noon, there had been thirty-ſix interments. This was a greater number of dead than had yet occurred within an equal period.</p>
            <p>The commiſſioners appointed by the governor to carry into effect the law for alleviating the diſtreſſes of the poor, by the expenditure of ten thouſand dollars, attended punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to their appointment. Their names are as follow, viz.

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:032138_0018_0FF152DADA13A8C0"/>They invited the inhabitants to recommend in writing ſuch indigent perſons as might come within their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Theſe were to be aſſiſted by applying at the ſtate-houſe from three to nine o'clock in the evening, of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday, the 6th inſt. and thereafter, on "every 2d, 4th, and 6th days of the week, called Monday, Wedneſday, and Friday, while neceſſary." The commiſſioners, as above, were twelve in number, and their names and reſpective places of reſidence were printed, that people, during the receſs of their meetings, in want of employment or relief, might know where to apply. Numbers of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were immediately ſet to work upon the ſtreets and high-roads near the city. The funds were not adequate to give them full wages; and ſome of the overſeers told them that a whole day's work was not, of courſe, to be expected from them. The reader may ſuppoſe that no ſuch hints were neceſſary, for idleneſs is natural to man. But relief was eſſential, and it was proper to find them employment, if only to divert them. Should their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances not have been equal to the expenſe which they coſt, ſtill it was fit that they ſhould have ſomething to do. Even ſuppoſing that only ten of them were diſhoneſt, the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to robbery might have proved more detrimental to the citizens, than the whole amount of the expenditure; for ſome of them, after getting their wages, actually rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed one another. On South-ſtreet and Broad-ſtreet, the indulgence was taken in its utmoſt latitude; but when it is conſidered that ſome were emaciated, others delicate—and that many ſoon got bliſters on their hands, no great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions could be expected.</p>
            <p>The contagion continued to extend. For the twenty-four hours preceding Saturday the 9th, at noon, the Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia Gazette reported thirty-two deaths; being about double the amount of any former ſingle day. From that time, till Monday at noon, the deaths were by the ſame newſpaper, fifty-ſeven. On September 7th, the inhabitants of the Northern Liberties appointed a committee to aſſiſt the board of health. On the 12th, the commiſſioners for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor, ſent a letter to the governor, giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their proceedings. They ſtated that, from the 4th to the 9th inſtant, two hundred and eighty-four per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, chiefly heads of families, had been relieved, at an ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>penſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032138_0019_0FF152F7F90DF8E8"/>of two hundred and ſixty-nine dollars and ſixty-five cents, beſides a quantity of bread, the coſt of which an account had not been received. Two hundred and fifty men, at ſeventy-five cents per day, had been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the roads, and to open the courſes of water in South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, ſo as to drain the grounds. Proviſion was further made for about two hundred people, who had removed to the tents on the Schuylkill.</p>
            <p>On the 22d of September, a note appeared in the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, ſigned by James Oldden, No. 1, South Sixth-ſtreet; John Gardiner, jun. No. 28, Strawberry-alley; Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin Wharton, No. 268, South Second-ſtreet; John Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, No. 74, Swanſon-ſtreet, Southwark; and Thomas An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon, No. 63, Shippen-ſtreet, do. They ſtated, that the guardians of the poor having generally left the city, they had voluntarily undertaken to ſuperintend the poor, near Schuylkill; and had appointed David Thomas to be ſteward, who conſtantly reſided there. They notified, that thoſe who deſired to remove from the neighbourhood of the ſick, to the tents, were to apply to them for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, before they could be admitted. They requeſted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of ſtraw, of old blankets, of children's clothes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In a ſecond letter from the commiſſioners, appointed to inſpect the diſtribution of money, to the governor, dated September the 18th, they related, their having, during that week, relieved ſix hundred and fifty-eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, chiefly heads of families, with five hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five dollars and fifty cents, beſides a conſiderable quantity of bread; that about 520 perſons, who were thrown out of employment, and deſtitute of ſubſiſtence, had been paid at the rate of ſeventy-five cents per day, for labouring on the high-roads, &amp;c. They had been obliged, from the ſtate of their funds, to lower the wages to fifty cents.</p>
            <p>In a third letter to the governor, dated September 25th, the commiſſioners mentioned, that, ſince their laſt, they had relieved eight hundred and fifty-five perſons. They had paid ſix hundred and thirty-nine men for labour on the roads; and including proviſions for the people in the tents, and forty-ſix dollars and fifty-four cents for incidents, their whole expenditure came to five thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032138_0020_0FF152A844CA93E8"/>and eighty-one dollars and forty-nine cents. Some accounts were likewiſe unſettled. Hence the total outlay came to upwards of two thouſand dollars per week; and, conſequently, the whole money granted by the legiſlature, being ten thouſand dollars, would laſt only for five weeks, or to the end of the one then current.</p>
            <p>To remedy this deficiency, the mayor of Philadelphia was authoriſed, by an ordinance, to borrow on the credit of the Corporation, from either of the banks in the city, ten thouſand dollars; one thouſand were to be applied to the repairing of the high roads, and the remainder for the hiring of patroles, and ſuch other meaſures as might be neceſſary for the protection of the city.</p>
            <p>On October 4th, the commiſſioners for taking care of the poor, addreſſed a fourth letter to the governor. They ſtated, that the weekly expenſe of ſupporting them, came to upwards of two thouſand five hundred dollars. They had ſince their laſt publication, relieved a number of men, by employment on the roads, at fifty cents per day, to the amount of fifteen hundred dollars; other diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had come to the amount of twelve hundred dollars more. They earneſtly recommended private ſubſcriptions for the relief of the poor, and ſubjoined a catalogue of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations already made. This is reſerved for a ſeparate arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, including the whole of ſuch donations, as far as it ſhall be found poſſible to collect them.</p>
            <p>The Merchant's Advertiſer of October 10th, contained another addreſs from the commiſſioners. They began by ſtating, that, on September 1ſt, they had accepted of their appointment. They then received the ten thouſand dollars beſtowed by the legiſlature, and which had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been ſuppoſed more than ſufficient for the purpoſe. They found, upon examination, upwards of three thouſand people, of all ages, deſtitute of work or ſubſiſtence. The number had ſince greatly increaſed, and the whole yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the ſame ſuffering condition. They next, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic terms, addreſſed the richer claſs of their fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens for aid; and conſiderable ſupplies were gradually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
            <p>By the 15th of October, ſixteen phyſicians had been affected with the diſorder. Of theſe, <hi>eight,</hi> whoſe names are

            <p>If a generous contempt of danger and of death me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the gratitude of mankind, that tribute is, on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent emergency, unqueſtionably due to the phyſicians of Philadelphia. The moſt laborious, hazardous and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able taſk was, in almoſt every inſtance, to be performed gratuitouſly. Dr. Dobel, with a view to this contagion, had previouſly made his will. He was of independent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; had been married but a few months before, and could have no temptation for the office which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, but what aroſe from pure benevolence.</p>
            <p>Apprehenſions had been, for ſome time, entertained by the ſteward of the city hoſpital, that illicit practices were carried on at that place; after ſome vigilance, one of the attendants was, on the 12th of October, taken with a bag full of ſundries belonging to the public. On a promiſe of forgiveneſs, he confeſſed that property, to a conſiderable amount, had been ſecreted in the houſe of a certain John Brown, another of the attendants. A ſearch-warrant was iſſued; and the fact being proved, Brown was directly committed to priſon.</p>
            <p>Before the middle of October, the mortality in the city began to abate. On the 13th of that month, the inſpectors of the health-office addreſſed a note, ſigned by William Montgomery, as chairman, to ſuch of their fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens whoſe families were then out of town. They were adviſed not to return for a few days longer, becauſe, altho' there was an appearance of the fever having begun to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſtill they did not think it adviſable to return at ſo early a period. They particularly cautioned citizens reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the country from yet entering Southwark, and the lower parts of the city. They further adviſed, that proper
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032138_0022_0FF152B7B4C1E7B8"/>perſons ſhould, in the mean time, be employed to ventilate and clean their houſes.</p>
            <p>Nothing, however, could exceed the impatience of ſome citizens to return. There had been complaints of extortion in thoſe ſmall towns and places in the country to which many had retired. This is worthy of obſervation, that we may be cautioned, in caſe Providence ſhould permit Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia to be again viſited by a ſimilar misfortune. That quadrupeds, birds, and aquatic animals, ſhould prey upon each other, ſeems, in many claſſes, to have been the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious deſtination of nature; but that human beings ſhould practice the ſame rapacity againſt their fellow-creatures, is a very poor illuſtration of the pretended ſanctity ſo pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſly diſplayed by ſome of them. Many of the country people have gained largely by the city; yet when its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants came into their power, they diſcovered what ſmall reliance ſhould be placed on their gratitude. Both lodging and proviſions were often unconſcionably enhanced in price. This extortion was ſometimes attended with much affected concern for the ſufferers, and many pleas of merit for giving them admittance on any terms whatever. To this account, exceptions were to be found, and this contraſt added ſtill more to the ſhame of the inhoſpitable.</p>
            <p>As a relief to the ſameneſs of this detail, we ſhall here inſert a few anecdotes which have come within our infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>Soon after the commencement of the fever, and while the inhabitants kept a guarded diſtance from each other, the bar-keeper of Mr. Wucherer's tavern, in Cheſnut-ſtreet, happened to be abroad, fell into company, came home inebriated, and went to bed. Suſpicion immediately took the alarm; and a doctor was ſent for, who pronounced his caſe to be the yellow fever. The neighbours were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der apprehenſions for their ſafety, and began to pack up their furniture for a retreat to the country. But next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfolded their miſtake, by the patient's reſuming the duties of his ſtation. Several loungers about Market-ſtreet wharf, were, like the bar-keeper, conſidered as having caught the contagion, and, conſequently, conveyed to the hoſpital. Some of them, perhaps, got infected in that place by the diſeaſe, as one or two paid their laſt debt to nature. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032138_0023_0FF152CDCA8BC0B8"/>this time, a volunteer patrol guarded the city. One night, ſome of them took up three foreign ſailors; and in accompanying them to their veſſel, one of them, either to eſcape from the patrol or by accident, fell into the river, and was drowned. His body was found and buried next day. The committee of health requited each of the patrol with twenty-two dollars per month; and the latter have ſince been raiſing a contribution from indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals by ſubſcription, as a further reward for their own vigilance.</p>
            <p>Tricks were played by ſome of the priſoners in the city gaol. They feigned to have the diſorder, were conducted to the hoſpital, and after partaking of a warm ſupper, and a good night's lodging, diſappeared on the wings of the morning. Several who had been really attacked by the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and others who had been ſent to the hoſpital againſt their will, by virtue of the governor's proclamation, in conſequence of the medical verdict of a ſuſpicious caſe, fled, as ſoon as they were able.</p>
            <p>A Mr. Horn, a young German, had been about five days from Philadelphia, when he was taken ill in Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land county, and died of the yellow fever. A remarkable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is here ſtated reſpecting his illneſs, on the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his landlord, a Mr. Rittenhouſe. Such was the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and flattering ſtate of the diſorder, that within two hours of his exit, he had no apprehenſion of the approach of his diſſolution: he appeared ſenſible, though his continual theme was love; and he was planning his happineſs in a connu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial life; but Death, in ſo ſhort a ſpace, triumphed over the faſcinating deſires of Cupid.</p>
            <p>A Mr. Barry viſited the city, during the calamity. He had been adviſed to keep his body open, as a preparative, in caſe that he ſhould be attacked. Accordingly, he went to an apothecary, and bought a box of thirty-two purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive pills.—From ignorance, he ſwallowed the whole immediately, and was ſuddenly taken unwell in the ſtreet, oppoſite to the bank of North-America. A ſick-cart happened to paſs by empty, and the drivers believing him attacked with the diſorder, forced him into it, and were proceeding to the hoſpital. At the corner of Twelfth and Cheſnut-ſtreets, one of the drivers quitted the cart. Anger or fright perhaps
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032138_0024_0FF152BBC8C00938"/>had ſtopped the operation of the pills; for he ſummoned ſtrength, got looſe, and beat the driver that remained. He led the man, his horſe and cart to the City-hall, where he left them with many complaints of bad treatment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Robert Longdon, a carpenter, at the beginning of the ſickneſs, had gone to Darby to work for Mr. Jeſſe Sharples. Having come to town upon a Sunday, he was, on the following Thurſday, ſeized with a chill, at Darby, and on Friday, the black vomit appeared. The family where he was lodged, left the houſe, and he muſt have died, if he had not with the fever, for want of neceſſaries, but for the humanity of David Roſs, a young man who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the ſtore of Mr. Sharples. Two phyſicians vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited him on the enſuing Monday, and pronounced it to be a caſe of the yellow fever: ſalivation was recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but the patient became delirious, and died on the ſame afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sharples beſpoke a coffin, and got his grave dug in the Friends' burying-ground, near Darby. The people of that town became alarmed: the grave-digger and cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin-maker fled through fear; and there was ſome danger that the corpſe might be ſuffered to putrify in the ſtreet. James Ryan and David Roſs, clerks to Mr. Sharples, along with that gentleman and a ſtranger, went through Darby to the burying-ground, with the hearſe, every door in the place being ſhut. This was about nine o'clock at night. The horſe ſtumbled, and fell, at the diſtance of a quarter of a mile from the place of interment. Both the ſhafts of the hearſe were broken; and it was with great difficulty that theſe four perſons contrived to drag the hearſe forward. On their return, every door was ſhut againſt them, except that of Mr. Sharples. His two clerks, who had aſſiſted at the funeral, found it neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the city. Such were the difficulties which occurred not only to the ſick, but to the healthy.</p>
            <p>The landlord of the Golden Swan, North Third-ſtreet, hired a horſe and carriage to the board of health, for the purpoſe of conveying the dead to the burying-ground. One day, the driver ſtopt at a tavern: the horſe, not being properly faſtened, ran off with an empty coffin that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be in the carriage; and returned, with full ſpeed,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032138_0025_0FF152AE831EA520"/>homeward. In paſſing through the yard of the inn, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſtable, he was eſpied by the cook and bar-keeper. They inſtantly raiſed an alarm that the horſe brought home a dead body, inſtead of conveying it to the place of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment. Fame or calumny ſoon after reported that two or three perſons were dead at the Golden Swan.</p>
            <p>Two perſons employed by the committee of health, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a man into the War-Office, whom a phyſician had condemned to the hoſpital. The patient had been an old ſoldier. He held in his hand a ruſty bayonet, and kept them off. He had only been too free with his bottle, and would not be made a priſoner.</p>
            <p>Some have imagined themſelves to be attacked by the contagion, when they had only been intoxicated. One young man, an apprentice in Philadelphia, drank too much port wine. It returned from his ſtomach: he miſtook it for the black vomit; and when he got ſober, he became delirious, through fear he ſhould be ſent to the hoſpital.</p>
            <p>One of the moſt affecting circumſtances of death, was, in the caſe of Dr. Jacob Thompſon. He had been married in the evening—had gone to bed, and within two hours, felt the ſymptoms of the diſorder approaching. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were alarmed. The bridegroom was removed, and died on the third day, leaving his unfortunate wife, "at once a widow and a bride."</p>
            <p>Dr. Pleaſants had removed to the country: philanthropy actuated his return, whereby he alſo periſhed. Dr. Annan, another phyſician, who loſt his life, had, like Dr. Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, been but newly married. David Thomas, of South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, fell an early and much lamented victim to this ſcourge. In the different and ſucceſſive capacities of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, deputy-ſheriff, and as ſteward to the poor at the tents, on Schuylkill, he had ſerved with integrity, vigilance and humanity. Mr. Peter Helm, ſo diſtinguiſhed in 1793, and who, upon this occaſion, again offered his ſervices at the City-Hoſpital, was likewiſe attacked, but has ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>During this contagion, Wilmington became the general mart for trade over Philadelphia: merchants notified, in a joint advertiſement, their removal to that place. Many country cuſtomers, however, went elſe here for their
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032138_0026_0FF152A595259300"/>fall aſſortments; in conſequence of which, we fear ſome will feel themſelves embarraſſed to preſerve that promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which has hitherto generally characteriſed the mercantile houſes of our metropolis.</p>
            <p>Some of thoſe who were moſt courageous in 1793, were timid, and fled among the moſt early, in 1797. They had witneſſed ſuch diſtreſs then, that their reſolution now faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. At the commencement of the attack, more or leſs of panic ſeized every one; but thoſe who procraſtinated a flight, and ſaw "Death's ſhafts fly thick," were like ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in a battle, who, as we are told, cannot, at its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, diſpoſſeſs themſelves of terror; but, after balls have, for ſome time, flown over their heads, feel leſs apprehenſion for perſonal ſafety, and compoſure and firmneſs generally ſucceed.</p>
            <p>No ſuch inſtances of general fatality occurred now, as in 1793. Then, according to Mr. Mathew Carey, a man of the name of Collins, buried his wife, his two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, his ſon, and his ſon's wife, with her child; after all this, he got married a ſecond time, before the cloſe of the fever, buried his new wife, and, to wind up the ſcene, died himſelf. Such fatal occurrences being rife in the mind, people were happily impreſſed with the danger of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the city.</p>
            <p>Drs. Hunter and Stafford diſtinguiſhed themſelves by benevolence. The poor were invited to call at their ſtores for medicines, which, with the general preſcriptions for the relief of thoſe infected, they actually ſupplied, free of expenſe. Such inſtances of philanthropy ſhould be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only here, but in the grateful minds of our citizens.</p>
            <p>Among other perſons meriting public notice, for their liberality during the diſorder, two bakers, Chriſtopher Ludwick and Frederick Frailey, ought not to be forgotten. They baked, gratis, for the poor, ſeveral thouſand loaves of bread, of flour furniſhed by the commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>On the Saturday previous to the meeting of the aſſembly of the ſtate, the Mayor expreſſed his apprehenſion of the progreſs of the contagion, to an aſſociation of Friends, who ſtyled themſelves, "a ſociety for improving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the poor." John James, Thomas Wiſtar, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Garrigues, Thomas Savery, George Pennock, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032138_0027_0FF1530B53EAE080"/>Garigues, jun. and Peter Barker, were appointed to apply to the aſſembly, as the funds of the ſociety itſelf were not adequate to the neceſſities of the caſe. Henry Drinker, ſen. and Thomas Wiſtar, who were not members of that ſociety, joined themſelves to the committee. They waited on the Tueſday following upon the legiſlature, and the ten thouſand dollars were granted on the ſame day. The promptneſs of this grant merits conſiderable enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium. The Mayor had, from his office, peculiar oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of learning the public diſtreſs. People's neceſſities impelled them to ſue for debts, while thoſe who were ſued, pled in defence, the general langour of buſineſs, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the deſertion of the citizens. Jonathan Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, late magiſtrate of Southwark, and now ſheriff, in a ſtruggle between ſympathy and the duties of his office, actually refuſed to grant a warrant againſt a perſon in diſtreſs, and abſented himſelf, to avoid the pain of being importuned to bring ſuits for creditors. Towards the more advanced periods, however, of the calamity, the courts of juſtice were ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>A grateful mind will recur with ſingular pleaſure to the recollection of thoſe gentlemen, who, after having encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, in 1793, every degree of toil and hazard, returned in 1797, to the ſame arduous and alarming duty. Among theſe were, Iſrael Iſrael, John Letchworth, Thomas Savery, Stephen Girard, Caleb Lownes, and John Connelly. Mr. Iſrael had, in 1793, firſt ſuggeſted, and afterwards aſſiſted in promoting the plan of an orphan committee, of which he and Mr. Letchworth were active members. The latter alſo ſerved in the committee of diſtribution. On the late emergency, they again officiated with eminent uſefulneſs; as did likewiſe Mr. Savery; who, in 1793, had been alſo a member of the committee of diſtribution. Meſſrs. Girard, Lownes, and Connelly now ſuperintended the City-Hoſpital. In 1793, Mr. Girard had volunteered as one of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers of Buſh-hill hoſpital. Mr. Lownes, at the ſame awful period, was ſecretary to the committee for relieving the ſick and diſtreſſed, while Mr. Connelly acted in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious capacities. In 1793, he twice caught the contagion, and, as ſoon as he recovered, returned to his charge.</p>
            <p>The prudence of the commiſſioners, in providing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032138_0028_0FF152DCCD2451A0"/>as well as ſubſiſtence for the poor, ſhould ever be reſpectfully remembered. The neceſſitous who were relieved, doubtleſs feel gratitude ingrafted in their hearts, to thoſe gentlemen who ſtood to their reſpective poſts, at the imminent hazard of their lives, to be their guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and benefactors. What muſt have been the feelings of the Board of Health—the Commiſſioners—the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and Inſpectors of the Hoſpital and Tents—the Overſeers of the Poor<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſeph Galley, Michael Baker, John Smith, and David Graham, were the only perſons, out of fourteen of the Overſeers for the City and Liberties, who adhered to their poſts. Their funds, by the number of applicants, at an early period, got exhauſted; and, to the honor of the Bank of Pennſylvania, they lent them four thouſand dollars, on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate credit of Mr. John Inſkeep, Treaſurer of the Guardians of the Poor, and Iſaac W.

            <p>One of the moſt lamented victims of the diſorder, was Dr. Nicholas Way, who, during 1793, reſided at Wilmington, and was remarkable for his hoſpitality to the fugitive citizens of Philadelphia. He had ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032138_0029_0FF153222B0D3D80"/>to our metropolis, where his talents as a phyſician, and philanthropy as a man, which his fortune enabled him to ſupport, introduced him to extenſive practice. Few men either lived or died with a greater number of friends, or a ſmaller number of enemies. It was by his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, that, during the late calamity, five phyſicians were appointed to ſearch for and attend ſuch of the poorer citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens as might be affected with the diſorder. He was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the mint.—While the public lament his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they will be pleaſed to hear, that that office is now filled by a gentleman, to whom they owe an equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect;—one, who, like him, could feel for the diſtreſſed, and always exerted himſelf to benefit his fellow-creatures.</p>

            <p>Mr. David Evans, jun. was twice attacked. In the firſt illneſs, he loſt an hundred and twenty-ſix ounces of blood, and in the ſecond, twenty-four. This account is given by himſelf.</p>
            <p>About the middle of October, the Board of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, having conſidered that the diſtreſſes of the poor would be likely to continue through the enſuing winter, opened a ſubſcription, to raiſe money for the purchaſe of wood and proviſions, to be diſtributed in the rigour of the ſeaſon; and appointed agents to buy up five hundred cords of wood, which has been purchaſed, and is daily diſtributed to them.</p>
            <p>As an inſtance of the malignity of this diſeaſe, we ſhall mention, that a man from Baltimore, in a convaleſcent ſtate, called, during this time, at a ſtore in Newcaſtle, kept by Clay, Bond and Co. Mr. Clay and Mr. Shelly, of the firm, and Mr. Ruth, an accidental purchaſer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the contagion, and expired within twenty-four hours of each other.</p>
            <p>At Philadelphia, a dead body, ſaid to be thrown from the Arethuſa, was found in the Delaware, ſewed up in a bag. Another body of a man was picked up, that had a note about him, ſignifying that he had ſpent his whole money upon the doctors, without recovering from his
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032138_0031_0FF1531465870E40"/>complicated infirmities, and that he thought Death was the moſt certain relief. No evidence appears, however, that he was the writer of the note. Poſſibly he might have been murdered, and that the perpetrator wrote it to elude ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>The College of Phyſicians recommended, in preference, as nurſes to the ſick, Negroes who were natives of Africa. This produced an inconvenience; for, the blacks of this country became alarmed, and generally refuſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; while the ſcarcity of Africans, made people bid high for them, and raiſed, to exorbitance, the price of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.</p>
            <p>The practice of burning the clothes of the infected, muſt, on ſerious reflection, be viewed as highly improper. For, the peſtilential air, ariſing with the ſmoke, it is more than probable, aided by wind, might have a tendency of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the fever to any one who inhaled ſuch noxious effluvia. One gentleman, who was at a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the Hoſpital, obſerving the practice, imagined that from them proceeded a diſagreeable ſmell: be this as it may, he was ſoon after ſeized with the contagion, and now imputes it to that cauſe.</p>
            <p>A gentleman in this city, who was attacked with the diſeaſe, immediately ſent for his phyſician. By the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the uſual remedies, he was, in a ſhort time, out of danger. But, though relieved from the fever, he ſtill remained under a deep affection of the ſalivary glands. In conſequence of this, a baſon was provided, which received the ſaliva that fell from his mouth. One day, two young cats entered the room, unperceived by him, at firſt, and licked up part of the contents of the baſon. They were ſeized, within an hour afterwards, with violent chills, and continued to waſte away to mere ſkeletons, loathing all kinds of food. On the fourth day, one of them died. The perſon having experienced the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of mercury, in relation to himſelf, ſuppoſed it might be of ſome ſervice to the ſurviving cat, and accordingly gave her twelve grains. In a ſhort time, to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it operated, and the cat, before to appearance near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, ſeemed to recover, and was, during the day, much revived. The medicine was not continued, and the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032138_0032_0FF15296781EDA10"/>next day ſhe drooped as before. The day after (the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth) it died. The mother of the cats never left them while in this ſituation!—She appeared ſlightly diſeaſed, but did not die.</p>
            <p>On the 13th of Auguſt, a man of the name of Peter Moliſis, late a ſeaman of the ſhip Hinde, was ſent to the Marine Hoſpital, from Love-lane; and died in two or three days. This was eleven days after the veſſel was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. Alſo, on the 14th, another man, a Portugueſe, was taken from the corner of Penn and South ſtreets, to the Hoſpital, who had the fever, and ſaid he had been landed about five days from the ſame ſhip; another man, belonging to the Hinde, was alſo landed ſick, and lodged at the corner of Almond and Front ſtreets, at Mrs. O'Connor's.—He was, by the alarm of the neighbours, and his landlady, carried off from thence.</p>
            <p>On the 24th of Auguſt, a meeting of a few citizens was held; who appointed a committee, conſiſting of the following gentlemen:—Dr. William White, Dr. Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Way<note n="*" place="bottom">Stephen Girard was appointed in the place of Dr. Way, after he died.</note>, Nathaniel Falconer, John Connelly, Samuel Coates, and Caleb Lownes. The object of this aſſociation was, to viſit the houſes of the ſick, and, generally, the ſick and diſtreſſed, for the purpoſe of adminiſtering ſuch relief, as their ſuffering ſituations required. Samuel Coates was appointed treaſurer; and, beſides anſwering the orders drawn by the gentlemen of the committee, he viſited with them the houſes of the ſick, during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of the fever. This early aſſociation had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the extenſive duties which the different receſſes of diſtreſs unfolded to their view. The unwearied and diſintereſted labours of theſe gentlemen, their poſterity may hear with gratification:—It may bring in view the unexampled character of the philanthropic Howard. With their pecuniary aid, they raiſed a fund, without any ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to the amount of about three thouſand ſix hundred dollars. With this ſum, the ſick were aſſiſted without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction to the City or Liberties.</p>
            <p>An aſſociation of young ladies, of the ſect called Friends, under the name of "<hi>The Female Society,</hi>" a conſiderable
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032138_0033_0FF152FD559D8DD8"/>time ſince formed in our city, for the purpoſe of relieving the <hi>poor without diſcrimination,</hi> at this awful period, amidſt the frowns of Providence, continued that goodneſs, which, in more tranquil hours, inſpired their tender ſouls. The laſt mentioned committee gave them, to aid their views, two hundred dollars; thirty pair of childrens' ſhoes, and ſixty blankets. They procured numerous donations from other ſources Diſtreſs plead not here in vain:—The chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table—the virtuous—the religious, yet left in a corrupted city, may, we hope, avert the correction of Heaven.**** May the recording angel drop a tear, and blot out many of the faults inherent in our natures, that we may, by repentance, be ſpared like Nineveh!</p>
            <p>Mr. James Smith, merchant (brother to one of the firm of Gurney and Smith) reſided, at the beginning of the ſickneſs, in the moſt infectious part of the city. He aſſiſted ſtrangers that were ſick, and particularly the poor, who were forſaken by their <hi>friends</hi>; helped many patients to the Hoſpital, and many bodies to their graves. He defied all danger that could eaſe the patient, or could render re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the dead. He offered his gratuitous ſervice to the Board of Health, to ſuperintend the cleanſing of infectious houſes. As ſoon as he got his commiſſion, the Board fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with tubs, buckets, bruſhes, lime, &amp;c. and he recruited a black company, conſiſting of twenty or thirty, and entered on his office. Every houſe, in which he could get acceſs, where people had died, he purified. While he left ſome of theſe people in one houſe, to ſee how others came on elſewhere, they broke open and robbed the ſtore belonging to it, of a quantity of goods, the property of the late houſe of Richard <hi>&amp;</hi> James Smith, the former of whom had died. Here Mr. Smith had new trouble on his hands, in purſuing, with conſtables, this ſable, light-fingered groupe, and in arraigning them before Hilary Baker, our Mayor; whoſe name we cannot paſs over, without ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to diſtant readers, that he did not flinch from his ſtation; but daily evinced himſelf to be that mild arbiter, which, in more tranquil hours, was a conſpicuous trait in his character. Mr. Smith requeſted that no addreſs or application on the ſubject of his office ſhould be ſent to his houſe, that his family might not feel uneaſy apprehenſions for his perſonal ſafety.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:032138_0034_0FF152E9DE81AD58"/>Mr. Thomas Anneſly undertook to cleanſe ſeveral houſes in Southwark, where people died, free of expenſe, except what actually accrued to him.</p>
            <p>Mr. Samuel M. Fox, Preſident of the Bank of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, wrote a letter to the Board of Health, on the 22d of Auguſt, offering to lend them any ſum of money that <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 word">

            <p>At the cloſe of the fever, the Board of Health appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted "a committee to purchaſe and transfer to Dr. Edward Stevens, to Dr. John Church, to the heirs of Dr. Benger Dobel, to the heirs of Dr. Samuel Pleaſants, to Dr. John Redman Coxe, to Dr. Michael Lieb, and to the heirs of Dr. William Annan, each one ſhare of the ſtock of the Bank of Pennſylvania, and that the transfers ſo made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, that they are in conſideration of the high ſenſe the Board of Health entertain of the ſervice of thoſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, during the calamity of 1797."</p>
            <p>Dr. Stephens wrote a letter to the Board, politely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the acceptance of the bank ſhare granted to him.</p>
            <p>The Board, on the 10th of November, reſolved, That their thanks ſhould be preſented to Dr. John Duffield, for his ſervices, and that, as an acknowledgment for them, he ſhould be preſented with a ſhare in the bank of Pennſylvania, transferred as thoſe to the other phyſicians.</p>
            <p>On the 23 November, they alſo "reſolved, that their thanks ſhould be preſented to Mr. James Smith, late of New-York, for his voluntary, diſintereſted and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſervices during the late contagious fever, and that the ſame be publiſhed."</p>
            <p>The Chairman of the Board, in notifying to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor certain reſolutions, expreſſed to him, that the Board are ſo ſtrongly impreſſed with the extraordinary labour and attention of Dr. John Church and Dr. Benger Dobel, in conſequence of their being ſeated where the diſorder raged with moſt violence, that they would <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>The impropriety practiſed by the drivers of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages that conveyed the dead to the burying-grounds ſhould be noticed; ſo that, in caſe any ſuch calamity might viſit us hereafter, we may learn to improve by the blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of others. Thoſe particularly who conveyed the dead from Southwark, frequently drove the carriage along the moſt central parts of the city, in conveying them to the Hoſpital burying ground, inſtead of taking a direction towards the Commons.</p>
            <p>While this is iſſuing from the preſs, the river is frozen over, wood is dear, and trade is almoſt ſtagnant. The neceſſaries of life, are, generally ſpeaking, at a higher rate than in 1793. Bankruptcies are as numerous as they were at the cloſe of the American revolution. When links to a chain are thus broken, we are, literally, on a boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſea. Thouſands ſuffer by the failure of hundreds. Our trade, being long cramped by the aggreſſions of two oppoſite powers, has rendered money ſcarce, and increaſed the number of poor to an unexampled amount. Hence, though Death has not ſnatched away from us more than one-quarter ſo many ſouls as in '93, yet we cannot, on a curſory view, find much contraſt in the picture of the two periods.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The following letter will afford an idea of the ſufferings of ſome of the poor of the City of Philadelphia:</p>
                  <p>"Sir,—Once more I find myſelf called upon to give you a few lines on as diſagreeable a ſubject as ever occurred in human life.

Not, however, without liberally admitting, that it was owing to the confuſed ſtate of the people who rendered liſts—the vaſt trouble and time neceſſary for daily receiving them—and blunders of grave-diggers, particularly their reporting that bodies would be buried at one time that perhaps would not be interred for ſeveral hours after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and ſo, perhaps, were enumerated twice. Theſe obſervations we make, as a juſtification for our accuracy, that naturally, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, might be called in queſtion.</p>
