            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOME time ago I was ſolicited by Mr. Weſley, to ſend him an account of my experience and travels. I was at a loſs to know what was beſt to be done in this caſe; but after ſome conſideration, I informed him that I would comply with his requeſt. After I began to write, I found ſome ſcruples in my mind which I communicated to him. But ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I received a ſecond, and then a third letter, in which he intreated me to lay aſide my ſcruples and comply with his requeſt.</p>
            <p>Having at length prepared the piece, I ſent it from New-York in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which I underſtood was caſt away, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that he did not receive it; of which I had no <hi>certain</hi> account, till he informed me in another letter; and that if it di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> come to hand ſoon, it would not be in time for him to ſee it: which was, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:023401_0003_0FBF588A9A8EA138"/>the caſe; for whilſt I was ſitting in my room in Albany, finiſhing a letter to be encloſed with it, a friend came in, and preſented me with a news-paper, in which I read the account of the death of that eminent ſervant of God.</p>
            <p>I have ſince conſented to have it print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in America, with very little alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except an enlargement. In truſt in this my eye hath been ſingle, and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention pure. In keeping my regular journal, it was not uncommon for me to write the exerciſes of the day before I cloſed my eyes in ſleep. But ſhould there be any miſrepreſentations, or any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances exaggerated (which I think is not the caſe) I hope my reader will have charity enough to impute it either to miſtake, or wrong information. I can appeal to the Searcher of hearts when I ſay, in the relation of any ſubject I had rather be under than over the truth.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but ſame real facts which I have related, will appear ſtrange to
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:023401_0004_0FBF588CD35B0848"/>ſome people. Great and glorious diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries hath the Lord made to me, in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of his vineyard, at various times; inſomuch, that I think it my duty not to keep ſilence; but publiſh to the children of men the great goodneſs of a benevolent God. Within ſixteen years, I have travelled more than ſixty thouſand miles, in the glorious work of <hi>planting</hi> or <hi>ſpreading</hi> the Goſpel; and when I look back, the time ſeems very ſhort, and I often mourn under a ſenſe of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs, and feel willing to ſpend the remainder of my days in the ſervice of ſo good a God.</p>
            <p>I have an ardent deſire to be uſeful, and it greatly rejoices my heart when I ſee or hear of precious ſinners embracing the overtures of mercy. I earneſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe all thoſe into whoſe hands this ſhort diary may fall, to read it with earneſt prayer; then peradventure it will have its deſired effect on their hearts. In this
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:023401_0005_0FBF588E56166F28"/>account I did by no means intend to gratify the curioſity, or to tickle the ears of thoſe who live in pleaſure. I never aimed at this from the pulpit; the truth of which thoſe who know me can teſtify; and in my writing I aim at the ſame thing— to be inſtrumental in bringing precious ſouls to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay to God's dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren—the advice of St. John is, <hi>"lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, love one another."</hi> And <hi>"perfect love caſteth out fear."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt entreat all thoſe who are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to pure religion, to endeavour to take the following ſteps before they cloſe their eyes in ſleep, viz. <hi>1.</hi> Set down and count the coſt—conſider the ſtate which your ſoul is in—meditate on the ſhortneſs of time, the certainty of death and judgment, and the abſolute neceſſity of a preparation for futurity. <hi>2.</hi> Turn your back on every thing which you know to be ſinful. Sin cauſed the Son of God to groan and die. Why, O why then
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:023401_0006_0FBF5892291A6E30"/>ſhould we live and delight in ſin? O! behold ſin driving, as it were, the ſpear into the ſide of the Redeemer, and ſly from it as from deadly poiſon. <hi>3.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take yourſelf to prayer; how your kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e before the eternal Judge, and call on the ſtrong for ſtrength. <hi>4.</hi> Form a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the name of the Lord, that the remainder of your days ſhall be ſpent in a life of piety. <hi>5.</hi> Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and you ſhall be ſaved. You ſhall feel your ſins forgiven. The guilt, power, and love of ſin ſhall be removed, and your ſoul ſhall be happy in God. Till this is your bleſſed experience, your ſoul will be unhappy, and if you die without it, your ſoul will for ever ſink into hell.</p>
            <p>O! dear ſinners, my heart is enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards you; repent and turn to the Lord, and he will in mercy meet you. "Now is the accepted time, &amp;c." The laſt trump will ſoon be blown, and all mankind muſt appear at his tremendous
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:023401_0007_0FBF58966F7FCE28"/>bar. There is a ſufficiency in Jeſus, and he is now ſtanding ready to ſave you. That you may live as you would wiſh to die, and reign with Chriſt in endleſs day,</p>

            <p>I Was born in the year of our Lord 1752. My parents were of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and brought up their children in that way. My father was a very moral man, and thought by his neighbours to be a very good Chriſtians and my mother was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that feared the Lord. I was (as my parents informed me) from my infancy prene to pride, ſelf-will, and ſtubbornneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: which I afterwards ſenſibly felt, to the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of my heart. My father's grandfather was an emigrant from Great-Britain; and numbered among the firſt ſettlers in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Maryland.</p>
            <p>I was very early taught the Lord's pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, creed, and ten commandments, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the catechiſm of the church of England; and was in early life reſtrained by my render parents from open ſin. It pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord to remove my dear mother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an awful eternity when I was young. But I ſhall never forget the admonitions
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023401_0009_0FBF5899AB3BFE40"/>which ſhe gave me. One Lord's-day when I was about ſeven years of age, my mother was retired (I was fitting by her ſide) and whilſt ſhe was reading the two laſt chapters of the Revelations, when ſhe came to the place where it ſpeaks of the tree and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, ſhe made a full ſtop, and with eyes uplifted to heaven, and tears flowing down, "O!" ſaid ſhe, "that I may be happy enough to eat of that fruit, and drink of that water, in my heavenly Father's kingdom!" I believe the bleſſed Spirit was with her, and I felt the divine operations: but I knew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im not; for we lived in a dark time. One day when I was about nine years of age, as I was walking alone in the field, it was as ſtrongly uppreſt on my mind, as if I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eard a voice, "Aſk and it ſhall be given you." I was immediately deſirous to know what it meant, and it occurred to my mind, that this was a ſcriptural promiſe. But I, having no ideas of ſpiritual things, immediately ran to the houſe and told my elder brother, it was revealed to me, that I ſhould be very rich: ſhortly after this, I was by myſelf and there was a queſtion aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, "Do you know what a ſaint is?" I pauſed a while in my mind, and unſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023401_0010_0FBF589AF4118760"/>there are no ſaints in this our day on earth. The ſame voice replied, "a ſaint is one that is wholly given up to God." And immediately in idea, I ſaw ſuch a perſon who appeared the moſt beautiful of all I ever beheld. I was affected, and prayed to the Lord to make me a ſaint, and it was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſt upon my mind that I ſhould be one; and a ſpirit of joy ſprung up within me; but I had no one to open to me the way of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Some time after this, a great affliction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel my father's family: firſt a ſiſter, then my mother, and then two ſervants were remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an awful eternity. The ninth day of my ſiſter's illneſs, ſhe aſked for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and eat heartily for one in her low ſtate. After ſhe had done ſhe deſired to be raiſed in the bed; I am, ſaid ſhe, about to leave the world. The family were called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and were in a flood of tears: "Weep not for me," ſaid ſhe, "for I am not afraid to die. I am going to my Jeſus, who will do more for me than any of you can do." I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her ſoul was happy. And the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exhortation which ſhe gave will neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was not common to find her on the Lord's-day without a Bible; her old uncle, who was a communicant in the church, uſed to ſay, "Sally lives as ſhe would wiſh to die." From this time a melancholy gloom hung over me, and I frequently went alone to weep. I knew I wanted ſomething, but what it was I knew not; for I had none to take me by the hand, and lead me into the narrow path. I know the bleſſed and fixing my ſo that I have been melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into tenderneſs; but I knew not the way of ſalvation. About this time it was I bought myſelf a pocket Teſtament, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently withdrew and read; and was much affected with the ſufferings of our dear Lord. Our unhappy miniſter was a ſtranger to God and the moſt of his flock, I fear, were in the way to ruin.</p>
            <p>When I was about twelve years of age, I was removed to another ſchool, where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a time I threw off all ſeriouſneſs; and became as wild as the reſt of my young play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. The moſt of my ſchool-hours, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023401_0012_0FBF589DF183FEB0"/>I turned fourteen, were taken up in branches of the mathematics and book-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the intervals of my time, in the ſtudy of aſtronomy. I have often continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alone in the ſtudy of this till after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, without a ſerious thought of God or my eternal welfare. Between the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and eighteenth years of my age I left ſchool, and began to think of living in the world. But alas! I was careleſs and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; though what the world calls a moral youth. I was ſond of pleaſure, and loved this world more than God. Oh! what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have I to praiſe God for his goodneſs, in purſuing me with the overtures of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. About this time it was, that there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be much ſaid of the people called Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts in Baltimore county where I lived. Many went out to hear them, and I among the reſt, but the place was ſo crowded I could not get into the houſe: but from what I could underſtand, I thought they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth, and did by no means dare to join with the multitude in perſecuting them: but thought I would let them alone, and keep cloſe to my own church. Oh! thoſe ſoul damning ſins, pride and unbelief, which kept me from God and his people!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:023401_0013_0FBF589F83015920"/>
Bleſſed be God, it was not long after, that his holy Spirit began again to work powerfully with me. One day as I was riding home, I met a young man who had been hearing the Methodiſts, and had got his heart touched under the world. He ſtopt me in the road, and began to talk ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about Jeſus and his people, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to me in ſuch a winning man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that I was deeply convinced there was a reality in that religion, and that it was time for me to think ſeriouſly on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Not many days had paſſed, before a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle book fell into my hands, called Ruſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l's ſeven ſermons. By this book I was adviſed to make as exact an eſtimate of all my ſins as poſſible; I did ſo, and found they were numerous, for I began to ſee myſelf in the goſpel glaſs; and many were the tears I ſhed over this book. And I promiſed an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life; but my repentance was too much like the early dew or morning rain. Still the way of ſalvation was not open to me, and there was an unwillingneſs in me to ſubmit. But as my dear Lord was not willing that I ſhould periſh, his good Spirit ſtill ſtrove with me. One day as I was paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023401_0014_0FBF58A6DE2B82C0"/>over a rapid ſtream, a log on which I had frequently gone, gave way, and I was near being ſwept down the ſtream; after ſtruggling a while, I got out, though much wounded among the ſharp rocks. This que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtruck my mind with great weight, "What would have become of your ſoul, had you been drowned?" I wept bitterly, and prayed to the Lord under a ſenſe of my guilt. Still my ſtubborn heart was not willing to ſubmit, though I began to carry a little hell in my boſom.</p>
            <p>In May 1772, as I was riding out one afternoon, I went down a deſcent over a large broad rock; my horſe ſtumbled and threw me; and with the fall on the rock, and the horſe blundering over me, I was beaten out of my ſenſes. I was alone, and how long I lay I know not; but when I recovered, in ſome meaſure, I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on my knees, with my hands and eyes raiſed to heaven, crying to God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. It came ſtrongly into my mind that had I then been taken, I ſhould have dropt into hell. I felt my miſery, and praiſed God, as well as I knew how, for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; and before I moved from the place, I promiſed to ſerve him all the days
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023401_0015_0FBF58AF03E8DEA8"/>of my life. But before I aroſe from my knees, all my pain of body was removed, and I felt nearly as well as ever I did in my life. I alſo felt the drawing of God's Spirit, and in a meaſure ſaw a beauty in Jeſus: but I did not know that my ſins were forgiven; neither was the plan of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation clearly open to me; but I went on my way determined, by grace, to be a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of Chriſt. All the Antinomians in the world, could not make me believe, that a man cannot feel ſweet drawings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he experiences juſtification.</p>
            <p>I now procured a collection of the beſt religious books that I could; amongſt which were, the writings of Mr. Hervey, the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of true godlineſs, and Alleine's alarm to the unconverted: for as yet I had not ſeen any of Mr. Weſley's publications nor converſed on religious ſubjects with any of the Methodiſts.</p>
            <p>As I lived a retired life, I frequently read, prayed, and wept till after midnight: and often withdrew to the woods and other private places for prayer. In ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my name was already caſt out as evil, though I was aſhamed to let any one know the exerciſes of my mind, or that I uſed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023401_0016_0FBF58B063EF62F8"/>ſecret prayer: and in order to conceal it when in company, I have frequently griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bleſſed Spirit, by joining in trifling converſation. For I was much afraid of being thought a hypocrite. But the Holy Spirit ſtill purſued me, and I attended ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the duties of the family, over which I was placed. I had as yet heard very few Methodiſt ſermons; and the devil ſtrove very hard to keep me from going among thoſe people. Some time after, my late well-tried friend and brother Mr. F. A. came to our county: I went to hear him one evening at R. W.'s. The place was crowded; however I got to the door and ſat down, but he had not preached long, before I ſenſibly felt the word: and his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſeemed as ſalve to a feſtering wound. I heard him with delight, and bathed in tears could have remained there till the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſun, the time paſſed ſo ſweetly away: I was delightfully drawn, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſtoniſhed to find a perſon go on ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, without his ſermon before him. I ſuppoſe hundreds of thoughts paſſed through my mind. But I returned home with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fully perſuaded that he was a ſervant of God, and that he preached in a way
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023401_0017_0FBF58B19E6D0830"/>I had not heard before. I followed him to another preaching place; and ſixing my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive eye upon him, I found him to be a workman that need not be aſhamed, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dividing the word. He began to wind about me in ſuch a manner that I found my ſins in cluſters, as it were, around me: and the law in its purity, probing to the very bottom, and diſcovering the defects of my heart. I was ready to cry out, "How does this ſtranger know me ſo well!" After ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was ended, I wiſhed not to ſpeak to any one, but returned home in a very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner.</p>
            <p>My father began to be troubled about me, and came to ſee me. We ſat up talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till near midnight. "I have no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," ſaid he, "to your being religious; but why would you turn from the church?" I replied, I have no intention to leave the church, but whenever perſons become ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they are called Methodiſts, and their names are caſt out as evil. After we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I found great tenderneſs of heart, and ſhed many tears in private, and many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes occurred to my mind; I loved the Methodiſts, and yet the enemy of my ſoul kept me at a diſtance from them. Unbelief
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023401_0018_0FBF58B318ABE718"/>and pride kept me from the comforts of aſſurance.</p>
            <p>In April 1773, my brother John was taken dangerouſly ill, ſo that his life was deſpaired of. One Lord's-day, many of our relations and others came to ſee him, expecting every minute he would breathe his laſt. I was greatly concerned on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his ſoul, which to appearance was juſt launching into eternity, and my fear was that he was unprepared. I went round to the back part of the bed, and kneeling down, I prayed earneſtly to the Lord to have mercy on his ſoul. After I had done praying, I perceived his lips were moving, but could not hear a word that he ſpoke, till I put my ear cloſe to his mouth (to appearance he was juſt going) and heard him ſay, "Lord, thou knoweſt I am unprepared to die, have mercy on me, and raiſe me up, and give me a longer ſpace, and I will ſerve thee; thy Spirit has often ſtrove with me, but I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected thee," &amp;c. Thus did he plead with the Lord for a conſiderable time. He knew, and ſo did I, the moment of time when the Lord anſwered prayer, and granted him a longer ſpace. Immediately
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023401_0019_0FBF58B47722C2E8"/>I roſe from my knees, and told the waiting company they need not be uneaſy, for the Lord would raiſe him again; inſtantly the diſorder turned, he fell into a doſe, and within a few days was able to walk about his room. After his recovery, I converſed with him on the ſubject, and he told me that he ſaw death, that he was ſummoned to appear in the world of ſpirits, and that hell was his doom. "I know," ſaid he, "when a reprieve in anſwer to prayer was ſent, the blow averted, and the tender thread lengthened, on condition that I would give the remainder of my days to the Lord." A few years after he was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed in heart, and lived two years and eight months happy in the ſervice of God, died a witneſs of perfect love.</p>
            <p>About this time my dear Lord laid me under his hand, and I was brought nigh unto death. During the time of my ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I was in a very ſtrange way; I lay on my bed ſinging praiſes to God without any dread of death; I ſelt my mind eaſy; I thought if I was removed I ſhould go to Heaven; I was willing to die; I did not know my ſins were forgiven; but I felt a ſtrong hope, yet I was not fully acquainted
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023401_0020_0FBF58B89A1C3FF8"/>with the plan of ſalvation. Who can tell what ſtate my ſoul was in? I was a good Churchman, but a poor Methodiſt. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the name of the Lord! He delights not in the death of a ſinner, for he raiſed me up again; but ſtill the enemy of my ſoul ſtrove to keep me from amongſt God's dear, deſpiſed children.</p>
            <p>The Auguſt following, it pleaſed the Lord to take my father into eternity.— Surely it was painful to loſe the tendereſt of parents. From my earlieſt knowledge of his family, conſiſting of about twenty in number, I do not remember ever to have heard an oath ſworn either by black or white; and it was a rare thing for him to correct either children or ſervants, though ſtill there was a trembling at his word. I frequently viſited him in the time of his illneſs (for he had a long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſickneſs) and he ſeemed very fond of my company; and I have reaſon to believe he went happy out of this dangerous world. Being now left in the entire charge of a family, and the ſettlement of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's buſineſs moſtly devolving on me, I was ſurrounded with many cares and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which were no help to the affairs of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023401_0021_0FBF58B9B0CB5D10"/>my ſalvation. The devil ſtrove hard to drive away all my good deſires, but ſtill I attended conſtantly to my ſecret devotions, though at times cold enough. It was not long after the death of my father, that I had a particular interview with the new pariſh miniſter, who was a very clever man, of a moral character, and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in the place: I was a conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on his miniſtry, and frequently converſed with him on divine ſubjects. He told me the Methodiſts carried matters too far; that a man could not know his ſins were forgiven: and all we might expect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </gap>his life was a hope ſpringing from an upright life. This doctrine exactly tallied with my experience, and was food for my fallen nature. I ſoon fully agreed with hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in ſentiment, and pleaded that no man could know his ſins forgiven in this world. The grand enemy began now to exerciſe my mind in another way; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeek a literary qualification for the miniſtry in the church. This hung upon me for a conſiderable time; and I applied myſelf to reading and ſtudy for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, often conſulting my new counſellor. The Spirit of the Lord at times ſtrove
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023401_0022_0FBF58BD9914E218"/>very powerfully, and I was frequently afraid that all was not well with me, eſpecially when I was under Methodiſt preaching. To theſe people I was drawn; but it was like death to me; for I thought I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerve God in any way than among them; at the ſame time ſomething within would tell me they were right. Being amazingly agitated in mind, I at length came to this concluſion, to give up my former purſuits and bend my mind to the improvement of my worldly property, and ſerve God in a private manner. I now ſet out as it were in full purſuit of buſineſs with an expectation of accumulating <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>During the time of my ſelf-ſecure ſtate, I had the form of godlineſs, attended the church conſtantly, and ſometimes went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>k, prayed frequently every day in ſecret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, endeavoured to attend ſtrictly to the Sabbath, often reproved open ſin, and denied myſelf of what the world calls plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I was ſo faſt ſet in my way, that I thought I ſhould certainly go to Heaven. And if at any time I was overtaken, I would endeavour to mend my pace and pray more
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023401_0023_0FBF58C02E3BE060"/>frequently. I cannot ſay I was always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubts; for often, under Methodiſt preaching, my poor foundation would ſhake, eſpecially under the preaching of dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther G. S. and I would ſcarcely recover my hope for many days; then I would be tempted to think they were a deluded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and I would go among them no more: but ſtill I was drawn again and again. I ſtood in a manner between the children of God and the world. When I was with the people of God I would endeavour to confute them; and when I was among their enemies, I plead their cauſe.</p>
            <p>One day being at a diſtance from home, I met with a zealous Methodiſt exhorter. He aſked me if I was born again? I told him I had a hope that I was. Do you know, ſaid he, that your ſins are forgiven? No, replied I, neither do I expect that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in this world. I perceive, ſaid he, that you are in the broad road to hell, and if you die in this ſtate you will be damned. The Scripture, ſaid I, tells us that the tree is known by its fruit; and our Lord like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe condemns raſh judgment. What have you ſeen or known of my life that induced you to judge me in ſuch a manner—I pity
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023401_0024_0FBF58C2B9D4FA38"/>you, ſaid I, and turned my back on him. But I could not eaſily forget the words of that pious young man, for they were as ſpears running through me.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate I continued till June 1775. The bleſſed morning I ſhall never forget! In the night I went to bed as uſual; and ſlept till day break—Juſt as I awoke, I was alarmed by an awful voice, "Awake, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for you are not prepared to die." This was as ſtrongly impreſſed on my mind, as if it had been a human voice as loud as thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I was inſtantly ſmitten with convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a manner I had not been before. I ſtarted from my pillow, and cried out, Lord have mercy on my ſoul! As it was about the commencement of the late unhappy war, and there was to be a general review that day near my houſe, I had promiſed myſelf much ſatisfaction; for I was a profeſſed friend to the American cauſe: however, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of giving my attendance, I paſſed the morning away in ſolitude; and in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon went out and heard a Methodiſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. In ſorrow I went, and in ſorrow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; and in ſorrow the night paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. None but thoſe that have experienced
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023401_0025_0FBF58CCC96768E0"/>the like exerciſes, can form an idea of what I underwent for ſeveral days.</p>
            <p>The devil and the enmity of my heart ſeemed to riſe higher and higher. On the Tueſday following, in the afternoon I heard Mr. D. R. preach; and was ſo oppreſt that I was ſcarce able to ſupport under my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. After preaching I called in with D. R. at Mrs. G—'s, and ſtaid till about nine o'clock. On my way home being much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed, I alighted from my horſe in a lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wood, and bowed my knees before the Lord; I ſenſibly felt two ſpirits, one on each hand. The good ſpirit ſet forth to my inmoſt mind, the beauties of religion; and I ſeemed almoſt ready to lay hold on my Saviour. Oh! unbelief! ſoul damning ſin! it kept me from my Jeſus. Then would the enemy riſe up on the other hand, and dreſs religion in as odious a garb as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; yea, he ſeemed in a moment of time, to ſet the world and the things of it in the moſt brilliant colours before me; telling m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023401_0026_0FBF58CEAE7C96C8"/>laſt began to give way to the reaſoning of the enemy. My tender feelings abated, and my tears were gone; my heart was hard, but I continued on my knees in a kind of meditation; and at length addreſſed my Maker thus: Lord, ſpare me one year more, and by that time I can put my worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in ſuch a train, that I can ſerve thee. (I ſeemed as if I felt the two ſpirits with me.) The anſwer was, "Now is the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time." I then plead for ſix months, but was denied—one month, no—I then aſked for one week, the anſwer was, "This is the time." For ſome time the devil was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, till I was denied one week in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l dart. "The God," ſaid he, "you are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſerve, is a hard Maſter; and I would have you to deſiſt from your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour." Carnal people know very little of this kind of exerciſe: but it was as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to me, as if I had been converſing with two perſons face to face. As ſoon as this powerful temptation came, I felt my heart riſe ſenſibly (I do not ſay with enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) againſt my Maker, and immediately I aroſe from my knees with theſe words, "I will take my own time, and then I will
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023401_0027_0FBF58D030918C48"/>ſerve thee." I mounted my horſe with a hard, unbelieving heart, unwilling to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Jeſus. Oh! what a good God had I to deal with! I might in juſtice have been ſent to hell.</p>
            <p>I had not rode a quarter of a mile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore the Lord met me powerfully with theſe words, "Theſe three years have I come ſeeking fruit on this ſig-tree; and find none." And then the following words were added, "I have come once more to offer you life and ſalvation, and it is the laſt time: chuſe, or refuſe." I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſurrounded with a divine power: heaven and hell were diſcloſed to view, and life and death were ſet before me. I do believe if I had rejected this call, mercy would have been for ever taken from me. Man hath power to chuſe or refuſe in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matters; otherwiſe God would have no reaſonable ſervice from his creatures. I knew the very inſtant, when I ſubmitted to the Lord, and was willing that Chriſt ſhould reign over me: I likewiſe knew the two ſins which I parted with laſt, pride and unbelief. I threw the reins of my bridle on my horſe's neck, and putting my hands together, cried out, Lord, I ſubmit.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023401_0028_0FBF58D1C6EDE530"/>I was leſs than nothing in my own ſight; and was now, for the firſt time, reconciled to the juſtice of God. The enmity of my heart was ſlain—The plan of ſalvation was open to me—I ſaw a beauty in the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Deity, and felt that power of faith and love that I had ever been a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to before.</p>

            <p>AFTER I found this pearl of great price, my ſoul was ſo exceedingly happy, that I ſeemed as if I wanted to take wing and fly away to heaven. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though alone in an unfrequented wood, I was conſtrained to ſound forth the praiſes of my dear Redeemer. I thought I ſhould not be aſhamed to publiſh it to the ends of the earth. As I drew near to the houſe, the ſervants heard me, and came to meet me at the gate in great ſurpriſe. The ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s ſeemed as ſo many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> going forth in
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023401_0029_0FBF58DA589DAE78"/>their Maker's praiſe. I called the family together for prayer, but my prayer was turned into praiſe.</p>
            <p>About midnight I laid down to reſt; but my ſoul was ſo happy in God, I ſcarcely wiſhed for ſleep; however, at length my eyes were cloſed; but behold! about day-break I awoke, and was ſtrongly tempted by the devil; "Oh!" ſaid the adverſary, "where is your religion now? It was only a dream." I ſtarted from my pillow —I remembered the time and place where I received the bleſſing: and was enabled to repel that temptation. Again ſaid he, "It is all a deluſion." This aſſault pained me to the heart. Not feeling as I had done, I began to conclude perhaps it might be ſo; and betook myſelf to the fields and woods, under deep diſtreſs. I frequently bowed my knees before the Lord; and, bleſſed be his dear name, about nine in the morning my beloved Maſter viſited my heart with his love. And I think I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as great a manifeſtation as at the firſt. This viſit was attended with an impreſſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to go to ſuch a place, and declare to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who might be there, what great things the Lord had done for me. I went to the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023401_0030_0FBF58DC3B90FA48"/>houſe, got my horſe, and ſet out. When I arrived at the place, I found a Methodiſt preacher, and ſeveral of my acquaintance. And it was ſtrongly impreſſed on my mind to deliver my meſſage. I ſat down among them, but the croſs was too heavy. I ſat hours, and grieved the bleſſed Spirit, till I was brought under heavy trials, yea, deep diſtreſs of ſoul; and in that way I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home.</p>
            <p>For the good of others, I ſhall ſpeak of a few days' exerciſe on this occaſion. The dear Redeemer left me, or rather hid his face from me: and I had to wade through deep waters. I faſted and prayed, till I was almoſt reduced to a ſkeleton; but did not open my mouth to any one. I was ſinking into deſperation.—O! how pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully was I haraſſed by the devil, day and night! The Saturday following I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the fields; all nature was cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with beauty and verdure; but I could diſcover no charms in aught around me: but was under the deepeſt exerciſes of mind, and ſeverely tempted of the devil. "Ah," ſuggeſted he, "where is your God now?" He thruſt atheiſm and deiſm againſt me; and thus ſuggeſted to my mind, "You
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023401_0031_0FBF58DDB740AB28"/>ſee you have been deluded; and if you will now take my advice, you will deny every pretenſion to this religion. The Methodiſts are a ſet of enthuſiaſts, and you have now a proof of it." Then with what ſplendor was the world ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to my imagination: "All theſe things," ſuggeſted he, "will I give you if you will deny that God you have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſerve, and pray to him no more." I was ſunk as low as I could poſſibly be; for my mind was encompaſſed with darkneſs, and the moſt ſevere diſtreſs. I was afraid my lips would be forced open to deny the God who made me. Glory, glory to my Lord! who again gave me a view of an opening eternity, and a ſenſe of his dread Majeſty; the ſight of which brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the duſt, proſtrate with my face to the ground, where I lay for a conſiderable time with language ſimilar to this, if I periſh, it ſhall be at thy feet, crying for mercy. Thus I lay, till I recovered a gleam of hope that I ſhould be ſaved at laſt.</p>
            <p>I aroſe from the earth, and advancing towards the houſe in deep thought, I came to this concluſion, that I would exclude myſelf from the ſociety of men, and live
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023401_0032_0FBF58DF32FAE358"/>in a cell upon bread and water, mourning out my days for having grieved my Lord. I went into my room and ſat in one poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till nine o'clock. I then threw myſelf on the bed, and ſlept till morning. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was the Lord's-day, I did not intend to go to any place of worſhip; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I deſire to ſee any perſon, but wiſhed to paſs my time away in total ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. I continued reading the Bible till eight, and then under a ſenſe of duty, called the family together for prayer. As I ſtood with a book in my hand, in the act of giving out a hymn, this thought powerfully ſtruck my mind, "It is not right for you to keep your fellow-creatures in bondage; you muſt let the oppreſſed go free." I knew it to be that ſame bleſſed voice which had ſpoken to me before—till then I had never ſuſpected that the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſlave-keeping was wrong; I had not read a book on the ſubject, nor been told ſo by any—I pauſed a minute and then replied, "Lord, the oppreſſed ſhall go free." And I was as clear of them in my mind, as if I had never owned one. I told them they did not belong to me, and that I did not deſire their ſervices without
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023401_0033_0FBF58E239FA25D8"/>making them a compenſation; and I was now at liberty to proceed in worſhip. After ſinging, I kneeled to pray. Had I the tongue of an angel, I could not fully deſcribe what I felt: all my dejection and that melancholy gloom which preyed upon me, vaniſhed in a moment: a divine ſweetneſs ran through my whole frame—O! in what a wonderful manner was my poor ſoul let into the depths of my Redeemer's loved Praiſe and glory to his name for ever!</p>
            <p>I had now no deſire to confine myſelf to a cell, but wiſhed to ſpread my Redeemer's glory to the ends of the world. I bleſs the Lord for leading me ſafe through ſuch fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trials! My late affliction of mind was for my good. It was God, not man, that taught me the impropriety of holding ſlaves: and I ſhall never be able to praiſe him enough for it. My very heart has bled, ſince that, for ſlave-holders, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe who make a profeſſion of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for I believe it to be a crying ſin. In the forenoon I attended church, but I could not find what I wanted. In the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon I went to hear the Methodiſts; and ſomething told me, "theſe are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple." I was ſo happy in the time of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023401_0034_0FBF58EA192178C0"/>preaching, that I could conceal it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; ſo I determined to chuſe God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for my people, and returned home re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing.</p>
            <p>A few days after, I attended a claſs-meeting on Deer-creek, for the firſt time, and was convinced it was a prudential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and my heart was more than ever united to this community. I told Br. H. a pious man, what the Lord had done for me. I now began again to be preſſed in ſpirit to viſit my friends and neighbours; and eſpecially ſome particular families which lay with weight on my mind. The firſt viſit I made, the man of the houſe was much enraged againſt me; but my dear Lord gave me one or two of his children. Shortly after I viſited another family; and the maſter was brought to cry for mercy, on his knees before the Lord. The third was near twenty miles off: I ſeemed to go with confidence, and got there a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night: I told him what God had done for me, and deſired he would ſend out and call in the neighbours, and I would pray with and for them. The perſon did ſo, and after prayer I was obliged, for the firſt time, to open my mouth by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023401_0035_0FBF58EB3438A700"/>and the Lord filled it, and ſent his arrows to the hearts of three ſinners, one of whom ſlept very little that night; and another followed me near ſixteen miles the next day.</p>
            <p>I again attended claſs for the ſecond time at Mr. D.'s; and as they had not heard what had happened to me, ſome of them were fearful that I had come in to ſpy out their liberties. I aroſe from my ſeat, and, for the firſt time among the Methodiſts, publicly declared what the Lord had done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> me. A divine kindling ran through the whole houſe; and we had a bleſſed meeting. The leader offered to give up his paper to me; but I refuſed, ſaying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> would viſit them as often as I could; and ſo returned home, praiſing God.</p>
            <p>I felt an impreſſion to go to that brother I have before mentioned, who was raiſed from the jaws of death: he was in a ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way; but did not profeſs the faith of aſſurance. I begged of him to call a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his own houſe, and I found grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> freedom to ſpeak, and appointed anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> meeting; about forty people gathered; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whilſt I was ſpeaking, the power of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Lord came down in a wonderful manner
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023401_0036_0FBF58ECF0B70608"/>near half the poor ſinners that were preſent, were ſtruck to the floor, and cried for mercy to ſuch a degree, that they were heard at a great diſtance. After the meeting was ever, many continued crying for mercy.</p>
            <p>The next morning a gentleman who liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not far off, came to the houſe to beat me: ſoon after he entered he began to ſwear, affirming I would ſpoil all his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes. I told him if he did not leave off ſwearing, he would ſend his ſoul to hell. He replied, "If I ſaid that again, he would level me to the floor." I aſſured him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> would reprove him whenever he took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Lord's name in vain. He then roſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and ſtruck me on the ſide of the face, and followed his blows. There were five of us in the houſe, my brother, his overſeer, myſelf, and two enemies. I was afraid we ſhould have had a general battle. My brother was only awakened; his overſeer had no religion beyond a zeal for the truth, and ſuch a love for my brother and myſelf, that he would almoſt have laid down his life for us. My mind was perfectly calm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and my ſoul ſo happy, that I ſcarce felt his blows. I ſaw the Lord's hand in my preſervation; for though he was in ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023401_0037_0FBF58EF36B9DB70"/>a rage, I had not been exhorting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minutes (with tears) before he was as quiet as a lamb: and he and his man, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us good morning, went away. Dear man! not long after he was taken into as awful eternity.</p>
            <p>I now began to hold evening meetings in different places, ſeveral times in a week: and united thoſe who were awakened into a kind of ſociety; and ſeveral, I truſt, were happily united to Jeſus. O! what ſweet times I uſed to have. Frequently we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tinued ſinging, praying, and praiſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> till after midnight. Many of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ns were ſorry for, and pitied me; but glory to God! I delighted in the croſs of my dear Saviour. I was aſſaulted by many inward conflicts from the devil and the corruptions of my own heart; but Jeſus was precious to me.</p>
            <p>I had an appointment, one Lord's day, but before I got there a company of Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al's children gathered to prevent the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but, bleſſed be God, I was enable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I was determined I would have nothing to do with the unhappy war; it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my mind, and grievous to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to have any hand in ſhedding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man blood. On this account I was taken, at the general meeting, before the rulers. But my dear Lord was with me, and gave me words that my oppoſers could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. While ſurrounded by my enemies, my ſoul was happy, and, with tears flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from my eyes, I told them their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

               </gap> Lord: they laid a fine upon me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Lord would not permit them to take a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my property. On being diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I withdrew and found great freedom to pray for them; and returned home with a glad heart.</p>
            <p>It was preſſed on my mind to have ſome converſation with Mr. W—. He had been the means of keeping me from God and his people for a long time. We had a long diſcourſe in the veſtry chamber, before the veſtry: where I told him what God had done for me. He deſired to know who gave me authority to hold meetings in his
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023401_0039_0FBF58F887498E08"/>pariſh? I told him I did not do it either for money or honor; that while there were ſinners in his pariſh, and the Lord preſſed it on my mind, I ſhould call them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. "You have no right to do it," ſaid he, "unleſs you were ordained." The love of God conſtraineth me, ſaid I, and I muſt open my mouth in his cauſe. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taſted his goodneſs, I have a longing deſire that my neighbours ſhould be made happy too. After a converſation of near two hours on the new birth, finding his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind diſturbed, I told him in a plain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap> effect it formerly had on me, and ſo our meeting ended. After I withdrew to my home, being young in the way, very few to ſtrengthen and many to weaken my hands, I was ſorely tempted of Satan to give up my confidence in my dear Lord. And under heavy affliction of mind I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and wreſtled in prayer till the Lord viſited me, and diſperſed every doubt and every fear; giving me theſe words for my comfort, "Fear not, I am with you, and will ſupport you under all your trials." O what conſolatory ſtreams flowed into my
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:023401_0040_0FBF58F9E02FAB78"/>heart! and how was I ſtrengthened and enabled to rejoice in the Lord!</p>
            <p>Mr. T. R. underſtanding that my mind was exerciſed reſpecting the miniſtry, ſent to me to meet him at Mr. D—'s; I did ſo, and although he was a ſtranger to me, I found in him a father, who gave me moſt ſalutary advice, which I ſtood much in need of: for I had been wading through deep waters, and under very ſevere exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. I left him, much ſtrengthened and encouraged to go on in the bleſſed work. Some time after my brother requeſted to have preaching at his houſe, and it was there I became acquainted with Mr. R—a, who applied to me to travel with him. I complied, and found myſelf very happy; and at times had freedom to ſpeak, though the croſs was very heavy; and I was often ready to ſtart back. I had not been with him long before I returned home, and was ſo powerfully exerciſed, that I concluded it would not do to become a travelling preacher. Here my enemy ſtepped in, and told me there was one way to prevent it, which was to alter my condition. The object was ſoon determined on, and I made her a viſit, told my errand, and ſet a time
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:023401_0041_0FBF58FAF9C0A718"/>when I ſhould expect to have her anſwer. Many pleaſing proſpects now opened upon me; all this time I was willing to do any thing about home to promote the cauſe of religion: but it was like death to me to travel. The time arrived, and I went to know the perſon's mind reſpecting my late propoſal; but behold! the hand of the Lord was againſt it: during the night it was as if ſome perſon was telling me, "You are about to do your own will; I have a greater work for you; you muſt go out and preach the goſpel." My mind was ſo diſquieted, I ſcarcely cloſed my eyes throughout the night; till being fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced I was entering on a work the Lord had not called me to, I determined to give the matter up. In the morning early, I met the perſon in the hall; I told her my difficulty; and that I believed the Lord had a greater work for me to do. I have written on this ſubject for the benefit of young preachers, into whoſe hands this may fall: being perſuaded the enemy of ſouls exerciſes many of them in the ſame way. O that they may be wiſe and break the ſnare of the devil! Mr. R—a deſired me to meet him in Baltimore town at a
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:023401_0042_0FBF58FC99ECC7A0"/>certain time: I went, and he forced me into the pulpit, but the croſs was ſo heavy, and my temptations ſo great, I could ſcarcely ſupport under them; but, bleſſed be God, after I opened my mouth, I felt my dear Saviour, and it was a ſweet time to me, and I expect to many more. I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled a few days with him, after which he ſent me on a circuit alone. This was the fall after my converſion. I found great liberty of ſpeech, and the word was bleſſed to many ſouls, for the Lord greatly aſſiſted me, and I had ſweet, refreſhing ſeaſons. Oh! how happy might I have been, had I guarded againſt my powerful adverſary! I had not been on the circuit more than fifteen days, before I gave way to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's ſuggeſtions, and concluded I was not called to this work. I left the circuit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deep dejection, and returned home; determined I would never attempt it again. The devil told me, the more I went among the Methodiſts, particularly the preachers, the more my mind would be diſtreſſed about travelling. I was ſtill willing to ſpeak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally about home; but to go through the world, I knew not where, was a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den too heavy for me to bear.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="unknown:023401_0043_0FBF5903D6FC1FF0"/>
            <p>It is not in my power to give a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all my exerciſes from the fall till the following ſpring. It may however be neceſſary to touch on a few particulars; for about four months I ſpent my time in prayer, reading, and ſuch like exerciſes, except when I was from home, at preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or holding meetings myſelf. The idea of travelling and preaching the goſpel was conſtantly held up to my view. Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when riding or walking, I was drawn out on divine ſubjects, and at times the Bible ſeemed all open to me: it was not uncommon for me to preach in my ſleep. One night the whole world of ſinners ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be exhibited as it were in the air, ſuſpended by a ſlender thread, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal pit beneath them. I ſaw them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unconcerned, in all kinds of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly practices, as ſecure as if in no ſort of danger: in my ſleep I began to cry aloud to convince them of their danger; till I awakened my brother, who the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> awoke me: I was ſitting up in my bed, trembling and as wet with ſweat as if I had been dipped in a river. Although I lived ſo abſtemiouſly, I had very little hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; except at thoſe times when I felt a
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023401_0044_0FBF590503D88710"/>degree of willingneſs to labor for my dear Lord. I have frequently ſtood aſtoniſhed, wept and mourned in ſecret before the Lord, and entreated him to ſend ſome one elſe that was more ſenſible and capable than myſelf: looking around in my mind, and nominating ſuch and ſuch perſons, whom I conceived to be more fit for the office of the miniſtry; ſaying, how can it be, that ſuch an unworthy, ignorant being ſhould be ſet apart for ſo great a work? When on my way to my occaſional ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, I would promiſe in my mind, that if the Lord attended his word with great power, I would conſent to give up, and labor for him. And at ſuch times I have had great diſplays of the goodneſs of God, and ſinners weeping all around; and although my mind at the preſent would be reſolved, unbelief would again aſſault and overpower me.</p>
            <p>In the month of March my conflicts were ſo great, I almoſt ſunk under them. The ungodly amongſt my acquaintances knew not what was the matter with me: ſome would aſk if I was ſick (for I was much worn away.) Others would ſay behind my back, he will come to nothing. I believe
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023401_0045_0FBF590633346DD0"/>I had a more ſevere travail of ſoul before I ſubmitted to be a travelling preacher, than I had gone through for juſtifying grace. One day being almoſt weary of life, and under deep dejection, I thought if the Lord would manifeſt his will, I would, through grace, obey. I was next led to enquire how I was to expect this deſired favor. I kneeled down by the bed and prayed to the Lord, by ſome means or other, to make a diſcovery to me, in the cleareſt manner, of what he would have me to do. I aroſe from my knees without any particular anſwer, much burdened and greatly diſtreſſed. I threw myſelf on the bed again, and in leſs than two minutes I was in a ſound ſleep. I dreamed I ſaw the devil come in at the door, and advance towards me; I thought a good angel came and ſpake to me, ſaying "Will you go and preach the goſpel?" I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "I am unworthy, I cannot go:" In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the devil laid hold of my hand, and I began to ſtruggle to get from him; I ſaw but one way that I could eſcape, and that was a very narrow one. The good angel ſaid to me, "There <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> diſpenſation of the goſpel committed to you, and wo unto you, if you preach not the goſpel." I
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023401_0046_0FBF5907D60CDDF0"/>ſtruggled for ſome time to get from him, but in vain, at length I cried out, "Lord, ſend by whom thou wilt, I am willing to go and preach thy goſpel." No ſooner had I thus ſubmitted, than I ſaw the devil fly as it were through the end of the houſe in a flame of fire. I awoke, immediately every cloud was diſperſed, and my ſoul was enraptured with the love of my dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. I wanted now to converſe with ſome experienced perſon on the ſubject, my way now appeared ſo open, I thought I ſhould never have any more doubts to contend with. I believe it was the next day, I received a letter from brother D. R. deſiring me to come and take the circuit a ſew weeks while he went to Philadelphia. I had no doubt, but the Lord directed him to write thus. Before the day arrived that I was to ſet off, the enemy ſtrove again to prevent me; telling me, I was deluded, that it was only my own fancy, or the vanity of my own heart. After I ſet out I was perſecuted to that degree, I was ready to deſire my horſe might throw me and put an end to my life; or maim me ſo that I might not be able to go on. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I got to brother D. R.'s, in Cecil,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023401_0047_0FBF591024D346D0"/>where he had an appointment for me, but my exerciſes were ſo ſevere, that I could ſay but little. The next day he left me, and I concluded to go on the circuit. Of all creatures in the world, I have the grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſon to be thankful to the Lord, for his tender care of me, a poor, weak rebel againſt him. At the firſt and ſecond places to which I went, the Lord was powerfully preſent; and I believe good was done. I was now quite willing to be an exhorter; but thought I would not take a text: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I had not travelled far before I had a text ſuggeſted to me, and I refuſed, till my gift of exhortation was almoſt taken away; and my mind was amazingly diſtreſſed again.</p>
            <p>One Sabbath I came to a place near Chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tank bridge, where I again refuſed to give out a text, and it pleaſed the Lord to hide his face, ſo that I was unable to ſpeak with any degree of freedom. I went to my afternoon's appointment very low both in mind and body; having taken very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle refreſhment for ſeveral days. I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined if a text opened to me, I would give it out boldly, and truſt in the Lord. It was ſo, and I gave out "Behold the man." I
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023401_0048_0FBF5911717CAF98"/>ſhall never forget the afternoon; it was a time of power to me and many others; the whole Bible ſeemed open to me. The next day I went to my appointment, with ſome willingneſs to be a preacher. I gave out this text, "The great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand." I endeavoured to ſhew, as I could, how aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that day would be; and who would, and who would not, be enabled to ſtand; with the dreadful conſequence. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in a very remarkable manner came down among the people, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſinners were brought to cry for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. When almoſt ſpent, I ſtopt; but the people continued praying; O! it was a memorable ſeaſon! my ſoul was happy, and my heart humbled. I was now willing to be a preacher, and thought ſurely I ſhall never doubt again.</p>
            <p>When brother D. R. returned, he took the circuit, and I went out to open a new one. As I paſſed along through Tuckey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoe Neck, I called at a houſe and aſked the woman, if ſhe wanted to hear the word of the Lord preached, if the did, to ſend and call in her neighbours; ſhe did ſo, and I found great freedom. I gave out, that I
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023401_0049_0FBF591301EC7E20"/>would preach again the next day. The man of the houſe was an officer of rank, and it being a day of general muſtering, he marched up all the company, and I ſpake to hundreds with freedom; many tears were ſhed, and ſeveral convicted, one of whom has ſince become a preacher. I continued ſeveral days in the Neck, and my labors were attended with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>I again met brother D. R. in Cecil county, where we had a quarterly-meeting, and from thence we ſet out for Hartford. He ſolicited me not to fail attending the Baltimore conference. On the Lord's-day following, an appointment was made for me to preach in my native place; and a multitude gathered: amongſt whom many of my old friends and relations were there, which made the croſs very heavy. I gave out my old text, "The great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand." Juſt as I had entered on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I fainted under the croſs, and fell to the ground (I was preaching under the trees) where I laid till water was brought and thrown on me, when I immediately recovered, and was enabled to riſe. I then proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eded, the ſubject opened to me, and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023401_0050_0FBF591484BC4F90"/>we had a ſolemn ſeaſon. On Monday I had a ſevere conflict about attending the conference. The exerciſe of my mind was too great for my emaciated frame. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took myſelf to my bed and lay till twelve o'clock, and then roſe up, and ſet off. I got into Baltimore about ſun-ſet. The confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was to begin the next day: I attended, paſſed through an examination, and was admitted on trial: and my name was, for the firſt time, claſſed among the Methodiſts; and I received of Mr. T. R. a written li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe. My mind continued ſo agitated (for I ſtill felt an unwillingneſs to be a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling preacher) that after I went from the preaching-houſe to dinner, I again fainted under my burden, and ſunk to the floor. When I recovered, I found myſelf in an upper chamber on the bed, ſurrounded by ſeveral preachers; I aſked, "where I had been," and ſeemed to be loſt to all things below, appearing to have been in a place from whence I did not deſire to return: the brethren joined in prayer, my ſoul was ſo happy, and every thing wore ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an aſpect, that the preachers appeared more like angels to me than men. And I have bleſſed my dear Lord ever ſince, that
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023401_0051_0FBF591BE57C9A78"/>I was ever united to this happy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; though unworthy of a ſeat among them.</p>

            <p>I WAS appointed to travel in the Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric circuit with Mr. R. and as the conference ended on Friday, I ſet out and got as far as Mr. W—n's, and the next day got into my circuit. I preached on the Lord's-day with very little freedom, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to my own ſoul: the enemy ſtill purſued me, throwing in his fiery darts. At times. I had ſweet communion with my dear Lord; but a conſciouſneſs of my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inability for the great work in which I had engaged, cauſed my hands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hang down. I was a young ſoldier, and knew but little about exerciſing the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian armour. The goodneſs of God was great to me, in opening the hearts of the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023401_0052_0FBF591CB50BB258"/>people to receive and bear with my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p>One day on my way to my appointment, the difficulties appeared ſo great, that I turned my horſe, three different times, homeward. I was in a ſolitary wood, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely alone; I wept, and mourned, and prayed at the feet of my Lord, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to go forward: I did, and a ſweet and powerful meeting we had. Sometimes when I have been at the appointed place, and the people aſſembling, I have been tempted to hide myſelf, or wiſh that I was ſick; at other times I have envied the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of crawling inſects on the face of the earth; and I have conſtantly found, that the greater croſs it was to ſpeak for God, the greater was the bleſſing, both to myſelf and the people. In ſimilar caſes, I ſeldom open<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d my mouth to ſpeak in public, but what the power of the Lord was ſenſibly felt. My Bible, at particular times, would appear ſo ſmall that I could not find a text. I remember one day, a congregation was gathered, and I was alone, under deep ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; and it appeared as if there was not one verſe in the Bible that I could ſpeak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but all on a ſudden, whilſt I was on
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023401_0053_0FBF591E531986C0"/>my knees before the Lord, the following text was powerfully applied: <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach glad tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound.</hi> Iſaiah lxi. 1. I immediately met the aſſembly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinging and prayer, gave out the text, and the power of God deſcended in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner. Before this, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſo hardened, that we had no more than four members; but before I left the houſe, twenty, who ſeemed to be that day broken in heart, were added to the ſociety: and we continued ſinging and praying till near ſunſet, and there appeared to be very ſew in the congregation whoſe hearts were not touched; my voice being almoſt loſt in the cries of the diſtreſſed. O! bleſſed be God! this was a day of marrow and fat things to my poor heart.</p>
            <p>Some time after I was requeſted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a watch-night, and I conſented. Mr. R. was diſpleaſed that I had not conſulted him; but I was innocent, knowing very little of the diſcipline. Many people came together, and many of the children of the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:023401_0054_0FBF5927FA2573C8"/>devil were angry and ſtoned the houſe; but our dear Lord was powerfully preſent. God's people had a little paradiſe; and I truſt there were ſeveral new-born ſouls, and ſome poor ſinners brought to tremble. I can truly ſay it was a great time with me.</p>
            <p>I continued ſix months in this circuit: and bleſſed be God! many were added to the ſociety; his children much quickened; and many happily brought into the kingdom of grace. My heart was cloſely united to the people, and they were remarkably kind to me, all around the circuit. I thought it a great favor to be received as a preacher: and I verily believe the Lord inclined the hearts of the people to overlook my many weakneſſes and want of knowledge; and, for the ſake of his dear Son, he in a ſmall meaſure owned my efforts. To his honor be it ſpoken.</p>
            <p>I think it was in November I was ſent to Fairfax circuit, where I ſtaid three months. I had many happy moments, and preached the goſpel with freedom. I cannot ſay I met with much ſucceſs, neither was I ſo powerfully haraſſed by the devil. I was now better acquainted with his devices; and, I truſt, had a more ſteady confidence in my
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:023401_0055_0FBF592979897630"/>dear Saviour. I began to preach the word more freely, and was not ſo eaſily ſhaken with reſpect to my call to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: and I was now entirely willing to be a travelling preacher: and bleſſed be God! he gave me favor in the ſight of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>As there were many doors open for us in New Virginia, and ſeveral ſmall ſocieties formed, Mr. R. thought it expedient to ſend me into thoſe parts of the country; and bleſſed be my God! I found a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to go any where, and to do any thing that would bring moſt honor and ſervice to the church of God. I bleſs and praiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Lord for his goodneſs to me during my ſtay in that part of his vineyard, for he wonderfully enlarged my deſires after him; and increaſed my gifts, and opened the hearts and houſes of the people to receive his ſervant and his wood. And many were added to the ſociety.</p>
            <p>I viſited Shepherd's town, lying high up on the Patowmac river. On the Lord's-day I attended the church, and heard their miniſter preach on <hi>Keep holy the Sabbath-day.</hi> He was a ſlow-ſpoken man, and I think his diſcourſe took up fifteen minutes.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:023401_0056_0FBF592AF0035220"/>He ſaid there was no harm in civil amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on a week-day; but they ought to refrain from them on the Sabbath. I had no doubt but his diſcourſe was his own compoſition. I do not remember a word about the fall of man, faith, or repentance. I aſked liberty, and went up into the pulpit after him, and gave out, <hi>How ſhall we eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Heb. ii. 3. After I had done, one of his hearers aſked him what he thought of the doctrine the ſtranger had delivered? Why, ſaid he, he ſeems to bring ſcripture to prove it; it may be ſo, but if it is, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it.</p>
            <p>I preached every other Sunday in church, during my ſtay in this new circuit; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the fourth ſermon there were as many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as could crowd into the building. There was a great agitation among the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the word took ſuch effect on the heart of a woman, that ſhe cried ſo loud for mercy as to make the church ring: the people, being unacquainted with ſuch things, ſtrove to get out; but the aiſles, and every place were ſo crowded, that they could not, unleſs they had firſt given way at the doors. In a few minutes the Lord ſet her ſoul at
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:023401_0057_0FBF592C6F59D380"/>liberty. She clapped her hands in an ecſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy of joy, praiſed the Lord, and then ſat down quietly. The whole congregation ſeemed to be loſt in amazement, and the divine preſence appeared to run through the whole houſe: moſt of the people were melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into tears. The Preſbyterian miniſter was among the crowd, and moſt of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation came to hear what the babbler had to ſay. This man with his deacon I met on the road a few days after. "I was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you preach," ſaid he, "and I did not like your doctrine." What was your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſaid I. "Why it was a volley of ſtuff." Well, ſaid I, if the Lord makes uſe of it to bring ſouls to himſelf, I wiſh to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> thankful and ſatisfied. "You preach per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection," ſaid he, "and that I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be attainable in this life." Then ſaid I, you do not hold with the doctrine of our Lord and his apoſtles; our Lord ſays, <hi>he ye perfect as your Father in heaven is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> and the apoſtle ſays, <hi>the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi> When a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> we to be made perfect? "Not till death," ſaid he. Our Lord, ſaid I, <hi>came to deſtroy the works of the devil;</hi> and do you ſuppoſe he will call death to his aſſiſtance? Death in ſcripture
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023401_0058_0FBF5934A28DDB10"/>is called the laſt enemy, and we learn, that as death leaves us, judgment will find us; and that there is no knowledge or work in the grave. <hi>And if we die in our ſins, where the Lord is, we cannot come:</hi> I want to know how death is to bring this work about. "Why," ſaid he, "at the article of death, ſin is done away, and not till then." Then firſt, you muſt hold with a death purgatory, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a purgatory after death, or thirdly, a ſalvation from all ſin in this world. The Papiſts ſay, we muſt be refined by the fire of purgatory: The Univerſalians ſay, that the laſt farthing will be paid in hell; and you ſay, nay, death will do it: but we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the doctrine of the holy ſcriptures, and ſay, that <hi>his name ſhall be called Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> Do you not, ſaid I, believe that the Lord is able to waſh and cleanſe the ſoul from all ſin one minute before death? He agreed at laſt that it might be a minute before death. And if a minute, why not a day, a month, yea, why not ſeven years? The apoſtle ſaith, <hi>behold, now is the accepted time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="60" facs="unknown:023401_0059_0FBF5935D8F878A8"/>and ſo ſaying turned their backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me.</p>
            <p>A few evenings after, I preached near his houſe, and he and his deacon were preſent again; a precious, ſweet ſeaſon we had; a great ſhaking among ſinners, and I expect the heart of the miniſter was alſo ſoftened. He came to me after ſermon, and aſked my pardon if he had ſaid any thing amiſs.</p>
            <p>Glory to God, he enabled me to travel largely through that country during my ſtay there; and preach one, two, three, and ſometimes four ſermons a day. The laſt ſermon I preached was from <hi>Finally, brethren, farewell, &amp;c.</hi> This was a time not ſoon to be forgotten. A large congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſeemed to drink in every word; ſuch attention was given, and ſo much of the divine preſence felt, that I continued near three hours, and then the people hung around me in ſuch a manner that I could ſcarcely get from them, begging me with tears not to leave them.</p>
            <p>I rode about ten miles and preached to a number of people in a meadow ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mountains; and I do believe good was done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:023401_0060_0FBF5936F286B910"/>
Having an invitation, I went to the houſe of an old Quaker; and in the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my departure had family prayer; the Lord touched the hearts of both the old people and their children; for they were in tears, and entreated me to return that way again.</p>
            <p>I attended quarterly meeting in Fairfax, and met Mr. T. R. with ſeveral others, who were on their way to the conference, which was held at Deer-creek. During this year.

My appointment was much to my mind, and I had a lively hope that my dear Lord would be with me, and bleſs my weak endeavours to promote his cauſe.</p>
            <p>We travelled ſeveral days before we met any Methodiſts; but my dear Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended us, for we had happy times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and had an opportunity of preaching ſeveral ſermons before we reached our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit: we had a ſweet ſeaſon at the houſe of a good old man; and I think we were providentially ſent thither, not only for the benefit of the family, but likewiſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others.</p>

I told him God had taught me better than to uſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weapons againſt the lives of human creatures. He intimated ſomething about ſtopping me. I told him I was not afraid of man—that if he did not learn to fight with other weapons he would go to hell.</p>
            <p>On Sunday the eighth of June, I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at brother I—'s to many ſerious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. While I was pointing out the goſpel-ſalvation, there was a ſhout in the camp of Iſrael; and after the meeting ended there was a rejoicing among the people. I met the ſociety, and was more than ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:023401_0063_0FBF5942433ABC88"/>in my belief, that the Lord had ſent me into that part of his vineyard. I there met with a black boy that was happy in the Lord; and I thought he exceeded all the youths that ever I ſaw for a gift and power in prayer.</p>
            <p>Monday June the 9th, I preached a few miles off, from thoſe words, <hi>Looſe him and let him go.</hi> There were as many people as the houſe could contain. And after preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near two hours, the cries of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly were ſo great that I gave over. The people continued together a long time after, and I doubt not but ſeveral were ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. O Jeſus! thou ſtill increaſeſt my faith; thou giveſt me lively ſenſations of thy pardoning love; and that thou haſt called me to the miniſtry of thy bleſſed word. At this meeting we were ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully drawn out that we knew not when to part, having ſeldom felt the like. The next day I had great freedom to preach, and one ſoul was born of God.</p>
            <p>Thurſday June 12, I found much eaſe in preaching at Dr. C—r's to an attentive, ſolemn congregation; but not very lively. I rode to Col. T—r's, and met brother E. P. We held a watch-night, and I
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:023401_0064_0FBF5943B1E694F8"/>think I never had more freedom to ſpeak. The word was bleſſed to the colonel and his family, and they treate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> me ever after more like a ſon than a ſtranger; yea, I I may ſay, more like an angel than a poor clod of earth. And I, on my part, ſhall ever reſpect them for their kindneſs to me.</p>
            <p>The next day I again croſſed the Roan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oak river, and had great liberty to preach from theſe words, <hi>For lo, the winter is paſt, the rain is over and gone, the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the ſinging of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land, &amp;c.</hi> After this, we had a love-feaſt, and many ſpake freely of the goodneſs of God. In this place the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wanted to gain me with their kindneſs; but I refuſed their obliging offers, being convinced I ſhould do more good in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering up and down the earth without any incumbrances; and as for riches, I had enough to ſerve my purpoſes. The temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was conſiderable, and pleaſing to nature. Vain world, away with your flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery! I could rejoice in my God, with the teſtimony of a good conſcience, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the oblation was made for the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023401_0065_0FBF59456EBB0340"/>good of Chriſt's church, which he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his own blood. It was no time to think of houſes and land, &amp;c. I paſſed on, rejoicing in God my Saviour, and was greatly encouraged in the bleſſed work. But halcyon days did not always attend me. For again I experienced the ſevere buffetings of Satan; but my exerciſes proved a bleſſing to me, for my ſoul was humbled, and I was made in a meaſure ſenſible of the need of a deeper work of grace on my heart, before I could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely happy.</p>
            <p>Sunday June 22d, in Roanoak chapel I preached to about five hundred whites, and almoſt as many blacks who ſtood without; I found freedom of mind, and tears trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down the faces of many, both white and black. And the next day while I was preaching a funeral ſermon, we had much of the divine preſence. In this way I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued around the circuit, till the quarterly meeting, which was held in Auguſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="67" facs="unknown:023401_0066_0FBF594DA252A2E8"/>walk and heavenly converſation, I was much ſtirred up to ſeek a deeper work of grace; eſpecially by the experience of ſiſter B—. I believed there was ſuch a thing as perfect love to be attained in this world; and I likewiſe knew I was not in poſſeſſion of it: I ſaw a beauty in the doctrine, and preached it, but it was at a diſtance.</p>
            <p>About this time the ſtate-oath began to be adminiſtered, and was univerſally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, both by preachers and people where I was; but I could by no means be ſubject to my rulers in this reſpect, as it touched my conſcience towards God: ſo I was informed I muſt either leave the ſtate, take the oath, or go to gaol. I told thoſe who came to tender the oath to me, that I profeſſed myſelf a friend to my country: that I would do nothing willingly or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to the prejudice of it: that if they required it, I would give them good ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my friendly behaviour during my ſtay in the ſtate. "But why," ſaid they, "will you not take the oath?" "I think," ſaid I, "the oath is too binding on my conſcience; moreover, I never ſwor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:023401_0067_0FBF594EEF6531A8"/>want, in all things, to keep a conſcience void of offence, to walk in the ſafeſt way, and to do all the good I can in bringing ſinners to God."</p>
            <p>Many of my friends endeavoured to perſuade me to comply; alleging, that I might be more uſeful among the people: but it was to no purpoſe. The rulers ſaid, "You muſt leave the ſtate." This I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do; for, firſt, the conference appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to labor in this ſtate: and in the ſecond place, I am confident that my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment is approved of by my heavenly Father; and therefore, I dare not leave the ſtate. "Then," ſaid they, "you muſt away to priſon." That matter, I replied, I leave to the God of Daniel; aſſured he is able to defend my cauſe; whether in or out of gaol.</p>
            <p>The many trials I had on this occaſion drove me nearer to God, and as many thought that every ſermon would be my laſt, many more attended than otherwiſe would; and I found much freedom to preach the word; and good was done: I alſo found a great degree of ſweetneſs in my dear Saviour, for great was his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me.</p>

               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:023401_0068_0FBF59508B2A6218"/>
At a certain place ſeveral of the rulers bound themſelves to put me to gaol, when I came that way again: my friends perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to decline going <hi>there;</hi> but I told them I could not be clear if I diſtruſted ſo good a God. Before I came round to that place, the Lord laid his afflicting hand on ſome of thoſe ruling men who had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to impriſon me; ſo that when I went there, ſeveral of them had already made their exit off the ſtage of human action: and another was lying at the point of death. I preached with much freedom, but there was none to lay the hand of violence upon me; though I had been chaſed for ſeveral months before: and the perſecution from this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entirely ſubſided during my ſtay in the ſtate. In this circuit I met with a number of inward and outward trials; but I bleſs God, that ever he ſent me into this part of his vineyard: for I can truly ſay, that the life and converſation of many of my worthy friends (ſome of whom were older in the grace of God than myſelf) were made a great bleſſing to me. O! how ſhall I make ſuitable returns to my God for the thouſands of his favors.</p>

In September I went to North-Carolina, to travel Roanoak circuit, and was ſweetly drawn out in the glorious work, though my exerciſes were very great, particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſlavery and hard uſage of the poor afflicted negroes. Many times did my heart ache on their account, and many tears ran down my cheeks, both in Virginia and Carolina, while exhibiting a crucified Jeſus to their view; and I bleſs God that my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors were not in vain among them. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured frequently to inculcate the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of freedom in a private way, and this procured me the ill will of ſome, who were in that unmerciful practice. I would often ſet apart times to preach to the blacks, and adapt my diſcourſe to them alone; and precious moments have I had; while ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their ſable faces were bedewed with tears, their withered hands of ſaith were ſtretched out, and their precious ſouls made white in the blood of the Lamb. The ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of thoſe poor out-caſts of men, through the bleſſing of God, drove them near to the Lord, and many of them were amazingly happy.</p>
            <p>Reſpecting Chriſtian perfection, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſuch a thing to be attainable in this
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:023401_0070_0FBF595A8F6350D8"/>life, and in public and private contended for it, and had often felt the need of it in my own ſoul: but I never had ſuch a view of it in my life as in this circuit. My dear Lord, in a very powerful and ſudden man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, gave me to ſee and feel the need of this bleſſed work. Every heart-corruption was diſcovered to me by the bleſſed Spirit, at the houſe of that dear afflicted mother in Iſrael Mrs. Y. I have had many ſweet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with that precious family; but ſhe has ſince gone to Abraham's boſom. This diſcovery was made to me while I was alone in the preachers' room. I expected in a few moments to be in eternity; and the cry of my heart was, Lord, ſave me from inbred ſin. The purity of God, heaven, and the law, with the impurity of my heart, were ſo diſcloſed to my view, that I was humbled in the very duſt; and expected ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to enter into the kingdom of heaven: without a greater likeneſs to my dear Lord. I rejoiced that the cold hand of death was not upon me; for I ſaw with my bodily eyes a ghoſtly appearance, which in a few moments vaniſhed away. And for more than a week, an earneſt ſtruggle con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in my heart for all the mind which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:023401_0071_0FBF595BC40F42C8"/>Chriſt. My appointments were made, or I am apprehenſive I ſhould have declined preaching ſo pure a goſpel, till the heart-corruptions which I felt were waſhed away. The enemy ſtrove very hard to rob me of my confidence; but although I was at times brought very low, yet I did not let go my hold of the dear Redeemer, the witneſs of my juſtification, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>One day, I went to my appointment, and whilſt the people were gathering, I withdrew about a quarter of a mile from the houſe, and wreſtled with the Lord in prayer; and thought I could not meet the congregation, unleſs I was delivered from my inbred chains. However, after the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had waited about an hour, I went to the houſe, but my ſtruggle ſeemed to be at the height. I thought I would pray with the people and diſmiſs them. After pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er my Lord gave me this text, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart; for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Never had I ſuch freedom before that time, to deſcribe 1ſt. the impurity of the heart: 2dly. how it is to be purified: and 3dly. the bleſſing conſequent thereon—That they ſhall ſee God. While I was ſpeaking of the travail of a ſoul for purity, all my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:023401_0072_0FBF595D4EE589A0"/>diſtreſs vaniſhed; and I felt a little heaven on earth. I know that the Lord deepened his work; but I did not claim the witneſs; yet my ſoul was happy from day to day.</p>
            <p>From this time I began to preach the doctrine of Chriſtian perfection more than ever; the plan ſeemed as clear to me as the noon-day ſun. And many were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the need of it; and ſome were brought into the perfect liberty of God's children.
<note n="*" place="bottom">What is this perfection? It is not the perfection of God, or angels, nor the perfection of Adam in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, but it is Chriſtian perfection. It conſiſts in the extirpation of all ſin, in having the powers and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart purified, and the whole ſoul filled with divine love. 2d. How is this bleſſing to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? As we are juſtified by faith, ſo are we ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by faith. 1. We are convinced of the need of it. 2. In common there is a ſweet diſtreſs, but no guilt or condemnation. 3. We muſt by faith receive the promiſes. Repentance diſclaims all help in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. Faith lays claim to all the help in Chriſt. Repentance ſays, I can do nothing. Faith ſays, <hi>Through Chriſt Jeſus ſtrengthening me I can do all things.</hi>
               </note> The word of our dear Lord proſpered in the circuit; and ſome of the children of Belial were ſtirred up to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute. One day a very wicked man came into the houſe while I was preaching; he
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:023401_0073_0FBF595EB1DF74C0"/>ſuppoſed my diſcourſe pointed at him; and ſtood for a conſiderable time, ſwelling and threatening in his heart that he would haul me down and beat me. But before the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was ended, he gave heed to the things delivered, and a ſpirit of conviction took hold of his heart; ſo that before he left the houſe he profeſſed juſtifying faith; and I truſt became a changed man.</p>
            <p>I then went to the houſe of a Chriſtian man, whoſe brother was a violent perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and lived next door. Whilſt I was a family prayer in the evening, he ran over with a loaded gun, and ſtood with it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented for a conſiderable time; but had not power to draw the trigger. A few days after, he was in a rage with his brother o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> account of his receiving the preaching; ſhot at him, and ſlightly wounded his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. I was very thankful I eſcaped him.</p>
            <p>In this circuit there was a bleſſed gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for good; during my ſtay ſinners were convinced and converted, and at the ſpring quarterly meeting we had ſome lively wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of perfect love; and others greatly moved to ſeek after that deep work of grace. Glory to God! I can ſay I had many bleſſed, happy moments while tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:023401_0074_0FBF596722662700"/>the Virginia and Carolina foreſts, endeavouring to gather poor loſt ſouls to my dear Redeemer's fold. And it did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice my heart to ſee them flocking after him.</p>
            <p>I have often thought, that the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions afforded me were an ample compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for all the difficulties and trials I met with in wandering up and down through an ill-natured world. And I often reflect and bewail my backwardneſs, when I firſt entered ſo unwillingly as a laborer into my Lord's vineyard. But now, thanks to his dear name, I go willingly; and deſire cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obey all his commandments, and do all the little good I can to promote his honor and glory.</p>
            <p>In May, I left the people to whom I found myſelf cloſely united, and in whoſe ſight the Lord gave me great favor; and ſet out for the Leeſburgh conference.</p>

            </head>
            <p>WE had a comfortable conference in Leeſburgh, and May 20, 1778, I ſet out for my deſtined place. After preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few ſermons, and viſiting my old friends and relations, on the 30th of May I croſſed the Cheſapeak; and in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had a delightful opportunity of preſſing the neceſſity of holineſs on the minds of many. Bleſſed be God! there was a ſhout in the camp among our bleſſed Saviour's deſpiſed followers. And I have no doubt but that my Lord directed my lot into this part of the work.</p>
            <p>On Sunday I ſpoke in Kent preaching<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe with much liberty; and we had a ſweet, refreſhing ſeaſon. This was the firſt Methodiſt preaching-houſe that was built on this ſhore. In the evening I was much drawn out in prayer and ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and felt the ſweet beams of the bleſſed Spirit, and experienced the bliſs of prayer, with a comfortable hope that my
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023401_0076_0FBF596B001CA020"/>dear Lord had deepened his work of grace in my heart. Four preachers were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by conference for the Peninſula— Brothers H. L. C and myſelf. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of ſouls had ſtirred up a great perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Methodiſts. Brother H. was taken by the rulers, and put in confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Brother L. thought it his duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Virginia. And poor brother C. was too unwell to travel much: ſo that for a conſiderable time I was left almoſt alone.</p>
            <p>To human appearance our proſpects were gloomy. In this place what was called a tory company embodied themſelves, and a backſliding Methodiſt was at the head of them. It was ſoon circulated through the country that the Methodiſts were enemies to the American cauſe: and were embody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to meet the Engliſh army. A ſhort time before this, the Engliſh preachers had embarked for Europe; and the conduct of Mr. R. had been very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the perſecuted flock: ſo that the cloud which aroſe in the Eaſt, grew very dark. During this time, dear Mr. F. A. found an aſylum at the houſe of good old judge W. and I believe none but the Lord and himſelf knew what he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:023401_0077_0FBF5971A32CAF38"/>for near twelve months. And we have ſince ſeen the hand of the Lord in his preſervation and continuation among us. I am ſure if the Lord had not been on our ſide, we ſhould have been torn to pieces by our enemies. My exerciſes of mind were very great, and my friends in Kent, on every ſide, entreated me to ſtay among them; and not to travel at large at the hazard of my life. I was ready at firſt to conſent, but had not ſtaid more than a week among them, when my ſpirit was ſtirred within me, and I cried earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Lord to know his will. I felt an impulſe to go; that he would ſtand by me, and defend my cauſe. And I received ſuch a deep ſenſe of God on my heart, and ſuch precious promiſes of his parental care over me, that I took leave of my Kent friends, and ſet out without any dread of my worſt enemies. I then travelled largely through the country, preaching once, twice, three, and ſometimes four times a day, to liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multitudes bathed in tears.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſoon forget the 24th of June, 1778. O what a wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing of hands among ſinners, and crying for mercy! God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple praiſing him from a ſenſe of his divine
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:023401_0078_0FBF5973B052D1B0"/>preſence powerfully felt. O how did my heart rejoice in my dear Saviour! I went through Cecil and part of the Delaware ſtate. A precious flame was kindled in many hearts, and many were brought to enquire what they ſhould do to be ſaved. I viſited Mr. F. A. at Mr. W.'s, and found him very unwell. I had a ſweet opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of preaching at Mr. W.'s. After ſome agreeable converſation with Mr. F. A. I went on to Maryland, and had much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in preaching to our perſecuted friends in Queen Ann.</p>
            <p>In this place they threatened to impriſon me; but as they did not take me in the public congregation, I concluded they did not intend to lay hands on me: however, the next day, as I was going to Kent, John B. met me on the road (he was formerly judge in that county.) When I came near him, he made a full ſtop as if he wanted ſomething; apprehending nothing, I ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and enquired the diſtance to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town: his reply was, You muſt go to gaol: and inſtantly took hold of my horſe's bridle. I deſired him in the Lord's name to take care what he was about to do: aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him I was on the Lord's errand, and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:023401_0079_0FBF597531FC4F78"/>requeſting him to ſhew his authority for his proceedings. With that, he alighted from his horſe, and taking a large ſtick that lay in the way, for ſome time beat me with it over the head and ſhoulders. Not being far from his quarter, he called aloud for help. I ſaw ſeveral perſons, as I thought, with a rope, running to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Providentially, at this moment he let go my bridle; had not this been the caſe, it is probable they would have put an end to my life: for the beaſts of the field ſeemed to be in the utmoſt rage. I thought the way was now open for my eſcape; and being on an excellent horſe, I gave him the whip, and got a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before he could mount; but he, knowing the way better than myſelf, took a nearer rout, and came in upon me with a full ſtrain; and as he paſſed, ſtruck at me with all his might; my horſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately made a full ſtop, my ſaddle turned, and I fell with force upon the ground, with my face within an inch of a ſharp log. The blows I had received, together with my fall and bruiſes, deprived me of my ſenſes. Providentially, at this time, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man paſſed by with a lancet. I was taken
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:023401_0080_0FBF597BE7D5FB98"/>into a houſe not far diſtant, and bled; by which I was reſtored to my ſenſes, but it was not expected I had many minutes to live. My affliction was good for me; and I can confidently ſay, nothing induced me to wiſh to ſtay any longer in this world, but the thirſt I had for the ſalvation of my fellow-creatures. The heavens, in a very glorious manner, ſeemed to be open; and by faith I ſaw my dear Redeemer ſtanding at the right-hand of the Father, pleading my cauſe; and the Father ſmiling, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to my poor ſoul.</p>
            <p>I was ſo happy I could ſcarce contain myſelf. My enemy was walking to and fro, in great agitation, wiſhing he had not moleſted me. I had a heart to pray for him, and deſired him to ſit down by me and to read ſuch and ſuch chapters. He did ſo; I told him if he did not experience that bleſſed work he would ſurely go to hell. I ſaid, if the Lord ſhould take me away, I had a witneſs within me that I ſhould go to heaven; and that I had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purely for the ſake of our Lord's bleſſed goſpel; and that I freely forgave him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and entreated him to ſeek the ſalvation of his ſoul, and never again perſecute the followers
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023401_0081_0FBF597D08643180"/>of our Lord. The poor, unhappy man did not know which way to look. "I will take you in my carriage," ſaid he, "wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you want to go." When he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I was likely to recover, he went to a magiſtrate, who was nearly as bitter againſt us as himſelf, and brought him to me.</p>
            <p>They both appeared as if the enemy was in them. With a ſtern look the magiſtrate demanded my name: I told him; and he took out his pen and ink, and began to write a mittimus to commit me to gaol. Pray, ſir, ſaid I, are you a juſtice of the peace? He replied he was: why then, ſaid I, do you ſuffer men to behave in this manner? If ſuch perſons are not taken notice of, a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can with no degree of ſafety travel the road. "You have," ſaid he, "broken the law." How do you know that? anſwered I; but ſuppoſe I have, was this the way to put the law in force againſt me? I am an inhabitant of, and have property in this ſtate; and if I miſtake not, the law ſays, for the firſt offence the ſine is five pounds, and double for every offence after. The grand crime was preaching the goſpel of our dear Lord and Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, in which I greatly rej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice. My enemy,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:023401_0082_0FBF597E461622D0"/>ſaid I, conducted himſelf more like a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman, than a perſon enforcing a law in a Chriſtian country. Be well aſſured, this matter will be brought to light, ſaid I, in an awful eternity. He dropped his pen, and made no further attempt to ſend me to priſon. By this time the woman who bled me, came with a carriage; and I found myſelf able to riſe from my bed, and give an exhortation to the magiſtrate and my perſecutor, and the others who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>I rode to the houſe of old brother D. and preached my dear Maſter's goſpel, with much delight, in the evening, to a few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed diſciples, as I ſat in the bed, from theſe words, <hi>In me ye ſhall have peace, in the world ye ſhall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world.</hi> John xvi. 33.</p>
            <p>I can truly ſay, what I ſuffered was for my good, and I think it was rendered a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the people around: for the work of the Lord was carried on in a bleſſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and I met with very little perſecution in that county afterwards. (Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I preached the funeral ſermon of the wife of the above magiſtrate, and he was
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:023401_0083_0FBF597FB115B450"/>very much moved.) In the morning I awoke about four, and deſired the friend of the houſe, if poſſible, to prepare a carriage for me by ſix; as I had a long way to go and to preach twice. But being diſappointed in getting a conveyance; though ſcarce able to turn in my bed, by body being ſo bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I looked to the Lord for help, which was granted with ſweet conſolation. I mounted my horſe about ſeven o'clock, and rode about fifteen miles, and preached at eleven o'clock. O! what a nearneſs I had to my dear Lord, while I held up a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Jeſus to upwards of five hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons! My face bruiſed, ſcarred, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with tears! the people were for the moſt part much affected. I rode after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ten miles further, and preached to hundreds with great freedom. O! how ſweet my dear Saviour was to me! I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if I could have died for him.</p>
            <p>After a few days reſpite, I went to the place where I was beaten, and found that the perſecuting ſpirit had in a meaſure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided; and that my way was ſurpriſingly opened. I had many hearers, and the word was much bleſſed to many ſouls. The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the hearts of many was, Surely this muſt be the right way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:023401_0084_0FBF5987EAFCAF38"/>
The Lord was very kind to me in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſcovery, in a viſion of the night, of the things I was to paſs through; and they came to paſs juſt as they were made known to me.</p>
            <p>From Queen Ann's, I again travelled through the Delaware ſtate, and had many bleſſed opportunities of inforcing the truth on the attentive multitudes that flocked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from various quarters. In the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Mr. S. the people had been deprived of the privilege of hearing for ſome time, and when I went among them, I found them hungering for the word. I preached from, <hi>Who is ſhe that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the ſun, and terrible as an army with banners?</hi> Solomon's Song vi. 10. I was ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully drawn out, and my ſpirit ſo taken up with divine things, that I almoſt thought myſelf in heaven; and many of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted children of God ſeemed as if they would take wings and fly away. O! it was a great day for an awakening power! and the love-feaſt was remarkable for the ſanctifying operations of the bleſſed Spirit. Many of our happy friends came from afar, and returned with their hearts all on fire
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023401_0085_0FBF59890D467FA0"/>for God. Many happy moments have I had among thoſe loving followers of our dear Lord.</p>
            <p>Sunday July 19, I viſited and preached to the people of Maſhey Hope. I was ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempted of the devil all the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preaching; he ſtrove to deſtroy or weaken my faith. I was afraid I ſhould not be a means of doing any good. I wept and mourned in ſecret at my dear Lord's feet, and ſenſibly felt the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and as if I never had a commiſſion to preach the everlaſting goſpel. There was an unexpected congregation. And ſhortly after I ſtood up before the people, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and unbelief fled; and I gave out, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi> Heb. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 3. The word ran through all the congregation, and there was a great ſhaking among the people. Among the reſt, a woman was ſtruck, and cried aloud for mercy, till ſhe fell to the ground. Her huſband was much offended, and I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that he threatened me, as he ſaid, for killing his wife. After ſermon I ſpent ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in praying for, and comforting the diſtreſſed. In the afternoon, accompanied by many, I rode four miles, and preached,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:023401_0086_0FBF598A3A490928"/>from <hi>Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?</hi> and I found myſelf greatly at liberty. In this place a few months ago, the people were faſt aſleep, but now many are awaking up, and ſeveral united to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
            <p>After travelling and preaching with great freedom and ſucceſs in the Delaware ſtate, I was brought on my way in the heat of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Talbot county, in Maryland, where I labored for about two weeks night and day with tears. Many ſouls were refreſhed, and I thought it good for me to be there. Many ſweet refreſhing ſeaſons had I among thoſe dear <hi>loving</hi> people: I ſhall not ſoon forget thoſe mothers in Iſrael, ſiſter P. and ſiſter B. who are now lodged in Abraham's boſom. They, I truſt, lived and died wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of perfect love.</p>
            <p>In this place the people, eſpecially the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, were much alarmed, and ſtirred up by an uncommon voice, which was heard three evenings ſucceſſively; and the laſt time ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reputable perſons were preſent. While they were at prayer, it exhorted them to pray mightily; and when one aſked who it was, it replied, "I am a good ſpirit." The laſt time of its appearance, it ſeemed to be
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:023401_0087_0FBF598BB0FA6BF0"/>aſcending. At the next quarterly-meeting, a man who was awakened by it, aroſe and ſpoke powerfully, and ſaid, "Curioſity that day brought me out, but I was cut to the heart, and reſted not till I found peace to my ſoul:" of this fact I entertain no doubts.</p>
            <p>In Auguſt I left Talbot, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by ſeveral friends went to Kent Iſland. I preached frequently to a very gay high-minded people, with freedom. An admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable change for the better has ſince taken place in that iſland. From thence I attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Auguſt quarterly-meeting in Kent, but had none to aſſiſt me except a few lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſpeakers; but the Lord was powerfully preſent, both in public worſhip and at the love-feaſt. The hearts of many were glad, and I ſpake freely and feelingly of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</p>
            <p>I cannot help thinking the circumſtance I am going to relate very remarkable. One day after meeting, my brother John came up to me and ſhock hands; and looking me very wiſhfully in the face, without any caution ſaid, "I ſhall never ſee you again in this world." And it was even ſo; for by the time I got round as far as Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:023401_0088_0FBF5993E0A68540"/>was taken very ill; and a few hours before I got to his houſe, he was interred on the Eaſt ſide of the preaching-houſe; where he bid me his laſt farewell, not more than two weeks before. He was my ſecond ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſon; and there was an uncommon inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy between us. His diſſolution was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him a long time before he died. An eminent phyſician was with him the evening before his death and his wife ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low to the doctor, enquired how ſoon he ſuppoſed he would die; he told her he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended he would not ſtay till the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He over-hearing them, ſaid, "Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, I ſhall not go till eight o'clock in the morning." He was a leader of three claſſes, and beloved by all the people of God; and ſpent much of his time in the public and private exerciſes of religion. He had his ſenſes perfectly in his laſt moments, and his exhortation which he gave was ſtriking. After exhorting his wife and a brother who lived with him, to ſtand faſt in the faith; and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſervant to love the Lord; in a very affecting manner he ſaid, "Now there is but one thing which lies heavy on my mind, and that is, the caſe of two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:023401_0089_0FBF599731E8F658"/>brothers. "Tell them," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, "from me, I never expect to ſee them in heaven" (they lived on the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſhore) "unleſs they repent, and turn to the Lord." This he ſaid to my brother Richard. Not long after they heard the meſſage, they ſought and found the Lord. Thus were his prayers anſwered. At eight o'clock, as he ſaid, he reſigned his ſpirit to his God, a witneſs of perfect love.</p>
            <p>In September 1778, I again returned to Delaware; and on the 5th for the firſt time, preached at Mr. W.'s in Muſkmelon, a kind man who had been a Quaker. I had for ſeveral days ſuffered deep exerciſes of mind, eſpecially while on my way to this place. The devil wanted to perſuade me, the Lord was a hard maſter: and the whole Sabbath morning I was ſorely tempted. This appointment was made for Mr. F. A. which cauſed my trial to be greater. At the meeting there were between five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and a thouſand people; many of whom came out of curioſity. I preached under a large ſpreading tree; but the wind being high, I concluded to preach the ſecond ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the houſe; but the houſe could not contain near half the people. I gave out, <hi>One
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:023401_0090_0FBF599882AFB6B0"/>thing I know, whereas I was blind now I ſee.</hi> Glory to God! Jeſus makes uſe of clay, in this our day to open the eyes of the blind. While I was in the firſt place deſcribing the blindneſs of the human mind, my dear Lord diſplayed his almighty power. There was a great weeping and mourning among poor ſinners: I likewiſe felt much happineſs, while deſcribing the Lord's method in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners to himſelf, and in ſhewing the bleſſed privileges they enjoy. How many were convinced at this meeting, and how many converted, I will not undertake to ſay; but I believe the number of both was great. I ſhall take notice of one inſtance of the power of God at this meeting. A man noted for wickedneſs, came curſing and ſwearing (as he has ſince told me.) But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt head of the diſcourſe, his ſins fell, as it were, with the weight of a mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone on him, and ſtared him in the face. "I would," ſaid he, "have run out; but I was afraid to put one foot before the other, leſt I ſhould drop into hell, for the pit was diſcloſed to my view; and I ſaw no way to eſcape it: I thought every minute I ſhould fall; but I held myſelf up by the chair. Oh!" ſaid he, "under the ſecond head of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:023401_0091_0FBF599A36603A20"/>your diſcourſe, while you were holding up Chriſt, I ſaw a beauty in him; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dependance on myſelf, I caſt my ſoul on Jeſus; and in a moment the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fell, and my ſoul was happy; and I went home rejoicing in my Saviour." I knew him ſix years after, and had no cauſe to doubt the ſoundneſs of his converſion. Among the reſt an officer was cut to the heart, and ſoon after threw up his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and became a pious follower of Chriſt. I do not think I ever ſaw a more powerful day in a new place. After meeting, the people all around were begging to have preaching at their houſes. Among other places, I appointed to ſpeak at Mr. L.'s whoſe heart the Lord had touched, he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Mother Kill; a place famed for wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Previous to my entering this place, the Lord awakened a woman of diſtinction, by an earthquake; and ſhe found peace to her ſoul ſhortly after I came to the place. And about a year after, ſhe died a witneſs of perfect love. I preached at a variety of places all around, and the work of the Lord went on proſperouſly: many being brought into newneſs of life, we began to have a little heaven on earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:023401_0092_0FBF599EE8A6B918"/>
When firſt I preached at Mr. L.'s, few came to hear; but the numbers gradually increaſed: ſouls were awakened, and I join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many to the ſociety. In the ſecond ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, among others, a youth by the name of C. B. was awakened, and after a time became a light in the church of God. I preached at his father's, and the work of the Lord proſpering, a large ſociety was raiſed in that neighbourhood, which did honor to the cauſe of God!</p>
            <p>I bleſs God for it, I had many hearts, hands, and houſes, opened around me; and many enquired, "What ſhall I do to be ſaved?" The people about Mother Kill, were brought up Preſbyterians, and their paſtor ſtrove by every means to keep them from the Methodiſts; but all in vain; they were convinced there was more in religion than a mere form. Multitudes gathered to hear the word, and many large ſocieties were formed in different places.</p>
            <p>September 12th, 1778, was the firſt day of my entering the town of Dover; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb for wickedneſs. I had deſired for ſome time to attack this place, but had no open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till an old gentleman came one day and heard me preach at Mr. S.'s: his heart
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:023401_0093_0FBF59A5112D7DD0"/>was touched, and he gave me an invitation to preach in the academy. Scarcely had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> alighted from my horſe before I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by hundreds; ſome cried one thing, ſome another; ſome ſaid, he is a good man, others ſaid, nay, he deceiveth the people—and I was alſo accuſed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a friend to King George. They cried, "He is one of Clowe's men—hang him— hang him." I know not what the event would have been, had not the Lord inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. There were ſo many tongues go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and voices heard, that I had no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble chance to ſpeak for myſelf; and to all human appearance, I was in a fair way to be torn in pieces every moment: I was, however, reſcued by ſeveral gentlemen of the town, who hearing the uproar, ran to my aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The chief of theſe were Mr. P. a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who was formerly awakened under Mr. Whitefield, Mr. L. and the alderman of the town. The little Squire preſſed through the croud, Zaccheus like, and taking me by the hand, led me through the mob, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me to preach and he would ſtand by me. I mounted the ſtage at the done of the academy; the people flocked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:023401_0094_0FBF59A5F2E88438"/>both within and without. And after ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer, I gave out, <hi>If it bear fruit well, and if not, then after that, thou ſhalt cut it down.</hi> My dear Lord was with me of a truth. It was not difficult for me to ſpeak, to be heard a quarter of a mile. Many who did not come to the place, heard me from their gardens and windows. We had much of the preſence of the Lord with us. We rarely ſee ſuch a weeping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in a new place. One woman was powerfully wrought upon, who ſat in her window more than a quarter of a mile off. She knew no reſt day nor night, till ſhe found a reſting place in her heart for the God of Jacob. It was thought by ſome of my Chriſtian friends, who accompanied me, that very few of the extenſive congregation were left without a witneſs in their hearts, of the truth of what was delivered: More than twenty got the word of truth ſo faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they did not deſire to loſe it, and it terminated, I truſt, in a ſound conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the ſouls of many.</p>
            <p>The mob hung their heads; many of them were affected, and their ringleader ſaid, he would come and aſk my pardon (ſo I was informed) if he thought I would
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:023401_0095_0FBF59A7A0AB9238"/>forgive him; and I underſtood he betook himſelf from that day to reading the Bible; and never again perſecuted the children of God—at leaſt to my knowledge.</p>
            <p>In the evening I lectured at Mr. S.'s, the old gentleman who had firſt given me an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to the town; many of the chief people of the place came to hear, and we had a very ſolemn time. When I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to my room, I was ſeverely buffetted by Satan. I felt as miſerable as Jonah un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his withered gourd: It was as though I had given all to the people, and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for myſelf. Ah! ſaid the enemy, the Lord will make uſe of you for the good of others, and then caſt you away, as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent does a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> rod after correcting the child. I was in ſuch deep exerciſe, that I could ſcarcely cloſe my eyes throughout the night, but paſſed the greater part of it away in ſighs, and groans, and ſilence, before the Lord. I believe I was permitted to be thus tried in order to keep me at the feet of my dear Lord, and hope I ſhall be always thankful for his kind dealings with me.</p>
            <p>Monday, September 13th, I preached a few miles out of town, accompanied by
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:023401_0096_0FBF59AFB84CBC28"/>many, and the Lord was with us. In the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon I returned and found many mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Chriſt; but the devil and ſome of his adherents were ſtriving to make them believe, that what I had told them was a deluſion; but they were not ſucceſsful. I joined thoſe who were deeply awakened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſociety; and the Lord was with them, ſpreading his work and converting the ſouls of many: among the reſt there was an old lady ſtripped of her own righteouſneſs, who had been a communicant in the church for many years; alſo ten of her children with their huſbands and wives were brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concern for their ſouls. I preached at her houſe, and ſixteen or eighteen of her children and children in law were preſent. The old lady was mourning; but ſeveral of them the Lord had ſet at liberty; and before many months he viſited the old lady with his forgiving love, as well as the moſt of her children. Such a family as this I have ſeldom ſeen in any part of America.</p>
            <p>The fields appeared white for harveſt; but the laborers were very few; and I was engaged in ſtrong cries to the Lord, to open the way and ſend out more; and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be his name, it was ſo; for he raiſed
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:023401_0097_0FBF59B13AC8B8A8"/>up ſeveral young men, and ſent others from the Weſtern ſhore. I wrote to brother F. A. who was at Mr. W.'s, informing him how matters were, and that his way was open into any part of the ſtate, and I requeſted him to make a viſit to Dover: which he did, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> brought in many whom I could not reach. The Lord gave us great favor in the fight of Dr. M. miniſter of the church, and he proved a great bleſſing to the cauſe of Method<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m. The prejudices of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple began to fall aſtoniſhingly; and there was a great gathering to the connection from all quarters, and hundreds enabled to rejoice in the Kingdom of Grace.</p>
            <p>The 19th of September, 1778, I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the funeral of my brother, and a ſolemn ſeaſon it was; my youngeſt brother was there from Baltimore, a wild youth, but the Lord laid his convincing hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and he returned a penitent mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: he could ſtay but a few weeks till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Monday September 20th, as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meditating through the fields, I heard the cries of one on the top of a tree: and lifting up my eyes, I ſaw a man about
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:023401_0098_0FBF59B2CB9C3AA0"/>taking his own life; a rope was tied to a limb with a nooſe in it, and the poor wretch bemoaning himſelf thus—"O what a wretch I am; once I had a day of grace, but now it is a gone caſe with me!—I may as well put an end to my wretched life!" He then made a motion to put the rope over his head, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the world farewell. I inſtantly called out to him, and told him to ſtop a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes while I converſed with him. He did; and after ſome time I perſuaded him to give over his wicked intention, and come down from the tree. In the courſe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, I found the good Spirit had from time to time ſtrove with him, and he had rejected the offers of mercy: till at length the arch-fiend perſuaded hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> his day of grace was paſt; and that he had better know his doom as quick as poſſible. My being an inſtrument (to human appearance) of ſaving the life of a human being, as well as, perhaps, an immortal ſoul, was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Tueſday I rode as far as Queen Ann's, and found a very proſperous work going on. I was very comfortable in my dear Lord; and experienced it was ſweet to wait o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wedneſday, September 22d, I awoke and aroſe early from my pillow, and felt a great nearneſs to the Lord, and had a ſweet time in ſecret. I viſited poor John W. a brother of the Dr. and ſound him near death, in his ſins.

<pb n="103" facs="unknown:023401_0102_0FBF55421DF33C80"/>among whom I went, appeared as familiar to me, as if I had been there frequently before. It ſeemed as if the Lord opened the way before me, ſtep by ſtep.</p>
            <p>Monday September 25th, I preached a funeral ſermon in the ſame neighbourhood; and the devil ſent out a woman with a piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol or two to ſhoot me: and while I was preaching from, <hi>Acquaint now thyſelf with him, and be at peace, thereby good ſhall come unto thee,</hi> Job xxii. 21. ſhe came in; and made ſo much noiſe that I ſtopped till they put her out and ſhut the door. O! how precious this ſeaſon was to me! And the divine power was ſenſibly felt among the people. After the ſermon many hung around me in tears, begging of me to pray for them, and likewiſe to viſit them, and not to let the diſturbance prevent my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among them again.</p>
            <p>The wife of Mr. N. a merchant in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſbury, was powerfully awakened; and many others who came from a diſtance. This part of the world was famous for gambling and dancing; but as the word ſpread, theſe vices fell; until there was ſcarce a frolic heard of in Broad-creek. About this place I joined many broken-hearted
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:023401_0103_0FBF5545E8C21500"/>ſinners in ſociety, and many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acquainted with the power of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Saturday Nov. 7th, on my way to Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot quarterly meeting, I preached at Mr. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>'s, and two very dreſſy young women, who came on a viſit to their relations, were wounded, and I left them crying for mercy.</p>
            <p>On Sunday Nov. 8th, quarterly meeting began. Brother P. preached a very uſeful ſermon; and I found freedom to diſcourſe on Solomon's chariot: the people were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and ſolemn.</p>
            <p>Monday 9th, love-feaſt began in the morning, and it was a refreſhing time. Many rejoiced in the Lord, and ſpake free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and feelingly of what God had done for them. After the love-feaſt I found great freedom to preach from, <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation,</hi> 2 Peter ii. 9. and we had a time not ſoon to be forgotten among the children of God.</p>
            <p>Tueſday Nov. 10th, I called again at Mr. P.'s, and found thoſe young women dreſſed very plain, and under deep diſtreſs. In the evening I read and lectured on the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:023401_0104_0FBF554939917CE0"/>16th of John, and the Lord was with us of a truth. The power of the Lord was ſenſibly felt, and his preſence filled the room, where about fifteen of us were met for prayer. Brother H. my brother Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard (who had come from ſome diſtance to ſee me) and myſelf, continued in prayer, excluſive of the time we ſpent in ſinging and exhorting, from about eight o'clock till near two; and in that time five ſouls were ſet at liberty: the two young women of whom I have ſpoken, Dr. W. and his two ſiſters, who came from a diſtance to quarterly meeting. This was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary night to my poor heart, and to the ſouls of moſt preſent.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday Nov. 11th, greatly refreſhed and ſtrengthened. I ſet out again on my way to Somerſet, and found my young diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples growing in grace, and increaſing in number. In my way round, having an invitation from Mr. N. I preached in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſbury, where the Lord began a bleſſed work; but the devil ſtrove to ſtop it; for he raiſed up enemies againſt me, who ſent the ſheriff with a writ to take me to gaol. After he ſerved it on me, he told me I muſt be confined. I told him, I was a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:023401_0105_0FBF554E78CE9A40"/>of the Lord Jeſus, and that if he laid a hand on me, it would be touching, as it were, the apple of his eye. He wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In April 1779, I was led ſtill farther in the wilderneſs, to enlarge the circuit; and though I met with a variety of trials, and was ſeverely buffeted by Satan; yet my Lord was with me daily. And although in thoſe new places, I had none to converſe with, at firſt, who knew the Lord; yet Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was ſweet company to me in my retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And often the wilderneſs was my cloſet, where I had many ſweet hours' con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with my dear Lord. Whoſe heart can help rejoicing to think of the kind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſions of our bleſſed Lord!—to ſend his Son to die for man—to permit them to lean on his boſom—and to have ſuch heavenly converſation with <hi>him!</hi> How blind muſt thoſe deiſts be, who deny the ſecond perſon in the ever bleſſed Trinity!

            <p>Monday April the 5th, I preached ſtill nearer to the ſea; and the ſame convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power ran through the audience: ſome of them thought but little of walking ten or twelve miles to hear the word.

One day I was wandering through the wilderneſs in ſearch of poor loſt ſheep, and called at ſeveral houſes; but they did not want me. At length night came on; and I had been all day, at leaſt from the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without any refreſhment for myſelf or horſe; and I got loſt withal in a thick wilderneſs, called the Cyprus Swamp. The night was dark and rainy; and after wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering about for a conſiderable time, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to take up my lodging as well as I could; for this purpoſe I ſtopped my horſe; but before I got down, I eſpied a light, by following which I was led to a houſe, where I was moſt kindly entertained. I ſat down, and found my ſoul very happy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The man of the houſe fixed his eyes upon me, and at laſt ſaid, "What are you, or who are you; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I then read the 7th chapter of Matthew, and lectured from it; and found great ſweetneſs in prayer. After I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to bed, the wife ſaid to the huſband, "That is a man of God; one whom the Lord hath ſent to reform the world."—
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:023401_0112_0FBF556215BAF918"/>When I aroſe in the morning, he aſked me to what place I was bound? and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſervice and company.

I aſked the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if ſhe had a love for the Lord? ſhe ſaid, "Yes." I aſked if ſhe ever prayed? ſhe replied, "I pray always." I aſked if ſhe knew her ſins forgiven? ſhe ſaid, "ſhe did not; but ſhe knew that ſhe ſhould go to heaven when ſhe died. And," ſaid ſhe, "I know that you are a ſervant of God; but you cannot teach me, for I underſtand all the ſcriptures, and I know what kind of death I am to die."

            <p>Sunday, June 7th. I ſpent the morning in retirement, ſorely tempted by the devil; and after I went to my appointed place, my mind was ſo bewildered, I thought there was not a text in all the Bible that I could ſpeak from. I felt myſelf leſs than the leaſt. At eleven o'clock there was ſuch a number col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that I was obliged to preach under the trees. I had been before the people but a few minutes, till the Lord bleſt me with great light, and the Bible ſeemed all plain to me. I am ſure if I had held the Quaker principle, I ſhould not have attempted to ſpeak; but glory to God! it proved a day of days to many others as well as myſelf.</p>
            <p>Whenever the Lord begins his work in any place, the devil and his children are ſure to riſe up againſt it. After preaching I ſet out for my afternoon's appointment, accompanied by about thirty, whoſe hearts the Lord had touched. I was purſued by a party of men who way-laid me, and the head of the company, with a gun preſented, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:023401_0116_0FBF556EC66DEB78"/>me to ſtop. Several of the women who were with us ſurpriſed me; they were in an inſtant off their horſes, and ſeizing hold of his gun, held it until I paſſed by. That ſame man was a penitent ſome time after, and became a member of the ſociety. I went on and preached at old Mr. T—'s, to a large, attentive company, and united a proſperous ſociety.</p>
            <p>I am not ſurpriſed at the devil's rattling his chains, for his kingdom is coming down very faſt. It appeared as if hundreds in the congregation were more or leſs wrought upon, and many appeared to be broken hearted. We could never get a ſociety in this place till now. I know the day when the Lord began his work in the Fork; I preached from theſe words, <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torment;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, if I ſaw no fruit to leave them: but bleſſed be God, he viſited the place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="118" facs="unknown:023401_0117_0FBF557107ADA320"/>and the devil followed me all the way, and frequently told me, "You are a fool, and may as well go back;" and after I got there, he told me, "my journey would be fruitleſs." I withdrew and mourned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and entreated him to grant that the devil might be diſappointed; and ſo it was, for a large number attended at eleven o'clock, and we had much of the divine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>efence. I ſpent a good portion of ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> after ſermon was over, in reading and explaining the rules of the ſociety.</p>
            <p>Tueſday June 9, I preached at I. T.'s. My mind was greatly diſturbed all the morning by the enemy of ſouls: ſo that I could not keep it fixed upon one thing for a minute at a time; which was a great grief to me. It is ſurpriſing that the devil ſhould have power to carry the mind, in the manner he does, to the ends of the earth; but though he has power to tempt, he cannot force us to give way to the temptation; this muſt be with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the will. We had a large gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people here, and a ſolemn time.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday June 10th. What is the devil afraid of? Why does he chaſe me in this manner? I do not know that I have
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:023401_0118_0FBF5574783144E8"/>given way to ſin, either inwardly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; and yet he tells me frequently, "my commiſſion is run out, and that my labors never will be bleſſed again." I have had great ſtruggling in my mind, to know my ſtanding; not that I doubt my adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the family of heaven; but reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſalvation from all inward ſin. From this quarter have ariſen my greateſt fears for more than 12 months paſt. I know that my dear Lord has given me power to ſerve him, and that I love him ſupremely; but theſe are comprehenſive words, <hi>to love the Lord with all the heart.</hi> My wiſhes have frequently gone up, deſirous of a ſtronger aſſurance of this perfect love which caſteth out fear. I have thought ſometimes that I ſhould doubt no more; but fearfulneſs hath kept me back.</p>
            <p>This day I felt ſtrangely: I was ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened (not with guilt, bleſſed be God) that I could ſcarcely bear my own weight. None know what I mean, but ſuch as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a commiſſion to deliver a meſſage for the Lord. The prophet knew when he cried out, <hi>The burden of the Lord</hi>—Jonah knew ſomething of it when he was called to go to Nineveh—and Jeremiah was well
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:023401_0119_0FBF557A21F0FED0"/>acquainted with exerciſes of this kind. It is a ſweet thing to preach the goſpel, but the croſs is to be borne. I remember the words of St. John, who eat the little book; in his mouth it was ſweet, but it made his belly bitter.</p>
            <p>I croſſed the river and went to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, which was at I. M.'s on Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creek. The people aſſembled from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and many came out who were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the way, and ſome from afar. I had ſcarce opened my mouth when my burden dropped off: and in an uncommon manner I was let into the Holy Scriptures; and the flame ran from heart to heart. I felt as though I had almoſt faith enough to remove mountains. One thing was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed not only by my friends, but likewiſe by thoſe who were enemies—There had been a great drought, ſo that the vegetable creation hung in mourning; and it was thought by many they would loſe their crops, if it continued much longer. In a particular manner I was led to pray for rain; and a few minutes after the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was diſmiſſed, the face of the ſky was covered with blackneſs, and we had a plentiful ſhower; which greatly ſurpriſed
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:023401_0120_0FBF557B765F6B18"/>and convinced the people. I was now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py enough to ſee the proſperity of the young converts. Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Lord was plentifully watering the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, I collected the family for prayer; and we had a great time of refreſhing from the preſence of the Lord. My ſoul was ſo happy while the Lord was uttering his voice in thunder, that it ſeemed as if I ſaw, by an eye of faith, the bleſſed Jeſus and the glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed company around him, in exalted ſtrains, ſinging and ſhouting his praiſe. And this flame continued with me till ſome time in the night, I then ſweetly reſted in the arms of my Lord.</p>
            <p>Thurſday June 11th, I preached to a poor people. Some who came from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thought I pointed my diſcourſe at them. Thurſday was a very ſolemn day of faſting. I have noticed that the evil one is more ſpiteful on my faſt-days than at other times. But I feel there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of keeping my body under, leſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preaching to others I ſhould be a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away. My public labors this day, as I was among a curious people, were to reconcile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſeeming contradictions in ſcripture. After I had done, I was warmly oppoſed
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:023401_0121_0FBF557DE1D7E120"/>by an enemy to the croſs of Chriſt. I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited one of the ſpiritual children of Mr. Whitefield, on her death-bed; and I truſt her ſoul was happy in the Lord.</p>
            <p>In the evening I met and examined a large ſociety, and we had a comfortable time. I had a ſweet night's reſt, and awoke at my uſual hour with a happy mind, and prayed earneſtly to the Lord, to grant that every moment of my life might be given to him.</p>
            <p>I rode to Quantico to viſit the young lambs. I expected that the Lord intended to do ſomething for them, for the devil purſued me all the way even till I got to the place. An unexpected congregation aſſembled in the afternoon, and the Lord was with us of a truth. Several were ſet at liberty; and the cries of the diſtreſſed were heard—Sweet Jeſus, thou art lovely to my ſoul!—O Jeſus! thou haſt overcome me with thy looks, and the kiſſes of thy lips! I ſound great freedom in meeting the ſociety, and in the morning I met them again, and a precious time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Sunday June the 14th. I felt this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as if the Lord intended to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="123" facs="unknown:023401_0122_0FBF5585E58675E8"/>in wreſtling with the Lord for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on my labors. I preached at old bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther R.'s at eleven o'clock: the old judge, who came as a hearer, gave great attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and we had a melting time. I rode ten miles to Saliſbury; when I came in, the man of the houſe took me into a room; and told me I had better leave the town immediately; for a mob was waiting, and intended to ſend me to gaol; "They came to my houſe laſt night," ſaid he, "expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find you here; but when they found you not, they laid hold on me, and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging me down the chamber-ſtairs, hauled me along the ſtreet till my arms were as black as ink from my wriſts to my ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and I know not what would have been the conſequence, if I had not been reſcued by a magiſtrate." This mob was made up of what they call the firſt people in the county. I told my informer that I had come to preach my dear Maſter's goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and that I was not afraid to truſt him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

After ſervice he returned to his company, and told them I had preached the truth, and if they laid a hand on me he would put the law in force againſt them. They withdrew to their homes, without making the ſlighteſt attempt upon me. O, who would not confide in ſo good a God! After our bleſſed meeting was over, I rode three miles and had a pleaſant time with a few of my friends. Glory be to God! he is carrying on a gracious work about this place. All this week I ſpent in preaching and viſiting the young ſocieties.</p>
            <p>Sunday June 21, I was to preach at the Sound. In the morning I intended meeting the ſociety at eight o'clock; but ſuch a crowd gathered that I declined it; and preached a ſermon. At twelve about 1500 gathered, and the Lord made bare his arm under the ſpreading trees. After a ſhort intermiſſion, I preached another ſermon: and it ſeemed as if the whole country would turn to the Lord. While
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:023401_0124_0FBF558CBB302920"/>preaching I was ſo wonderfully drawn out, that it appeared to me as though I ſaw our bleſſed Saviour working proſperouſly thro' the aſſembly. Weeping was on every ſide. I ſpent a week in the neighbourhood preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral times a day, beſides viſiting and converſing with the diſtreſſed. I believe this work was greatly hindered by the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, who came among the people and drew off a few; and ſet others to diſputing about the decrees, and their method of baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Sunday June 28th, when I came to bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther W.'s in Muſkmelon, I found that a Nicolite preacher had been ſowing his feed in the young ſociety, and endeavouring to deſtroy the new-born children. He told them, "It was a ſin to wear any kind of clothing that was colored; and that they ought never to pray but when they had an immediate impulſe, and that it was wrong to ſing." Many people came together, but I perceived a conſiderable alteration; for ſome would not ſing at all, and others ſat both in time of ſinging and prayer. Some had taken off the borders of their caps, and condemned thoſe who would not do a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they had done; in ſhort, ſome of my own ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

I gave out my text, <hi>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. xiv. 17. My dear Lord made bare his arm, and humbled me among them; and there was a ſhaking, convincing power. After ſermon was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I met the ſociety and excluded the leader and one or two more; thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained took a freſh ſtart, and grew more than ever. I ſpent the week in Mother Kill, and ſeveral other places, and was greatly comforted among the growing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</p>
            <p>Sunday July 5th, I preached in Dover a little after ſun-riſe, then rode four miles and preached at brother B.'s at nine, to hundreds who ſtood and ſat under the trees for want of room in the houſe from <hi>Behold a ſower went forth to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="unknown:023401_0126_0FBF5591F6659D08"/>It was little trouble to me to preach, for the ſcripture ſeemed all open. I rode five miles and preached in Muſkmelon again at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This day I ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of ſix hours in the four ſermons, and concluded about ſun-ſet. My ſpirit was ſo united to my Jeſus, and ſo tranſported, that I ſearcely felt the ſatigues of the day; and the only ſuſtenance I had taken was a little milk and water. I have ſeldom ſeen a greater day than this: I do not know but I may ſay thouſands are flocking to Jeſus. There is a childiſh fondneſs in theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and I feel unwilling to leave them; but the will of the Lord be done.</p>
            <p>Monday July the 6th. Having it on my mind, I ſet out to make an inroad through the Delaware ſtate, where I had never been: I had appointed a friend, who had given

And on July 19, I preached again in the open air to many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds; and found that the work of the Lord was ſtill going on. In the afternoon I preached to almoſt as many at old Mr. T.'s. His daughter Rebecca is a very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py young woman. A few months ſinoe ſhe was in the height of the faſhion, but now ſees the evil and folly of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Monday July 20, I went to preach at a houſe by the river, on the edge of Dorſet county; here here Lord had greatly weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Satan's kingdom. I preached at the door to abundantly more than could get into the houſe. I was ſo ſurpriſingly drawn out, and the people ſo engaged, that I could not conclude under two or three hours. From the looks of the people, I ſhould not have thought I had an enemy in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After ſermon, being much ſpent, I withdrew. Shortly after a perſon came to me and ſaid, "two men wanted to ſee me." I told him to deſire them to walk up, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were perſons in diſtreſs, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtruction; but when I ſaw them, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered wickedneſs in their very looks.
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:023401_0132_0FBF559F704F85F0"/>One of them was a magiſtrate, and he was a Churchman; the other was a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, and he was a diſputant. The magiſtrate brought him out in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute me in points of religion: and then his intention was to ſend me to priſon. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired them to ſit down, and the diſputant began; he ſaid but a few words until I aſked him if his ſoul was converted to God? I charge you, ſaid I, in the preſence of him before whom we ſhall ſhortly ſtand, tell me, is you ſoul converted to God? Do you know that your peace is made with God? He was ſtruck, and knew not what to ſay; but at laſt he ſaid, "I do not know that I am." Then, replied I, you are in the way to hell. And I began to exhort him to repent, and turn to the Lord.

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my friends gathered around me, and offered to be ſecurity for my appearance at court; but I told them I would give no ſecurity. I had faith to believe that he had not power, or at leaſt would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſtop me. I looked him in the face, and ſaid, I am going on the Lord's errand, and if you have power, here I am, take me; but remember, that the God againſt whom you are fighting, who made yonder ſun, is juſt now looking down upon you; and I know not but that he will cruſh you to the earth, if you perſiſt in fighting ſo furiouſly againſt him. I am now on my way to Philadelphia, to preach the glorious goſpel of my Redeemer; and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of your ſtopping me in this manner will be rueful. After converſing with him a few minutes, I perceived his countenance fall, and he ſaid, "It is a pity to ſtop you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>DURING my ſtay in the Peninſula, on this viſit, which was about fifteen months, ſeveral new circuits were formed; hundreds entered in the ſociety; a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation had taken place; great numbers were really and powerfully converted to God; and ſeveral preachers raiſed. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in this time I preached in more than a hundred new places, where my dear Lord began a glorious work. All manner of evil was ſaid of me by the wicked; but bleſſed be God for the anſwer of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a heart united to my dear Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and for the friendſhip and good wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of thouſands, whoſe hearts were touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the word.</p>
            <p>I ſtaid about two months in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and as it was ſhortly after the Britiſh troops left that city, there was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the ſociety, as well as among the people at large: I met with a variety of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and ſaw very little fruit of my labors. But many of our dear friends were near,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:023401_0136_0FBF55B2E8562430"/>dear, and precious to me: and frequently ſince that time I have had a great deſire to ſpend a few months in that city.</p>
            <p>I bleſs and praiſe my dear Lord, for the proſperous journey he gave me through the Jerſeys: ſeveral were awakened, and ſome brought to know Jeſus. One day, after preaching, an old man came to me and ſaid, all in tears, "This day I am an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and one years old, and this is my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual birth-day." The dear man's ſoul was ſo exceedingly happy, that he appeared to be ready to take his ſlight to heaven.</p>
            <p>I preached at a new place, where the congregation conſiſted moſtly of young people, from, <hi>The Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt,</hi> Luke xix. 10.

She at length fell from God, and became as wild and trifling as ever. Soon after this ſhe was entirely deprived of her ſpeech; and the enemy of her ſoul perſuaded her to believe, it was a ſin for her to do any kind of work, or even to dreſs herſelf; and if they gave her a book to read ſhe thought it ſinful to turn over a leaf, and would read no more, unleſs ſome one would do this office for her. It was impreſſed on her mind that there was a people in ſuch a place, that ſerved the Lord; and if ſhe could get among them, they would be a bleſſing to her; and ſhe would be reſtored to her ſpeech. She had never heard of a Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt; and the place which was revealed to her was near twenty miles off, where there was a young, loving ſociety. Though ſhe knew nothing of the way, ſhe ſet off to find that place and people. Her family miſſing her, purſued and brought her back. Not long after ſhe made a more ſucceſsful ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and found the ſociety. The Lord revealed her caſe to them. There was a preacher preſent, Mr. D. R. who being
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:023401_0138_0FBF55B8196D2F90"/>agreed, they called a meeting, and cried to the Lord in her behalf that day and the next; ſhe then went into a private room, kneeled down to prayer, and continued therein till the Lord bleſſed her ſoul. At the ſame time her tongue was looſened, and ſhe could ſpeak forth the praiſes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael's God. She had been dumb about two years. Some time after, I came into this neighbourhood and ſent word to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I would preach ſuch a day at her houſe. When the day arrived, I took the young woman home, accompanied by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends, and we were received like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: ſome thought the Methodiſts could work miracles. Many of the friends and neighbours came, and could not but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how angelic this young woman ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be; who was now able to ſpeak and work as well as uſual. I bleſs the Lord who gave me great freedom in preaching on this remarkable occaſion. The people ſeemed to believe every word which was delivered: and a precious, ſweet ſeaſon it was.

               </gap>erted; and afterwards became a pious fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the bleſſed Jeſus. When ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her uncle's in Dorſet, they began
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:023401_0140_0FBF55BF0072F998"/>to think ſhe was beſide herſelf; however, the Lord bleſſed her endeavours in favor of her ſiſter Polly, and a few others. Her fiſter was ſoon ſet at liberty in a powerful manner, and had as great a zeal for God as her ſiſter Catharine. Shortly after, their ſiſter B. became as bleſſed a woman as ever I ſaw; and I have not a doubt but that ſhe lived and died a bright witneſs of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Mr. B. was brought into the faith, with two young lawyers who were ſtudying under him, and ſeveral others of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; who were the fruits of the labors of theſe pious, I may ſay, bleſſed women. To return; ſome time after Mary's conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhe went to viſit H. A. <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was a relation of hers. As he was a man of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an entire ſtranger to Inward reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he was much aſraid ſhe would drive his wife out of her ſenſes. He undertook to ſhew his <hi>viſitor</hi> that the Methodiſts were not in the right way; and for this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="142" facs="unknown:023401_0141_0FBF55C08E09D770"/>with his book, and compare it with theirs. He did ſo, and found the Methodiſt publications to agree in ſubſtance with that. On this occaſion I firſt met with him at Mr. W.'s. After he had labored ſome time under diſtreſs of ſoul, the Lord gave him reſt—he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Thurſday Feb. 10th, 1780, I aroſe very early in the morning, and addreſſed the throne of grace. My dear Maſter wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refreſhed my ſoul, and I felt a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs to ſuffer any thing, whatever the Lord might permit to come upon me, for his work's ſtake. I opened my mind to Mr. F. A. who was at Mr. W.'s, and he ſeemed very deſirous I ſhould accept the invitation. He then commended me to the Lord in prayer, and I ſet out in good ſpirits with a ſtrong hope that good would be done. The firſt day I got half way, and had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable night. February 11th was a day of deep exerciſe. Are others diſtreſſed in the way that I have been? I travelled on ſeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with the weight of a mill-ſtone. I

               </gap>es ſtopped my horſe, intending to turn back, but was ſtill urged on my way. I got to my dear friend Mr. A.'s, ſome time before night; and the burden which I felt all the way, left me at his door. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it was perceptible, for my ſpirit did rejoice in God my Saviour. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into a private room, where the Lord let me know that I was in the very place he would have me to be.</p>
            <p>In the evening the family were gathered together for prayer: I ſhall never forget the time: I ſuppoſe about twelve white and black were preſent. The power of the Lord came among us: Mrs. A. was ſo ſilled with the new wine of Chriſt's kingdom, that ſhe ſunk to the floor, bleſſing and praiſing the Lord. And many of the blacks were much wrought upon. This night was a time of great refreſhment to me.</p>
            <p>Saturday 12. About thirty of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were called together; and the word ſeemed to melt their hearts. I had not the leaſt doubt, but the Lord had called me to this place.</p>
            <p>Sunday 13. Near an hundred gathered: the field, though in the winter, ſeemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Monday the 14th, accompanied by my friend, I went to the other part of the county. The field is ripe. One man was deeply affected only by ſeeing us. I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at colonel V.'s, a clever man, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became a great friend to us and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too.—The fields are white for harveſt— The devil is angry—The wicked rage, and invent lies and miſchief. The county court was ſitting, and ſome of the heads of it were determined, by ſome means or other, to clear the place of ſuch a troubleſome fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For a cloak they charged me with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryiſm: and I was informed, gave a very wicked man leave, and promiſed to bear him out, in taking my life; and for this purpoſe he was to lay in wait for me the next day. It providentially reached my ears that night before I went to bed, and as the wicked ſeemed thus inclined, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I had a moſt remarkable viſion of the night. And in that viſion it was revealed to me what I was to ſuffer; and that the Lord would ſtand by me, ſo that my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould not injure me. Hundreds flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to hear the word; on one ſide ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were enquiring what they ſhould do to be ſaved; and thoſe on the other ſide; how they ſhould manage in order to baniſh me from the place.</p>
            <p>Monday 21. I had great ſatisfaction in reading a piece that treated on the human ſoul.—I had much freedom in the word in public, and a bleſſed family meeting at my good friend A.'s; but ſorely tempted of the devil. Shortly after (ſhall I ſpeak the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="146" facs="unknown:023401_0145_0FBF55CD355482F8"/>went down ſtairs in the morning, intending not to ſpeak of what had paſt: but brother A. enquired if I had been down in the night; I told him I had not; "why," ſaid he, "ſhortly after you went up, I came into the hall, and was at prayer, when I heard ſome one walk down ſtairs, and ſeemed to be ſtanding at the door: as I knew there was none above but yourſelf, I concluded it muſt be you that wiſhed to go out; I therefore went and opened the door, but ſaw no body, and certainly it was the devil." This was about the preciſe time he left my bed. Poor devil, you are afraid of your kingdom. I then mentioned what had paſt in my chamber. The little daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was under ſome concern of ſoul, and getting up one night, awoke her parents, and told them ſhe was afraid the devil would carry her away. The ſoul ſpirit was wonderfully rouſed, and very bitter againſt this dear family.</p>
            <p>February 24, I had a ſweet and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful time. After I went to reſt I was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed in my ſleep: I thought I ſaw an innocent creature chaſed almoſt to death, by a company of dreadful beings; after a while I ſaw a cloud about the ſize of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="147" facs="unknown:023401_0146_0FBF55D06F479F58"/>hand riſing in the Weſt, which grew black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and darker, till it appeared to cover the earth: I thought now, moſt ſurely the world is to be at an end. I ſaw after a while thoſe cruel beings turn pale as death. I ſaw a perſon come up to the innocent creature, which they were chaſing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. I awoke rejoicing, but knew not how to interpret this dream.</p>
            <p>Saturday 25, my ſpirit was ſolemn and weighty: expecting ſomething uncommon would turn up. I withdrew to the woods, and ſpent much time before the Lord. I preached with freedom to a weeping flock, my friend A. accompanying me to the place. In the evening we were repairing to his houſe, being about to preach there the next day; but a parcel of men embodied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and way-laid me, with an intention to take me to gaol. About ſun-ſet they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded us, and called me their priſoner. They beat my horſe, curſed and ſwore, but did not ſtrike me. Some time after night they took me to a magiſtrate who was as much my enemy as any of them. When I was judged, and condemned for preaching the goſpel, the keeper of the peace, who ſat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his great chair, immediately wrote a mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:023401_0147_0FBF55D828DBBF50"/>and ordered me to gaol. I aſked him if he had never heard of an affair in Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot county. Brother I. H. was committed to gaol for the ſame crime, that of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel: ſoon after the magiſtrate was taken ſick unto death, and ſent for this ſame preacher out of confinement to pray for him. He then made this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, "When I ſent you to gaol," ſaid he, "I was fighting againſt God, and now I am about to leave the world, pray for me." His family were called in, and he ſaid to his wife, "This is a ſervant of God: and when I die, I requeſt he may preach at my funeral. You need not think I have not my ſenſes; this is the true faith." He then gave brother I. H. charge of his family, and deſired them to embrace that profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now, ſaid I, I beſeech you to think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it as an honor to be impriſoned for the goſpel of my dear Lord. My horſe was brought, and about twelve of the company were to attend me to gaol. They were all around me; and two, one on each ſide, holding my horſe's bridle. The night was
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:023401_0148_0FBF55D934AF4A18"/>very dark; and before we got a mile from the houſe, on a ſudden there was a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common flaſh of lightning, and in leſs than a minute all my fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s were diſperſed: my friend A. was a little before the company. How, or where, I know not, but I was left alone. I was reminded of that place of ſcripture, where our dear Lord's ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fell to the ground, and then, this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſcripture came to me, <hi>Stand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of God.</hi> It was a very dark cloudy night, and had rained a little. I ſat on my horſe alone, and though I called ſeveral times, there was no anſwer. I went on, but had not got far before I met my friend Mr. A. returning to look for me. He had accompanied me through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole of this affair. We rode on talking of the goodneſs of God, till we came to a little cottage by the road ſide, where we found two of my guards almoſt ſcared out of their wits. I told them if I was to go to gaol that night, we ought to be on our way, for it was getting late.— "O! no," ſaid one of them, "let us ſtay until the morning." My friend and I rode on, and it was not long, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re we had a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful clear night. We had not rode far,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:023401_0149_0FBF55DAB4FC5C90"/>before the company had gathered, from whence I know not. However, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be amazingly intimidated, and the foreman of the company rode along ſide of me, and ſaid, "Sir, do you think the affair happened on our account?" I told him, that I would have him to judge for himſelf; reminding him of the awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the day of judgment, and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there was of preparing to meet the judge of the whole earth. One of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſwore an oath, and another immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reproved him, ſaying, "How can you ſwear at ſuch a time as this?" At length the company ſtopt, and one ſaid, "We had better give him up for the preſent;" ſo they turned their horſes and went back. My friend and I purſued our way. True it is, <hi>The wicked are like the troubled ſea, whoſe water caſts up mire and dirt.</hi> We had not gone far before they purſued us again, and ſaid '"We cannot give him up." They accompanied us a few minutes, and again left us, and we ſaw no more of them that night. A little before midnight we got ſafe to my friend's houſe. And bleſſed be God, the dear waiting family were looking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>During the remaining part of the night, though dead in ſleep, I was tranſported with the viſions which paſſed through my mind. And had a confidence in the morning, that my beloved Lord would ſupport me.

               </gap>. The ringleader ruſhed forward, with
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:023401_0151_0FBF55E539E430C0"/>a piſtol preſented, and laid hold of me, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the piſtol to my breaſt. Bleſſed be God! my confidence was ſo ſtrong in him, that this was with me, as well as all their other weapons, like feathers, as was repreſented to me in the viſion of the night. Some of the audience, who ſtood next to me, gave me a ſudden jerk; I was preſently in the room, and the door ſhut. As ſoon as I could I opened it, and beckoning to my friends, deſired that they would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure my enemies; that I did not want to keep from them, but was willing to go to gaol. If I had not ſpoke in this manner, I believe much blood would have been ſhed. I began to exhort, and almoſt the whole congregation were in tears; and in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner the women were amazingly agitated. I deſired my horſe to be got, and I was accompanied to Cambridge, where I was kept in a tavern from twelve o'clock till near ſun-ſet, ſurrounded by the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it was a great mercy of God that my life was preſerved.</p>
            <p>A little before night I was thruſt into priſon, and my enemies took away the key, that none might adminiſter to my neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I had a dirty floor for my bed, my
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:023401_0152_0FBF55E6BA192F28"/>ſaddle-bags for my pillow, and two large windows open with a cold Eaſt wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon me: but I had great conſolation in my dear Lord, and could ſay, "Thy will be done." During my confinement here, I was much drawn out in prayer, reading, writing, and meditation. I believe I had the prayers of my good friend Mr. F. Aſbury: and the book which he ſent me (Mr. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford's letters during his confinement) together with the ſoul-comforting and ſtrengthening letters which I received from my pious friends, was rendered a great bleſſing to me. The Lord was remarkably good to me, ſo that I experienced a priſon to be a mere paradiſe; and I had a heart to pray for and wiſh my worſt enemies well. My ſoul was ſo exceedingly happy, I ſcarce knew how my days and nights paſſed away. The bible was never ſweeter to me. I never had a greater love to God's dear children. I never ſaw myſelf more unworthy. I never ſaw a greater beauty in the croſs of my dear Lord; for I thought I could, if required, go cheerfully to the ſtake in ſo good a cauſe. I was not at all ſurpriſed at the cheerfulneſs of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent martyrs, who were able in the flames
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:023401_0153_0FBF55E8811E50E0"/>to clap their glad hands. Sweet moments I had with my dear friends who came to the priſon window.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Happy the man who finds the grace,</l>
               <l>The bleſſing of God's choſen race,</l>
               <l>The wiſdom coming from above,</l>
               <l>The faith which ſweetly works by love.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Many, both friends and ſtrangers, came to viſit me from far and near, and I really believe I never was the means of doing more good for the time: for the county ſeemed to be much alarmed, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts among whom I had labored, were much ſtirred up to pray: for I had written many epiſtles to the brethren. I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget the kindneſs I received from dear brother and ſiſter A. They ſuffered much for the cauſe of God in Dorſet county, for which (if faithful) they will be amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated in a better world.</p>
            <p>My crime of preaching the goſpel was ſo great, that no common court could try my cauſe. There appeared to be a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of my ſtaying in gaol till a general court, which was near twelve months. My good friend Mr. A. went to the governor
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:023401_0154_0FBF55F0AC847818"/>of Maryland, and he befriended me: had I been his brother, he could not have done more for me. The manner in which he proceeded to relieve me was this. I was an inhabitant of Maryland by birth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: I could likewiſe claim a right in the Delaware ſtate, which ſtate was more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to ſuch <hi>peſtilent fellows.</hi> I was carried before the governor of Delaware. This gentleman was a friend to our ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He met me at the door, and welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in, aſſuring me he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould do any thing he could to help me. A recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory letter was immediately diſpatched to the governor of Maryland, and I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at liberty. O! how wonderfully did the people of Dorſet rage—but the word of the Lord ſpread all through that county, and hundreds, both white and black, have experienced the love of Jeſus. Since that time I have preached to more than three thouſand in one congregation, not far from the place where I was impriſoned; and many of my worſt enemies have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After I leſt my confinement, I was more than ever determined to be for God, and none elſe. I travelled extenſively, and my dear Lord was with me daily; and my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did rejoice in God my Saviour. In vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the young ſocieties, after I left gaol, we had bleſſed hours: for many came to hear—ſinners cried for mercy, and God's dear people rejoiced.</p>
            <p>Friday 24, was a ſolemn faſt, being Good-Friday, the day on which my dear Redeemer gave up his precious life. Three days after, being in a bleſſed family, I had great ſweetneſs both in public and private; and before I laid down to reſt, I was very deſirous of being loſt and ſwallowed up in the love of my dear Redeemer, and of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the witneſs of perfect love. After I laid down to reſt, I was in a kind of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary way for ſeveral hours. About one I awoke very happy, aroſe from my bed, and addreſſed the throne of grace. I then lighted a candle, and ſpent near two hours in writing the excrciſes of the night. I ſaw myſelf travelling through a diſmal place, encompaſſed with many dangers; I ſaw the devil, who appeared very furious; he came near to me and declared with bitterneſs,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:023401_0156_0FBF55F459EBA2A8"/>he would be the death of me; for ſaid he, you have done my kingdom much harm: thus ſaying he began pelting me with ſtones, and bedaubing me with dirt, till I felt wounded almoſt to death, and began to fear I ſhould fall by the hand of my enemy. But in the height of my diſtreſs, my dear Saviour appeared to me: I thought him the moſt beautiful perſon that ever my eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: "I am your friend," ſaid he, "and will ſupport you in your journey; fear not, for your enemy is chained." I ſeemed to receive much ſtrength, and the power of the enemy was ſo broken, that he could not move one foot after me: all he could do was to throw out threats, which he did loudly, till I got out of his hearing. Being ſafe from theſe difficulties, I looked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſaw a very high hill which I was to aſcend; and began to fear I never ſhould be able to reach the top: I entered on my journey, and got about half way up, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed that I thought every moment I muſt ſink to the earth; I laid down to reſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little, and ſeemed to fall into a kind of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſe; but I had not laid long, before the perſon who met me in the valley paſſed by, and ſmote me on the ſide, ſaying—
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:023401_0157_0FBF55F6738F7298"/>"Riſe up, and be gone, there is no reſt for you there." With that I received ſtrength, and got up to the top of the hill. I then looked back, and ſaw my enemy at a great diſtance: I was greatly ſurprized when I ſaw the place through which I had come; for on every hand there appeared to be pits, holes, and quagmires in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. I was much wounded, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpattered with dirt, but looked round to ſee if I could find any houſe; and at a diſtance I eſpied a little cottage, and made up to it: when I got near the door, two angels met me and ſaid, "Come in, come in, thou bleſſed of the Lord, here is entertainment for weary travellers." I thought within ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be the moſt beautiful place I had ever ſeen. After I went in, I thought it was heaven filled with bleſſed ſaints and angels. One and another broke out "Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, glory," &amp;c. &amp;c. till the place was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with praiſes. One ſpake to me and ſaid, "This is not heaven, as you ſuppoſe, neither are we angels, but ſanctified Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; and this is the ſecond reſt. And it is your privilege, and the privilege of all the children of God." With that I thought I had faith to believe, and in a moment my
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:023401_0158_0FBF55FD16F41D28"/>ſpotted garments were gone, and a white robe was given me: I had the language and appearance of one of this bleſſed ſociety: I then awoke.</p>
            <p>Before this, I had an ardent deſire tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know my ſtate, and to ſink deep into God. When I awoke I ſeemed all taken up with divine things; and ſpent part of the remainder of the night in writing, prayer, and praiſes: and had a ſtrong wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of union with my dear Lord. My brother T. from Baltimore ſide came to ſee me, and travelled ſeveral weeks with me: and bleſſed times we had together; for I believe it was on this viſit he felt a witneſs of pardoning love to his ſoul.</p>
            <p>Upon a certain occaſion, I was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully led to think of the place called hell, and was ſeverely baſſeted by the devil. "Hell," ſaid he, <q>is not ſo bad a place as you repreſent it: how can God be a merciful Being, as you ſet him forth, if he ſends people to ſuch a diſmal place for a few ſins, to be tormented for ever?</q> I was earneſtly deſirous to know what kind of place it was. And the Lord condeſcended to ſatisfy me in the dead ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the night. After I feil into a deep
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:023401_0159_0FBF55FE77136550"/>ſleep, I ſeemed to enter through a narrow gate into eternity; and was met by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who conducted me to the place called hell; but I had a very imperfect view of it; I requeſted to be taken where I could ſee it better, if that could be done: I was then conveyed to a ſpot where I had a full view of it. It appeared as large as the ſea, and I ſaw myriads of damned ſouls, in every poſture that miſerable beings could get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. This ſight exceeded any thing of the kind that ever had entered into my mind. But it was not for me to know any of them. Was I to attempt to deſcribe the place as it was repreſented to me, I could not do it. Had I the pen of a ready writer, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic wiſdom, I ſhould fall ſhort. I cried out to my guide, it is enough. With that he brought me to the place where he firſt met me. I then deſired a diſcovery of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: my g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſaid, "not now; return: you have ſeen ſufficient for once; and be more faithful in warning ſinners, and have no more doubts about the reality of hell." Then I inſtantly awoke.</p>

            <head>SECTION VIII. <hi>A ſhort Account of my Labors and Exerciſes on the Weſtern-Shore in the Year</hi> 1780.</head>
            <p>THE Methodiſts being only a ſociety, who were moſtly united (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to communion) to the Church of England; and her miniſters (eſpecially in Virginia and Carolina) in the time of the war were diſperſed, ſo that a large body of people, under the name of Methodiſts, were in a great meaſure deſtitute of the ordinances of the Lord's houſe. In this caſe what was to be done? Our dear Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia brethren thought it expedient to form themſelves into a church, and have the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances among them; which they did in the year 1779. But it was contrary to the minds of the preachers to the North.</p>
            <p>In April 1780, we held a conference in Baltimore; at which brother F. A. bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther W. W. and myſelf thought proper to viſit our brethren at the South: and after a tedious journey of ſeveral hundred miles, we arrived ſafe in Manekin-town: where we found the brethren in conference, fully
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:023401_0161_0FBF5601405864E8"/>perſuaded in their minds that the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired us to be a ſeparate church. We for a conſiderable time conferred together, and much of the divine preſence was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. On both ſides it was painful to part. This the great Governor of the church would not permit; for when the help of man failed, he interpoſed his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent arm, and convinced our brethren, that they ought at leaſt to accede to a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the ordinances for one year, till the founder of our ſociety, Mr. John Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, could be conſulted. A circumſtantial letter was written to that venerable apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the age, which moved his bowels of compaſſion towards us; and he was fully convinced, ſome time after, that he was in duty bound, for the proſperity of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection in America, to do that thing, which he once but little expected—I ſpeak with reſpect to his ſending over a power of ordination, with his approbation of our becoming a ſeparate, tho' Epiſcopal church. Which he did as ſoon as the way was open: and it has proved the riſing glory of the connection.</p>
            <p>Thurſday May 11, having accompliſhed our buſineſs and obtained our wiſhes, we
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:023401_0162_0FBF560969416AA8"/>ſet our faces to the North with gladneſs of heart, praiſing the Lord for his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Thurſday 18, I came to Baltimore, where I was appointed to labor.</p>
            <p>Friday 19, I ſet apart as a day of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and felt my ſoul ſweetly united to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I viſited brother W. L—'s family, and had great fellowſhip with them. Surely ſiſter L. poſſeſſes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love of God.</p>
            <p>Saturday 20, I awoke a little after four o'clock, very much taken up with my dear Redeemer. The company and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's dear children, are bleſſings for which I ſhall never be ſufficiently thankful. I have had many ſweet moments with this dear family. I returned to town, and preached with freedom.</p>
            <p>Sunday 21. As the ſerpent was lifted up in the wilderneſs, ſo did I endeavour to hold up the Saviour of the world to a liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening multitude at the Point-chapel.

In the evening I preached to about five hundred precious ſouls with freedom. My trials are great, but I am borne above the world and ſin.</p>
            <p>Monday 22. I was comfortable whilſt exhibiting the truth to a loving people; and the day following I attended a funeral, and found great freedom to preach. The remaining part of the week, I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably employed in preaching, viſiting our pious friends, and meeting claſſes.</p>
            <p>Sunday 27. I held forth in Gunpowder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neck to many hearers. This is almoſt as old a ſociety as any in Maryland: it is about 12 miles from where I was born. In the evening I preached to a ſtiff-necked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but I believe ſome good was done.— This week was chiefly taken up among my relations and old acquaintances, who are moſtly laying in the arms of the evil one; nevertheleſs I found freedom, by day and night, to offer Jeſus to them.</p>
            <p>Sunday June 3. With delight I viewed the riſing morn; the fields were clad with
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:023401_0164_0FBF560D08867308"/>a beautiful green; the creation ſmiling, and the birds tuning their notes—ſurely an immortal ſpirit ought to praiſe the Creator of the univerſe. Many attended my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in our old Buſh-chapel, among whom were many of my relations and old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, ſome of whom came a diſtance. I found freedom, 1. to point out the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 2. the order, 3. the ſtrength, 4. the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the church; and laſtly, gave an affectionate addreſs, particularly to parents, to tell it to the generations following.— Pſalms xlviii. 12, 13. I had reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the hearts of ſome were ſoftened, and ſome of my relations and old acquaintances began to think that I was not beſide my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I cried the ſame day to many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſouls, <hi>Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?</hi> Luke xiii. 6—9.

            <p>Sunday 10. At the Fork-chapel I found freedom to hold out the willingneſs of Chriſt to ſave all who unfeignedly devote themſelves to him: and afterwards Mr. G. gave a lively exhortation to the Chriſtians to ſtand faſt in the faith: but I fear ſome who were preſent, have turned aſide. In the afternoon I preached at his houſe— from, <hi>Fear not, little flock, for it is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom,</hi> Luke xii. 32. 1. Who are the flock? 2. Why ſmall? 3. What fears are they trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with? and then concluded with an affectionate addreſs. I felt a ſweetneſs in my own ſoul, and ſeveral thought it good to be there.</p>
            <p>Sunday June 17, I preached two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: the firſt in a private houſe, and the ſecond in the Dutch church at Riſter-Town. Part of my retired hours was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up the week following, in the ſtudy of the Revelation. This book is not to be underſtood but by the ſame ſpirit with which it was written. It was not written without tears; with tears we muſt ſit at the feet of Jeſus for an underſtanding of it.
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:023401_0166_0FBF56119B567190"/>I know but little: I muſt ſet out aſreſh, and earneſtly ſeek more grace and knowledge.</p>
            <p>Monday, my dear friend C. rode with me to Mr. V.'s, where the Lord favore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thurſday 21, was a very dull day to me, eſpecially the former part of it.</p>
            <p>Sunday 24, was a day of gladneſs, and I preached with freedom. Monday I met brother W. and brother T. I preached with freedom, and one ſoul was ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Tueſday morning was a refreſhing time to me. I am happy in viſiting the ſick: it is a moſt comfortable thing to have an intereſt in heaven on a dying pillow.</p>

He ſaves them from the guilt, power, love, and practice of ſin. I preached a few miles from town, and the Lord diſplayed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing power. The Chriſtians were all alive, and ſinners crying aloud for mercy; ſo that my voice was almoſt loſt. When I departed, I left one youth, who had been very wicked, ſtruggling as for life, and his companions weeping around him. I know not how many were ſet at liberty; I felt the power of faith, and returned to town, where I preached with freedom to near a thouſand people.

            <p>Monday 17, having been ſent for, I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited aunt B. my father's ſiſter, a very old woman; and ſhe appeared to be near her end. I know not how many years ſhe had been a communicant in the Epiſcopal church; but all this will not avail, if we do not become new creatures. My father had eleven brothers and ſiſters, the moſt of whom lived to be old. They are all gone to a world of ſpirits except one, and ſhe is on the borders of the grave. My heart melted within me. After prayer I left her, and ſhe appeared to have a tender heart.</p>
            <p>Sunday 23. The worth of precious ſouls lays with weight upon me. O! for a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet voice, on all the world to call! After preaching at the Fork-chapel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Sunday 30, brother C. and family ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied me. At ſeven o'clock we had a love-feaſt; about two hundred of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were preſent, and our Saviour was in the midſt. Afterwards I preached in the Dutch church. About thirty of our friends accompanied me about eight miles to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dutch church, where I preached to many with freedom. Many went with me three miles further to Mr. V.'s, where we had a watch-night. The labors of this day were weariſome to the body; but I was ſtrong in faith, and willing to give my little all to God. The next day a crowded audience aſſembled at the ſame place: ſome time before, and whilſt the people were gathering, my mind was uncommonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed: but I found great freedom whilſt inforcing, <hi>Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial, which is to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you.</hi> The cloud was diſperſed, and I felt myſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly ſweet and comfortable.

I appeared to be ſurrounded by thouſands of devils, who were all ſtriving to take from me my confidence; and for a time it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt gone. I began an examination from my firſt awakenings—then my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion—my call to preach—the motives which induced me to enter this great work —my intention, and life from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. In the time of this examination, every fear was diſmiſſed, and every fiend vaniſhed; and a band of holy angels ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with the moſt melodious muſic that I ever heard. I then began to aſcend, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by this heavenly hoſt; and thought every moment the body would drop off, and my ſpirit take its flight. After aſcending a vaſt height, I was over-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a cloud as white as a ſheet; and in that cloud I ſaw a perſon the moſt beautiful that my eyes had behold. I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſlodged from this tabernacle, and take my everlaſting flight. That glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I awoke, and my ſpirit was ſo elevated with a ſenſe of eternal things, that I thought I ſhould ſleep no more that night. Great and glorious diſcoveries have been made to me, both ſleeping and waking; but all the promiſes of heaven and eternal glory have been conditional. In ſcripture we have a little, but ſignificant word, <hi>if</hi>— If you are faithful until death, you ſhall have a crown of life. I would adviſe all the children of God to be very careful and watchful, and continue in well-doing until death. Some ſuppoſe that we ought not to put any dependance in dreams and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We ſhould lay the ſame ſtreſs on them in this our day, as wiſe and good men have done in all ages. Very great diſcoveries were made to Peter, Paul, and others in their night viſions. But is there not a danger of laying too much ſtreſs on them? We are in danger from a variety of quarters: let us therefore bring every thing to, and try it by the ſtandard; taking the Spirit for our guide, and the written word for our rule, we ſhall without doubt go ſafe.</p>

Tueſday Auguſt 2, I preached with great freedom to a crowded audience, and a miniſter of the Reformed Church of Holland gave an exhortation in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man language; as there were ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who did not underſtand Engliſh.</p>
            <p>I paid the town of Baltimore another viſit; and was then under a neceſſity of croſſing the Cheſapeak-bay agreeably to the deſire of Mr. F. Aſbury. During my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence brother D. R. ſupplied my place. In many places during my travels through the Peninſula, we had great diſplays of the power of God; for thouſands gathered to hear the word. The devil was angry, and he and his agents ſpread many moſt ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous reports; ſome of which were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acroſs the bay, and reached the ears of my relations: and ſome of the carnal ones believed the reports. My manner was, to go ſtraight forward in the line of my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When I returned, many gathered, at the Fork-chapel, from all quarters; and among the crowd I eſpied my old uncle T. who had heard and believed the reports; and was determined, as I underſtood, to detect me in the midſt of the people. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall I forget the day; for the Lord
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:023401_0173_0FBF56278E1CD6B8"/>his arm bare, and we had a precious, refreſhing ſhower; and the heart of my dear old uncle was tendered<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and tears flowed down his face. After he left the Chapel, he ſaid to ſome of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, "ſurely my couſin is belied." He came and begged me to go home with him; which I did. The next day he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me five miles; and the tears flowed plentifully. When we were about to part, he aſked me what compenſation he ſhould make me for the benefit which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. "Will you," ſaid he, "receive a ſuit of clothes?" I thanked him kindly, telling him that I had as much clothing as was neceſſary. He then put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out eighty conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental dollars, which at that time were worth about twenty hard dollars; at firſt I refuſed; but he would not be denied. So I took them, and ſome time after gave them to brother S. a man who needed them. When we parted, he told me he expected to ſee me no more—It was ſo; for ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord called him away.</p>
            <p>I continued in this circuit till the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpring, and enjoyed precious moments. Many were added to the ſociety, and many

            <head>SECTION IX. <hi>An Account of my Travels, Exerciſes, and Succeſs, in forming what is called Little York Circuit.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FOR ſome time it was in my mind to viſit Little York, and the country round. The way being open, on Monday the 24th of January 1781, I ſet out, and travelled till evening: and then put up at a tavern, about twelve miles from the town to which I was bound. I lectured in the family on the ſeventh of Matthew; and the Lord began <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s work: that night Mr. W. a gentleman from the town, lodged at the ſame tavern; and in time of family-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:023401_0175_0FBF56319C0FE238"/>the Lord, in mercy, laid his hand of conviction on him.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 25th, I went on to town, and in the afternoon the bell rang, and I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Dutch church; and the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's lady (who was awakened the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before) got her heart touched. When he came home in the evening, he ſpoke to this effect, "My dear, I heard ſuch a man laſt night as I never ſaw or heard before, and if what he ſaid be true, we are all in the way to hell." "I expect," ſaid ſhe, "he is the ſame man whom I heard this afternoon in Wagoner's church; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that his doctrine is true, and that we are all in the way to ruin." "Well," ſaid he, "let us ſet about our ſalvation." "I am willing," ſaid ſhe.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday 26th. As I had ſent forward an appointment, I went on about twenty miles, and preached with a degree of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Having an appointment, I preached at Mr. G.'s, the Lutheran miniſter; and after meeting we had an agreeable converſation. His mother and ſiſter, whoſe hearts the Lord had touched. accompanied me to Berlin, where I preached to a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:023401_0176_0FBF563281723958"/>with great freedom. I again had an opportunity, in the evening, to hold up a loving Saviour to the liſtening multitude.</p>
            <p>By this time a perſecution had ariſen among the people in Little York and around: the enemy of ſouls had taken an advantage of my two friends, who were awakened: being under deep diſtreſs, and ſorely tempted by the devil, not knowing what to do, at length they prepared water, and waſhed themſelves; and then put on clean clothes, and concluded that it was the new birth. And after they came from their room, they kiſſed their two children, who were man and woman well nigh grown, and told them they were new born. Being in a great meaſure bereft of their ſenſes, and the enemy ready to take every advantage, "Come," ſaid they, "old things muſt be done away, and all things muſt become new." They then began to throw their old clothing and blankets <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the fire; and among other things he throw on a large bundle of paper money. "This," ſaid he, "is an old thing, and muſt be done away." The neighbours being alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ran in and ſaved many things: but I
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:023401_0177_0FBF5633F53E5B18"/>ſuppoſe they did not ſuſtain leſs than fifteen pounds loſs. A miniſter was ſent for, and he deſired a doctor to be called; for they knew not what was the matter. A Quak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> woman came to ſee them, and ſhe ſaid, "She did not know of any one that could be of ſervice to them, unleſs it was the man that was the occaſion of it." The cry was, ſuch a man ought not to go through the country: and others deſired me to be brought and put into gaol. I was about twenty miles off, and as ſoon as I heard of it, mounted my horſe and got to them as quick as poſſible. When the neighbours ſaw me, ſeveral gathered into the room. When I entered the houſe, I perceived that the woman looked ſtrange, and the man was in bed under the hands of the doctor, with ſeveral bliſter-plaiſters on him. I ſat down by his bedſide (ſhe ſat on the foot of the bed) and aſked him what he wanted—"To be new born," ſaid he. Taking out my little bible, I read and lectured on a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and ſenſibly felt that the Lord was preſent to hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I deſired them to take his bliſter-plaiſters off. Glory to God! he reſtored them, not only to their natural, but ſpiritual ſenſes. A good and gracious God has his own way of working among the children of men. Though at firſt it cauſed a great diſtreſs to lay upon my mind; yet in the end it was for good; many were aſtoniſhed and brought to a ſerious conſideration. Although the church door was ſhut againſt me, a large ſchool, room was opened, in which I preached a ſermon on the occaſion, to about three hundred ſouls; and the Lord touched the hearts of many: and my two mad people (as they had been called) were able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Lord: and it was not long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In the evening I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to many in the miniſter's own houſe, and there was an inquiry how to obtain mercy. In the country Satan began to rage as well as in town.

            <p>Wedneſday 22. I had a tedious journey to Colcheſter; but found the parents of one family (who were awakened when I was there before) mourning for Jeſus; and I had freedom to preach to the people. In the morning I ſet out again for Berlin, and miſſed my way. I am burdened—ſurely it is a burden which the Lord hath laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and it is for the beſt. I called at an houſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I can prove to you, ſaid I, that it is out of your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſell your children to the devil, for they belong to God.

After he had got the horſe, I deſired her to make ready, and go to preaching with her huſband. "O," ſaid ſhe, "I cannot think of leaving my dear little children in the arms of the devil." After ſome time ſhe was prevailed on to go.

<pb n="182" facs="unknown:023401_0181_0FBF56402CF8DCF8"/>and I will praiſe thee! thou art kind, and I will give glory to thy holy name!</p>
            <p>Friday February 24, I returned to town, and the perſecution was ſo hot, that I thought it moſt expedient to preach at Mr. W.'s, a mile out of town. Many gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we had a moving time. The next day we had a powerful ſeaſon; and the hearts of ſome of my enemies were reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Sunday February 26. I never ſaw ſo many out in this place before, and even ſome who had thought it a ſin to hear me. And I never ſaw a more general moving in any place where preaching had been ſo ſhort a time. In this county there were, I think, ſixteen different denominations, and ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Wedneſday February 28, I returned to try the town again, and found the people very ſtill; and we had a ſolemn, uſeful
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:023401_0182_0FBF564256C85238"/>time. Lodged at Mr. S.'s, and felt my ſpirit much refreſhed.</p>
            <p>Tueſday March 1. Being deſired the day before to viſit a diſtreſſed man, one who was troubled with an evil ſpirit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween day-break and ſunriſe, I called his miniſter out of bed, and deſired him to go with me. We went, and I deſired all to leave the room, except the diſtreſſed man, his wife, the miniſter, and myſelf. I then deſired him to open to me his caſe. He ſaid "for a long time the devil had followed him, and that he had frequently ſeen him with his bodily eyes." The dear man was under conviction, but knew not what was the matter with him. I told him my experience, and gave him as good directions as I was capable of. I prayed for him, and ſo likewiſe did his miniſter in Dutch; and I underſtood afterward, that he was troubled no more in the ſame way, and became one of my quiet hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>I viſited the country, and experienced great diſplays of the awakening power of God; for many precious ſouls were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the way to heaven, both Dutch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="184" facs="unknown:023401_0183_0FBF5645F136D0E0"/>and preached to about three hundred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by candle-light; but ſome were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I appointed to preach the next even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In town there were many ſoldiers billeted, and the officers declared that if I came to attempt to preach again, that they would have me to gao!—So I underſtood by my friends; who deſired me to decline. I was not afraid of their threats, but in the evening attended the appointment. Shortly after I had taken my text—<hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi>

            <p>Saturday 20, I preached at Mr. H. P.'s, and the Lutheran miniſter who met me, gave an exhortation after I had done, in Dutch.</p>
            <p>Sunday 21, I preached at the ſame place at eight o'clock to hundreds. I then rode five miles, and preached in a large barn at twelve o'clock, but many could not get in. More than a hundred followed me from the morning preaching, and many of them were crying for mercy. One man came to me in a flood of tears—"Sir," ſaid he, "can you tell me what I ſhall do to be ſaved, for I am the wickedeſt man in the whole county." I exhorted him to put his truſt and confidence in God. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cry among the people was, "This is the right religion."—It did appear to me, as if ſects, and names, and parties would fall; and only the name of Chriſt be all in all. I rode ſix miles farther followed by many, and preached with freedom at four o'clock. And in the evening I had great freedom to preach in town. It would be too tedious for me to give an account of every particular; yea, I could not do it.
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:023401_0185_0FBF564E03382090"/>During my ſtay in this part of the Lord's vineyard, which was a little more than two months, I preached in more than twenty different places: and I then thought that there were more than three hundred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under powerful awakenings; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had found the pardoning love of God, and were happy; and I joined about a hundred in ſociety the laſt week of my ſtay in the parts, and was very ſorry that I could not ſtay a longer time with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—Though I was ſucceeded by a faithful preacher, the work afterwards did not proſper in the manner I expected.</p>

            <head>SECTION X. <hi>A ſhort Account of my Travels till the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Conference,</hi> 1781.</head>
            <p>OUR conference was attended with a bleſſing. All the travelling-preachers were willing to abide by Mr. Weſley's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſpecting the ordinances. I was appointed to Suſſex circuit in Virginia: but found it to be ſomewhat difficult to travel; for it was the time when Cornwallis was ranſacking the country. In Virginia it was a time of diſtreſs indeed, and there was a call for great faith and patience.</p>
            <p>June 4th, 1781, I got into the circuit, and had an appointment at Ellis's chapel. When I entered the door I ſaw a man in the pulpit dreſſed in black, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e was at prayer. I ſoon perceived her was a man bereft of his reaſon. I went into the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit and deſired him to give over. After he ended, I gave out his text, and began to preach. But I had no other way to ſtop him, than to deſire the people to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw. His teſtimony was, that he was a prophet ſent of God to teach the people;
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:023401_0187_0FBF565084CF81A0"/>and that it was revealed to him, a perſon was to interrupt him in his diſcourſe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few minutes the people returned, and all was ſtill. I then gave out, <hi>Feed my ſheep,</hi> John xxi. 17. I had liberty in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1. the character in the text—ſheep; 2. why the followers of our Lord might be called ſheep; and, 3. how the ſheep are to be fed. 1. The ſhepherd; 2. the food; and, 3. the manner of feeding the flock. The prophet returned home, and that night he told his family, at ſuch an hour he would go into a trance; and that they muſt not bury him till after ſuch a time, ſhould he not come to. Accordingly, to appearance he was in a trance. The next day I was ſent for to viſit him. Many were weeping around the bed. He lay like a corpſe, for I could not perceive that he breathed. He was once happy in God, and a ſenſible, uſeful man. About the time of which he ſpoke, he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Satan was partly diſappointed; for in a meaſure he was reſtored to his reaſon, and I took him part of the way round the circuit with me. What was the cauſe of this? Satan prompted him to think more highly of himſelf than he ought; and to
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:023401_0188_0FBF5658C826F9A0"/>ſet himſelf up for ſome great one; and ſo he fell into the condemnation of the devil. I had a hope before we parted, his fallen ſoul was reſtored; and ſome time after he began again to preach Chriſt; and, I truſt, was more humble than ever. I continued on this circuit about three months, and had many happy hours, and ſome diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones. Two things cauſed a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs on my mind, 1. the ſpirit of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, 2. that of ſlavery which ran among the people. I was reſolved to be found in my duty, and keep back no part of the counſel of God. Day and night I could hear the ſoaring of the cannon, for I was not far from York, during the ſiege or taking of Cornwallis. Many of our pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friends were abſolutely againſt fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome of them ſuffered much on that account. Some of them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled or taken by force into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e field; though they would ſooner loſe their own lives, than take the life of any human creature. I ſaw it my duty to cry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own this kind of proceeding, declaring that it was not precedented (to compel perſons to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght contrary to their conſciences) in the oracles of God. I was, in a particular
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:023401_0189_0FBF565A48B9CF78"/>manner, led to preach againſt the practice of ſlave-holding. Several were convinced of the impiety of the practice, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated their ſlaves; and many others, who did not liberate them, were convinced that they ought to uſe them better than they had done. Had it not been for thoſe two evils which lay ſo heavy on me, I might have been more popular among the people. I preached at a quarterly meeting at Maber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's chapel, where there were about two thouſand preſent, of all ranks; and being preſſed in ſpirit, I cried, <hi>Do juſtice, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.</hi> There were more than a thouſand people who could not get into the chapel: ſome of thoſe without called for an officer to take me. After meeting was ended, I walked through the midſt of them, but no one laid hands on me. During my ſtay in this circuit, many backſliders were reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and though my trials were great, I had many refreſhing ſeaſons.</p>
            <p>Saturday and Sunday Auguſt 12 and 13, I attended a quarterly meeting in Nanſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond circuit; and travell d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>everal times round it, poſſeſſing a great love for the people. Mrs. G. (a woman of note) and
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:023401_0190_0FBF565BB3E556E0"/>her niece, came out to hear the word; both were convinced, and became famous for piety.</p>
            <p>Friday 25, I preached near a place call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Deſert. I am informed that this wilderneſs is twenty miles broad, and fifty long; and in the middle of it is a lake three miles wide and five long; in which is abundance of fiſh of various kinds. I am alſo informed, that when the Indians were driven from this part of Carolina, many of them fled to this deſert, in which they found a ſmall ſpot of high land, where they lived moſtly on roots and fiſh, till they were driven out by the wild beaſts of the deſert. I am farther informed that it is inhabited by panthers, bears, wolves, and wild cats in abundance: and that they are of a very large ſize.</p>
            <p>I am now in my element—forming a new circuit—and I have pleaſing proſpects. I preached in one peace, and there was a great ſhaking among the people. I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again the next day, and the power of the Lord in a moſt wonderful manner came down.—I was ſomewhat ſurprized— the rich are brought to mourn for Chriſt. Several fell under the word. A major was
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:023401_0191_0FBF565D32C91D28"/>ſo powerfully wrought on, that I ſuppoſe he would have fallen from his ſeat, had not the colonel held him up. A large ſociety was united in this place, moſtly of the rich. About this time I received a letter from Mr. F. A. in which I was informed that he could not viſit the ſouth, and that it was his deſire I ſhould ſee to ſtationing the preachers.</p>
            <p>In November I began my autumn viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Saturday and Sunday 3d and 4th, the Brunſwick quarterly meeting was held; at which about twelve preachers met, and had their different appointments. We had a bleſſed time at this meeting. I travelled (by the deſire of the brethren) largely through the circuits, and my dear Lord was powerfully preſent in many places to heal. I met with much trouble from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral who were not willing to give up the adminiſtration of the ordinances.</p>
            <p>Tueſday January 29, I unexpectedly met Mr. F. A. (as he had concluded it was beſt to come down) who requeſted me to viſit the circuits on the north ſide of James ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; which I promiſed to do, as ſoon as I had fulfilled my appointments already made. I did not accompliſh this till the mouth of
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:023401_0192_0FBF56650E180C28"/>March, for I had to viſit my new circuit, where I had crowds to hear the word; and ſeveral of the Engliſh churches were open; and many enquiring after eternal life.</p>
            <p>March 14. Having finiſhed my rout, I croſſed James river, and entered Fluvannah circuit: and felt my heart cloſely united with the dear children of God, ſome of whom have emancipated their ſlaves. I found them in great confuſion about the ordinances at the Brokenback church, and favorably hope that my viſit was for good, for I was greatly drawn out in preaching the word.</p>
            <p>Saturday 23 and Sunday 24th, I attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my brother Richard Garrettſon's quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting; and we both had great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to preach the word, and a precious, powerful time. This meeting was held at colonel F.'s, a moſt precious man; one who ſpeaks boldly for his maſter, and has liberated many ſlaves. My brother travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſeveral days with me, and we had ſweet times together.</p>
            <p>Saturday 30th of March, I travelled on my way to Hanover circuit, and had ſome very agreeable converſation with a ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="194" facs="unknown:023401_0193_0FBF566703F37980"/>of ſalvation; though at firſt very unwilling to let it be known.</p>
            <p>Sunday 31, I preached in the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian meeting-houſe at Ground-Squirrel; but I do not know of any good done, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept prejudice removed. I paſt round the circuit, preaching day and night with a degree of ſucceſs, and my ſpirit was daily refreſhed.</p>
            <p>Sunday 5, I preached in the church in King and Queen. We had ſuch a ſhout in the camp of Iſrael, that my voice was loſt. Saturday we had a powerful meeting at dear brother S.'s. The good old man told me, it was revealed to him ſeveral months before, that I ſhould preach in his houſe. (I have heard much of you, ſaid he, and have had a longing deſire to ſee you.) I perceived that the Lord had bleſt my brother Richard's labors in this place. I ſet ſeveral days apart for retirement, and earneſtly deſired to drink more deeply into the Spirit of God. O, for a cloſer walk with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Saturday 11, as I was on my way to my appointment, my chaiſe turned over, and the horſe being ſcared, broke the chaiſe and harneſs, ſo that I was under a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of borrowing a horſe and ſaddle. The next day I preached in the church, and my chaiſe being fitted up, I ſet out on my way, accompanied by brother D. We rode all day through the rain, and on Wedneſday we got to Surry, where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was to be held. My reward is not with man: if it was I ſhould be poorly off. We ſettled our conference concerns as far as we could, and adjourned till the third Tueſday in May: when it was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Baltimore. On Sunday I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the quarterly meeting in Suſſex with Mr. F. A. When I came to Leeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh I found the ſmall-pox very brief; and when I got into Baltimore-Town it was more ſo; and my ſcruples being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, I was inoculated; for which I have had no reaſon to repent. My labors in Virginia the paſt year were not altogether in vain. I think my dear Lord made me inſtrumental in uniting to us many of our brethren, who had diſagreed with us about the ordinances, both preachers and people.
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:023401_0195_0FBF5669F277BD20"/>I can ſay it was a year of humiliation; and humbly believe I grew in knowledge as well as grace.</p>

I was willing to go in the ſpring, but I felt an unwillingneſs to expoſe myſelf in the dead of winter, in the back ſettlements, where all were ſtrangers to our doctrine and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.

In Auguſt 1784, I received a letter from brother F. A. in which I was deſired to prepare for a journey to Charleſton, as quick as poſſible. At that time I was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in Talbot circuit, and had great freedom among the people. Our dear Lord was laying a foundation for, and carrying on a moſt glorious work. I have no doubt but hundreds were awakened that ſummer, in the circuit. Dear brother M. (who was called the weeping prophet) travelled with me; and the Lord owned his labors. The moſt of my time, during this ſtation, was ſpent in Kent, Suſſex, and Talbot circuits; where we had glorious gatherings to the ſociety. It was not uncommon to ſee from one to four thouſand people at a quarterly meeting; and I was ready to conclude, that the whole Peninſula would flame with the glory of God. I was reſolved, by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Lord, to leave the circuit as quick as poſſible, and ſet out on my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Charleſton, which I did after the Tuckehoe quarterly meeting, at which I preached my farewell ſermon to a name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crowd bathed in tears. I went as far as Dover, and intended to ſtay at R. B.'s. <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a few days. The evening following
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:023401_0197_0FBF5673C300E7D8"/>a friend came to my room, and informed me that doctor Coke had arrived, and was below. I went down, and received him and brother W. as welcome meſſengers; and accompanied them the next day to a quarterly meeting held at Barrot's chapel. Dear Mr. Weſley had gratified the deſires of thouſands of his friends in America, in ſending a power of ordination, and giving his conſent to our becoming a ſeparate church. About fifteen preachers were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and it was concluded that I ſhould go through the continent, and call a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at Baltimore immediately. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſix weeks, after travelling upwards of twelve hundred miles, I ſettled the buſineſs, beſides preaching almoſt every day, once, and ſometimes twice, and made my return. The preachers being gathered, our confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence began on Chriſtmas-day, and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded to the method propoſed by Mr. Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley: and men were ſet apart, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated for the different orders of the church. And inſtead of Charleſton, I had an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to take charge of the work in the Eaſt. I was tempted (if it was a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) to think that the nomination was partial; however I was reſolved, with the
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:023401_0198_0FBF56753A96E6C0"/>bleſſing of the Lord, to go as long as my ſtrength would admit; any where, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, as might be thought beſt.

In two week I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled about three hundred miles, and preached twenty ſermons (though the ſnow was deep) to many attentive hearers; and I truſt ſome were brought under a ſerious concern about their ſouls: and a few old Methodiſts, who were emigrants from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, rejoiced to hear that glorious found, which they had been accuſtomed ſo often to hear in their native land. When I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to Halifax, I found freedom to preach to the people, but labored under many trials. My few kind friends in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax were not willing that I ſhould leave
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:023401_0200_0FBF52CBDD2CAC78"/>them. The harveſt is great, and the labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are few. I muſt go where there is a probability of doing the moſt good. There are thouſands of poor ſouls in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who are deſtitute of a ſpiritual ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd—yea, I fear in the open field of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="202" facs="unknown:023401_0201_0FBF52CD38CFF200"/>appeared to be a ſmall moving on the minds of individuals. I ſtaid a few days in this town, and preached ſeveral ſermons; and I doubt not but there were ſeveral powerfully awakened—and about twelve, whoſe hearts ſeemed to be touched, joined in ſociety.</p>
            <p>I travelled through Wilmut, Granſville, Annapolis, and Digby, and had many to hear, but few were willing to give their hearts to God. In D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>by they were deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of a miniſter of any denomination, and I fear of religion too; and in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they were but a ſmall remove from it in Annapolis—true they had Mr. B. for their miniſter; but his diſcourſes were not adapted to the awakening of ſleepy ſinners. Can theſe dry bones live? O! that there may be a ſhaking, and a little army raiſed up to praiſe the Lord! Many took me to be their enemy, and would not come to hear the word. I had many ſorrowful hours, and ſhed many tears on account of the wickedneſs of the people; but my dear Lord comforted my ſoul.</p>
            <p>Sunday June 5, 1785, I preached to many in Mr. E.'s barn; at eleven o'clock I adminiſtered the ſacrament to a few. In
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:023401_0202_0FBF52CEB57C94C8"/>the afternoon I preached again. Monday I preached at Horton, on the freedom of the will: and Tueſday met brother C. at Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. The day following about twenty of our friends, after ſermon, communicated with us; and we had a feaſt of love. Brother C. went on his way to Cumberland, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply brother B.'s place; for I had written to him to come to Halifax; and the Lord made him a bleſſing to the people in that city. After ſpending a few more weeks in thoſe country-towns, with a degree of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and ſucceſs, I returned to and ſpent ſome time in Halifax, and found that bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther B.'s labors had not been in vain.</p>
            <p>Tueſday July 26. I embarked for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpool, and landed ſafe on Friday, and had a time of refreſhment whilſt preaching in the meeting-houſe. Captain D. who has ſince gone to heaven, ſome time before any of us came to this town, met with a little tract, written by Mr. Weſley, called the character of a Methodiſt, and having a great deſire to hear one of thoſe men, ſent to Shelburne, and deſired brother I. M. to give them a viſit, which he did ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and many of the people were very fond of his doctrine; but he was much
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:023401_0203_0FBF52D68D3B0A08"/>oppoſed by a company of warm profeſſors of religion, who were the followers of one Mr. A. One Lord's-day he went into the meeting-houſe to preach, and a party of thoſe zealous diſciples were determined if poſſible to prevent it; and in all probability would, had not the magiſtrate interfered: Colonel P. as mild a man in nature as any to be found, as well as a well-wiſher to all religious perſuaſions, reaſoned very coolly with them, but to little purpoſe, till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther magiſtrate ſpoke more roughly, and then they gave over, and left the houſe. After this they did not attempt an open attack, but ſtrove to prejudice the people againſt us.</p>
            <p>When I came to town, I found that by the preaching of brother M. and brother C. the Lord had begun a work, and they had united twenty in ſociety. In this town there were about one thouſand inhabitants, beſides little children. I was much pleaſed with the people, and found great freedom to preach the word. I began to preach at five o'clock in the morning; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being moſtly raiſed amongſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="205" facs="unknown:023401_0204_0FBF52D88C529A20"/>I ſtaid in the town about four weeks, during which time I preached three, and ſometimes four ſermons on the Lord's day; and frequently on other evenings: and viſited from houſe to houſe. When I departed, I left forty in ſociety, ſeveral of whom had found pardon, and ſeveral were under deep diſtreſs; and I can ſay for my own part, it was a precious ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>In Auguſt I embarked for and arrived ſafe in Shelburne, where I found ſixteen members of ſociety of whites, and ſome blacks, who were united by brother C. In this town there are many precious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, moſtly refugees, and prone to evil as the ſpark is to fly upwards. In this town we had a little preaching-houſe which was built by Mr. W.; and would accommodate about two hundred people. During my ſtay my manner was as follows, viz. in the morning to preach in Shelburne at nine o'clock: then to walk to Burchtown three miles off, and preach to the black people at twelve o'clock: (there were about five hundred in the town who were able to attend, and they had built themſelves a church) then to return and preach in Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>urne at five o'clock, and likewiſe by can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-light.
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:023401_0205_0FBF52D9F58E4FD8"/>I had not preached long till our church would not contain the people, ſo that many went away for want of room. Mr. W. miniſter of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, gave me an invitation to preach in his church: which I did three Sabbaths at five o'clock: and then there was no more place for me there. So I ſtood on a large rock in the ſtreet, and cried, <hi>On this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> Matt. xvi. 18. Our friends ſoon enlarged our little houſe, ſo that it would accommodate three or four hundred; but ſtill it would by no means hold as many as wiſhed to hear. Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to my deſire, the blacks of Shelburne bunt themſelves a little houſe at the North end of the town, and I preached to them ſeparately, in order to have more room for the whites.</p>
            <p>Our dear Maſter began to carry on a bleſſed work; but the devil and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were angry. They frequently ſtoned the houſe; and one night a company came out, and ſtrove (as it ſtood by the brow of a hill on pillars) to ſhove it down.—Whilſt I was preaching to near four hundred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by candle-light, they were beating un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:023401_0206_0FBF52E0F3190A18"/>to get away the pillars—In the midſt of my preaching I cried out, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are dogs, ſorcerers, whoremongers, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lie.</hi> The company ran off with a hideous yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and we were left to worſhip God peaceably.</p>
            <p>During my ſtay in and around Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne (which was ſix weeks) numbers both white and black, were added to the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and many taſted the good word of God, and felt the powers of the world to come.</p>
            <p>Being under an engagement again to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the new ſocieties where I had been, I embarked for Liverpool. Shortly after we hoiſted ſail (a man-of-war lay in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) an officer ſaid to his fellows, "He is going," and they cried amain, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Methodiſt parſon! hail the Methodiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> parſon!" Our captain paid no attention to them; but they followed us with a bullet from a cannon, though we paſſed on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt. I touched at Liverpool and ſtaid two weeks, and found the work of the Lord proſpering under the miniſtry of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I. M. From thence I went to Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax, and found the work proſpering under
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:023401_0207_0FBF52E303F726E8"/>the miniſtry of brother B. I ſtaid two weeks, and preached with a ſmall degree of freedom. I want to do good! I want to live to the honor of my dear Lord! I want to be all glorious within! When, O when will my warfare with Satan end? Not till my work is done! I reſign— Lord, I am willing to wait thine own good time.</p>
            <p>My cuſtom was to travel moſtly by ſea, in the ſummer; and by land, in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and the Lord was with me.</p>
            <p>I ſpent the moſt of this winter in the different towns between Halifax and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napolis; and there was a gathering to the ſociety. My mind was often troubled with people of a diſputatious turn of mind; and was grieved at the hardneſs of their hearts. Whilſt in the wilderneſs, ſurrounded by the impious, my mind was ſtaid on my dear Lord.</p>
            <p>In the ſpring 1786, I paid Liverpool my third viſit; and from thence went to Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, and found that a black man, by the name of M—t, from England, had done much hurt. Surely if lady H. had him put into the miniſtry (as he gave this account) her ladyſhip was much deceived in the man;
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:023401_0208_0FBF52E487336628"/>or elſe he has ſince become an amazing bad one. I left near two hundred blacks in ſociety, and at my return I did not find half that number. When I went to their town, I called them together, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of his character. Many of them were convinced of their error, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſociety; ſo that in the whole we only loſt about twenty perſons. I likewiſe applied to their colonel, who was a black, or rather a yellow man, to have him put out of the town, which he conſented to; ſo there was once more a proſpect of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity among them.</p>
            <p>A town called Barrington lay heavy on my mind, and I had a great deſire to viſit its inhabitants. This town lies about thirty miles to the South Weſt of Shelburne, having no other than a ſmall foot-path which leads to it; ſo that I was under the neceſſity of going by ſea, or on foot. I ſet out with A. E. for a pilot, as he had been there. I preached at Port-Roſeway, where we had a ſmall ſociety. From thence we went to Cape Negro, where we were kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained by old Mr. S. who I truſt had a love for our Saviour. With free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom I preached to a few families, and the
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:023401_0209_0FBF52E5F93395D0"/>Lord began a good work. From thence I went to Barrington; and after wading good part of the way nearly half-leg deep in mud and water, we got into town about three o'clock on the third day of our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from Shelburne. I did not know of one perſon who would receive me, ſo I ſat down on a large ſtone in the town, not far from the meeting-houſe. Their form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er miniſter who had left them, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, had written a letter in which he ſaid, there was one Garrettſon going through the country, who was a dangerous Arminian; and adviſed them to be careful. I deſired Mr. E. my companion and pilot, to notify the inhabitants, that a ſtranger had come to town, and intended at an hour by ſun to preach in the meeting-houſe. The hour commenced and I had about twenty hearers; and appointed to preach the next day at the ſame time. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all withdrew, and there was no one to ſay, Will you go home with me? I told my friend, he muſt get a home as he could, and I went to the houſe of a gentleman who aſked me to drink tea, but not to ſtay all night. I aſked him if there was a board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, or taver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="211" facs="unknown:023401_0210_0FBF52F01BB3DF88"/>was not, and it was not convenient for me to ſtay with him, or he would make me welcome. However, rather than ſtay out all night, I went to another houſe; and gave myſelf an invitation, and was not denied.</p>
            <p>The next day about thirty came out to hear; and I then had an invitation to an houſe. The day following I appointed to preach morning, afternoon, and evening; but the people were much afraid of being deceived. My mind was greatly diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and I was almoſt ready to leave the place; for the people looked very coldly on me.</p>
            <p>About an hundred came to hear; I preached two ſermons, and concluded not to preach in the evening, as I had an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to go home with Mr. S. a very cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man, who lived on a little iſland about ſeven miles off: in this man I found a friend. On this little iſland I preached ſeveral ſermons with freedom: and began to think, that the Lord had a work for me to do.</p>
            <p>The following Friday I went to another little iſland, to Mrs. D.'s, who had a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for religious people. Whilſt I was
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:023401_0211_0FBF52F1F5975C40"/>on this iſland, a Mr. C. came; whom I invited by a meſſenger to attend my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and ſpeak after me; but this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. In the evening I preached on the main land, not far from the meeting-houſe, to a few; but pride and unbelief keep out the word. Saturday I attended the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Mr. C. To-morrow, ſaid I (after meeting was out) I have an appointment in the meeting-houſe; and the days are long enough for us both to preach: this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; but appointed to preach in a private houſe. This kind of conduct in him aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſpectators; but ſtill the people were afraid of the Arminians.</p>
            <p>Sunday. This morning my mind was amazingly diſtreſſed. I was afraid the Lord had not called me to this town. I mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſecret, and intreated the Lord to make it manifeſt that he had ſent me to this place, by a diſplay of his convincing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er among the people. The hour came, and I repaired to the meeting-houſe; none were preſent but my pilot (and he was greatly ſhaken, and in doubt which wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As I was again aſcending the hill, toward the meeting-houſe, reſolving within myſelf, that if the people did not attend, and if the word was not bleſt, I would leave the town, and conclude that I was not called thereto. But I ſaw the people coming from every part of the town, and in a ſhort time we had a large gathering, and immediately the cloud broke from my mind, and with a gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d heart I aſcended the pulpit ſtairs; and the word of the Lord ſeemed all open to me. I preached and the flame ran through the aſſembly: in the afternoon I preached again, with the ſame freedom. Among two or three hundred people, it appeared as though there were but few preſent, but in a greater or leſs degree felt the flame. After meeting was ended, they came around me on every hand in tears; and I ſuppoſe I had invitations to more than twenty houſes.</p>
            <p>Having an appointment at Shelburne, we ſet out; but after I got there I ſtaid only a few days, and returned to take care of the awakened fouls. And in my return, I
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:023401_0213_0FBF52F51176AC30"/>called at Cape Negro; and the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a bleſſed work in ſeveral families there. When I got to Barrington, I found many hungering after the word. I took the town in rotation, and viſited the greater part of the families; and I went to but few houſes, at which there had been no awakenings. Mrs. A. and two of 'ſquire H.'s ſons' wives, had experienced the pardoning love of God; together with ſeveral others. Now it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I paid Cape Negro a viſit, and found Mrs. S. under deep conviction, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others; I preached with freedom, and returned, accompanied by near a dozen, and among the reſt was old Mrs. S. under deep diſtreſs of ſoul, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Mr. A. who had been at ſea, and had never heard a Methodiſt, came home in the midſt of this ſtir; and the Lord touched his heart, and he wept at his feet. Mrs. D. (wife to the 'ſquire) and ſeveral others were powerfully wrought upon. I viſited them; and Mrs.

A young woman under deep diſtreſs, who was at her houſe, retired, and was reſolved not to reſt till her ſoul was bleſt: and ſo it was, for about three o'clock the Lord gave her a new heart, and put a joyful ſong in her mouth. She came where I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the afternoon, full of love, and went all round the houſe among the young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and talked to them, to the admiration of all preſent. I preached from, <hi>Our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in unto you is not in vain.</hi> I viſited Mr. A. who was under deep diſtreſs. "O! ſaid he, what an alteration there is in the town—the people do not look like the ſame."</p>
            <p>By this time the Lord had raiſed up a young preacher, J. M. who came to me, and was helpful in the work. I continued in Shelburne, Barrington, and the adjacent ſettlements around, till Autumn; and our dear Lord did great things for many. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a neceſſity to viſit the Eaſt, I left
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:023401_0215_0FBF5334B76DA6C8"/>J. M. to take care of the new-born chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and embarked for Liverpool; where there had been a bleſſed work under brother I. M. I think he informed me, that the Lord made uſe of the ſudden death of our our worthy friend captain D. to begin this revival. I find a great alteration in this town. The firſt time I viſited the people here, we only had ſeven communicants; the ſecond time we had twenty; the third viſit we had near forty; and now we have more than ſixty. Many in this town were taught to believe, that none ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate but ſuch as have the witneſs of their juſtification. In my third viſit, two women came to me on Saturday evening, and ſaid, "we wiſh to commune to-morrow if we can get admittance." They ſaid it was preſſed on their minds as a duty. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they were mourning after a Saviour; and told them, I was willing that they ſhould commemorate the death of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, whoſe moſt precious blood was ſhed for the remiſſion of their ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to expect a bleſſing at the table. That night my enemies got hold of it, and it ran through the town that I had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted two unconverted women to the table.
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:023401_0216_0FBF533643CEDA80"/>The next day we had a precious time at the communion, and the Lord viſited the ſouls of thoſe two women whilſt at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: the change ſeemed viſible to many of the ſpectators—and our enemies when they heard of it, were aſhamed. I went to Halifax, Windſor, Horton and Coruwallis, where I ſpent the winter; except a few excurſions through a few other adjacent ſettlements. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orton, this winter, I favorably hope the Lord did bleſs my weak endeavours—I preached the word with freedom in different parts of the town; and many were added to the ſociety. There are many in that town that are near to me, and I ſhall not ſoon forget the kindneſs ſhewed me by Mr. and Mrs. C. Mr. and Mrs. S. and ſeveral others. O! that our good and gracious God may look on all thoſe who ſhew kindneſs to his children; and grant them the ſanctifying influence of his holy Spirit. I received a letter from Dr. Coke, in which I was requeſted to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Baltimore conference. It was with reluctance I came to this country; but I now feel a willingneſs to labor and ſuffer in the cauſe of God among this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I came to Windſor, where I had
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:023401_0217_0FBF5337C47484A8"/>great conſolation. Mrs. S. was a woman of a moſt excellent ſpirit, and her huſband was a very kind man. Dear Mrs. S. I underſtand has ſince gone to Abraham's boſom—ſhe is amply compenſated for all her labors of love—<hi>I was hungry, and ye fed me; naked, and ye clothed me; ſick, and in priſon, and ye came unto me</hi>—The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's body—his children—are near to him. I came to Halifax, where I found our good friend Mr. M. buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in building us a church. Of all the women whom I have met with, I have not found one more kind than Mrs M. but ſhe is now no more: and my heart was glad, when I heard that her faith was ſtrong in her laſt moments. I travelled, labored, and ſuffered in this country, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than two years. My dear Lord was with me by land and ſea. After all, I am an unprofitable ſervant—my greateſt wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Monday April 10, 1787, I bade my Halifax friends farewell; and ſo leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my dear Nova-Scotians, embarked with captain Wilſon for Boſton. I think I left behind about 600 members of ſociety.</p>

               </gap>ation of our lives and veſſel we came to anchor between two iſlands. I had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of preaching on each iſland; and gave a few books to the poor, and left ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in tears, whoſe hearts the Lord had touched. On Wedneſday 19, I landed in Boſton: preached a few ſermons with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was kindly entertained by Mr. S. and on Monday 24, took the ſtage for Providence. Here I ſtaid at Mr. S.'s, who is a godly Preſbyterian miniſter.— The bell rang the next day at ſix o'clock, and I found freedom to preach. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ening following I preached again to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſerious hearers, in Mr. S.'s meeting-houſe. I had ſome converſation with a deiſt, who appeared to be good-natured in his way.

From Newport I ſailed to New-York, where I had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to preach in the Methodiſt church on Sunday April 30. After ſpending a few days agreeably there, I took a ſaddle-horſe, and rode through the Jerſeys, and had an agreeable time among my old friends; and ſo came to Philadelphia on Saturday.</p>
            <p>On the Lord's-day, I found great freedom in preaching there to a people very near to me; and was rejoiced to find the church in a proſperous way. I then purſued my way to Baltimore: where many of the dear ſervants of God met in conference. It was the deſire of Mr. Weſley and others, that I ſhould be ſet apart for the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency of the work in Nora-Scotia—my mind was divided—man is a fallible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—In the end I concluded not to leave the ſtates; for thouſands in this country are dear to me.

<pb n="221" facs="unknown:023401_0220_0FBF534305EEC898"/>relations, I ſet out on my way to fulfil my appointment.</p>
            <p>Friday 19th, I called on that loving ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety at Duck-creek-croſs-roads, and had great freedom to preach the word.</p>
            <p>Saturday 20th, I got to Mr. B.'s, and on Sunday preached with freedom in the Methodiſt church in Dover. I viſited B. and P. and found them ſtill in a backſliding ſtate. This week was ſpent joyfully among a people whom I had not ſeen for a long time.</p>
            <p>Sunday May 28, 1787. I preached in Tuckehoe church to about a thouſand peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Many happy moments I have had in this Neck in years paſt, and we have not forgotten old tunes. A ſpiritual gale ran through the congregation—my conſola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>on and the conſolation of the people was ſo great, that I appointed to preach in the ſame church the next day; and had near as many hearers as there were the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. After ſermon I rode on my way, and unexpectedly met a congre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="222" facs="unknown:023401_0221_0FBF5344730CBDA8"/>many others of my old friends; and had great freedom in a lecture on the parable of the prodigal ſon, to a crowded audience who aſſembled in the evening.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 30th. At Talbot court-houſe I was ſurpriſed to ſee the gathered multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from all quarters. I ſuppoſe there were above five hundred more than our little chapel could hold. Lord, keep me humble! I fear many had a greater deſire to ſee the ſervant, than to partake of the crumbs from the Maſter's table. Many were diſappointed, for I had very little li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The people in this part of the country ſeem as if they would be all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts. It is a ſmall thing to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt in name only; but it is a great thing to love the Lord with all the heart, and our neighbour as ourſelves.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday 31. In the forenoon I preached to that little perſecuted flock at brother R.'s; and in the afternoon, I had a bleſſed time at the Bayſide-chapel. I preached in Miles-river Neck; and the day following about four hundred attended my miniſtry at Bolingbroke chapel. This ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety will not hold their fellow-creatures in bondage. A great harmony ſubſiſts among
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:023401_0222_0FBF534C98CBEA68"/>thoſe people, and I feel my heart united to them.</p>
            <p>Saturday June 3. I croſſed the river in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Dorſet, a place where I deſired to be. Sunday 4. At brother M.'s I met ſo large a congregation, that I was under a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of withdrawing to the ſhade for room. Some time ago there was a great work of the Lord in this Neck; but I am informed the work is now rather at a ſtand. What is the cauſe? Thoſe preachers whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors the Lord particularly bleſt in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival, were lively and powerful; and there was much of what ſome call wild-fire among the people: the cries of the diſtreſſed were frequently ſo great, that the preacher's voice was drowned. I was informed that thoſe people had been viſited by ſome, who had but little friendſhip for what ſome call hollowing meetings; and the work began to decline. The danger lies on both hands; and bleſſed is he who knows how to ſteer aright. I am never diſtreſſed in hearing convinced ſinners crying for mercy; though they were to cry ſo loud as to be heard a mile. And I doubt not, but the children of the Lord are ſo happy at times, that they are almoſt carried out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:023401_0223_0FBF534DECA15E88"/>and conſtrained to ſhout forth his praiſes.</p>
            <p>Sunday June 11, I preached in our new chapel on Taylor's iſland to abundantly more people than the chapel could contain. Many on this iſland love God.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 13, I preached on Hooper's iſland, and we had a precious ſhower. Before our meeting ended five ſouls were new-born; three of whom were ſiſters. There were many awakened at this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and great cries were amongſt the diſtreſſed. There was as little confuſion as I have ever ſeen, where there was ſo great a power felt.</p>
            <p>I continued in the Peninſula till May 1788; during which time I was ſeldom a day without preaching, and frequently twice or thrice in a day; and that with great freedom. I cannot ſay that there was an univerſal gathering; but I truſt the church was edified and built up in the faith. During this year, I travelled through and preached in every county on the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern-Shore, which are three of Virginia, three of Delaware, and eight of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="unknown:023401_0224_0FBF534EF9934DB8"/>
It was on my mind to go to Boſton, and with the approbation of Mr. F. A. I ſet out on my journey in May 1788. When I got to New-York, I found brother H. at the point of death. The harveſt being great and the laborers few, I was prevailed on by brother D. to ſtay till the York con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which was to be held in October. During which time I ſtaid moſtly in the city; except ſome excurſions through Long-Iſland and New-Rochelle circuits. Before the ſitting of conference, I had received invitations from a variety of places; and letters came to conference, in which we were intreated to ſend help to ſeveral places. I was conſcious to myſelf, that it was not expedient for me at that time to purſue my way to Boſton; though I had an eye to that place.</p>
            <p>At the conference I was appointed to take charge of the Northern diſtrict; which at that time conſiſted of New-York, Long-Iſland, and New-Rochelle circuits. After conference ended, I ſet out to the North with about twelve young preachers to form circuits; and our dear Lord opened our way in a moſt ſurpriſing manner: although much evil was ſaid of us. Many houſes,
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:023401_0225_0FBF5350AF542E30"/>hands, and hearts were opened; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commencement of the winter, we had ſeveral large circuits formed; and the the moſt of the preachers were comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſituated; and ſinners in a variety of places began to enquire, what they ſhould do to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Satan and his children were much alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and began on every hand to throw out threats againſt us. Some ſaid, "They are good men;" others ſaid, "Nay, they are deceivers of the people." A ſtranger from the new ſtate on his way down the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, informed the people that we were ſpread all through the country through which he came. This ſudden and univerſal ſpread cauſed ſome perſon to ſay, "I know not from whence they all come, unleſs from the clouds." Others ſaid, "The king of England hath ſent them to diſaffect the people; and they did not doubt, but they would bring on another war." Whilſt others gave it as their opinion, that we were the falſe prophets ſpoken of in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who ſhould come in the laſt days, and deceive, if it were poſſible, the very elect. Among others, the miniſters of the different denominations were alarmed, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:023401_0226_0FBF53586B727B78"/>leſt we ſhould break up their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and frequently coming to hear, ſome of them openly oppoſed, declaring public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the doctrine was falſe. The power of the Lord attended the word, and a great reformation was ſeen among the people; and many were enabled to ſpeak freely and feelingly of what God had done for their ſouls. My cuſtom was to go round the diſtrict every three months, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to New-York; where I commonly ſtaid about two weeks. In going once round I uſually travelled about a thouſand miles, and preached upwards of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſermons.</p>
            <p>Tueſday June 9, 1789. I left New-York accompanied by brother N. to Eaſt-Cheſter; and in the evening had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of hearing Mr. F. A. and Mr. W. and the word was powerfully felt. The next day I accompanied them to New-Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and ſat with delight under the word. The morning following we parted; and the remainder of the week I ſpent moſtly in writing.</p>
            <p>Sunday 14. I found liberty in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a ſolemn company in our new church at New-Caſtle, on Naaman's cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:023401_0227_0FBF535A43D8C1A8"/>and in the afternoon I heard brother L. at Bedford; and cloſed the meeting with an exhortation. Here we joined a ſociety. The people were brought up in the Calyinian line, but many are convinced that ſuch a ſyſtem does not reflect glory on the Deity; and they are willing to flee from it, though there are two miniſters who uſe their ſtrength in oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Monday 15th, I found great freedom to preach to a loving ſociety, formed by bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers M. and B. at Mr. H.'s, and had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that many of them were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for the ſalvation of their precious ſouls. Their ſinging was delightful.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 16th. In the morning I found my mind free in preaching the word at Stony-ſtreet church; and in the evening the Lord was with us at the Engliſh church at Peak's-kiln; and I had a comfortable night at G. C.'s. This is an affectionate family; and they ſeem very attentive to the word of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday 17th, I rode ten miles and preached to a people gathered from the mountains; and then went to brother J.'s, about twenty miles, and had great liberty in the word. There ſeemed to be a ſilent
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:023401_0228_0FBF535BC8786948"/>ſtruggling among the people, whilſt I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to dwell on the deep things of God. I viſited dear brother Cook, and found him near death. But his ſoul was happy in God his Saviour.</p>
            <p>Thurſday 18th. Accompanied by a friend twenty-five miles, I met brother F. A. and brother W. at doctor B.'s, where I heard a good ſermon and an encouraging exhortation; as I alſo did the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Saturday we parted, and I had a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious day.</p>
            <p>Sunday 21. The ſun this morning aroſe with his uſual luſtre, and diſperſed light through all the lower creation. Jeſus, the much brighter ſun, was precious to me. I preached in a barn, in the morning, at Ryn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ck; then rode 8 miles lower down, and preached in another barn, and had great liberty; and ſound a few whoſe hearts the Lord had touched when I was there before. I returned and preached again at ſix o'clock: but fear the word had no place in the hearts of the hearers—I was much diſtreſſed—dear Lord! man is weak. But when thou diſplayeſt thy convincing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the work is done. I rode to and ſpent the moſt of this week in the city of Hudſon.
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:023401_0229_0FBF535E217F7C38"/>In this place I have had ſome ſweet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and been greatly encouraged; but I now feel the need of patience—have I ſpent ſo much labor for nought? Have none been benefited by my miniſtry in this place? Some have been made angry, but a few alſo have been benefited—I am clear in the matter, having warned, invited, and handed out the promiſes with tears. So I let the matter reſt with the Lord, who ſaid, <hi>O Jeruſalem! how oft would I have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and ye would not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monday 29. Accompanied by one of the preachers, I rode on to brother B.'s, and on my way I ſtopped and preached in a cool ſummer-houſe made of green boughs, to near two hundred precious ſouls, who ſeemed to drink in the word. I am fully convinced (and it is an obſervation which I have made theſe many years) that poor people in general are more fond of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel than the rich. And this is agreeable to the doctrine of our Lord. I had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſweet time among thoſe people. More than twelve months ago I was ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to preach among them; but never had an opportunity till now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="unknown:023401_0230_0FBF535FFA0AB038"/>
Tueſday 30. I preached in Mr. V. D.'s large barn to many ſerious hearers; and perceived that the Lord was carrying on a work on the patent by the inſtrumentality of brother C—, a young preacher who had juſt entered the field.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday I rode 14 miles to Albany. Some time ago I petitioned the aſſembly (as they were then ſitting) for liberty of the city-hail; acceſs to which I have had ever ſince; but many in the city ſeem much ſet againſt the Methodiſts. The hearts of a few were touched, and ſeveral joined in a ſociety which has gradually increaſed ever ſince.</p>
            <p>Sunday July 5, I preached in Schenec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tady at 10, and at 3 o'clock in the Engliſh church, and in the evening in a ſpacious hall, and had great hope that good would be done in the town. Prejudice hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken deep root in the hearts of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; at preſent, I fear, there is very little vital piety in the place.</p>
            <p>Monday July 6. I ſet out on a journey to the North, and on my way I overtook an old gentleman, who ſaid, "I expect you are a miniſter. O! it is a bleſſed work, if you are called to it. I am a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:023401_0231_0FBF536602D37708"/>lower of Chriſt, and know my peace made with God." How, ſaid I, do you know that? "By the ſpirit which he has given me." Do you, ſaid I, know that your ſins are forgiven? "O yes." Do you, ſaid I, live in ſin? "Yes, we are all ſinners." Pray, ſaid I, how can you know your ſins forgiven, if you live in ſin? "I have the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwells in me." Don't you, ſaid I, ſwear ſometimes? "Swear, yes, and have been drunk too, many times ſince I was made a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but my comfort is, I cannot fall." What, ſaid I, would become of your ſoul, if you were to die drunk? "Die drunk! what would you think to ſee the ſun fall? was it ever known that a ſaint died drunk? impoſſible!" Well, ſaid I, according to your doctrine, if you always keep yourſelf intoxicated with ſtrong liquor, you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver die. Sin made man mortal; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find from ſcripture that drunkenneſs makes him immortal. "Sir," ſaid he, "I perceive you are a rank Arminian, and I would not go the length of my foot to hear you preach, for you are an accuſer of the brethren; and hold out a very uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:023401_0232_0FBF536702F35730"/>doctrine to God's dear children." Pray, ſaid I, what denomination do you profeſs? "I am an old Engliſhman, and a convert of Mr. Whitefield's, and a New-Light by profeſſion, from the ſole of my foot to the crown of my head." After I endeavoured to ſet his danger before him, I wiſhed him well; and riding thirty miles I found great liberty to preach my dear Lord's goſpel, from the language of the gaoler, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I travelled and preached through the country, and many gathered to hear the word; but many were much afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived by a falſe prophet, ſo termed by ſome. I preached in Aſh-grove, where w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> have many kind friends who have built us a church. When I firſt came into this ſettlement, I found ſome emigrants from Ireland, who had been acquainted with the Methodiſts; but there were very few of them, who retained the power of religion: though I ſoon perceived, that the doctrine was as a ſalve to a feſtering wound. Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliders were healed, and many who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been acquainted with thoſe men before, were brought to experience the faith which juſtifies the ungodly. In ſeveral places in
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:023401_0233_0FBF53687B7D0CB8"/>this circuit, the Lord made D. D. inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the converſion of ſouls.</p>
            <p>Saturday and Sunday were the days of our quarterly meeting; and a precious ſweet time we had. It was held in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther R.'s barn, and I think we had an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of about twenty communicants. I baptized eight adults in the houſe, and one by immerſion; alſo ſeveral children. We had about two hundred preſent at the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſt, moſt of whom were young converts. In the evening I had a converſation with a woman who informed me, that ſhe was brought to experience the love of God not far from Boſton; and being ſurrounded by the Baptiſts, they ſtrove to perſuade her to renounce her infant baptiſm, and enter more deep into baptiſmal water. By their continual ſolicitations and arguments, her mind became confuſed, ſo that ſhe was in doubt reſpecting the matter, and earneſtly prayed to the Lord to ſhew her his will.— One night after ſhe had thus prayed, ſhe went to bed, and not long after her eyes were cloſed in ſleep, ſhe thought ſhe ſaw our dear Lord with his arms extended and an infant preſented to baptiſm. She awoke without a doubt or fear, reſpecting the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:023401_0234_0FBF5370999D7308"/>of infant baptiſm. Some time after this, in the ſtate of Vermont, ſhe had an opportunity of hearing the Methodiſts, who, ſhe immediately perceived, preached the ſame doctrine which the Lord had taught her; and ſhe had never before met with a people with whom ſhe could join.</p>
            <p>Monday July 14. After I had ended my viſit through Cambridge circuit, I came to Albany, where I met the ſmall ſociety; and the next day rode to doctor H.'s. My horſe being very lame, and I not able to get another for a few days, either for love or money, I ſet out on foot; and after I had walked near twenty miles, I came to Spence-town, with my ſame horſe hopping behind me; and had at captain S.'s a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſweet time among the people. In ſpite of all the oppoſition, our gracious God has carried on a bleſſed work around this place. Tueſday I preached in Sheffield, where I was greatly oppoſed; but the Lord has plucked a few brands from the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The day following I dined at colonel B.'s, of Canaan: and in the afternoon held forth in the Preſbyterian meeting-houſe. The people of this town are mild and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic. Their former miniſter (Mr. T.) was
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:023401_0235_0FBF5371F74F2248"/>a catholic man, and did not do as ſome have done, prejudice and harden the hearts of the people againſt other denominations, eſpecially Arminians, as we are called. Our dear Lord, by the inſtrumentality of brother W. brother B. and others, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and converted a number of ſouls in different parts of this town; ſo that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we have ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Saturday 18, our quarterly meeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. Souls are flocking to Jeſus. The number of diſciples increaſes. Jeſus rode in his goſpel-chariot in Mr. C.'s barn on the Lord's-day, whilſt I was declaring, <hi>The ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return, and come to Zion, &amp;c.</hi> Brother B. aſſiſted me in the adminiſtration of the ſupper. In this part of our Lord's vineyard, many have been much troubled with Antinomianiſm; but the diſmal gloom is vaniſhing away.— I continued round on my regular plan, till on Thurſday July 23, I came to Sharon, where I was met by a number of precious ſouls, to whom I preached in the afternoon in the open air, for want of room in the houſe. Surely the Lord has a work to do in this town. Mr. S. ſays we are leading
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:023401_0236_0FBF5373000EF808"/>ſouls to hell: but, bleſſed be God, many will not believe it.</p>
            <p>Friday 24. This was a ſweet morning to my ſoul—I continued writing ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively till two o'clock excluſive of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals. The day paſſed ſweetly away.— When I looked at my watch, I perceived I had ſcarce time to get to my appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and roſe from my ſeat in haſte. The man of the houſe had gone out, and left the horſe tied in the meadow by a long rope, to be handy when I wanted him. I took the bridle and went out, in order to make ready for my journey: and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering him to be a borrowed horſe (mine was too lame to be uſed) when I took hold of the rope, and began to gather him to me, he was ſeared, and began to run; and by ſome means I was entangled in the rope —how it was I cannot tell, but I felt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the utmoſt diſtreſs: I lay by the fence bereft of the uſe of my ſenſes, as well as limbs. For a long time I could not tell who, or what, or where I was; till at length I ſaw in my hat (as I had been ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get it to lay my head on) the two firſt letters of my name, and knew who I was; and immediately called on the name
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:023401_0237_0FBF5374B6E2D3B8"/>of the Lord, who gave me power to riſe up, and walk to the houſe. A phyſician was immediately ſent for; and when he came, he found me much bruiſed, my right ſhoulder diſlocated, and almoſt every joint in my hands and arms much ſtrained. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my ſhoulder was ſet, and blood let, I was reſtored perfectly to my ſenſes. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the neighbours gathered in: and I think in all my life I never had a greater ſenſe of thoſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy heart.</hi> Thoſe around ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected me to die. But as I lay on my bed I was conſtrained to cry out, <hi>Perfect love caſteth out fear.</hi> Now, ſaid I, I know there is a reality in the religion which I have been recommending to others for theſe many years; as well as a truth in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt doctrine, ſo called. I had ſuch a love for the doctrine and cauſe, that it ſeemed as if I would freely have gone to the ſtake for it. I did not dare to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur; but cried out, <hi>Lord, it is good for me to be afflicted.</hi> I was never more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the dealings of a good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God. I was conſtrained, and that in a flood of tears, to exhort all thoſe around to fly to Jeſus: for I ſaw a fulneſs in him
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:023401_0238_0FBF537D21E615D8"/>for every creature. But one thing induced me to indulge a deſire to ſtay longer in this world; and that was to be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in doing good in the church.</p>
            <p>Saturday 24. I deſired a friend to make ready a carriage, for I had a longing deſire to attend the Dover quarterly meeting.— That evening I got as far as Oblong, where I lodged at the houſe of an old doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and received much ſtrength, and in the morning I got to Dover church, and was enabled to adminiſter the ſupper to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God's dear children: and afterward to preach with great liberty. I was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by brother L. to my appointments, till I got to North-Caſtle; where I thought it moſt expedient to decline attending my New-England appointments, for I could by no means ride on horſe-back; and the roads were too rough for a chaiſe; and withal I could only get in and out with help; and that with a degree of pain. I withdrew to the city of New-York, where I ſtaid about ten days, and then met my appointment on Long-Iſland, and had a precious, ſweet ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. After I had fulfilled my appointments on the iſland, on Wedneſday Auguſt 19, accompanied by a friend, I returned to
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:023401_0239_0FBF537F0DAD8A88"/>the city, and had a favorable hope that any affliction was ſanctified for my good; and it alſo proved a bleſſing to ſome in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he town where it happened. Surely the Lord is preparing me for ſome ſevere trial. The church in this city is gaining ground under the miniſtry of brother M. and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther C.</p>
            <p>Sunday 23. I was reſolved, God being my helper, to devote this day without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to him: and was very happy both in public and private. I preached two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and ſeveral hours paſt away in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>Friday Auguſt 28th. Having finiſhed a piece of writing, I again ſet out on my journey round the diſtrict, and found a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual gathering to the church in almoſt every place; the ſociety-members, as well as communicants, greatly increaſed. My mind was much exerciſed frequently; but I could find my all in the Lord Jeſus. In my return I viſited ſeveral towns in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, to which I had not been before, and found enlargement of heart to preach among the people.</p>
            <p>Thurſday November 19th, I returned to New-York, on my way to the council held
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:023401_0240_0FBF5380788BB158"/>in Baltimore: which journey was render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great bleſſing to me. When I left Baltimore I was reſolved, God being my helper, to be more than ever engaged in the glorious work; and it was my earneſt prayer, that, as in the South, the flame might break forth with us. I felt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it in Philadelphia; and when I came to New-York, I preached with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement which I had never felt in that city before; and had faith to believe, that the brethren would have glorious times; and ſo it was; for a few days after I left the city, the work, in a moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, broke out: firſt in a prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eeting, and then in the congregation; and I ſaw and felt ſomething of the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame, in many places round the diſtrict, in my winter viſitation.</p>
            <p>I had to encounter a variety of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In common the church-people do not oppoſe us in doctrine; but in this place, where we had a good ſociety, one of this order of men went and preached, and ſpread books, and the minds of ſeveral were much confuſed; and they concluded they would not commune with us any more — I preached from theſe words, <hi>We preach not
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:023401_0241_0FBF53821B8787F8"/>ourſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus's ſake.</hi> When our dear Lord ſent out his ſervants, he ſaid, <hi>Lo, I am with you to the end of the world.</hi> Who is he with? the Pope? the carnal biſhop? By no means. He will be with all his faithful miniſters of all deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, even to the end of the world. Our Lord diſplayed his power, and there was a ſhaking among the people; and thoſe wavering ones had their doubts removed, and drew near to the table. "It is a pity," ſaid one, "that you ever ſeparated from the church." It is a greater pity, ſaid I, for the church people, ſo called, to live without inward religion: ſhould there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a reformation and turning to God, among your miniſters and people, we ſhall ſtand a better chance to come together. I was brought up in the church, and have a great affection for it; and it would do me much good to hear of a turning to God among the members.</p>
            <p>June 2, 1790, I ſet out on a journey to Boſton, and ſo round the diſtrict. And on Tueſday I preached with liberty at New-Rochelſe, from, <hi>O my dove, who art in the cleft of the rochs,</hi> &amp;c. My greateſt freedom
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:023401_0242_0FBF538A149DA238"/>in the ſubject was when I inforced, <hi>let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

On Sunday I ſuppoſe there were a thouſand under the word at Bedford, whilſt I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment?</hi> The day before, a multitude gathered in King-ſtreet; as ſoon as I entered the houſe, I ſaw a man who was almoſt dead with the colic: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to drink a pint of cold water; and when he had taken it, his pain was gone. Monday 7, I cried to a liſtening multitude, <hi>All ſcripture is given by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God,</hi> &amp;c. The next day the houſe was crowded, and about an hundred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. The people ſeemed to drink in every word. Wedneſday I declared to a ſolemn company at Singſing, <hi>Now the juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> &amp;c. And in the evening at G. C.'s I had much freedom to preach the word. Thurſday 10, Oakley's church was filled from end to end. I had much ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in explaining the firſt pſalm. In the evening I found great freedom to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <hi>He that is born of God doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him; and he
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:023401_0243_0FBF538B68F3FA70"/>cannot ſin becauſe he is born of God.</hi> David loſt the ſeed of grace out of his heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he committed the act of adultery: no doubt he was an adulterer in his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left the houſe-top. If we keep ourſelves, that evil one cannot hurt us.— We paſſed on over the Fiſhkiln mountains, through Oſwego, Rynebeck, and Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partners; and had an opportunity, every day, to preach the glorious goſpel to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of precious ſouls.</p>
            <p>Sunday 20. About a thouſand met in Sharon, and I found it to be an high day.</p>
            <p>Monday 21. In Cornwall I truſt ſeveral were awakened; one in particular who did not reſt till he found peace to his ſoul. The next day I unexpectedly met a large congregation in the Engliſh church in Litchfield; I found freedom in preaching from, <hi>Enoch walked with God,</hi> Gen. v. 22. I went and preached in the Preſbyterian meeting-houſe about two miles off: and our heavenly Father has raiſed us up ſome good friends. The next day I preached in the ſkirts of the town, from, <hi>Whom he did foreknow,</hi> &amp;c. Here I met with trouble from a diſputations Antinomian; however, I went on, and preached at the houſe of a
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:023401_0244_0FBF538C754ECE08"/>good-natured drunkard, and talked to him about his ſoul. His wife and daughter are lovers of our bleſſed Lord.</p>
            <p>Monday 28, I preached to about five hundred people in Hertford with ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thurſday July 1. After a tedious journey we came to Boſton. I preached ſeveral ſermons, and had no doubt but the Lord will, ſooner or later, give us a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this place. From Boſton I went to Providence, and ſtaid a few days; and preached ſeveral ſermons with liberty. On Monday morning I preached my farewell ſermon a little after ſunriſe, to more than two hundred people. I have great fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Mr. S. as a Chriſtian miniſter, and ſeveral of his people, as followers of Chriſt; for they appeared like Methodiſts to me. I have ſome reaſon to believe that my journey to this town was not in vain, for as I went out, ſome met me in tears deſiring to know what they ſhould do to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>I again paſſed through Parmington, Litchfield, Cornwall, and Canaan; and was happy to converſe with many new-born ſouls. A woman in Canaan told me, that about ſeven years ago, a man of a low ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:023401_0245_0FBF538DF642BB58"/>came to her one night when ſhe was aſleep, dreſſed in black, and as ſhe thought ſurrounded with a light brighter than the ſun; he took out a book, and enquired for her name; and ſhe ſaw him write it down in golden capitals; and told her that if ſhe was faithful in the ſervice of God, ſhe ſhould have a crown of life. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe told her huſband the dream, and that ſhe ſhould ſurely ſee that man. "I went to hear every ſtrange miniſter who came into the town," ſaid ſhe, "and ſaw not the man till you came." And ſhe knew me as well as if ſhe had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with me ſeven years; and no doubt but the doctrine which I preached was the light which ſhe ſaw around me. And when ſhe went home, ſhe told her huſband that ſhe had now ſeen the man.</p>
            <p>I continued my journey through Hudſon and Queman's; from whence a diſtreſſed man followed me to Albany, and under the word he found peace to his ſoul. In Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany I have encountered many difficulties, in raiſing a little church; which is now likely to be finiſhed. I held a quarterly-meeting at Cli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-park; and from thence
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:023401_0246_0FBF5393B047D530"/>advanced toward the new ſtate; and found the work increaſing in moſt of the ſocieties. I had one and ſometimes two quarterly meetings to attend every week; and many were encouraged to preſs on in the narrow way. Having finiſhed my rout, in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I returned again to New-York: where conference was held. At this conference our new Northern diſtrict was divided; and I have continued in the Albany diſtrict ever ſince. I have met with trials of a peculiar nature, part of which I once thought I never ſhould have encountered. I wiſh at all times to be reſigned to the will of my heavenly Father—hitherto I have had an heart to bleſs them that curſe me, and pray for thoſe who perſecute and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitefully uſe me. One thing I have taken notice of, which in ſome inſtances has been admirable. More than two thouſand have joined the ſociety—more than a thouſand have been really born of the Spirit—more than eight thouſand have been brought to ſee in a meaſure the propriety of our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and diſcipline, and a reformation in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of places has taken place—hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, if not thouſands, in the back ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who were not able to give an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:023401_0247_0FBF5396016796B0"/>a year to a miniſter, and could ſeldom hear a ſermon, may now hear a ſermon at leaſt once in two weeks; and ſometimes oftener—withal ſome of the miniſters have lowered their ſalaries, and are more aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their labors. If you will take pains to enquire among them, at leaſt ſome can tell you that their congregations are larger; and where they had one, now they have two church members.</p>
            <p>Reſpecting the doctrine taught among the Methodiſts, I have not doubted of the truth of it, no, not for a minute ſince I firſt embraced it. Reſpecting other denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I am willing to think, and let think; but this I ſay, I would not have any one be of this or the other perſuaſion merely becauſe their parents brought them up in that belief. Touching unconditional elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reprobation, I never did believe it; and I am perſuaded I never ſhall whilſt I retain the uſe of my reaſon. What! to ſuppoſe that the Judge of the whole earth ſhould unconditionally from eternity, deſtine part of the human race to eternal flames! If any man can perſuade me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, then it will not be a hard matter to make me believe, that he has uncondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:023401_0248_0FBF5399031B6518"/>ſet apart a ſelect number (whom he calls the elect) for eternal felicity: and of courſe do what they will, it is impoſſible for them to loſe their election, or as ſome term it, fall from grace. If this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality be the plan of the goſpel, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge myſelf to have lived to the preſent time a ſtranger to it. I have not converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any man, ſince I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with men and things, that could be conſiſtent in ſupporting ſuch a doctrine. And thus it is that they ſo often contradict themſelves. The holy ſcriptures have a beautiful harmony when rightly underſtood. God ſpoke a number of intelligences, called angels, into exiſtence—beings capable of uſing aright, or abuſing their moral agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy—many of them did the latter, and were juſtly puniſhed. God alſo made a creature, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alled man; and ſurely, though he was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
