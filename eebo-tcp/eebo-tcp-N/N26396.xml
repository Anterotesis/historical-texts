            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>American Independence.</head>
            <p>IT has been obſerved by an elegant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <q>as an individual unconnected with the government, can only reaſon upon their meaſures from what is publickly known, ſuch an one may poſſibly contribute to weaken the effect of their authority by an attempt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it upon ground which they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim. A good cauſe is often injured by an unſkilful defence, and an unſucceſsful effort always leſſons the facility of a practicable ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</q> With a conviction of the truth of theſe remarks ſtrong on my mind, it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſiderable reluctance, that I undertake to ſtate certain reaſons and facts, to prove the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and expediency of the late appointment of an embaſſy to France. But as the ſubject is before the public, and is intereſting in an high degree to every American, what is now offered, cannot be deemed impertinent, and may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>That any favourable opinion in the Preſident of the United States, reſpecting the French rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution, or the preſent government of France, dictated the nomination, no one in his ſenſes can ſuppoſe. His many invaluable writings, his ſpeeches to Congreſs, his anſwers to numerous addreſſes, all his meaſures, and all his conduct, forbid the momentary admiſſion of ſuch an idea. That a man of his deep political knowledge,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035103_0005_1000A686024A2A98"/>proved devotion to his country, incorruptible integrity, decided averſion to innovation and all the wild doctrines of modern philoſophy; of ſo thorough a knowledge of the wickedneſs of the French rulers, could be taken in by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive appearances, could be lulled by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of their ſincerity, is not, humanly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, within the line of poſſibilities.</p>
            <p>But a little experience of this world and its ways, is ſufficient to convince us, how ſeldom the ſtill voice of reaſon is heeded in the heat of political diſſention. The moſt important ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are forgotten, the moſt exalted talents are depreciated, and one ſingle difference of opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion outweighs a life of virtue, patriotiſm and uſe fulneſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe reflections naturally ariſe out of the ſubject, but are not the defence on which I depend. It can I think be clearly ſhewn, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reference to the confidence due to the Preſident, and independent of all perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, that <hi>the meaſure</hi> is entitled to our warmeſt approbation, as calculated to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the hoſtile deſigns of France, and promote the beſt intereſts of the United States.</p>
            <p>It was not to be expected, that the French would ſet down eaſy and contented, under the diſappointment and diſgrace which the failure and developement of their attempts on our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, peace and honour had brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. We had every thing to fear from their intrigue, the luſt of power, mortified pride, and ungratified avarice.</p>
            <p>The miſſion of Logan has ceaſed to agitate the public mind; but thoſe who think it too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035103_0006_1000A69EB2DBE5C0"/>to be worthy of notice, will ſome time or other be convinced of their miſtake.</p>
            <p>That he was the agent of the French party in the United States, to the Directory, is beyond a doubt; and it is equally certain that the future operations of the Directory were determined by his communications.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The plan,</hi> I think, will be clearly made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by what is herein diſcloſed; to be, <hi>For the Directory, previous to the adjournment of Congreſs, to requeſt a renewal of the negociation at Paris, and to give the aſſurances required by the Preſident, in rather an indirect manner, with the view that he ſhould not conſider them ſatisfactory, and decline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother embaſſy. Then, immediately upon the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Congreſs to ſend an Envoy Extraordinary to Philadelphia, to tell the ſtory of our Government's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the advances of France, and to ſolicit a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all ſubjects of diſpute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be aſked, how was this known at the time of the nomination? I anſwer—a much leſs degree of penetration than is attributed to the Executive of the United States, muſt have foreſeen that France would croud us with offers, aſſurances, and embaſſies. How to meet theſe was then the queſtion. To refuſe to treat, and afterwards be forced into it, would have been a moſt unfortunate circumſtance. It would have deſtroyed the work of at leaſt ten years; it would have taken away the well earned pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularity of the American Government, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored French influence, with all its attendant horrors. Every body muſt allow that <hi>for us, Paris is the beſt place to treat in.</hi> It may be urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that as France had refufed to receive our
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035103_0007_1000A68E4498ECF8"/>miniſters, we could refuſe to receive her miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But this is reckoning without the hoſt— We <hi>might</hi> have <hi>taken</hi> this ground but we never could have <hi>kept</hi> it. The rights of embaſſy are well underſtood, and France having diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, would be no apology for our doing the ſame. It is a <hi>general maxim</hi> of the law of nations, that, <q>we are not to refuſe admitting and hearing even an enemy's miniſter. The greater the calamities of war are, the more is it incumbent on nations to preſerve means for putting an end to it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It may be inſiſted on, that the preſent gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of France is an <hi>uſurpation.</hi> The fact is readily admitted; but it muſt not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that the <hi>uſurpers</hi> have been long ſince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <hi>ſovereigns</hi> by the United States, and by every nation that has had any thing to do with them. Every objection on this ſcore againſt the preſent embaſſy, applies with equal force, againſt Mr. Morris's continuing at Paris after the dethronement of the King, againſt the reception of Mr Genet, againſt the appointment of Mr. Monroe, againſt the reception of Meſſrs. Fauchet and Adet, and againſt the appointment of General Pinckney, and of the three Envoys Extraordinary, Meſſrs. Pinckney, Marſhall and Gerry. But, ſuch an objection has no validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. On the queſtion, "Whether miniſters may be received "from or ſent to an uſurper" VAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEL lays it down, that <q>foreign powers, if the advantage of their affairs invites them to it, follow poſſeſſion: there is no rule more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or more agreeable to the law of nations, and the independency of them. As foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035103_0008_1000A6E9B855F388"/>have no right to interfere in the domeſtic concerns of a people, they are not obliged to canvas and inſpect its oeconomy in thoſe particulars, or to weigh either the juſtice or injuſtice of them. They may if they think proper, ſuppoſe the right to be annexed to the poſſeſſion. When a nation has expelled its ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, the other powers which are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to declare againſt it, and would not draw on themſelves its arms or its enmity, conſider that nation as a free and ſovereign ſtate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking on themſelves to determine wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it has acted juſtly in withdrawing from the allegiance of ſubjects and dethroning the Prince. Cardinal Mazarine received Lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hart, who had been ſent as ambaſſador from the republic of England, and would neither ſee King Charles the IId, nor his miniſters. If a nation, after driving out its Prince, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to another, or changes the order of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and acknowledges a ſovereign to the prejudice of the natural and appointed heir; foreign powers may here likewiſe conſider what has been done, as legal; it is no quarrel or buſineſs of theirs. At the beginning of the laſt century, Charles, duke of Suderma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, having obtained the crown of Sweden, to the prejudice of Sigiſmund king of Poland, his nephew was ſoon acknowledged by moſt ſovereigns. <hi>Villeroy,</hi> miniſter of Henry the IVth, king of France, at that court, in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moir of the 8th of April 1608, plainly ſaid to the Preſident Jeannin, <hi>All theſe reaſons and conſiderations ſhall not hinder the king from treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035103_0009_1000B7DC8721B2E8"/>with Charles, if he finds it to be his intereſt, and that of his kingdom.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>This was arguing ſenſibly. The King of France was neither the judge nor the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the Swediſh nation, that he ſhould, againſt the good of his own kingdom, refuſe to acknowledge the king which Sweden had choſen under pretence that a competitor termed Charles an uſurper. Had it even been done with juſtice, it does not come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cognizance of foreigners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore, when foreign powers have received the miniſters of an uſurper, and ſent theirs to him, the lawful prince, on recovering his throne, cannot complain of theſe meaſures as an injury,</hi> nor juſtly make them the cauſe of a war, provided theſe powers have not gone farther, nor furniſhed any ſuccours againſt him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>I have been the more particular in giving this extract at length, becauſe the queſtion which it conſiders, though frequently alluded to, has never been fully diſcuſſed, in any of our political writings, that I have ſeen.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe a French envoy arrived in this country. He is told, that our repeated embaſſies have been ſpurned with indignity, and without a hearing from the threſhold of the Directorial palace, and therefore a Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Directory could not be received.</p>
            <p>The envoy replies, <hi>[the more lies the better for his purpoſe]</hi>
               <q>I am come to explain, and make atonement for that very thing; you ſurely cannot refuſe to receive reparation for inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or inſults." And perhaps he might add, the men who refuſed your miniſters were
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035103_0010_1000B7DE223D2AD0"/>traitors, enemies to France as well as Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; Merlin, and Treillard, and Rewbell, and Lepaux, and Talleyrand are taken up as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, and are ſucceeded by the true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, the friends of both countries, who have ſent me to heal all differences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs all your wrongs.</q> Even ſetting aſide, the law of nations and the right of embaſſy, thoſe who think our government could have withſtood all this, are deſired to recollect <hi>town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meetings</hi> and <hi>treaty remoſtrances,</hi> and if they are ſtill inflexible, nothing which I can ſay will affect their opinions.</p>
            <p>I have now before me a pamphlet which though I often before heard of, I never was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obtain till within a few days. It is a handſome Paris edition. Several copies of it, directed to different characters in this country, arrived here about the middle of laſt ſummer. Some little was ſaid reſpecting it at firſt, but the work has been kept from the public eye. The reaſon is obvious. It being predicated upon the idea that the Preſident would make no nomination, it could not anſwer the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the French government, or their friends the American jacobins. But few federaliſts, it is preſumed, were poſſeſſed of a copy, and thoſe it is probable, were themſelves ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the <hi>protriety</hi> of the nomination, that they did not think there was any neceſſity for the promulgation of information, which would place it in a more conſpicuous light. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains three letters, the firſt entitled <hi>Joel Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to his fellow citizens of the United States,</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

The ſecond <hi>Joel Barlow to General Waſhington,</hi> dated Paris, Oct 2, 1798, with a note prefixed at the time of publication. The third <hi>Fulwar Skipwith and Joel Barlow to a Member of the Executive Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi> The book appears to have been written by the expreſs order of the Directory, with a view of accellerating their plan of getting a new miniſter at Philadelphia, <hi>under circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unfavourable to the United States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall quote and comment on ſuch parts of the work as will unfold the deſing.</p>
            <p>Barlow profeſſes a great deal of frankneſs, and is willing to allow many of the faults of the French government; a degree of candour, which any who are acquainted with <hi>their ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of juſtice and police,</hi> know would be rather too dangerous an experiment, if they had not ſome ſpecial purpoſes to anſwer by ſuffering it. The Directory having heard by Citizen Logan and others, what was conſirmed by our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like preparations, that the ſpirit of this country was at length rouſed by injuries upon injuries, and inſults upon inſults; were convinced, that it would not do for. Citizen Barlow, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Citizen, to tell us that France had done us no wrong. This accounts for the following expreſſions in the firſt letter— <q>How much you have unfortunately ſuffered from the pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies carried on under the French laws" p. 4. the attempts which had been made here to extort from our commiſſioners a bribe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and a promiſe of a loan to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</q> p. 5. <q>No man in America could feel a greater indignation that I did at the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035103_0012_1000A69447BFE300"/>piece of villainy therein detailed</q> (in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches) ibi. <q>I had no knowledge that even a <hi>loan</hi> was aſked for, or contemplated to be aſked for on the part of France. It was my opinion that it was the policy of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can government under circumſtances then exiſting to <hi>offer</hi> a loan</q> ibi. That monſtrous ſyſtem <q>of piracy and plunder exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards neutrals</q>—<q>all the horrors that have attended this tremendous revolution</q> p. 6. <q>The innumerable acts of injuſtice and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence committed under the order of the 2d of March 1797, and the law of the 18th of January 1798</q> p. 7. <q>The flood of piracy and plunder let looſe upon your property; a ſcene of wickedneſs which no man can abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate more than myſelf</q> p. 36.</p>
            <p>Theſe expreſſions uſed by a man in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the French government, would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence, if any was wanted, that the book was penned by their direction. But the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of Barlow, and his connection with, and dependence on that government, are ſo well known to all political men in the United States, that to <hi>them</hi> the proof muſt be unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>In the letter addreſſed to General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton is the following paſſage, with the accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying note, added as before mentioned, when the book was publiſhed. The letter it ſeems was firſt ſent as a private one. <q>An embargo that had been laid on American veſſels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the republic in conſequence of a report that war had been begun on the part of the United States, was taken off as ſoon as it was aſcertained that ſuch war had not been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035103_0013_1000B7E19B79DBF8"/>and a new declaration was at that time ſent to America of the wiſhes of France to treat. 1</q>
            </p>
            <p>NOTE. 1. <q>Since writing this letter, I am at liberty to ſtate that the <hi>new declaration,</hi> here referred to, was diſpatched from Paris through an official channel about the end of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber laſt. It ſhould ſeem that it had not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Philadelphia, before the opening of Congreſs in December; as the Preſident's ſpeech alludes to a declaration made to Mr. Gerry in July, but takes no notiee of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent one, which was perfectly explicit and unconditional.</q> The letter adds, <q>theſe facts will doubtleſs come to your knowledge through other channels before you receive this letter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appears that the Directory had taken meaſures to ſpread in this country the news of their offer, upon the preſumption that it would not be accepted, and that this circumſtance would aſſiſt their intended miſſion to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. And it is ſaid that duplicates of the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred aſſurances were read in jacobin meetings in Pennſylvania, previous to the nomination, and that the <hi>worthy</hi> members of theſe meetings only waited for Congreſs to break up, in order to blaze them abroad.</p>
            <p>But France wanted a <hi>ſalvo,</hi> and this was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily furniſhed by the proſtituted Skip with and Barlow. The following is taken from their letter to a Member of the Executive Directory; the date it will be recollected was the 12th of February 1799. <q>The enlightened policy which has ever animated your conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                  </gap> kind reception you gave that eſtimable patriot Doctor Logan, which has been followed by the moſt happy effects, induce us to addreſs you ſome reflections on the intelligence lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from that country. We ſhall take the liberty of expoſing to you our opinion rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the beſt mode of ſilencing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of France in America, extending and invigorating republican principles" &amp;c. &amp;c. The Congreſs muſt riſe on or before the 4th of March, (20 days from this) as the bienni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al functions of all the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and one third of the Senate, ceaſe on that day. Should the Preſident therefore be diſpoſed to name a miniſter, he cannot do it after that day, without calling a ſpecial meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſenate; which delay would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily throw that operation into the ſummer; and ſuch miniſter could not arrive in Paris till next autumn or winter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>France, ſeated on the car of victory, is ſurrounded with too much glory, to fear that an act of condeſcention ſhould be miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, or aſcribed to any other cauſe than her own magnanimity. You would abridge the ſufferings of your colonies, revive the manufactures, commerce and agriculture of many parts of France, give a new triumph to republican principles, and make a better treaty than could be made under other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, if you would ſend a miniſter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Philadelphia." "If we dared to give a ſuggeſtion on an object ſtill more delicate, we would hazard our opinion rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035103_0015_1000A698D4F2F9E0"/>to the qualities of the perſon whom you may charge with this miſſion to Philadelphia. We ſhould invite you to chooſe a citizen whoſe name and character are known and reſpected in America; who by his writings may have merited the eſteem of the two countries; a citizen, if poſſible, who may have ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with our excellent philoſopher and patriot, Jefferſon; and whoſe known moderation, integrity and wiſdom ſhall at the ſame time prevent his being diſagreeable to the opoſite party; a citizen whoſe enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love of liberty, in its moſt extenſive effects, ſhall render him proper for a negotiation which may become the ſource of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive proſperity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After reading this, can any one heſitate as to the expediency of the late nomination? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs were juſt about diſſolving without declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war, notwithſtanding the loſſes and the buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings we had ſuffered and endured. The ſame conſtitution which gives Congreſs the <hi>"power to declare war"</hi> gives the Preſident the <q>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the ſenators preſent concur;</q> to <q>nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, appoint ambaſſadors and other public miniſters,</q> and <hi>makes it his duty</hi> to <hi>"re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> ambaſſadors and other public miniſters. The Preſident was to be left nine months the ſubject, (I was going to ſay the ſport) of French diplomatic ſkill. <q>A citizen whoſe name and character are known, and reſpected in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</q> was deſignated, to allure us. The
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035103_0016_1000B7E5F784F3A0"/>
               <hi>tyger</hi> was in fact <hi>crouching to leap upon his prey,</hi> but our vigilant Executive diſcovered his <q>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous fangs peeping through the downy vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet of his paws,</q> and checked the hideous monſter at the outſet.</p>
            <p>That great ſtateſman whoſe writings ſtill il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumine the world which his immortal part has lately left, declares in his celebrated <q>Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the French Revolution</q> that he <q>would preſerve conſiſtency, by varying his means to ſecure the unity of his end.</q> He who has the affairs of a nation to direct, muſt know to accompliſh this, or he will be illy fit for the truſt. The feelings and paſſions which operate in the common intercourſe of mankind, ought to be diſcarded when the fate of our country is at iſſue. Keppel, one of the moſt judicious, brave and experienced officers that the naval hiſtory of Britain can boaſt, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the command of the channel fleet in 1778 was accuſed of having been guilty of miſconduct on the 27th of July of that year. Unjuſtly attacked in the houſe of Commons, by thoſe who neither knew his difficulties nor reſources, he calmly replied, <hi>I conſidered, on that day, that I had England in my hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps if the tide of ſucceſs had continued on the ſide of France, many who now complain of the nomination, would have applauded it. But I contend, that the change of fortune among the belligerent powers is an argument in favour of the policy of the meaſure. We ſhall be more likely to obtain juſtice from France, while ſhe is going down hill and contending againſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior power, than we ſhould be, were ſhe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035103_0017_1000B7E7810D5920"/>ſeated on the car of victory," The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwevn the two nations, muſt ſome time or other be ſettled; and while nothing is done, contrary to our engagements to other nations, <hi>our Government</hi> is alone the judge when to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate, or attempt to negotiate. Advantage ought to be taken, of every conjuncture, which can poſſibly turn out to our benefit.</p>
            <p>If there are any, who wiſh to hear only one ſide of the queſtion; ſuch may ſay, <q>as the envoys are gone on their miſſion, why this tedious eſſay?</q> To theſe it is replied, that the objections to the miſſion have gone forth to the world, and are circulated in Europe as well as America. And if any miſunderſtanding, ſhould ariſe in conſequence of this miſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and any other powers, <hi>ſome</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican objectors will have the merit of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anticipated it, juſt in the ſame degree that the jacobins, have that, of fortelling, French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and depredations in conſequence of the Britiſh treaty.</p>
            <p>But we are not to conſult the pleaſure of any foreign nation, in our negotiations with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther —the moment we do, we relinquiſh our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence. <hi>National friendſhip?</hi> is alas! to be found only in the imaginations, of revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary fanatics. <hi>Intereſt,</hi> is the ſpring of all national intercourſe. America has paid too dearly for this leſſon, ſo ſoon to give it up.</p>
