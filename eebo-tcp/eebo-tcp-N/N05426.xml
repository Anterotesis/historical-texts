            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT would be a Defect both in Gratitude and Duty, if the firſt Diſcourſe from the Pulpit in Favour of INOCULATION, was not moſt humbly inſcribed to YOUR MAJESTY.</p>
            <p>THE Nation, among numerous other Inſtances of paternal Regard, ſtands obli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged to YOUR MAJESTY's Goodneſs and Reſolution, for the Introduction and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of that ſalutary Practice.</p>
            <p>THE very early Concern YOUR MAJESTY ſhewed for the Safety and Happineſs of this Kingdom, by expoſing Your own va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Life, with great Intrepidity, to all the Hazards of War, was again apparent, when, with equal Firmneſs of Mind, You
<pb facs="unknown:006871_0003_102A8168AA6EE658"/>
expoſed the important Lives of Your own tender and Royal Offspring, in the firſt Experiments made in <hi>Britain</hi> of the Effects of this Method of communicating an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe dangerous and often fatal Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>AND probably to thisOperation we owe the Life of that illuſtrious PRINCE, to whom, under Divine Providence, this Nation, and the whole Proteſtant Intereſt, are ſo deeply indebted, for the happy Victory at the Battle of <hi>Colloden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT YOUR MAJESTY's vigilant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the Welfare of Your People, in all Reſpects, may be rewarded with a very long and happy Reign upon Earth, and crowned with immortal Glory in Heaven, is the ardent Prayer of,</p>

               <q>—And that thou bring the <hi>Poor</hi> that are are caſt out, to thy Houſe.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE Words are Part of a Deſcription of that <hi>Humiliation</hi> and Worſhip, that is <hi>really acceptable</hi> to the great Creator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the World; as highly proper in itſelf, and as a juſt Imitation of his divine Goodneſs, <hi>which regardeth the Prayer of the poor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, and deſpiſeth not his Deſire</hi>; and which, in the ſacred Writings, is ſo frequently repreſented, both as an <hi>Example</hi> and an <hi>Encouragement</hi> to human Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>IS not <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Faſt,</hi> ſays Almighty God, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>that I have choſen, to looſe the Bands of Wickedneſs,— to undo the heavy Burdens</hi>; — is it not to <hi>deal thy Bread to the Hungry; and that thou bring the Poor that are caſt out,</hi> (caſt out and <hi>afflicted,</hi> as the original Word alſo ſignifies) <hi>to thy Houſe</hi>? and that thou <hi>hide not</hi> thyſelf from <hi>thine own Fleſh</hi>?</p>
            <p>THE ſore Diſtreſs of our Fellow-creatures, our own Fleſh, literally <hi>caſt out and afflicted,</hi> which occaſions the preſent Solemnity, falls very naturally under the Command of the Text, <hi>Bring the</hi> Poor <hi>that are</hi> caſt out <hi>to thy</hi> Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:006871_0005_102A8172878ACD28"/>THE SMALL POX is a well known Diſtemper, to which Providence has been pleaſed to ſubject Mankind, the Seeds of it being intermixed with the human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; this may be ſaid <hi>in general,</hi> becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thoſe, who <hi>paſs through</hi> Life, after having arrived at Manhood, and <hi>having been within the Reach of Infection,</hi> are ſo <hi>extremely few,</hi> as ſcarce to form an Exception; learned Calculations have made it as one to many Hundreds.</p>
            <p>AT the ſame Time, this <hi>almoſt univerſal Diſeaſe</hi> is very <hi>loathſome</hi> and <hi>nauſeous</hi> both to the <hi>Sufferers</hi> and <hi>thoſe who attend them</hi>; ſo <hi>ſpreading</hi> and <hi>infectious,</hi> as to prevent all friendly Aſſiſtance from Perſons who have not themſelves undergone the Diſtemper; and likewiſe ſo <hi>pernicious</hi> and <hi>fatal,</hi> as, upon a very <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Calculation,</hi> to deſtroy <hi>One in Seven</hi> of all whom it attacks, and very <hi>often</hi> in much <hi>greater</hi> Proportion. An Inſtrument of Death that ſlays without Diſtinction! Youth and Beauty, Dignity and Power, Wealth and Affluence, are no Protection; the Palace and the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſtand in this reſpect upon a Level, and the <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>the Poor meet</hi> and <hi>fall together</hi>; poſſibly with ſome <hi>Diſadvantage</hi> to the former, if <hi>their</hi> Blood has been inflamed by luxurious Diet and high Living.</p>
            <p>AND where Numbers of Men are collected together, as in Garriſons, Regiments, or the Crew of a Ship, the Havock is prodigious; which in ſome Junctures <hi>has been,</hi> and therefore <hi>may be,</hi> highly prejudicial in <hi>a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal View,</hi> beſides the Loſs of Lives.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Confuſion</hi> and Terror of the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> the <hi>Ceſſation</hi> of Trade and Buſineſs, and the <hi>great Slaughter</hi> made by this dreadful Malady when, like a <hi>deſtroying Angel,</hi> it attacks populous Towns and Villages, are extreamly certain and notorious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:006871_0006_102A81741AC24010"/>NOW, the <hi>general</hi> View of the preſent charitable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, is with God's Bleſſing, to render this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Diſtemper <hi>leſs</hi> deſtructive, and diminiſh that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Devaſtation which it <hi>now</hi> continually makes among the human Species.</p>
            <p>AND the Relief <hi>here</hi> propos'd to the Poor, is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly purſued by <hi>two</hi> different Methods; the one is, as it were <hi>preventive,</hi> to leſſen the <hi>Violence</hi> and the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> of this <hi>malignant Diſeaſe</hi>; the other is to ſupply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent, diſtreſs'd, Patients, who <hi>actually</hi> labour under it <hi>by common Infection,</hi> with all neceſſary Aſſiſtance and Relief. The Aim of the previous Method is this, <hi>viz.</hi> After due Preparation, in a <hi>known,</hi> viſible Manner, to raiſe that Commotion in the Blood, which ſends forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Surface of the Body the latent Materials of this Diſtemper ſo very dangerous, when excited in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Way by infectious Particles unperceived. It ſeems therefore (like the raiſing a Fit of the Gout, when the Particles of that painful Malady are diſperſed thro' the whole Maſs of Blood) not ſo properly the giving a Diſtemper to a human Body intirely free from and out of Danger of that Diſtemper, as chooſing the <hi>ſafeſt</hi> Time and Manner of cauſing a Diſorder, otherwiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unavoidable in a Way extremely more pernicious, the Fuel thereof being lodged within us. An <hi>Intention</hi> beyond all <hi>Diſpute</hi> worthy of much <hi>Approbation</hi>; and which ſhould always be purſued with the utmoſt Care and Precaution both in the Choice of the Perſon from whom the infectious Matter is collected, and of unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable Subjects, upon whom the Operation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</p>
            <p>IT is needleſs to enter into a Diſquiſition, which is the propereſt Method of <hi>deſignedly</hi> raiſing this Diſorder in the Human Frame, by <hi>carrying</hi> the Perſon that is to receive it to the <hi>contagious Steams</hi> or Effluvia; on,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006871_0007_102A8178F9AB3AB8"/>
               <hi>bringing</hi> to him the <hi>infected</hi> Matter. <hi>Religious</hi> Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (<hi>if any ſtill remain</hi> concerning a Practice, that has preſerv'd ſo many Lives, and prevented the heavieſt Grief in ſo many Families) are <hi>exactly the ſame,</hi> in either Method of <hi>voluntary</hi> Communication.</p>
            <p>FOR 'tis no more invading the Prerogative of Heaven, to occaſion one eaſy and voluntary Conveyance of the Infection than another; by a <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>hardly</hi> ſenſible Raſure upon the Skin of the Arm, than communicating the ſame Diſtemper by inviſible Particles, to that tender Organ the Lungs, which are ſo frequently affected by the Venom of this Diſeaſe, when contracted by the Breath, or receiving into the Body infected Particles in what is called the natural Way.</p>
            <p>WERE this <hi>preventive</hi> Method <hi>univerſally ſucceſsful,</hi> and never <hi>once</hi> to fail in <hi>any</hi> Inſtance whatſoever, 'tis ſcarce to be preſumed that any Objection would be raiſed againſt a ſalutary Expedient, to preſerve from Deſtruction ſo great a Part of the human Species, as daily fall by this mortal Enemy, when it attacks Men as it were in the Dark, <hi>ignorant</hi> of, and <hi>unprepar'd</hi> for the Aſſault.</p>
            <p>THIS Method of Inoculation would then be no more liable to Cenſure, than the making a <hi>voluntary</hi> Wound, by <hi>Inciſion,</hi> to form a neceſſary Drain; or adminiſtring any operative Medicine, which upon <hi>repeated Trials</hi> had prov'd an <hi>unfailing Security</hi> againſt any other <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>prevailing</hi> Peſtilence or Contagion.</p>
            <p>BUT, in order to <hi>excite</hi> and <hi>ſecure</hi> a <hi>Dependence</hi> upon his <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> the GREAT GOVERNOR of the World has appointed that no human Affairs, not even our neceſſary <hi>Suſtenance,</hi> ſhould be attended with ſuch <hi>abſolute</hi> Certainty; a very wiſe Appointment! That <hi>vain</hi> Man might not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Being, but <hi>among</hi> all the <hi>Changes</hi> and <hi>Chances</hi> of this mortal Life, ſhould ſtill look up unto, becauſe he can only be defended by, God's moſt gracious and ready Help.</p>
            <p>EXPERIENCE alone muſt <hi>determine</hi> the good or bad Conſequences of this artificial Infection, as it ought to do in <hi>all other</hi> medical Attempts, which in many Inſtances are, in <hi>reality,</hi> little more than curing or alleviating <hi>one</hi> Diſtemper, by exciting or introducing <hi>another.</hi> And in this View the Method, now under Conſideration, of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening the Hazard of a very mortal Diſeaſe, ſhould be conſidered in the ſame Light as every other <hi>Antidote,</hi> or <hi>preventive</hi> Attempt in Phyſic or Surgery, againſt any probable, almoſt certain Malady, internal or external. I forbear therefore to derive any Strength to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the great Number of <hi>noble, venerable,</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> Perſons of every <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the public Advocates of this compaſſionate Deſign: Let it ſtand upon its own proper Evidence, and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>A SAFE Paſſage thro' this Diſtemper, like the eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating <hi>Slaves,</hi> is a Deliverance to vaſt Numbers of People, kept as it were in <hi>Bondage</hi>; who, <hi>before</hi> they have undergone this <hi>abhorred</hi> Diſeaſe, are <hi>excluded</hi> from <hi>many</hi> Offices of Life, and prevented from purſuing their neceſſary Buſineſs; and it gives Tranquillity and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to Perſons of better Condition, who under Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of this loathſome and infectious Diſorder, were all their former Days ſubject to great Anxiety and conſtant Fear.</p>
            <p>'TIS needleſs to enter into a Diſcuſſion of ſeveral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, that attended the Infancy of this uſeful Practice, which Time and fuller Experience have now removed; with reſpect to the Communication of <hi>other Diſeaſes</hi> with the varielous Matter; or that certain Ails and Complaints
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006871_0009_102A8180E3BC54A8"/>
have follow'd the inoculated Diſtemper; of both which Inconveniencies there is <hi>at leaſt</hi> an equal Hazard upon Infection, by an unperceiv'd Contagion, that, like a <hi>Peſtilence walketh in Darkneſs</hi>: Or that the Diſeaſe is more likely to return after Inoculation. The large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of many Years has now effectually removed all theſe Objections, nor can it be wondred at, if in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi> of the Practice <hi>eſpecially,</hi> ſome few Attempts have prov'd ineffectual.</p>
            <p>BEYOND all Diſpute, in the <hi>voluntary</hi> Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Diſeaſe, there is an happy Opportunity to chooſe—The beſt Seaſon of the Year — The early, the propereſt Time of Life— A Juncture when the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> it ſelf is moſt <hi>favourable,</hi> and the Blood is in a right State to receive it, neither too much enriched, nor too much impoveriſhed — To prevent treating the firſt <hi>doubtful</hi> Symptoms in an improper manner— To avoid <hi>Cold,</hi> or <hi>Inflammation</hi> of the Blood, by Food, Liquors, or Exerciſe, after the <hi>known</hi> Infection is received.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed to the only ſure Evidence, real Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Matter of Fact; in which almoſt every Part of the Globe, <hi>Aſia, Europe</hi> and <hi>America</hi> give a concurrent Teſtimony — GREAT BRITAIN in particular has now had a Trial of this voluntary Method of artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially exciting the Diſtemper for <hi>near thirty Years</hi> at different Times, and diſtant Places, with very great Succeſs.</p>
            <p>AT <hi>firſt,</hi> indeed, in this, as in other very uſeful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>s, the Succeſs was far inferior to what longer Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and repeated Trials have <hi>now ſo happily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,</hi> in this <hi>Metropolis,</hi> as well as in diverſe other Places, particularly in that uſeful Eſtabliſhment formed for the Reception of deſerted young Children; and more eſpecially in <hi>this Hoſpital</hi> peculiarly inſtituted for

this good Purpoſe, being <hi>one Branch</hi> of the Charity for which we are now aſſembled.</p>
            <p>BESIDES this <hi>general Evidence</hi> of the Advantages of Inoculation, I can ſpeak with more Aſſurance upon the beneficial Effects of that Operation, becauſe I ſpeak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on full Information, and by the Permiſſion of three Gentlemen in particular, of deſerved Eminence and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in the Profeſſion <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Serjeant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="1">I. That the artificial Communication of <hi>the Small Pox by Inoculation,</hi> is, almoſt without Exception, an effectual Security againſt that dangerous Symptom the <hi>ſecond</hi> Fever, which deſtroys ſo great Part of thoſe who periſh in the natural Way.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That under Inoculation, there is ſcarce any Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in Breathing or Complaint upon the Lungs, which Diſorder produces ſo many bad Effects when the Diſtemper is received in the unknown and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Manner.</p>
            <p n="3">The III<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and moſt material Article is the great and happy Succeſs, as to Numbers, with which God's good Providence has bleſſed this uſeful Operation; Great, beyond the moſt ſanguine Hopes; ſo great that in above FIFTEEN HUNDRED Perſons inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by theſe eminent Hands, only <hi>three</hi> have
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006871_0011_102A81889909CE28"/>
died; and this very material Fact is alſo confirmed by unexceptionable Accounts from diverſe other Places <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Thus, for Example, the learned Dr. <hi>Langriſh</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> gives the following Account:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>About ten Years ago the Small Pox raged furiouſly in <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and ſome neighbouring Towns, and in the natural Way proved an unkind Sort, which induced great Numbers to be inoculated. In PORTSMOUTH, CHICHESTER, GUILFORD, PETERSFIELD, and WINCHESTER, we reckon near two thouſand that were inoculated at that Time, and (except two Women, who were <hi>both with Child,</hi> and both inoculated <hi>contrary</hi> to the Advice of their Phyſician I don't remember to have heard of any one bad Accident that befel any of them, but what might very reaſonably have been ſuppoſed to have proved worſe, if they had had the Small Pox in the natural Way. More than this, I think, can't well be ſaid to prove the Uſefulneſs of Inoculation.</q>
                  </p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>BUT that a Matter of ſuch Importance many be brought to ſome apparent Certainty, it may not be improper to enter a little into Calculation.</p>
            <p>FROM the <hi>annual Account</hi> within the Bills of Mortality (in which many Places in and near the City are omitted) it appears, that in <hi>twenty Years, viz.</hi> from the Year 1731 to the Year 1750 incluſive, no leſs than 39,115 Perſons have died of this fatal Diſtemper; which, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Places not inſerted in the Weekly Bills, muſt be conſiderably more than 2,000 every Year that fall in the two adjoining Cities and Parts adjacent.</p>
            <p>AND if only <hi>one</hi> in <hi>ſeven</hi> (which is a very ſufficient Allowance) is ſuppoſed to die by the Diſtemper taken in the <hi>natural Way,</hi> then the whole Number of Perſons who in this Period of <hi>twenty Years</hi> have been thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, amounts to 280,000, and of theſe no leſs than 40,000 have periſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006871_0012_102A818ECAEE8DB0"/>BUT if in every TWO HUNDRED <hi>One</hi> ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to die <hi>under Inoculation,</hi> which, as obſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, is really much more than fall by that artificial Infection, now continually advancing with increaſing Safety; and the certain Fact, as above-mentioned, is only <hi>One</hi> in 500, being leſs than half of the Number I have ſtated — But ſuppoſe I ſay <hi>One</hi> in 200 to die under <hi>Inoculation,</hi> then had this artificial Method of conveying the Diſtemper univerſally taken place, inſtead of that prodigious Deſtruction of Mankind, 40,000 in the Space of 20 Years in one Diſtrict, no more than 1400 had periſhed; and the Difference in that ſhort Period would have been no leſs than THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED Lives preſerved, beſides the numerous Poſterity that might have been derived from them. And were this Practice univerſal in theſe two Cities <hi>only</hi> NINETEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY Lives, under the Bleſſing of God, would be annually preſerved.</p>
            <p>'TIS a pleaſing Obſervation, That the Slaughter made by this formidable Diſtemper is greatly decreaſed, the Numbers as recorded in the Yearly Bills, being one-fifth leſſened <hi>ſince</hi> this Practice has prevailed.</p>
            <p>FACTS like theſe, ſpeak ſo ſtrongly and ſo clearly, that Reaſoning and Argument muſt be quite ſuperfluous, to excite your generous and ample Contributions, which are abſolutely neceſſary to carry on and extend this <hi>great,</hi> this <hi>compaſſionate,</hi> this <hi>national</hi> Undertaking. Humanity, Regard to our Country, the Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Precepts of Religion, would awaken your generous Sentiments at any Juncture; but eſpecially at this unhappy Period, when <hi>Debauchery, Vice,</hi> with the moſt deſtructive and as it were peſtilential <hi>Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi> are making ſuch daily and dreadful Havock among the Inhabitants of this Iſland, as renders every Deſign, every Attempt to preſerve the Lives of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006871_0013_102A8192929B5228"/>
People, extremely ſeaſonable, and to the higheſt Degree neceſſary!</p>
            <p>THOSE, in particular, who have themſelves, or whoſe Children have, by God's great Goodneſs, ſafely paſſed thro' the Dangers of ſo deſtructive a Diſtemper, by this happy Expedient; thoſe alſo who are deſirous to obtain the divine Bleſſing when the Experiment is made in their own Family, cannot fail to exceed in Bounty, that the Lives of the <hi>Poor,</hi> (of <hi>great Regard in the Sight of God</hi>) may alſo be preſerved.</p>
            <p>BUT it is high time to turn our Thoughts to the other Branch of this great and neceſſary Undertaking, the <hi>Relief</hi> of deſtitute and miſerable Creatures, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under this <hi>dreadful</hi> Diſtemper, contracted by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Infection.</p>
            <p>THIS mournful Caſe is peculiarly affecting, as theſe wretched Sufferers are ſo <hi>really caſt out</hi> and <hi>afflicted</hi>; afflicted with one of the <hi>ſoreſt Maladies</hi> incident to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, <hi>caſt out</hi> and abandoned of all human Help.</p>
            <p>THIS beneficial Charity therefore is not a new Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but a moſt deſirable Addition, and a neceſſary Supplement to all other <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> ſince from all other <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> theſe deſtitute and miſerable Objects are <hi>una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably excluded,</hi> and ſometimes even forcibly expelled, in the <hi>utmoſt Diſtreſs,</hi> and without any Place of <hi>Refuge</hi>!</p>
            <p>THE uſual <hi>Danger</hi> of this terrible Diſeaſe, is by this Means greatly increaſed, I might ſay aſcertained by their abſolute want of all neceſſary Care and Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>CAN Thought conceive a more deplorable Condition, or is any Sorrow like unto their Sorrow? Nor <hi>Food,</hi> nor <hi>Phyſic,</hi> nor <hi>Bed</hi> to lie upon, nor <hi>Houſe</hi> to cover
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006871_0014_102A819480A4E2F0"/>
their diſeaſed Bodies from the coldeſt Blaſts of the open Air! This is no Picture drawn by Imagination, but real and certain tho' moſt melancholy Fact, which, to the Knowledge of many who now hear me, has occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in numerous, affecting, ſhocking Inſtances, one of which would be ſufficient to move the hardeſt Heart of any Spectator.</p>
            <p>PERSONS unavoidably driven out from other Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as ſoon as this Diſtemper appears to be their real Complaint; induſtrious Labourers that come from far, in the buſy Time of Harveſt, with many others, in ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Circumſtances, make up the Inſtances that ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occur, of <hi>wretched</hi> Objects <hi>quite deſtitute</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> or <hi>Habitation</hi> into which they can gain Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion.</p>
            <p>BUT where the Calamity does not reach this extream Degree of Woe and Miſery, there is ſtill, in too many ſad Inſtances, Diſtreſs enough to melt any human Heart.</p>
            <p>TAKE, for <hi>Example,</hi> a Caſe that lately happened, —</p>
            <p>A POOR Man ſick of this <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> of which his <hi>Wife</hi> lay dead in the <hi>ſame</hi> Room, with <hi>four Children</hi> around him <hi>catching the dreadful Infection,</hi> but deſtitute of <hi>all</hi> Relief, till they found <hi>ſome</hi> in that too narrow Building, which now importunately begs your compaſſionate Bounty to enlarge its Dimenſions, that you may <hi>then,</hi> without <hi>Repulſe</hi> or <hi>Refuſal,</hi> bring the <hi>Poor</hi> that <hi>are caſt out</hi> and <hi>afflicted,</hi> to <hi>a Houſe of Mercy</hi>!</p>
            <p>IT would afford greater Joy to reflect, tho' ſome have died in this Place, and no wonder, when they often come almoſt in the laſt Stage of the Diſtemper, that yet near 800 poor Creatures have, by the Bleſſing of the Almighty, received a Cure under this pious and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006871_0015_102A81981F872EA8"/>
charitable Inſtitution, were not this Joy darkened by a Cloud of unrelieved Diſtreſs and Miſery.</p>
            <p>BUT cruel it would be, in the higheſt Degree, to poor rejected Supplicants, and unfaithful to the Nation, not to publiſh, that the preſent Supplies for this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and neceſſary Undertaking, are ſo defective and inadequate, that the Doors of this charitable Houſe, all the Beds being full, are continually ſhut againſt a great Number of miſerable Objects, ſometimes <hi>ſeven</hi> or <hi>eight,</hi> in one Day, who implore Admittance; but, alaſs! im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore in vain! The Extent of the preſent Building is by much too ſmall, and the preſent Fund quite inſufficient to enlarge it. Beſides that Anguiſh of Heart which theſe unhappy Creatures feel, upon being rejected, the Publick alſo may ſuffer greatly.</p>
            <p>FOR, could ſuch poor Wretches be received into an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> before the Diſeaſe becomes infectious, <note n="*" place="bottom">It is greatly to be wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

engage our Compaſſion to the afflicted Poor, when they have the Misfortune to be viſited by the ſame Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>MAN, it is always ſaid, is a ſocial Creature, and it is no leſs certain that he ought to be a religious one; but if ever this Character can ſhine with diſtinguiſhed Luſtre, and Society and the Influence of pure and undefiled Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, appear with ſuperior Advantage, it muſt be in ſuch Aſſemblies as <hi>this,</hi> collected for the Purpoſes of pious Benevolence and Compaſſion, in Behalf of the afflicted Part of our own Species.</p>
            <p>AND if ever <hi>Scenes of Wretchedneſs and Miſery</hi> ought to move the Heart, and engage theſe amiable Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the deep and deplorable Diſtreſs of the Objects now under Conſideration, will certainly produce that deſirable Effect, and to a Degree anſwerable to the large Supplies that are abſolutely requiſite in a Caſe ſo very extenſive.</p>
            <p>REFLECT, with Attention, upon that beautiful, and, in the preſent Caſe, very appoſite Parable of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted rich Man, and the afflicted <hi>Lazarus,</hi> drawn by the <hi>compaſſionate Saviour</hi> of Mankind, to excite Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and Pity, by repreſenting the different Fate and Condition of the uncharitable <hi>Rich,</hi> and the diſtreſſed <hi>Poor,</hi> in this World, and in the next.</p>
