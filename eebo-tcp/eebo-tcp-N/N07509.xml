            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>O GOD, the father of lights, author of truth and virtue, from whom deſcendeth every good and perfect gift; we moſt humbly beſeech thee, through the mediation of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, favourably with thy mercy to hear our prayers, and grant all our petitions agreable to thy will. For the merits of thine only SON, accept our unworthineſs; give us true Repentance, and pardon all our Sins.</p>
            <p>Receive our thanks and praiſes to thy Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, for thine infinite Power exerted with perfect Wiſdom and Goodneſs. We admire and celebrate the unſpeakable glories and perfections of thy nature: and extol thy goodneſs to the children of men, in making us the higheſt order of beings in the world we inhabit, capable of loving and adoring Thee. We venerate thy bounteous Providence, in continually protecting and ſupporting us. Above all, we labour to expreſs our thanks and praiſe, for thy love to a ſinful and apoſtate world, in reſtoring to us again the

means of grace and hope of glory, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in CHRIST JESUS. Grant, that we may henceforth expreſs our ſenſe of thy tranſcendent love to us, by loving thee above all things, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind for thy ſake. Diſpoſe our hearts, by thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful grace, to ſympathize with the miſeries and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the wants of the poor and afflicted; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with ſincerity all the duties of Juſtice and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: by Faithfulneſs, Friendſhip and Affection to one another, by ſubjection for conſcience ſake to our Governours in Church and State, by Chriſtian unity and religious Concord.</p>
            <p>Bleſs and proſper the reformed Churches, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Church of England, and its ſupreme head on earth, our ſovereign Lord the King. So diſpoſe and govern his heart, that he may ever ſeek thy honour and glory, and preſerve thy people in wealth, peace and godlineſs.

Be propitious to This and all our ſincere attempts and endeavours to offer thee our praiſe and honour: and grant, that in the uſe of all outward <hi>means</hi> of devotion, for the advancement of thy worſhip, we may always conſider the <hi>end;</hi> and to our external homage, may unite our inmoſt affections, and all the powers of our ſouls, to adore and celebrate Thee: that in all our works, words, and thoughts, we may glorify thy holy name, and finally by thy mercy obtain ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, through JESUS CHRIST our LORD: who hath taught us thus to pray.</p>

            <p>EPHESUS, a maritime city of Iönia, renowned for its opulence, commerce, and ſuperſtitions, was a place of the greateſt reſort of any in the <hi>province of Aſia:</hi> and buſineſs, curioſity, or religion drew thither men of all cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and conditions. In this idolatrous city, St. Paul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to plant the Chriſtian Church<note n="*" place="bottom">ACTS XIX. XX.</note>: and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great oppoſition he met with, <q>the word of GOD mightily grew and prevailed;</q> ſo that <q>all they which dwelt in Aſia, heard the word of the LORD JESUS, both Jews and Greeks.</q> To ſuch a mixture of converts from different nations, ſects and ſuperſtitions, St. Paul addreſſes this Epiſtle; and, with conſummate art and judgment, adapts his manner of writing to their peculiar circumſtances. There being ſo
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:009584_0007_0F76DE91A6D7B9C0"/>
great a diverſity in the former ſtate and opinions of thoſe, who had become his converts; ſome from Judaiſm, others from Idolatry; ſome from the ſchools of ſcience and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; others, who had been addicted to magic and the <hi>curious arts</hi> of Superſtition: the learned and judicious Apoſtle every where adapts his addreſs to their ſeveral manners and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; and labours eſpecially, to combine in one body and in one communion, in <hi>the unity of the ſpirit</hi> and <hi>in the bond of Peace,</hi> men who had no common principle of union or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but what they derived from their Chriſtian profeſſion. He illuſtrates this religious union by an allegory<note n="*" place="bottom">CH. II. 20—22. III. 18. IV. 16.</note> borrowed from the order and ſymmetry of the celebrated temple at Epheſus; an alluſion, which muſt have made a ſtriking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on his converts, to ſhew the moral harmony and ſpiritual beauty, which reſults from the unity of the whole Church of CHRIST. In purſuing this topic of Unity, which is principally kept in ſight through the whole Epiſtle; he inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in the III firſt Chapters, on the tranſcendent privileges of the Chriſtian Church, into which men of all nations and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters were freely admitted, as into a ſchool of virtue, and<note n="§" place="bottom">CH. 1. 3, 5, 10.</note> 'bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings,' that in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times (a well known periphraſis for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Goſpel) GOD might gather together in One all things in CHRIST: being <hi>choſen in him, before the foundation of the world, that they ſhould be</hi> henceforth <hi>holy and without blame before him in love; predeſtinated unto the adoption of children by</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:009584_0008_0F76DE9251ECB308"/>
JESUS CHRIST. In conſequence of theſe general privileges of Redemption, in the latter part of the Epiſtle he exhorts them to <hi>walk worthy of the vocation, wherewith</hi> they were <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;</hi> and deſcends to many admirable <hi>precepts</hi> for the conduct of the Chriſtian life in all its relations. That of the text, as applicable to the ſolemnity of this place and time, ſhall be particularly opened and enlarged upon. It is only ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the context, as it is part of an addreſs to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſian converts, inſtead of their <hi>former</hi> vain <hi>converſation,</hi> to ſubſtitute manners becoming their new and holy profeſſion. <q>Ye WERE ſometimes darkneſs; but NOW are ye light in the LORD: WALK as children of light—See then that ye walk circumſpectly, not as fools but as wiſe, redeeming the time:</q> that is, making up by an extraordinary diligence in Chriſtian ſanctification, for the time loſt in a ſtate of gentiliſm. He then exhorts them to temperance and ſobriety, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to their heathen revellings; <hi>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is exceſs,</hi> or luxury and riot: and teaches them to regulate their mirth by the Chriſtian ſtandard. <q>
                  <hi>But be filled with the</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>ſpeaking to yourſelves in pſalms and hymns and ſpiritual ſongs,</hi> SINGING and MAKING MELODY <hi>in your heart to the</hi> LORD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BY being <hi>filled with the ſpirit,</hi> the Apoſtle intimates, what he explains more at large in his Epiſtles to the Corinthians, that the Pſalmody or ſacred Poetry of the Chriſtian Church was
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009584_0009_0F76DE9341132198"/>
then the effect of divine Inſpiration; being one of the <hi>chariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual gifts</hi> of the HOLY GHOST: a gift of <hi>temporary</hi> uſe and continuance, like thoſe of languages, miracles, and unpremeditated prayer. As ſuch, they are plainly connected in that paſſage to the Corinthians; <hi>I will</hi> PRAY <hi>with the ſpirit, and I will pray with the underſtanding alſo; I will</hi> SING <hi>with the ſpirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 COR. XIV. 15.</note>. In the ſame chapter, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the abuſe of the gift of Tongues, and the regulation of it by the dictates of Reaſon, borrows an illuſtration from muſical inſtruments, which ſeems to intimate the uſe of them in the pſalmody of that Church<note n="†" place="bottom">ver. 7. See alſo REV. V. 8. XIV. 2. The martyr <hi>Ignatius</hi> has the like alluſion, to illuſtrate the Chriſtian union, by figures taken from Muſical harmony.

            <p>THE Engliſh Expreſſion in the text, <hi>ſpeaking to yourſelves,</hi> does not, I think, convey the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, or indeed any other good ſenſe. <hi>Lalountes eautois</hi> or <hi>en eautois,</hi> is liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>ſpeaking between yourſelves,</hi> that is, <hi>alternately,</hi> in the manner in which we recite our Pſalms. This ſenſe is well expreſſed in an invaluable Epiſtle of PLINY the conſul<note n="§" place="bottom">Lib. x. epiſt. 97, de Chriſtianis.</note>; who gives this noble teſtimony of the Chriſtian worſhip. <q>Soliti ſtato die ante lucem convenire, carmenque CHRISTO quaſi DEO dicere ſecum invicem. They uſed to meet on a ſtated day, before light, and ſing an hymn to CHRIST as
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009584_0010_0F76DE93E9F82FB8"/>
GOD, alternately.</q> The <hi>ſecum invicem</hi> of PLINY is the <hi>en eautois</hi> of the Apoſtle. This interpretation is confirmed by a parallel paſſage to the Coloſſians:<note n="†" place="bottom">COLOSS. III. 16, where <hi>eautois</hi> is uſed for <hi>allêlois,</hi> as in Epheſ. IV. 32. and in the text.</note> 
               <hi>Let the word of</hi> GOD <hi>dwell in you richly in all wiſdom; teaching and admoniſhing</hi> ONE ANOTHER, <hi>in pſalms and hymns and ſpiritual ſongs; ſinging with grace in your hearts to the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>IN both places, this diſtinction of the ſacred poetry into <hi>pſalms, hymns,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual ſongs,</hi> ſeems to be taken from the different kinds of poetic compoſition in the old teſtament, which are diſtinguiſhed by theſe ſeveral titles.

            <p>SINGING <hi>and</hi> MAKING MELODY <hi>in your hearts to the</hi> LORD—where the propriety of the words, <hi>adontes kai pſallontes,</hi> ſeems to expreſs both <hi>vocal</hi> and <hi>inſtrumental</hi> muſic. Of the firſt, there is no doubt of its having always obtained in the worſhip of Chriſtians; the latter, as a matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> is not ſo certain, though, as a matter of <hi>right</hi> and lawfulneſs, it is clear enough from this and other texts, and from ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009584_0011_0F76DE9605D74CE0"/>
which confirm this poſition. The words <hi>pſallô</hi> uſed in this text, properly ſignifies <hi>to ſing to an inſtrument;</hi> and is appropriated rather to the ſtriking of chords, as in the lute or harp, than to the accompaniment of the voice. But the lawful uſe of inſtrumental muſic in our Churches, does not depend meerly on the argument drawn from this etymology: though without this appropriation of the words, <hi>ſinging</hi> to the <hi>voice,</hi> and <hi>making melody,</hi> to the <hi>inſtruments,</hi> the text will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably labour with a diſtinction without a difference: an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracy ſeldom to be found in the holy writings, wherein a more exact propriety of words, is, I think, obſervable, than in any other ancient books.</p>
            <p>IT is well known that in the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Iönian</hi> cities, Muſic was ſo much in vogue, that a man was reckoned ill-bred, who could not touch an inſtrument. All their poetry, eſpecially of the lyric kind, and in the rites of Religion, was accompanied with muſic: And univerſally among the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, poetry and muſic were inſeparable<note n="*" place="bottom">Hendecaſyllaborum volumen—legitur, deſcribitur, <hi>cantatur</hi> etiam, et a Graecis quoque,—nunc <hi>citharâ</hi> nunc <hi>lyrâ</hi> perſonatur.'

From which we may draw a very probable concluſion, that the Epheſian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts were permitted by the Apoſtle to accompany their pſalms and hymns, with ſuch kinds of inſtruments, as were then in uſe: mere ſinging, without the grace of harmony and modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by the lute or other inſtruments, being almoſt entirely unknown to antiquity.</p>

HAVING thus commented on the text, I proceed to confirm this interpretation, by enquiring into the origin of Poetry and Muſic, and their application to Religion.</p>
            <p>POETRY is the child of Admiration. Our nobler paſſions, when ſtrongly excited by wonder and ſurprize, vent themſelves in elevated ſentiments and figurative language. Invention, Enthuſiaſm, and Sublimity of ſtile form the eſſence of Poetry<note n="†" place="bottom">

               </note>; and as theſe are connected moſt intimately with our ideas of the Divinity, Religion is the natural ſource of Poetry. Among the Greeks, (the moſt poetical nation in the world, except the Hebrews) the firſt efforts of poetry, were the praiſes of the gods, in hymns of thankfulneſs for fruitful ſeaſons and the harveſt or vintage. Among the Hebrews, the inventors of poetry, it had a ſtill nobler origin, and a truer application: being always conſecrated to Religion, and having never dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated like that of other nations, to inferior purpoſes. The poetry of the Hebrews, being dictated by a real Inſpiration, came to its perfection at once; and with the nobleſt enthuſiaſm and ſublimity of ſtile and ſentiment, has all the artifice of an exact though ſimple verſification. The moſt ancient regular poems that are preſerved entire in the ſcriptures, are thoſe of Moſes at the paſſage of the Red Sea, Exod. XV. and near the end of his life, Deut. XXXII. and perhaps the XCth Pſalm.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009584_0013_0F76DE9771B25DC8"/>
But fragments of much greater antiquity are interſperſed in the Pentateuch. It is particularly noted, that the ſong at the paſſage of the Red Sea was performed by choruſſes of men and women; and accompanied with dancing and inſtruments.</p>
            <p>AS the Poetry of Scripture makes ſo large a part of the Old Teſtament; I will offer a few obſervations on ſuch books and pieces, as are ſtrictly poetical, not only in the elevation of ſtile and ſentiment, but in the cadence and verſification. This every where conſiſts of <hi>iämbic</hi> or <hi>trochäic</hi> meaſures, correſponding to the numbers and accent of our Engliſh poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: being not diſtinguiſhed from proſe, by the length or ſhortneſs of feet and ſyllables, but ſolely by the regular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and harmonious cadence. The figures that moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the Hebrew poetry are the antitheſis and the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaſm or climax. Moſt of the verſes conſiſt of two mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the latter of which is often an amplification or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the former; and is uſually a key to the true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of obſcurer paſſages. This artifice in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is one reaſon, that the fire and ſpirit of the Hebrew poetry cannot be extinguiſhed in the moſt literal and proſaic verſion. Our own language ſeems very happily adapted to expreſs, in a kind of meaſured proſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Should the Church be bleſſed with a new Engliſh verſion of the Scriptures, or with an exact and critical correction of the preſent Tranſlation: together with a more juſt diviſion of the Chapters and Paragraphs; might it not add to the perſpicuity and elegance of the poetical books, to diſpoſe them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Hebrew metre, ſtiche-wiſe or in verſicles; as in Dr. <hi>Grabe'</hi>s edition of the Septuagint, and as in Biſhop <hi>Hare'</hi>s hebrew edition of the Pſalms, and Dr. <hi>Grey'</hi>s, of Job, Proverbs, &amp;c?</note>, the peculiar genius of Eaſtern poetry.</p>

BESIDES the lyric poems of Moſes, which were wrote 1500 years before Homer, we have in the Book of Judges. Ch. V. the triumphant ſong of Deborah and Barak, on the defeat of the Midianites. In this and ſeveral other pieces of the ſame character<note n="†" place="bottom">ISAIAH XIV. 3—27.

HIS Proverbs are a didactic poem, of very different charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: the firſt part (ch.

            <p>IN this review of the Hebrew poetry, it would be unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable to omit the book of JOB: which all agree to be the far nobleſt dramatic poem, that is any where extant; though there is a great diverſity of opinions, both as to the ſcope and antiquity of it.

MUSIC is among the earlieſt inventions of the arts of life: being aſſigned by Moſes to one of the ſons of Lamech: as the introduction of property [<hi>mikneh</hi>] is aſcribed to another of the ſame race. <q>Jubal was the father [or, inventor of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical inſtruments, and the teacher] of all ſuch, as handle the harp and organ<note n="*" place="bottom">GEN.

The firſt ſpecimen of poetry ſeems to be thoſe obſcure metrical verſes (for ſuch they are) of Lamech to his wives, in the ſame chapter<note n="‡" place="bottom">GEN. IV. 23, 24.</note>. The harp and timbrel are often mentioned in the ſubſequent hiſtory. But the muſic as well as poetry of the Hebrews, ſeems to have attained its perfection, under that great maſter and patron of both, King David. The wonderful effects of his muſic on the <hi>evil ſpirit</hi> of Saul, which was probably a deep and rooted melancholy, ſhew that it was

            <p>TO judge of the improvements of this fine art, let us take a curſory view of David's regulation of it, for the ſervice of GOD's tabernacle. In the books of Chronicles we find 4000 Levites, divided into courſes, under 288 eminent maſters, <hi>that were inſtructed in the ſongs of the</hi> LORD, appointed to praiſe the LORD <hi>with muſical inſtruments of</hi> GOD<note n="‖" place="bottom">CHRONIC. b.

trumpets, &amp;c. from the number and variety of which, it is probable, that the Hebrew muſic was of great compaſs and harmony; ſuitable in majeſty and grace, to the exquiſite elegance and ſublimity of their poetry. It appears from the CXXXVIIth pſalm, that the Jews in their captivity were highly eſteemed for their muſic by their Conquerors; and we read that 200 muſicians of both ſexes returned with Ezra from Babylon<note n="†" place="bottom">EZRA II. 65.</note>.</p>
            <p>NO nation ſeems more to have cultivated this art, than the Jews: though wonders are told us of the Grecian muſic, which was under the regulation of their Legiſlators, and of great influence on the public manners<note n="*" place="bottom">POLYBIUS, aſcribes the ferocity of the <hi>Cynaethians,</hi> and the humane and hoſpitable diſpoſition of the other <hi>Arcadians,</hi> chiefly to the neglect of muſic among the former, and the eſteem and practice of it among the reſt. From this inſtance we may conjecture, that Muſic might be applied with good effect to civilize our American Indians, <q>If ever (in the words of that ſage hiſtorian) GOD ſhould hereafter bleſs them with better ſentiments, and turn their minds towards ſuch <hi>diſcipline,</hi> as may ſoften and improve their manners; and eſpecially to <hi>Muſic:</hi> by which <hi>means</hi> alone, they can ever hope to be diveſted of that brutal fierceneſs, by which they have been ſo long diſtinguiſhed.</q>

                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:009584_0020_0F76DE9C0EE798F8"/>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Awake, my glory, awake, lute and harp;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>I myſelf will awake right early.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <bibl>Pſal. LVII. CVIII.</bibl>
               </q>
IN the CLth pſalm he calls upon all nature, animate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate, to praiſe the LORD; and on man, to praiſe him with the ſound of the trumpet, with the pſaltery and harp, with the timbrel and dance, with ſtringed inſtruments and organs, with loud and high-ſounding cymbals. <hi>Let every thing that hath breath praiſe the</hi> LORD. Let all the powers of the ſoul, and that ſenſe of harmony which GOD hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on the ear, be employed in their utmoſt exertion, to celebrate the author of melody itſelf.</p>
            <p>THE fine arts, not only of Muſic and Poetry, but thoſe of Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting, the powers of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and every true expreſſion of taſte and genius, are all undoubtedly derived from GOD. This is as evident from Reaſon as from Revelation. There can be no inſtance of intelligence in man, but what is derived from an intelligent cauſe. In the Jewiſh worſhip, the Tabernacle and Temple, with all their rich ornaments; becoming thoſe palaces of the KING of Kings, and the majeſty of the Theocracy; were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed on the models given by GOD himſelf. Yet an opinion ſeems to have taken deep root in the minds of ſerious perſons, that what are properly called the fine arts, are almoſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the Chriſtian life, and a heavenly temper. The reaſon of which hard cenſure is, I ſuppoſe, that theſe arts
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009584_0021_0F76DE9EC3909CE8"/>
have generally been ſo groſly perverted to the gratification of pride and luxury, and a profane voluptuouſneſs. Thus, the noble powers of Poetry have been in many inſtances debaſed to the vileſt purpoſes: Muſic hath been the attendant of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling and licentious exceſſes: Sculpture and Painting, in pagan and papal countries, have lent their aid to ſuperſtition and idolatry: Eloquence, Taſte, and Genius have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned, to flatter the pomp, or varniſh the deformity of vice. The abuſe has in a manner deſecrated all the arts of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and made good men piouſly averſe to them. Yet in themſelves, and under juſt regulations, they are friendly to <hi>virtue,</hi> and a ſource of <hi>happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To retrieve the juſt eſteem of the fine arts, by making them ſubſervient to Religion and Virtue, is the trueſt appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of taſte and genius. Wealth, when it increaſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the wants and conveniencies of Society, if it is not vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Elegant arts, will be perverted to the groſſer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of vice and luxury. This ſeems to be the preſent caſe of England, where theſe arts are even neceſſary, to check or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert every ſpecies of corruption. But in our own Country, it muſt be diſcerned, that we are ſo far from that opulence, which demands the cultivation of the finer arts, that the more ſparingly they are introduced among us, the longer ſhall we ſecure the ſimplicity and frugality of our manners. What we do attempt of this kind, cannot better be applied, than to the ſervice and ornament of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:009584_0022_0F76DE9F6E961A08"/>
IT is natural to object, that the arguments for ſplendour and elegance, in the buildings, muſic, and other decorations relating to Religion, being derived from Jewiſh inſtitutions, are of no force when applied to the Chriſtian worſhip. Yet there ſeems to be ſomething not ſo eaſily abrogated in the immediate appointments of GOD himſelf: and thoſe, not (like many of the Jewiſh rites) of temporary uſe and application, but ſuitable to the general frame of human nature; and no leſs apt at preſent, than in Solomon's temple, to raiſe in our hearts religious affections, and elevate the Soul to GOD.</p>
            <p>WE find the prophet Eliſha, when ruffled by his interview with the King of Iſrael, calming his troubled ſpirits with muſic: <hi>and when the minſtrel played, the hand of the</hi> LORD <hi>came upon him</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">KINGS b. II. ch. III. 15.</note>. Such ſhould be the effect of ſacred muſic in our churches; it ſhould calm the agitations of our minds, it ſhould compoſe our ſpirits, and lift up our hearts to GOD, in an holy chearfulneſs and ſerenity. GOD loves not a dull and melancholy ſpirit. Much of that dejection, we ſee in ſome religious people, is <hi>the ſorrow of the world</hi> that <hi>worketh death;</hi> or is the effect of wrong apprehenſions. We are commanded to <hi>'Rejoice evermore.' Rejoice in the</hi> LORD <hi>always, and again I ſay, Rejoice.</hi> Phil. IV. 4. Much more might be alledged, to prove that the true Chriſtian ſpirit, is a ſpirit of alacrity and chearfulneſs, of ſerenity and joy: a ſpirit, as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that dejection and ſtupid ſadneſs, which good
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009584_0023_0F76DE9FD52131E8"/>
men ſometimes miſtake for the temper of the goſpel; as it is from the <hi>laughter of fools,</hi> which, like <hi>the crackling of thorns,</hi> is but a ſhort-lived momentary blaze, that expires in a flaſh of mirth. The Chriſtian temper is a perfect acquieſcence and reliance on GOD, through CHRIST. To the faithful and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous this opens the happieſt proſpects; which, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thrown into ſhades, every where brighten on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant view. The Faith, the Hopes, the Duties of a Chriſtian ſupport him in that calm, that peaceful, that delightful ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Soul, which, I ſuppoſe, is the immediate effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious muſic, on thoſe who attend to it with right affections.</p>
            <p>MUSIC, when rightly applied, is a powerful aid to a devout and holy temper: it is as powerful, when miſapplied, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face every ſerious impreſſion. How much then is it the duty of thoſe, who practice this divine art in our churches, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their performance by the purpoſe of it? and, inſtead of indulging themſelves in any unbecoming levities of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or execution, to practice that grave and ſober melody, which may compoſe and fix the mind in a ſerene and holy chearfulneſs; thoſe ſoft and pathetic airs, which melt the heart to penitence; or thoſe high and ſolemn ſtrains, which raiſe the ſoul in adoration to GOD?</p>
            <p>OUR incomparable HOOKER, in his laws of Eccleſiaſtical polity<note n="†" place="bottom">BOOK V. §. 38.</note>, thus regulates the uſe and performance of ſacred
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009584_0024_0F76DEA099174F30"/>
muſic. <q>In church-muſic, curioſity and oſtentation of art, wanton or light or unſuitable harmony; ſuch as only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ear, and doth not naturally ſerve to the very kind and degree of thoſe impreſſions, which the matter that goeth with it leaveth, or is apt to leave, in mens minds; doth rather blemiſh and diſgrace that we do, than add either beauty or furtherance unto it.—The faults prevented, the force and efficacy of the thing itſelf—is in truth moſt admirable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſame great author expreſſes, in very eloquent terms, the powers and application of this divine art. <q>Muſic hath an admirable facility to expreſs and repreſent to the mind, more inwardly than any other ſenſible mean, the very ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, riſing and falling, the very ſteps and inflections every way, the turns and varieties of all paſſions, whereunto the mind is ſubject.—In harmony, the very image and character of virtue and vice is perceived, the mind delighted with their reſemblances, and brought by having them often iterated, into a love of the things themſelves. For which cauſe, there is nothing more contagious and peſtilent, than ſome kinds of harmony; than ſome, nothing more ſtrong and potent unto good.—At the hearing of ſome, we are more inclined unto ſorrow and heavineſs; of ſome, more mollified and ſoftened in mind; one kind, apter to ſtay and ſettle us; another, to move and ſtir our affections. There is, that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009584_0025_0F76DEA158E43CF8"/>
draweth to a marvellous grave and ſober mediocrity; there is alſo, that carrieth, as it were, into extacies, filling the mind with an heavenly joy, and, for the time, in a manner ſevering it from the body. So that—the very harmony of ſounds, carried from the ear to the ſpiritual faculties of our ſouls, is by a native puiſſance and efficacy, greatly available, to bring to a perfect temper whatſoever is there troubled; apt, as well to quicken the ſpirits, as to allay that which is too eager; ſoveraign againſt melancholy and deſpair: forceable to draw forth tears of devotion, if the mind be ſuch as can yield them; able both to move and to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate all affections.—In which conſiderations, the Church of CHRIST doth likewiſe at this preſent day retain it; as an ornament to GOD's ſervice, and an help to our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT muſt however be obſerved, that, in early times, the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian pſalmody, agreable to the depreſſed and perſecuted ſtate of the church, muſt have been very plain and ſimple: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for ſeveral ages, eſpecially in the weſtern parts, without inſtrumental accompaniments; the Organ in particular hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not been introduced into churches, 'till the XIIth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. Yet the ſame reaſon ſpeaks for inſtrumental as for vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal muſic; its native efficacy to excite the beſt affections, and through the paſſions, to reach the underſtanding. But in all our oblations of Prayer or Praiſe eſpecially in thoſe of pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mody
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009584_0026_0F76DEA210B75F88"/>
and muſic, which are moſt liable to this defect; let us be ever careful, that our ſacrifice be not without a heart: and in your love of melody, do not neglect the affections of the Soul, and the rational ſentiments of Chriſtian piety, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the beſt performances of Church-muſic are but harmonious trifles. 'GOD <hi>is the king of all the earth; ſing ye praiſes with underſtanding</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">PSAL. XLVII. 7.</note>. On this maxim, thoſe who have a taſte for this heavenly art, may aid the piety of thought with the powers of ſound: and they who are leſs ſuſceptible of its impreſſions, may ſtill expreſs in their devotions, the muſic of a well-tuned Soul, 'ſinging and making melody <hi>in their hearts</hi> to the LORD.' Though we need not be inſenſible to the advantages which may be derived to Religion from the decent ſplendour of its public miniſtrations, where the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Muſic and other hightenings of divine worſhip are acceſſible: yet that Devotion is too delicate and faſtidious, that cannot ſubſiſt without them; that cannot, within itſelf, in the receſſes of the heart, and abſtracted from all external accommodations, find ſufficient reſources of interior Piety.</p>
            <p>THUS have I adventured to make ſome obſervations, on a ſubject, of which I know but little of the thëory, and leſs of the practice; and in which, I give up my own indifference to Church-muſic, to the taſte of thoſe who have finer feelings, and a higher opinion of its ſubſerviency to devotion. I need not uſe any arguments, to engage your good-nature, to aſſiſt

I am not aſhamed to be an importunate ſolicitor, where a public intereſt is concerned; the intereſt of a Church, which, I hope, will be a KTHMA EC AEI, a perpetual benefit to our Country. But where there is a ready mind, Importunity is unneceſſary; and would be ſome diſparagement to that inclination, favour and prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is the faireſt recommendation of your free-will offerings. <hi>He that giveth, let him do it with ſimplicity, and a ready mind; for</hi> GOD <hi>loveth a cheerful giver</hi>
