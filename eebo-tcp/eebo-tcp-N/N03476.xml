            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a part of the Prieſt's Duty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Moſaick Diſpenſation, to hearten and incite the Armies of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to fight the <hi>Lord's Battles,</hi> with Intrepidity and undaunted Courage. <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.2, 3, 4. <hi>It ſhall be when ye are come nigh unto the Battle, that the Prieſt ſhall approach, and ſpeak unto the People, and ſhall ſay unto them, Hear, O Iſrael, ye approach this day unto battle againſt your Enemies: let not your heart faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified becauſe of them. For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you againſt your Enemies, to ſave you.</hi> As the Prieſt was to ſpeak thus, and animate the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to a valiant Behaviour in the Day of Battle, ſo queſtionleſs, he was before it, to exhort them, as there was need, to be in a readineſs, duly prepared
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004249_0003_100408FAA9C91908"/>for it. That there was ſuch a number of well-diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined Men with <hi>Jehozabad,</hi> might be partly a good Effect of the Prieſts and Levites faithful teaching throughout all the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> of which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text ſpeaks. And what the Miniſters of the Lord then did, may be now equally incumbent on the Preachers of the <hi>Goſpel of Peace.</hi> It is therefore (as I apprehend and undertake it) the Duty of my <hi>Poſt,</hi> to be a Monitor unto Soldiers; who, by coming at this time into the Houſe of the Lord, ſeem to demand of me, as the Soldiers did of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, Luk. 3.14. <hi>And what ſhall we do?</hi> And though he is the leaſt of Chriſt's Miniſters, at whoſe Mouth they ſeek the Law; yet while I declare to them the <hi>Counſel of God,</hi> I may expect that they will TAKE HEED.</p>
            <p>With this Chapter begins the Hiſtory of <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi>'s glorious and happy Reign over the Kingdom of <hi>Judah.</hi> He was the Son and Succeſſor of a good King, and <hi>walked in the firſt ways of his Father Aſa,</hi> as well as of <hi>David.</hi> His Wiſdom in ordering his Military Affairs, to his own Eſtabliſhment in the Throne, and the Peace and Welfare of his Subjects, is the only Thing in his Character and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I ſhall now remark to you, as what may afford us ſome ſeaſonable Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Of this we have an Account in the beginning, and from v. 12. to the End of the Chapter. Upon his Acceſſion to the Throne, <hi>he ſtrengthned himſelf againſt Iſrael. And he placed Forces in all the fenced Cities of Judah, and ſet Gariſons in the Land of Judah, and in the Cities of Ephraim, which Aſa his Father had taken.</hi> In the latter Days of <hi>Aſa,</hi> which were not ſo pious and proſperous as his firſt, there was War between the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and of <hi>Judah:</hi> So that the firſt Thing which <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> after he came to the Crown, had to do, was to fortify againſt ſo near and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an Enemy. Which he did ſo effectually, that <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> inſtead of puſhing on the War
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004249_0004_10043A0AC7939B10"/>againſt him, ſoon courted his Alliance and Aſſiſtance. <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ſtrengthened himſelf, not as his Father did, by a League with the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> but by building Gariſons on his Frontiers, and well-manning of them. On which lawful Methods of Defence, he might expect God's Bleſſing, and in the uſe of which proper Means he truſted in God. <hi>And Jehoſhaphat waxed great exceedingly, and he built in Judah Caſtles and Cities of Stone:</hi> in which he had plenty of Arms, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Victuals. <hi>And he had much Buſineſs in the Cities of Judah,</hi> which he did not through Indolence and Luxury, neglect; but did a great deal in repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fortifying the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> and furniſhing them with neceſſary Proviſions, as well as in purging them from the Reliques of Idolatry and Injuſtice. <hi>And the Men of War, mighty Men of Valour, were in Jeruſalem. Jeruſalem</hi> being the Metropolis of the Kingdom, and the Thrones of the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> being ſet there, the principal of the Military Forces were placed in it: or at leaſt, the Generals and Chief Captains, with ſome Companies of their Soldiers, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the King there. <hi>And theſe are the Numbers of them, according to the Houſe of their Fathers: Of Judah, the Captains of Thouſands; Adnah, the Chief, and with him mighty Men of Valour, three hundred thouſand. And next to him was Jehohanan the Captain, and with him two hundred and fourſcore thouſand. And next to him was Amaſiah the Son of Zichri, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offered himſelf unto the Lord; and with him two hundred thouſand mighty Men of Valour. And of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin; Eliada a mighty Man of Valour, and with him armed Men with Bow and Shield, two hundred thouſand. And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourſcore thouſand, ready prepared for the War: Theſe waited on the King, beſides thoſe whom the King put in the fenced Cities throughout all Judah.</hi> The Sum total of the Soldiers under theſe five Captains, was Eleven Hundred and Sixty Thouſand Men. It
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004249_0005_10043A10ED29A928"/>may ſeem incredible, that ſo vaſt an Army ſhould be rais'd and maintain'd out of the Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin:</hi> Eſpecially ſince in the preceding Reign, <hi>Aſa</hi> could not bring into the Field <hi>Six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> Men. Chap. 14. 8. It is probable, as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> had not all theſe at one time, but ſucceſſively: The Train'd-Bands of <hi>Judah</hi> being firſt under the Command of <hi>Adnah;</hi> and after his Death, under the Command of <hi>Jehohanan;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>Amaſiah.</hi> And the Train'd-Bands of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> firſt under the Command of <hi>Eliada,</hi> and then of <hi>Jehozabad.</hi> Or, as others conceive, that this nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Hoſt, almoſt Twelve Hundred Thouſand, in the Reign of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> who was under a ſpecial Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, and waxed great exceedingly, as in Riches and Honours, ſo likewiſe in Military Strength, was diſperſed all the Country over, each Man reſiding, for the moſt part, on his own Eſtate, only appeared on Days of Muſter to be trained; and were ready, whenever there was Occaſion, to go forth to War; but the Commanders, with a ſuitable <hi>Life-Guard,</hi> waited on the King at Jeruſalem. Theſe, ſaith Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> were the Trained-Bands or Auxiliaries, whoſe Chief Officers waited upon the King to receive his Commands, and to raiſe and bring in all or part of their Forces to the Service of the King and Kingdom, as Need required.—From the Connexion of the Text and the Character given in it of the Soldiers under the Command of General <hi>Jehozabad,</hi> I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to you this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That it is the Honour of a Prince, and Safety of a People, to have a competent Number of Men, ready prepared for War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Glory of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>'s Reign, and the Felicity of his People under it, conſiſted partly in the good Order of the Militia; that there was a ſufficient
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004249_0006_10040905ECC964A0"/>Number of Trained Bands in a readineſs for any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, throughly fitted for the War, that either was or might ariſe in his Time. And this is the Honour of any Prince, and Strength of any People.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome will deſire to hear proved, what is in this Doctrine ſuppoſed, That War is lawful. If it be not ſo in any Caſe, the Doctrine is falſe. It is no Credit to a King, nor advantage to his Subjects, but the reverſe, for them to be <hi>wiſe to do evil,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for a bad Work. If War be always in it ſelf ſinful, then all Diſpoſitions to it, and Preparations for it, are ſo likewiſe. And Sin is the Reproach of any King and People: It ſtains all their Glory, weakens their Strength, and lays them open to Dangers and Miſeries. But that War in ſome Caſes, and with ſome Reſtrictions, is lawful and expedient, the Light of Reaſon and of Scripture plainly diſcovers. Tho' the Cauſe of it is always bad, and the Effects of it woful: Tho' it comes from Men's Luſts, and ſpreads Deſolation and Death on the Face of the Earth; yet ſometimes People have a Call to engage in it, and their ſhedding the <hi>Blood of War,</hi> may not be a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Divine Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> If it be poſſible, we ſhould live peaceably with all Men: But ſometimes it is not ſo; and then War on their Side, who uſed their beſt Endeavours for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Peace, is lawful and warrantable, is neceſſary and unavoidable. "Together with Life, and a natural Love of it, and Means to ſupport it, God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to every Man a Right to defend it, with its neceſſary Supports, againſt unjuſt, extreme and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Violence upon it, or them", and to repel Force with Force. The Law of Self-preſervation, which is the Law of God and Nature, obligeth Men to fight in Defence of their Lives and Liberties, when vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently aſſaulted and invaded; and, if other Means will not prevail, to maintain, or recover their Rights by the Sword of War. The Law of Humanity, which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004249_0007_10043A1325C29488"/>is alſo the Law of Chriſtianity, bindeth Men in this way to aſſiſt their Neighbours againſt unjuſt Invaſions and Encroachments; and to deliver them from cruel Oppreſſions and Captivities. When <hi>Abram</hi> heard that his Brother <hi>Lot</hi> was taken Captive, he armed his trained Servants, born in his own Houſe, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighteen, and purſued the Enemies, and ſmote them: and brought back the Captives, and all their Goods <note n="*" place="bottom">

And in ſuch Caſes there may be a warlike Proceſs by an Appeal to the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> the great Patron of Right, and Diſpenſer of Succeſs.—Indeed it is foretold, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.4. that <hi>in the laſt Days,</hi> the Days of Goſpel-Light and Peace, <hi>the Nations ſhall beat their Swords into Plow-ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks: that Nation ſhall not liſt up Sword againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither ſhall they learn War any more.</hi> But this Prophecy ſheweth, that the Deſign of the Goſpel is to introduce and eſtabliſh a univerſal Peace, and good Will among Men on Earth; and in thoſe on whom it hath its proper Effect, it mortifies thoſe Luſts, from whence come Wars and Fightings. But ſince the Goſpel is ſo far from being embraced by all Nations; and they who profeſs it, are ſo far from living up to the Rules and Precepts of it, the Time is not yet arrived for the full accompliſhment of this Prediction and Promiſe. And till then, we may, by reaſon of Men's corrupt Intereſts and Luſts, which the Goſpel oppoſeth, expect to ſee thoſe Words of the <hi>Prince of Peace</hi> verified, Mat. 10.34. <hi>Think not that I am come to ſend Peace on Earth; I came not to ſend Peace but a Sword.</hi> And while accidentally, through the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men's Hearts, and the prevalence of their Luſts, the Conſequent of our Lord's coming, and ſetting up his Kingdom is War, the proſecution of it on one ſide, may be what the Goſpel allows, yea requires, But tho' War is ſometimes lawful and expedient, yet it ſhould be made with good Advice, and only in Caſe of great Neceſſity ſhould People engage in, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it. After all amicable Means of adjuſting Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between Nation and Nation, prove ineffectual, then, and not before, may they be refer'd to this Divine Arbitrement. And I can't think, but that Soldiers, who are preſs'd into a War, ſhould be convinc'd of the lawfulneſs of it: and ſhould not be obliged to engage in it, on a blind preſumption that there are
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004249_0009_10040909EF436550"/>good Reaſons for it, tho' they muſt not know them. All that are killed by them in an unjuſt War, are murdered; and the <hi>Cry of Blood</hi> is louder than the <hi>confuſed Noiſe,</hi> which there is in <hi>every Battle of the Warriour.</hi> And will the Blood unjuſtly ſhed in this manner, cry only againſt the Prince, by whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the War is levied? Will the whole Blame fall upon him? If ſo, then Subjects may innocently abet the Luſts, the Ambition, the Avarice, and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſtineſs of a King. If the Sovereign Power be the abſolute and only Judge whether the Soldier's Cauſe and Call be good, then the Subjects of the Grand Turk may be excuſed and juſtified in the Slaughter of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: And the Subjects of Popiſh Princes in the Maſſacre of Proteſtants: And the Roman Soldiers did not amiſs in apprehending and crucifying our Lord, when their Superiours commanded them: And that Soldier, which is ſaid to have told <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in his firſt Expedition againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> that in Obedience to his Commands, he would not refuſe to ſheath his Sword in the Breaſt of his Brother, or in the Throat of his aged Father, or in the Bowels of his pregnant Mother, was not to be deteited for his unnatural Barbarity, but commended for his loyal Affection to his General. Which Conſequences are very ſhocking.</p>
            <p>Tho' it is ſit, that the great and difficult Affair of War, ſhould be entruſted with the Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of a Nation, yet Soldiers that would keep their Conſciences and Hands pure from the Guilt and Stain of Blood, ſhould modeſtly enquire into the Merits of the Cauſe in which they fight; and reaſonable Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhould be given them that the War is lawful, and the Cauſe better than their Lives, which they venture for it. The <hi>Manifeſtos</hi> of Kings, ſetting forth the Grounds and Reaſons of their proclaiming War, need be clear and full, as their Commands, requiring their Subjects to engage in it, are plain and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Soldiers are to fight as rational and moral Agents,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004249_0010_10043A19D19B3B90"/>and not go forth to the War, <hi>as the Horſe, which hath no Underſtanding, ruſheth into the Battle.</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004249_0012_10043A226955E4D8"/>that is commonly verified in them, which Chriſt ſaith, Joh. 12.25. <hi>He that loveth his Life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> They caſt away their own Lives, which they are ſo fond of ſaving; and bring ſwift Deſtruction on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by flying from it: For as great Cowards as themſelves, will eagerly purſue Fugitives, and dare run them through, or ſhoot them behind.

               <hi>Julius Caſar</hi> was never wounded in Battle, tho' he ever fought in the foremoſt Ranks of his Troops.— The Heathen Moraliſts reckon'd Bravery in War the higheſt Expreſſion of Courage: And that the Soldier had the greateſt Opportunity to ſhew this Vertue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Life, the deareſt Thing to a Man in this World, is riſqued in War. And 'tis certain, that he is not fit for War, that is afraid to die. Soldiers therefore need make their Peace with God, that they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for War; and be ſure of the Goodneſs of their State, as well as Cauſe, that they may be ready to march into the Mouth of Danger, and meet the <hi>King of Terrors</hi> in the Field of Battle. If they are Enemies to God, and in a State of Condemnation, their Valour is Vain-glory, rather than true Courage. Pagan Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers taught, that Fortitude is always accompanied with Juſtice and Truth. Chriſtians may further add, that it is joined with Piety and Faith. The Wicked often fear where no Fear is; and are moſt likely to be diſpirited, to be afraid with great Amazement, when they ſhall hear the Alarm of War, and be called out to Action, in which they muſt jeopard their Lives. Pſal. 28.1. <hi>The wicked flee, when no Man purſueth: but the righteous are bold as a Lion.</hi> Theſe have good Reaſon to be ſo, for God's Providence is engaged with them, and for them: And the <hi>Helmet of Salvation,</hi> which is the Hope of Eternal Life, may well make them to hold up their Heads in the midſt of Dangers,

If they prevail againſt their Enemies, they are apparent Conquerors; if they fall before them, they die in Peace with God, and ſhall be happy for ever. No Attempts of Pagan <hi>Heroes</hi> are ſo gallant, no Exploits ſo illuſtrious, as thoſe of God's <hi>Worthies.</hi> Their Faith made them valorous and victorious. —<hi>Through Faith they ſubdued Kingdoms—eſcaped the Edge of the Sword, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in Fight, turned to flight the Armies of the Aliens</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Men who are ready prepared for War, are compleatly-armed.</hi> The firſt Inventer of Weapons to fight with, was probably <hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi> whom <hi>Zillab</hi> bare to <hi>Lamech:</hi> He is ſaid to be an <hi>Inſtructer of every Artificer in Braſs and Iron,</hi> Gen. 4.22.

            <p>Inſtruments of Death are neceſſary and uſeful in War. If fewer Lives would be deſtroyed, more Cripples, 'tis likely, would be made, by fighting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. Men would act greater Cruelties upon one another, and the Controverſy not be ſo ſoon decided. If War therefore be juſt, it may lawfully be managed with armed Violence; and the Miſchiefs of it may be leſs, than if it were proſecuted by naked Combatants.— Various have been the Weapons of War, which the different contending Nations of the Earth have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and uſed againſt one another. <hi>Guns</hi> and <hi>Swords</hi> are now the moſt common. And they who are not furniſhed therewith, are not fitted for War. Strength and Courage are not ſufficient without <hi>Armour of Proof.</hi> To the beſt natural Accompliſhments for War, there muſt be added Military Equipments. The
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004249_0014_10043A2F128228C0"/>mighty Men of Valour under <hi>Jebozabad,</hi> were, like thoſe under <hi>Eliada,</hi> armed with Bow and Shield: Weapons, offenſive and defenſive: or it would not have been ſaid, that they were <hi>ready prepared for the War.</hi> The People were deſtitute of ſuch Soldiers, and were in a diſtreſſed Caſe when War was in the Gates; and there was not a <hi>Shield or Spear</hi> to be found among <hi>Forty thouſand in Iſrael,</hi> Judg. 5.8. Either their Oppreſſors had diſarmed them; or their Weapons, through their own Sloth and Negligence, had been ſo long diſuſed, that the Ruſt had ſpoiled them. And in <hi>Saul</hi>'s Time, <hi>there was no Smith found throughout all the Land of Iſrael: (for the Philiſtines ſaid, leſt the Hebrews make them Swords or Spears</hi>) 1 Sam. 13.19. <hi>So it came to paſs in the Day of Battle, that there was neither Sword nor Spear found in the Hand of any of the People that were with Saul and Jonathan,</hi> Verſ. 22. The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were very politick in depriving the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of Smiths, leſt they ſhould make for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Inſtruments of War. But very impolitick and mean were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in ſuffering the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> thus to impoſe upon them. And tho' God took occaſion from their being ſo ill-provided for War, to glorify his Power in the Diſcomfiture and Deſtruction of their Enemies, yet this was inexcuſable Negligence in them. Altho' the Lord ſaveth not with Sword and Spear <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. 17.47.</note>, tho' he ſometimes giveth Succeſs to thoſe who are deſtitute of ſuitable Weapons of War, to ſhew that the Battle is his; yet they have no regular Truſt in him, who take no Care to furniſh themſelves with the ſame. Tho' Soldiers take to themſelves the Shield of Faith, yet they muſt have material Inſtruments of War that they may be prepared for it. <hi>David</hi> went forth in the <hi>Name of the Lord of Hoſts</hi> to fight <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet he took his <hi>Sling</hi> in his Hand, and choſe him five ſmooth Stones out of the Brook, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.40. He
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004249_0015_10040922431FF128"/>put off <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Armour,</hi> becauſe it did not fit him, he had not proved it; he had not then much Experience of ſuch Weapons, which the King would have had him made uſe of. He was better accoutred with his Sling, and the ſmall Stones he pick'd out of the Brook. He prefer'd theſe Weapons, how contemptible ſoever in the Eyes of others, becauſe he had been accuſtom'd to them. And they were indeed the fitteſt for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. A little Stone from his <hi>Sling</hi> was a proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to lay the Gigantick Foe on the Ground; and then there was no <hi>Sword like Goliab</hi>'s own, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to give the finiſhing Stroke, and compleat the Victory, by cutting off his Head.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Men who are ready prepared for War, are well-diſciplined.</hi> This comprizeth two neceſſary and excellent Qualifications of Soldiers; that they be ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and governable.</p>

That underſtand the Buſineſs of their reſpective Poſts; the part which every one is to perform: That can readily take their Places, and keep their Ranks: That know the various Marches, Facings and Poſtures, to receive an Attack from, and make an Aſſault on their Enemies; how to Charge and Retreat: And that can dextrouſly handle their Arms: As the <hi>Gadites, who ſeperated themſelves unto David, Men of War, fit for the Battle, that could handle Shield and Buckler</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004249_0016_10043A4E66DBB930"/>it. Pſal. 144.1. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, my Strength, which teacheth my Hands to War, and my Fingers to fight.</hi> Military Skill is to be obtain'd from the Lord of Hoſts, in the uſe of proper Means; and not to be expected by extraordinary Inſtruction or immediate Infuſion. Tho' it is a <hi>good Gift that cometh down from the Father of Lights,</hi> yet it is an acquired Endowment. By Study and Exerciſe, Men are to learn War. <hi>David</hi> bad them teach the Children of <hi>Judah</hi> the uſe of the Bow, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>God,</hi> by Men and Means teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Hands of Soldiers to War. Military Skill is a requiſite Preparation for War. Without it, Strength cannot be exerted nor Courage ſhewed, nor Weapons handled, to good purpoſe. Eccl. 8.18. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (of which Military Skill is one Branch) <hi>it better than Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of War.</hi> They who are deſtitute of it, will be more likely to hurt themſelves than their Enemies, with their own Weapons. A few train'd Bands uſually do greater Exploits than Armies of unſkilful Soliders Vaſtly numerous Hoſts have been routed and put to Flight by a few regular Troops; and large Kingdoms overturned by the ſmall Force of expert Warriours. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s three hundred and eighteen Men, with which he purſued and ſmote four potent and victorious Kings, were his <hi>trained Servants</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 14.14.</note>: Such as he had well inſtructed in the Military Art: and with which he prudently attack'd a numerous Army, coming upon them from ſeveral Quarters, that he might ſtrike them with the greater Terror. Skill in War often defeats the Enemy's Strength; and it helps the Soldier to make the beſt uſe of his own. Pſal. 18.34. <hi>He teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my Hands to War, ſo that a Bow of Steel is broken by mine Arms.</hi> Wonderful Feats could <hi>David</hi> perform with Hands that were ſo well taught. His breaking a Bow of Steel was the Effect of his Skill, rather than of his Strength. He did it, not ſo much by main
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004249_0017_10040926DCAB2C20"/>Force, as by ſlight of Hand. And his killing <hi>Goliah</hi> was not purely miraculous, nor meerly accidental. Tho' the Finger of <hi>God</hi> is not to be excluded from, yet <hi>David</hi>'s Skill was improv'd in that remarkable Action. It was indeed by God's Providence, but not without <hi>David</hi>'s Art, that the Stone was directed to ſuch a Place, and came with ſuch Force, as to caſt down the mighty Champion. <hi>David</hi> did not uſe his Sling, as the Man, who ſmote <hi>Ahab</hi> through the Joints of his Harneſs, drew a Bow at a venture <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kin. 22.34.</note>, when he ſmote the Philiſtine in the Forehead, that the Stone ſunk thereinto, and he fell upon his Face to the Earth <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Sam. 17.49.</note>. To ſhew his Contempt of <hi>David, Goliah</hi> might come negligently towards, and in his ſcornful Rage turn back his <hi>Helmet,</hi> and expoſe his naked Forehead to ſo inferiour a Combatant. One of the Rabbins ſuppoſeth, that when <hi>Goliah</hi> ſaid to <hi>David, Come to me, and I will give thy Fleſh unto the Fowls of the Air,</hi> he threw up his Head in Diſdain ſo haſtily, that his Helmet fell off, and ſo left his broad Forehead a fair Mark for <hi>David</hi>'s Sling. But if <hi>Goliah</hi> kept on that piece of his Armour, yet <hi>David</hi> might level ſo right, as to hit the Place which was left open for his Adverſary's Eyes. Is it not probable, that he was as good a <hi>Mark's.

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004249_0018_10043A61A6C01310"/>thus deſcribed, 1 Chron. 12.32. <hi>Men that had Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Times, to know what Iſrael ought to do: the Heads of them were two hundred, and all their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were at their Commanament.</hi> The Princes of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> knew how to rule, and the Commonalty of that Tribe were diſpos'd to obey: The Leaders were intelligent and judicious, and the Soldiers modeſt and obſequious. Out of the high Eſteem they had of their Commander's Wiſdom and Prudence, they were at their Beek; willing to be directed and order'd by them. The <hi>Centurion</hi> had a well-diſciplin'd Band, who ſaid to Chriſt, in Mat. 8.9. <hi>I am a Man under Authority, having Soldiers under me: And I ſay to this Man, Go, and be goeth: and to another, Come, and be cometh: and to my Servant, Do this, and he doth it.</hi> Good Order is the Beauty and Strength of an Army, as well as of any other Society: And it conſiſts in the prudent Conduct of Officers, and obſequious Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Soldiers. If Men will not obſerve the Rules of Military Order, they are not prepared for War, how well ſoever they may in other Reſpects be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd for it. Their Strength, and Courage, and Weapons, and Skill, do only fit them to do more Miſchief to their King and Country, than their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can. Mutinous, ſeditious, diſobedient Soldiers overthrow the Commonwealth, and betray the Cauſe which they ſhould maintain. A diſcontented, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Spirit in an Army, is like a Fever in the Body; or Fire in a City. A mutinous Army is the neareſt Reſemblance of Hell; and next to Hell, the worſt Place for any Man to be in. They are not well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd therefore, and prepar'd for War, who are not governable, and ſubject to Martial Order.—<hi>"Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Forquatus</hi> (a Roman Commander) put his own Son to Death, becauſe he fought contrary to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, tho' he proved victorious. A <hi>French Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> once Knighted a Soldier, becauſe he was the firſt Man that climb'd the Bulwark of a beſieged Fort,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004249_0019_10043A68C8818938"/>whereupon enſued the gaining of it, and then hang'd him within an Hour after, becauſe he did it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Command. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was of another Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for when he ſaw that <hi>Scava,</hi> one of his Soldiers tranſgreſs'd in Diſcipline in Battle againſt the <hi>Britains,</hi> but behaved himſelf with ſingular Valour, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him to a Centurion's Place". I do not approve the Severity of the two firſt Inſtances, nor the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the laſt: A middle way betwixt both ſeems moſt eligible, and might ſerve to make Solders care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they do not tranſgreſs the Rules of Order, and violate the eſtabliſh'd Laws of Arms.</p>
            <p>Having thus conſider'd what Men are ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for War, I am next to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That it is the Honour of a Prince, and Safety of a People, to have a competent Number of ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Glory of Kings, and Welfare of their Subjects, are not to be ſeperated, but may be diſtinguiſh'd; and a ſufficient Number of able-bodied, couragious, well-arm'd and diſciplin'd Soldiers, contributes not a little to both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is for a Prince's Honour, to have a ſuitable Number of Men, ready prepar'd for War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God,</hi> the great King of Heaven and Earth, is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as he is <hi>the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> This is one of his magnificient Titles: <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is his Name.</hi> All his Works, in all Places of his univerſal Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, are his Hoſts: ſo that there is <hi>not any Number of his Armies.</hi> All his Creatures are ranged by him in a goodly and convenient Order. Like an Army marſhalled to Battle, or marching in Array, they are under his Conduct, ready preſt for his Service, and when he ſpeaks, or only beckens to them, or hiſſeth for any of them, they immediately engage in his Quarrel. Iſa. 40.26. <hi>Lift up your Eyes on high, and behold who hath created theſe Things, that bringeth out their Hoſt by Number; he calleth them all by Names, by the greatneſs of his Might, for that he is ſtrong in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004249_0020_10043A781308C998"/>Power, not one faileth.</hi> When he calleth them by their Names, they readily anſwer, <hi>Here we are</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Job 38.35.</note>. He ordereth his Creatures as a <hi>General</hi> muſtereth his Troops, and draws out the Squadrons of his Army; and he hath a Magazine and Treaſury, out of which to ſupply any of his Hoſts, which he ſends forth on an Expedition. <hi>Haſt thou entred into the Treaſure: of the Snow? or haſt thou ſeen the Treaſures of the Hail, which I have reſerved againſt the time of trouble, againſt the Day of Battle and War</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Verſ. 22, 23.</note>.—God, it's true, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no Hoſt to guard his Life, to ſupport his Dignity and Government, and to fight his Battles. But that we may have ſome Conception of his Majeſty, and Glory, and Power, he is repreſented as a mighty <hi>General,</hi> that hath numberleſs Legions under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts he is the King of Glory. Selab.</hi> And an earthly King, who is a viſible <hi>God,</hi> a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative and Vicegerent, of the inviſible, eternal King, as in other Reſpects he reſembles him, ſo in this he is like him, when he hath a puiſſant Hoſt, a well-modelled Army, a competent Number of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ready prepar'd for War. This is a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of a Prince's Grandeur, and a neceſſary Defence upon all his other Glory. Prov. 14.28. <hi>In the multitude of People is the King's Honour: but in the want of People is the Deſtruction of the Prince.</hi> His Honour being oppoſed to his Deſtruction, among the multitude of People in which his Honour is, there muſt be a ſufficient Number of good Soldiers; for in the want of ſuch, how numerous ſoever his People be, is his Deſtruction.—Much of the Honour of Kings is borrow'd from their Subjects, and depends upon them; and from which of their Subjects doth more Honour ordinarily accrue to them, than from their brave, expert and victorious Soldiers, and on which is it more dependant? Where we have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004249_0021_10043A7C088A5EF0"/>of <hi>David</hi>'s Greatneſs, we have a Catalogue of his <hi>mighty Men,</hi> 1 Chron. 11.9, 10. <hi>David waxed greater and greater: for the Lord of Hoſts was with him. Theſe alſo are the Chief of the mighty Men whom David had.</hi> The Preſence of the Lord of Hoſts made him great, but this it did by Men and Means. It was his Greatneſs, Reputation and Honour to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and ſerved by ſuch mighty Men of Valour.— In having a well-order'd Militia, a ſufficient Number of Soldiers, ready prepar'd for War, a Chriſtian King gives Proof of his Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs, as he is conſtituted by God, the Parent and Guardian of his Country, a Protector of the Church, and Patron of Religion. He manifeſts a generous Concern to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his People from foreign Injuries and Invaſions, and to ſecure them from inteſtine Broils and Factions; that under his <hi>Shadow</hi> they may enjoy Safety and Quiet, may reap the Fruits of their Induſtry, and not be diſturb'd in the Practice of Godlineſs and Vertue: and therefore 'tis his Honour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Safety of a People requires, that they ſhould have among them a competent Number of Soldiers, ready prepared for War.</hi> The Honour of a Prince is the Happineſs of his People: What conduceth to his Glory, doth ſo to their Felicity. His Hononr is founded in thoſe good Qualities and Deeds, which tend to their Advantage. He doth not acquire Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour without their Aid and Concurrence: nor could he retain it without their Support: which they cannot afford him, unleſs they are protected in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Lives and Properties. As therefore a competent Number of Soldiers, throughly fitted for War, adds much to his Glory; ſo 'tis by neceſſary Conſequence at parant, that the Safety of his People lyeth very much therein.</p>
            <p>A Militia put into and kept in good Poſture, is the Safety of a People, as it detereth and diſcourageth Enemies from making War upon them. It is ſaid
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004249_0022_10043A834E5DAC60"/>in our <hi>Context,</hi> That <hi>the Fear of the Lord fell upon all the Kingdoms of the Land that were round about Judah, ſo that they made no War againſt Jehoſhaphat.</hi> His vaſt Army of Men, ſo well prepar'd for War, and his Forts and fenced Cities, in Conjunction with his eminent Piety, (of which we read in this Chapter) ſtruck a Terror upon the neighbour Nations, which had before forely vexed the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſo that they did not for ſome time attempt any thing againſt it. But if a People are deſtitute of Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for War, their Careleſſneſs about their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence encourageth, yea invites, aforeign Invaſion. A monitory Example we have of this in <hi>Judg.</hi> 18. The Spies whom the <hi>Danites</hi> ſent to look out a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Place for them to dwell in, <hi>came to Laiſh, and ſaw the People that were therein, how they dwelt careleſs, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and ſecure:</hi> That the City was unfortified and the Men unarm'd and undiſciplin'd; not being apprehenſive of any Danger, becauſe they had perhaps enjoy'd a long Peace. The Spies returning, ſpake thus to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Ariſe, that we may go up againſt them.—Ye ſhall come to a People ſecure—for God hath given it into your Hand.</hi> And the Children of <hi>Dan</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by this Report, <hi>came unto Laiſh, unto a People that were at Quiet, and ſecure, and they ſmote them with the Edge of the Sword, and burnt the City with Fire.</hi> Six hundred Men with Weapons of War, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an eaſy and intire Conqueſt over that People, which dwelt in a <hi>large Land,</hi> becauſe they were ſo unprepar'd to reſiſt an Enemy.—A well-inſtructed Militia is the Safety of a People, as ſuch is moſt likely to ſtop their invading Foes, and turn the Battle to the Gate of their Enemies. They ſhould not indeed boaſt of the Strength and Bravery of their Soldiers, nor confide in the beſt military Proviſions for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: <hi>For the Battle is not</hi> always <hi>to the Strong;</hi> and God, in whom we ſhould truſt, can ſave a People, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004249_0023_100439FAA6FB6690"/>deſtroy their Enemies, by the weakeſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable Means. He can make a little <hi>Barley-Cake</hi> to ſtrike and overturn a <hi>Midianitiſh Tent:</hi> And three hundred Men, with no other Weapons than <hi>Trumpets, earthen Pitchers, and Lamps,</hi> to confound and ſcatter a huge Hoſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Judg. 7.</note> He can demoliſh the ſtrongeſt Walls, with the Blaſt of Rams-Horns, and the Noiſe of People ſhouting, as eaſily as with battering Rams, or roaring Cannons, and maſſy Bombs. But if People pretend to rely on God to ſave them from their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and fight their Battles, while they are not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to provide for their own Defence, they tempt him rather than truſt in him. The <hi>Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon,</hi> Judg. 7. 8. "The Sword of the <hi>Lord</hi> is all in all to the Succeſs of the Sword of <hi>Gideon,</hi> yet the Sword of <hi>Gideon</hi> muſt be employed. Men the Inſtruments, and God the principal Agent, muſt both be conſider'd in their Places". When <hi>Joſhua</hi> was going to diſpoſſeſs the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> he was aſſur'd of God's Preſence with him, yet was enjoyn'd to be <hi>ſtrong, and very couragious.</hi> We ſhould do our utmoſt towards our own Preſervation and Succeſs againſt our Enemies, while we truſt in God therefor. It was a brave Speech which <hi>Joab</hi> made at the Head of his Army, when the Front of the Battle was againſt him both before and behind, 2 Sam. 10.12. <hi>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People, and for the Cities of our God: and the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good.</hi> God can ſave without Means, or by Means leaſt fitted to the End: But 'tis his ordinary way to work by Means, and to work moſt by the apteſt Means. A ſuitable Number therefore of Men, ready prepared for War, are the viſible Strength and Safety of a People, as well as the Honour of their Prince.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>We may from bence infer, that if a Prince and People conſult their own Honour and Safety, they will be careful to have always a ſufficient Number of Men, ready prepared for War.</hi> They will encourage a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Spirit, and do what is reſpectively incumbent on them, to promote Military Skill and good Order; that the Commonwealth may not be deſtitute of able and expert Soldiers, who are its Beauty and Defence. There was no War againſt <hi>Jeboſhaphat,</hi> when he took ſuch Care, and his People concur'd with him in it, to have the Militia in a good Poſture,—ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand mighty Men of Valour, well-arm'd and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd, ready for Service, whenever there ſhould be Occaſion. And his Father <hi>Aſa,</hi> in whoſe Days the Land had Quiet Ten Years, call'd upon his People to join with him in making a good Uſe of the Peace they enjoy'd, by fortifying their Cities, arming and training their Soldiers: The Number of which out of <hi>Judah, that bare Targets and Spears, were three bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand; and out of Benjamin, that bare Shields, and drew Bows, two hundred and fourſcore thouſand: All theſe were mighty Men of Valour</hi>

Prudent States, wiſe Kings and Nations, when they ſheath the Sword, take up the Trowel; and in Time of Peace, prepare for War. In the Country of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> where the People dwelt careleſs and ſecure, till a ſmall Regiment of <hi>Danites</hi> ſmote them with the Edge of the Sword, <hi>there was no Magiſtrate that might put them to Shame in any thing</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Judg. 18.7.</note>. The. People were

A neglect of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Preparations for their own Defence, is ſhameful both in Magiſtrates and People, and often proves the Ruin of both.</p>
               <p>Tho' there hath been of late more of a Martial Spirit to be obſerved among us, than was formerly; and ſomething hath been done in many Places toward the Recovery of Martial Skill, which was almoſt loſt; yet it might be humbly aſk'd, whether the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> be not wanting to their own Honour, and the People's Safety, in not providing Laws, guarded with ſeverer Penalties than thoſe we have at preſent, to oblige Soldiers to attend the Exerciſes, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſit them for War? And whether People are not defective in furniſhing their Young Men with proper Weapons of War, and encouraging them to learn the dextrous Uſe of them? And whether that Reſpect is paid to thoſe, who by a laudable Care and Diligence, have acquir'd Martial Knowledge, do excel in it, and endeavour to propagate it, which is due to Men, who deſire in this Way to honour their King, and ſerve their Country?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We may hence infer the Duty of Soldiers, to be ready prepared for War.</hi> Since their being ſo, is the Honour of their Prince, and Safety of their People, their Obligation thereunto is apparent, ſtrong and ſacred. They ſhould faithfully endeavour to be ſo, for Conſcience ſake twards God, who requires them, and every other Order of Men, to <hi>honour the King,</hi> and ſeek the publick Safety and Welfare, in which the Glory of God is ſo much intereſted. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Amaſiah,</hi> one of the brave Generals, in our Context, that <hi>he willingly offered himſelf unto the Lord.</hi> And thus ſhould every Commander, and private Centinel,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004249_0026_10043AC0E95DC478"/>in the Militia do, ſhould offer himſelf, not only to his King, to ſerve him, and his People; but to the Lord, to glorify him, in the Calling of a Soldier. That his Strength, and Skill, and Courage, and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of War; all his Military Accompliſhments and Atchievements, may be HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD OF HOSTS. This, according to the Prophecy of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> Chap. 14. Verſ. 20. was to be the Inſcription upon the <hi>Bells of the Horſes,</hi> in the Day of Goſpel-Light. It ſhould be written on the Furniture of War-Horſes, and would be the greateſt Ornament to them, and Honour to thoſe who ride upon them. Soldiers ſhould piouſly deſign the Honour of God, in all that they undertake, for the Honour of the King; and aim to ſerve God, in ſerving their Country: GOD, THE KING, AND OUR COUNTRY, ſhould be the Soldiers MOTTO, and animating Word. If Soldiers are endued with a true Principle of Obedience to God, of Loyalty to their Prince, and Love to the Commonwealth, they will conſcientiouſly endeavour to be ready prepared for War.

'Tis reaſonably expected that you, of whom others are to learn War, ſhould be expert in it your ſelves: throughly ſkill'd in all the Exerciſes of the Military Art. It is a great Reproach to an Inſtructer in any Art, when it may be juſtly ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou therefore which teacheſt another, teaches;t thou not thy ſelf?</hi> 'Tis a Diſgrace to the Militia, when the LEADER of a Company, is
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004249_0027_10043AD65E90B8E8"/>fit only to be a BRINGER-UP OF THE FRONT-HALF-FILES. Superiour Skill is requiſite for them that are not appointed to teach others.

The Four Days in a Year allotted for Trainings, may well be ſpared from other Employments, by thoſe who are good Huſbands of their time; and it would be very unreaſonable and abſurd in them that are Prodigals of their Time, to complain of this Expence: But 'tis Pity, that thoſe Days ſhould be Days of Vanity, and be waſted (as they too often are) to little or no good Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>With manly Courage and Prudence exerciſe that Authority which, in the ſeveral fit Degrees of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination under the CAPTAIN-GENERAL, you are cloathed with. This is neceſſary for the preſervation of good Order, and the promoting of Martial Skill and Valour among the Soldiers.

If you would be thought mighty Men of Valour, betray not ſuch Weakneſs, as to be eaſily conquer'd by your own Paſſions. They that are ungovernable, mutinous, and ſoon angry, may have little of true martial Fire in them.
