            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving read what Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> against <hi>Wall's History of Infant Baptism,</hi> has advanc'd, I was too easily imposed upon by the Ingenuity of so Learned a Pen; and his plausible way of writing prevailed upon me too credulously to take in what was there offer'd; However for my further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I apply'd my self to the Author of the ensuing Discourse, and desired his Remarks on the most Material Passages in Mr. <hi>Gales</hi> Treatise; as also to essay the Vindication of Infant-Baptism, with the usual mode of administring that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Affusion. In answer to which the following Composure was written, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any view to its being publish'd.</p>
            <p>As I am privileged with a peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the Friendship of the Author, I shall not hazard his Displeasure, by offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Modesty. Only thus much I would crave liberty to say, That altho' he shuns Praises, He cannot miss a just esteem: from the Judicious. As this small Tract
<pb facs="unknown:002215_0004_0FDACF27F9820008"/>
has yielded me great satisfaction, and been approv'd by Persons of a more Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Character, who have seen it in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript; I was encourag'd to give it a Birth in Print, in hopes it might be serviceable to promote the Truth, which if attended with Success, will abundantly compensate for the Censure of Vanity, or what ever else may be thrown on him who may (at least) justly claim the Character of being <hi>A Well-wisher to Truth.</hi>

            <p>I accept his Challenge; For although I freely acknowledge, that the word very frequently signifies to <hi>Dip,</hi> yet not always, which when made appear, will overthrow his whole <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> from the word <hi>Baptizo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All his <hi>Quotations</hi> from profane Authors, (if pertinent) will do him but very little service; for his highest Pretence from them must be that the word is sometimes used in the sense he pleads for, and particularly in the places Cited; But this notwithstanding, it may carry a different meaning in Thousands of Instances, for ought he knows. But what will become of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation

upon this Topick, if some of his own cited Instances, should have the ill manners to Contradict him? which I am pretty Confident they will.</p>
            <p>He brings an Instance from <hi>Homers Batrachomy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omichia,</hi> who sayes, when one of the Champions was slain, by the side of a Lake, <hi>he breathless fell, and The Lake was Ebapteto,</hi> (which he transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes (<hi>Tinged with Blood.</hi>) Can he perswade a Gentleman of your Reason to believe, that the Lake was <hi>Dipt</hi> in Blood, or that the Poet so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended? Especially when you Remember, that this mighty Hero <hi>Crambophagus,</hi> from whose slaughter was this Deluge of Blood, was but a <hi>Frog</hi> Dying by the Hands of his victorious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the <hi>Mice.</hi> I am sure that it would be a more natural, and genuine Translation, to Read it, <hi>The Lake was sprinkled, or stayn'd with Blood,</hi> This would (if we look upon these Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions as this ingenuous Ludicrous Poem Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents them, to be famous <hi>Martial Chevaliers</hi>) make the Poets words both Truth and sense; But his Translation neither the one or the other; For he himself is forced to acknowledge, it <note n="†" place="bottom">

               <hi>very Ridiculous, to speak of Dipping or Plunging a Lake, in the Blood of a slain Champion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Previous to a particular Consideration of his Crafty attempt, to make the word a Nose of wax, to bend to his purpose, I shall observe to you, that we are not to put a Metaphorical Construction upon any Authors words, unless

            <p>How Mr. <hi>Gale,</hi> in the Case before us, and frequently in the following pages, has (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any occasion from the sense of the words) forc't upon them a Metaphorical meaning, with the greatest violence imaginable, you will, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his plausible Discourse, be easily Convinced.</p>

            <p>But then here is a Comparison without any similitude, for I can't devise where lies the parity between <hi>Dipping</hi> things in Dye, and the Running of Blood into a Lake; It is therefore but a wheadling of all Mankind out of their Reason, To perswade them to accept of this Translation, or this Metaphor, as you'll be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, when you consider, (1.)

            <p>By this time you are (I'm perswaded) convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the word in Controversy, cannot, without utmost violence, be translated to <hi>Dip</hi> or <hi>Plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You see, by what has been said, how little Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> is to be Relyed on, he having been very much out of the way in this Instance, we have great Reason to suspect him, in every thing Else, that Depends upon his Authority.</p>

And I'm sure that the Latter of these Constructions, that the Dew was <hi>Impressed,</hi> or fell upon him, is better sense than that he was <hi>Dipt</hi> in the Dew.</p>
            <p>That the words may be sometimes used in the sense He assigns them, I don't Deny, but not always.</p>
            <p>Our Author is again driven to his usual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge, a <hi>Metaphorical meaning</hi>; and says <hi>Page</hi> 142.
<q>Its Evident that <hi>Daniel</hi> and his Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, designed to Express the great Dew, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> should be Exposed to, more Emphatically, by saying, that he should lie in Dew, and be Covered with it all over, as if he had been Dipt.</q>
This Metaphorical sense, he endeavours to vindicate by alledging,
<q>That the Dews in the East are generally very large; </q>which he Confirms by the Instance of <hi>Gideons Fleece</hi> (which being miraculous, is very Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly urged in this Case) But all this Harrangue is very impertinent; for it's plain that the Scope and Drift of the words, was not to shew the quantity of the Dew he was wet with (he was Exposed to no Dew but what was ordinary; there needed therefore not Emphasis upon the words) But the Brutal sort of Life, that so great a <hi>Monarch</hi> was brought unto, by the Just (the amazing) Judgement of God;
How he was
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002215_0020_0FDACF3FD6068108"/>
turned out from Humane society, and instead of his magnificent Palace, which he with so much Haughtiness gloried in, had no Roof but the Sky, to Cover him, and to shelter him, from the Injuries of the Weather, and the <hi>Dew</hi> of Heaven. This is evidently the Scope of the Story, and therefore it stands in no need of (but has apparent violence offerred by) such meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Constructions, as he puts upon it.</p>
            <p>The next place I shall mention; is,
That <hi>Eccles</hi> 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29·<q> He that washeth (<hi>Baptizomenos</hi>) because of a Dead Body, and toucheth it again, what availeth his washing?</q>
That the Washing here spoken of, was by <hi>Sprinkling</hi> is most certain, and will appear Evident (notwithstanding all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> sayes to the Contrary) If the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Rite be duely Consider'd, you'l find it in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. throughout <hi>v.</hi> 13.
<q>Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver toucheth the Dead Body of any man that is Dead, and purifyeth not himself, Defileth the Tabernacle of the Lord, and that Soul shall be cut off from <hi>Israel,</hi> because the water of separation was not <hi>Sprinkled</hi> upon him. <hi>vers.</hi> 18. And a clean Person shall take Hyssop, and Dip it in the water, and <hi>Sprinkle</hi> it upon the Tent; and upon all the Vessels, and upon the Persons that were there, and upon him that touched a Bone, or one slain, or one Dead, or a Grave. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. And the Clean Person shall <hi>Sprinkle</hi> upon the Unclean, on the third Day, and on the Seventh Day; And on the Seventh Day we shall purify himself, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002215_0021_0FDACF4153AEE8F0"/>
wash his Cloaths, and Bathe himself in Water, and shall be Clean at Even.</q>
From this last Cited verse our Author tells us, <hi>Pag.</hi> 146.
<q>That the Defiled Person was to be sprinkled with Holy Water, on the third, and on the Seventh Day, praeparatory to the great Purification, that was to be by Washing the Body, and Cloathes on the Seventh Day.</q>
This is a gross mistake, for it was the Clean Person officiating, not the Unclean by touching the Dead, that was to wash his Cloathes, and Bathe himself in Water. This appears, 1. By the two following <hi>verses,</hi> 14.20.
<q>But the man that shall be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; and shall not purify himself, shall be Cut off from the Congregation; Because he hath Defiled the Sanctuary of the Lord; the water of Separation hath not been <hi>Sprinkled</hi> upon him, he is unclean.</q>
He is Unclean, not because he hath not <hi>Bathed himself</hi>; But because he hath not been <hi>Sprinkled</hi> with the Water of Separation. But the next <hi>Verse</hi> puts it out of all Doubt, who was to Bathe himself in Water, <hi>vers.</hi> 21. <hi>It shall be a perpetual Statute to them, that he that sprinkles the Water of Separation; shall wash his Cloathes, &amp;c.</hi> This also further appears from the 7<hi>th verse,</hi> which you may be pleased to turn to.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 147 Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> subjoyns, That
<q>it can't be Reasonably Imagined, that the <hi>Priest</hi> by barely purifying the Unclean, should need so much greater Washing and Purification, than the Unclean himself.</q>
Here he is out again; for the Bathe was the far lesser Cleansing. This will appear if you take notice of <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.31, 32. and forward, where it is ordained, <hi>That whoso toucheth the Dead Body of a Beast, was to Wash his Cloathes, and to be Vnclean untill the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>; and so the <hi>Priest,</hi> in the Case before us; but he that touched the Dead, Body of a Man, had contracted a greater Pollution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was Unclean seven Dayes; nor was the ordinary methods of Purification, sufficient for his Cleansing, but there must be all this adoe of Burning a Heifer, mingling her Ashes with Water, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But after all, if it be granted, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing for a Dead Body, was not perfect without the <hi>Bathe,</hi> the word in the quoted Text, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless Includes <hi>Sprinkling</hi> (for that was certainly at least a part of the Washing spoken of) and Therefore does signify to <hi>Sprinkle,</hi> as well as to <hi>Dip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We'll next look into the <hi>New-Testament</hi> and see whether it always there, necessarily signifyes <hi>to Dip,</hi> and if we find it there of a differrent signification, tho' but in one Instance, I'm sure we have gained the Cause.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:002215_0023_0FDACF44566A57A0"/>The first Place I'll, turn to is <hi>Luk</hi> 3.16. <hi>shall Baptize</hi> (BAPTISEI) <hi>you, with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire.</hi> You are sensible how Ridiculous it would be, to Translate the words, <hi>he shall Dip or Plunge you with the Holy Ghost and with Fire.

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Baptism</hi> was Evidently by Sprinkling, and no otherwise; For would it not be a Trifling, unworthy of our Notice, to say, That their being wet, and Refreshed by Rain from a Cloud, was <hi>Dipping</hi> them under Water? And that the <hi>Baptism</hi> here spoken of, was by Rain from the Cloud, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the Apostle here says they were <hi>Baptized</hi>) will not remain Doubtful, when you have Read <hi>Psal.</hi> 68, 7, 8, 9. <hi>O God, when thou wentest forth before thy People, when thou marchedst thro' the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We'll next look into <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Which stood only in Meats and Drinks, and Divers Washings</hi> [BAPTISMOIS] <hi>and Carnal Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Home-Thrust, and therefore puts our Author into a Sweat to turn it aside; which by all

<q>That the Words, for ought he knows to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, may speak of those Washings only, which were by <hi>Bathing</hi> or <hi>Dipping</hi> into Water.</q>
This I shall therefore consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1 We shall first observe the End and Scope of of these words, which was to shew, that all the Legal Cleansings under the <hi>Mosaick Paedogogy,</hi> were Typical of our being sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. The words are not true in fact, if our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors construction be allowed; it did not stand ONLY in divers <hi>Bathings</hi> and <hi>Dippings,</hi> there was divers <hi>Sprin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:002215_0028_0FDACF4BD3D96008"/>This makes it clear, beyond doubt, that the Washings Spoken of, were principally the <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> used among the <hi>Iews</hi>; for these, and these only, he Instanceth in, and referrs to, <hi>Num.</hi> 8, 7, and 19. <hi>per totum,</hi> upon which I have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly discoursed above.</p>
            <p>By this time you can't but see, that the word in Debate, signifyes something Else beside <hi>Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and Plunging.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am already (and I'm perswaded you also) grown weary of this word <hi>Controversy,</hi> you'll therefore Excuse me from further searching after, the meaning of the word in Scripture, when I've only Remark't,</p>
            <p>That the word in Debate is frequently used in Scripture; where (if the Sense <hi>Mr. Gale</hi> pleads for, be allowed, and it does signify to <hi>Dip</hi>) it will be far from Justifying the <hi>Antipoedobaptists</hi> in their Method of administring the Ordinance, for it don't necessarily (where it does signify to <hi>Dip</hi>) Imply, the <hi>Immersion</hi> of the whole Body, which is Clear,</p>
            <p n="1">1 From <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.24. <hi>And send</hi> Lazarus, <hi>that he may Dip</hi> (Bapse) <hi>the Tip of his Finger in Water, and cool my Tongue.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. From <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.38. <hi>And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvailed that he had not first washed,</hi> (EBAPTISTHE) <hi>before Dinner.</hi> This compared with <hi>Mark.</hi> 7, 5 makes it Evident, that the washing of the Hand, is the <hi>Baptism</hi> of the man. Whether the hands were washed by <hi>Dipping</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>Affusion,</hi> is not what I am now Enquiring; but
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002215_0029_0FDACF4D71BE8EE0"/>
what I observe is, that the Pharisee admired that he was not first <hi>Baptized</hi> (for so are the words Litterally to be translated) before Dinner, when the Washing of the Hand only, was what he Referred to. — And also to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From <hi>Mat</hi> 26.23. <hi>He that Dippeth</hi> (EMBAPSAS) <hi>his Hand, with me in the Dish.</hi> Hence then I argue, If <hi>Dipping</hi> the Tip of the Finger in Water be (<hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ize,</hi> does not necessarily signify to <hi>Dip</hi> the whole Body, nor has our <hi>Saviour</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring us to <hi>Baptize,</hi> required us to <hi>Plunge</hi> the Body under Water. So that if we allow them all they plead for, (and which none of them can ever prove) that the word <hi>Baptizo</hi> does signify to <hi>Dip,</hi> and only to <hi>Dip,</hi> yet it does not vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate their practice, of a total <hi>Immersion</hi>; for <hi>Dipping</hi> the <hi>Face,</hi> the Hand, Foot, Nay, the Finger, is a <hi>Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have here indeed used the words <hi>Bapto</hi> and <hi>Baptizo,</hi> as Synonomous, with which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor can find no fault, since he has assured us, that they are; <hi>page</hi> 217.
<q>Exactly the same, as to their signification.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But if there be (as many have Learnedly argued) any difference in these words, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together on our side: for if <hi>Bapto</hi> does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily include <hi>Dipping,</hi> in its signification, all Mankind will acknowledge it certain, that
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002215_0030_0FDACF4ED583C448"/>
               <hi>Baptizo</hi> can't be limited to that sense only.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> next endeavours to prove his mode of <hi>Baptism,</hi> by Citations from the Fathers of the Church, To all which its Answer sufficient,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the most that he quotes are too late to determine the matter, This matter; This Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> supposes sufficient answer to Mr. <hi>Wall,</hi> when he quotes <hi>Arrian of Nicomedia Page</hi> 355.
<q>That he lived not, until an Hundred and Fifty Years after Christ;</q> 
               <hi>whereas these he Cites, are much later.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Where he does make a shew of having primitive Antiquity on his side, he does but abuse his Reader. For Instance,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He brings in <hi>St. Barnabas</hi> saying, That <hi>we descend into the Water, full of Sins and Defilement, &amp;c.</hi> If he had done fairly by his Reader, he would have told him, that <hi>St. Barnabas</hi> Words might as truly have been translated, <hi>We go</hi> unto <hi>the Water and come</hi> from <hi>the Water</hi>; for so the prepositions he renders <hi>into,</hi> and <hi>Out Of,</hi> are very frequently used, as you'll see at Large hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. He quotes the <hi>Apostolick Constitutions,</hi> which he knows are Universally (by all learned men) acknowledged, to be spurious, and of a later date; He should therefore, have disabused his Reader, by giving him that account. All other his Citations, fall under the former Excepti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on. To which I may add,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Fathers of the Church (as he knows, and is forced to acknowledge) do some
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002215_0031_0FDACF505667A438"/>
of them approve, and argue for <hi>Sprinkling in Baptism</hi>;</p>
            <p>And this seems to have been the only Mode of administring the Ordinance in the early Ages of the Church, by that Story of <hi>Clemens Alewand</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Related by <hi>Eusebius Hist. Eccles. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. of an apostate youth, who after he had made a profession of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and enjoyed the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>Baptism</hi>; forsook the wayes and fear of God, pursued all manner of Dissolute Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; Headed a Company of Thieves, and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti, gave himself up to Slaughter, Murther, and Extream Cruelty. This being made known to the <hi>Apostle Iohn</hi> (who before had committed him to the Care of a Godly <hi>Bishop,</hi> for Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Instruction in the Faith) He pursues him into the Wilderness, and finding him, brings him unto such a Sense of, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for his past course of Extravagance, that embracing the <hi>Apostle,</hi> he answered him as well as he could, for weeping; <hi>So that again</hi> (sayes the Hystorian) <hi>he seem'd to be Baptized with Tears, The Shaking the Hand only omitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether this Story be true or Fabulous, makes nothing to the purpose, but what I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve is, that this Ordinance was, in those Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Centuries, administred by <hi>Shaking the Hand,</hi> consequently not by <hi>Dipping</hi> or <hi>Plunging:</hi> (he could not be dipt in his Tears) but by <hi>Affusion,</hi> or <hi>Aspersion</hi>; unto which that gesture is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>I shall not weary your patience with the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002215_0032_0FDACF5288CBF400"/>
many other Authorities of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> that might here be Introduced; but only observe to you, That our Author himself brings in <hi>Origen,</hi> one of the most capable Judges among them all) rendring the word <hi>(BEBAMMENON) Baptized,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.13. By <hi>ERANTISME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NON, Sprinkled,</hi> But rather than vail to the Authority of this Father, and of the <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Versions, which also render it so, He would fain believe <hi>Page</hi> 181. That the Text it self is wrong, and that the word there has been altered. But why so? is there any Copy of the <hi>New Testament</hi> in the World, to be found, that has any other Reading, different from the vulgar? no! But how is it possible for <hi>Origen</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and those Early Versions to understand the word otherwise, than he does, or of any Larger signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication?</p>
            <p>You see, <hi>Sir,</hi> what strange Refuges a Disperate Cause must have, that Men will rather suppose a Mistake in the Scripture, than in themselves.</p>
            <p>Our Author must think that all Mankind has laid aside the use of their Reason, and that no body could read but himself, when with such an Air he ventures to say, <hi>P.</hi> 109 101.
<q>That he is inclined to believe, That in general is a mistake, that Words have more than one Signification.</q>
And for this to quote Mr <hi>Lock</hi> in the third Book of his <hi>Essay of Human Vnderstanding.</hi> Let us Look into him and see what he says. <hi>Book</hi> 3 <hi>Chap.</hi> 9 <hi>S.</hi> 4 <hi>That then</hi> (says he) <hi>that makes Doubtful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Words, is the difference of Ideas, they stand for.</hi> He tells us again <hi>Book</hi> 3. <hi>Chap</hi> 7. <hi>S</hi> 4. <hi>In the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>Tongue there is a Particle consisting of but one single Letter, of which there are reackoned up, as</hi> I <hi>remember, Seventy, I'm sure above Fifty Several Significations.</hi> He goes on to Instance in our English Word BUT, of which he finds Five (and doubts not but he could if it were his Business to examine it, find a great many more) Significations.</p>
            <p>I might also observe to you, That we have some words, even in our Language, of a quite Contrary Signification, to Instance in the word <hi>Let,</hi> Sometimes used to permit, as <hi>Let me go,</hi> sometimes to hinder, as I have met with many <hi>Lets</hi> in my way.</p>
            <p>You may see by this how much his Assertions and how much his Quotations, are to be depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon.</p>
            <p>I shall now Conclude the first Controversy about the mode of <hi>Baptizing,</hi> when I have shewn you that we don't want sufficient Reason for our Mode of administring the Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then what is Signified by, Represented and Sealed to us, in this Ordinance, is (in Scripture) expressed by <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> and <hi>Affusion,</hi> but never by <hi>Dipping</hi> or <hi>Plunging,</hi> that I Remember. To Instance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Baptism</hi> signifies the Washing away our Sins by the Blood of Christ, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 22, 16. <hi>Arise be Baptized and wash away thy Sins.</hi> Now the washing away our Sins by Christs Blood is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently represented by <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002215_0034_0FDACF54D3F972F8"/>
               <hi>Through Sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience, and</hi> Sprinkling <hi>of the Blood of</hi> Jesus Christ Isa. 52, 15. <hi>So shall he</hi> Sprinkle <hi>many Nations</hi> Ezek. 36 25 <hi>I will</hi> Sprinkle <hi>clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean</hi> Heb. 12, 24. <hi>And to the Blood of</hi> Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>which speaks better than the Blood of</hi> Abel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The signification of <hi>Baptism</hi> is the Answer of a good Conscience, as the Apostle tells us, 1 Pet. 3 21. and this is also represented by <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>; Heb. 10, 22. <hi>Having our</hi> Hearts Sprinkled <hi>from an Evil Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Baptism</hi> Represents unto us our Sanctification and Cleansing by, and the Gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Hence these Metaphorical Expressions of being <hi>Baptized</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> before spoken of, and this is Set forth in Scripture by <hi>Affusion</hi>; as in the fore-cited <hi>Isai.</hi> 43, 4· I <hi>will</hi> Pour <hi>my Spirit upon thy Seed.</hi> And Joel 2, 28. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It can't be proved from Scripture, that the Ordinance was ever administred by <hi>Dipping</hi> or <hi>Plunging</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are indeed Expressions that seem to favour this mode of <hi>Baptis</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if Examined, will not prove so unanswerable as Mr. <hi>Gale.</hi> pretends. I shall distinctly consider the Texts, that he Cites for that purpose.</p>
            <p>The first is <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>And John also was Baptizing in</hi> Enon, <hi>near to</hi> Salim, <hi>because there was much Water there.</hi> Here note,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That the words in the original are, <hi>because there was</hi> (hudata polla) <hi>Many Waters there.</hi> And Travellers assure us, that it is a place of many
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002215_0035_0FDACF56798FF640"/>
Springs, and therefore not likely to <hi>Dip</hi> those Multitudes in, that came there to be <hi>Baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Iohn</hi> being in the Wilderness, there was occasion for much Water, that the multitudes which attended his Baptism might have Water for themselves, and Horses, or other Creatures (on which its probable many of them Rid thither) to Drink, Many springs of Water seem much more suitable to this purpose, than for <hi>Dipping</hi> or <hi>Plunging</hi> men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. While the Rites of Purification were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued among the <hi>Iews,</hi> it would have been thought a Scandal, for the same Vessel of Water to have been used for the <hi>Baptizing</hi> of many Persons, and therefore there needed much Water for this Administration, though it had been by <hi>Affusion</hi> or <hi>Aspersion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If all that John <hi>Baptized</hi> had been <hi>Dipt,</hi> he must have stood whole Dayes togather in the Water, and therefore could not have survived that Imployment but by Miracle.</p>

<q>Which is most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Suppose, that the River was <hi>poured</hi> or <hi>Sprinkled</hi> on them, or they <hi>Dipt</hi> in the River?</q>
I assume the former, <hi>Its most natural to Suppose, that the</hi> River (by a <hi>Synechdoche</hi> of a part for the whole) was <hi>poured</hi> or <hi>Sprinkled</hi> on them, as in the above Example, of the mans washing his Eyes in the Pool of <hi>Siloam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Text he brings to prove this Mode of Baptism, is That <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. <hi>And they went both into the Water, both</hi> Phillip, <hi>and the Eunuch, and he Baptized him.</hi> In answer to which; its sufficient to Say, That the Preposition (<hi>Eis</hi>) here rendred <hi>into,</hi> might as properly be Read <hi>Vnto</hi> the Water, and so it is very often used in the Scriptures; It does not therefore necessarily argue, that he was Baptized by <hi>Dipping.

But this is far from being to their purpose; for the Words truly translated are, he went straightway <hi>From</hi> the Water, for thus I think the Preposition (<hi>Apo</hi>) is always to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; it answers the Latin Prepositions <hi>A, Ab, Abs,</hi> and the English <hi>from.</hi> Thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.17.

            <p>Though Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> urges these Texts With Earnestness enough, yet when he finds this Prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition Construed to his disadvantage, he Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002215_0038_0FDACF5B11D10900"/>
and indeed truly argues, that <hi>Page</hi> 440, 441. Apo <hi>signifyes</hi> From, <hi>in propriety of speech.</hi> So that all Arguments from Christs, and the Eunuchs coming <hi>Out</hi> of the Water, are by his own Pleas wholly out of Doors.</p>
            <p>It is further worthy of Remark that we never Read any thing of going <hi>To</hi> the Water, or <hi>From</hi> the Water, in <hi>Baptism,</hi> Except in the Wilderness, or places distant from Inhabitants, where in all likelihood they wanted Vessels, to take up Water in.</p>
            <p>But after all, were it granted that they actually went <hi>into</hi> the Water, its no Evidence that they were <hi>Dipt</hi> or <hi>Plunged</hi> into it; they might go into the Water, and not be wet up to their Ankles.</p>
            <p>The next Text he brings is <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. and <hi>Rom</hi> 6, 4. Which are both of the same Import; and therefore may be Considered togather. That upon which, he Layes The Stress of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is our being <hi>Buried with Christ in Baptism.</hi> When he argues, That as <hi>Christ</hi> was Buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth, so should we be Buried under Water. In Answer to which, it is sufficient to tell you,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the whole Scope of the Text is to shew us that we are <hi>Baptized</hi> to a Conformity unto <hi>Christs</hi> Death, by our Dying to Sin; and to his Rising again in our living to <hi>God:</hi> Here is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Our manner of Administring the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, more Imitates a Burial than theirs; the throwing Water on the <hi>Baptized,</hi> is more like throwing Earth on the Dead.

<q>All Metaphorical Passages (says he) are out of Doors, Because of their Ambiguousness, and Obscurity. </q>I'll only add,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Adversaries themselves do practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally deny their Commentary upon this Text, for the Administrator of this ordinance (among them) never <hi>Dipt</hi> but a part of the Body, nor are they but partly Buried under Water in <hi>Baptism.</hi> The Person to be <hi>Baptized</hi> goes into the Water himself above the Waste, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either partly Baptizes himself, or else nothing but his upper parts are Baptized at all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Antipoedobaptists</hi> call for Express Proof, that Infants are to be Baptized; Let them therefore produce Express Proof, that this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is to be administred by <hi>Dipping.</hi>

Which may be Illustrated by transcribing <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.8, 9, 10. <hi>Peter said unto him, Thou shalt never wash my Feet; Iesus answered him. If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me,</hi> Simon Peter <hi>saith unto him, Lord, not my Feet only, but also my Hands and my Head; Jesus saith unto him, He that is washed, needeth not Save to wash his Feet, but is clean Every whit.</hi> Though our Saviour did not Institute this Ceremony of Washing their Feet; as a standing Sacrament, yet he did thereby put them in mind of the necessity of their being washed in his Blood, from the Pollution of Sin, as is evident from his saying, They had Else no part with him. And we see that washing but a part of the Body, did sufficiently signify the Sanctification of the whole Man; and why then washing a part of the Body in <hi>Baptism,</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:002215_0041_0FDACF5F53718230"/>
does not sufficiently Signify the Cleansing of the whole Man, our Adversaries are accountable.</p>
            <p>Thus I have, as breifly as the Task you Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon me, would allow, dispatched the first part of the Controversy.</p>
            <p>HAving finished my <hi>Remarks</hi> (I hope to your Satisfaction) on the <hi>First,</hi> it is time to Consider the <hi>second,</hi> and principal Article in Dispute; which, Refers to the subject of <hi>Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Gale</hi> is forced, <hi>Pag.</hi> 220. To <hi>Take breath a while,</hi> before he Enters upon this, that he might Regain his Vigour, and strength to Encounter his Adversary, in this new Combate; but as he Toiled himself out of Breath, to but very little purpose, in his former Attempt, so (you'll find, <hi>Sir,</hi>) that his new Accession of Spirits and strength, will be but little Service to him, in this fresh Encounter.</p>
            <p>He promises, <hi>Pag.</hi> 220. To
<q>avoid all he can the Celebrated Arguments, from Original Sin, and Circumcision, which have been (as he says) so often, and fairly Baffled.</q>
In this Indeed was his prudence very Considerable, for as often Baffled as they have been they Remain yet too powerfull for him to abide in the field.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to Lay the Foundation of a long, and triumphant Harrangue, by telling us, <hi>Pag.</hi> 221. That Mr. <hi>Wall</hi>
               <q>very freely allows, that it can't be made appear from the Scriptures,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002215_0042_0FDACF60D22687B8"/>
that Infants are to be <hi>Baptized.</hi>
               </q> Were this true, Mr. <hi>Wall</hi> had indeed given up the Cause, and made a voluntary offer of the Lawrels of Victory, to his Adversary:
But tho' he does most seriously, and frequently affirm, it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> han't so Extensive a Charity, as to believe it; But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That in this (as frequently else-where) he watches all opportunities, Right or wrong, to make, <hi>Candida de nigris, et de candentibus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I dare not, indeed, affirm, That there is no such passage in <hi>Mr. Walls</hi> Book, (I not having seen it) But am sure that the Passages quoted, fall so very far short of any such Concession, that there can't be modestly any such Construction (unless by a far fetch't Innuendo) put upon them; And I am ready to Conclude, that if <hi>Mr. Wall</hi> had said it, our Author would not have been so tender of him, as not to transcribe it.</p>
            <p>He indeed brings in <hi>Mr. Wall</hi> saying, <hi>That there is no particular Direction given, what to do, with Reference to the Children of those that Received the faith.</hi> And that <hi>among all the Persons, that are Recorded as Baptized by the Apostles, there is no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press mention made of any Infant, &amp;c.</hi> But what is this like acknowledgeing that it can't be made appear from the Scriptures, that Infants are to he Baptized? Much may be made appear from Scripture, that is not Expresly mentioned there, as the Admission of Women unto the Lords Supper, the Change of the Sabbath, and the Baptism even of the Apostles themselves, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:002215_0043_0FDACF62F06FCBA8"/>It is a Ruled Case, That good Consequences drawn from Scripture, are as much to be Relyed on, as the Express words of it.</p>
            <p>Did not our Lord prove the Resurrection, by Consequences from Scripture? <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31. Did not the <hi>Apostle</hi> use Consequential Reasoning, when he argues from <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.4. (<hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the Mouth of the Ox that treadeth forth the Corn</hi>) to the maintenance of the Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9? And does he not use Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential Arguments, when he argues from the Priesthood of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> to the Priest-hood of <hi>Christ, Heb</hi> 7. <hi>per totum? Cum multis aliis</hi> you hence see, that what is not Expresly mentioned in the Scriptures, may be evidently enough proved from them. And tho' <hi>Mr. Wall</hi> grants, that there is no Express mention of Infants, he may be far enough from acknowledging that it can't be proved from Scripture, that Infants should be Baptized. I insist more particularly here, to shew you the disingenuity of Mr. <hi>Gale</hi> in this Case, and how little he is to be depended upon, that will thus venture to say any thing; as well as to defect the vanity of their common Outcry, <hi>Let there be Express Scripture produced, that Infants should be Baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not so material whether <hi>Mr. Wall</hi> allows, or dissallows this Allegation, as whether it is true in fact; which if it appears to be, (as our Author would persuade us it is) our Cause, I must confess, is Expiring, and must quickly give up the Ghost. But I find so little grounds

The Consequence is Clear, and unexceptionable, see <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Acts.</hi> 16.31.33. It only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to prove from Scripture, that Infants have <hi>Faith</hi>; which you shall now see done, I hope, to your Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>I freely own, that the Acts, and Exercises of <hi>Faith</hi> they are no more capable of, than the Acts, and Exercises of <hi>Reason</hi>; but as all men will allow them the Habits of <hi>Reason</hi>; I can't see why they should deny them the Habits of <hi>Faith.</hi> I'm sure there is the same Cause to Deny their being Rational Creatures, as Believers.

This indeed refers to the Meekness, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> necessary to all his Disciples; But observe, that in the 3<hi>d</hi> and 4<hi>th</hi> verses, he does not tell them that they must become such little Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren or such a Child as this, (as the <hi>Antipoedabaptists</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> Dreamed, and therefore went playing about the streets with Rattles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>as</hi> little Children and <hi>as</hi> this Child.</p>

            <p>The Scope and drift of our <hi>Lords</hi> Discourse in the 5<hi>th</hi> and 6<hi>th</hi> Verses, will help to Enlighten this. Our <hi>Lord</hi> is there shewing how much he values, and how highly R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>It is also objected, That this Child, tho' little, might be grown to some Years, and so be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Actual Faith. To which I answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He took the Child in his Arms, as <hi>Mark.</hi> assures us, <hi>Cap.</hi> 9 <hi>v.</hi> 35. and it is therefore most Reasonable to conclude, that it was but in its Infancy.</p>

with that Emblem of <hi>Humility, Meekness,</hi> &amp;c. was lost, if it was a Child arrived to an age capable of the Acts of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi>; for you are not so unacquainted with such little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as to be Ignorant, how Proud, Pievish, Contentious, &amp;c. they are, more I think at such an age, than any other.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That he called him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not an Infant. I answer, He might call him in his nurses Arms, and it seems most probable that he did, by the forecited parrallel Text, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.35. Where its said <hi>he took him in his Arms.</hi> But if otherwise, an Infant in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, may be capable to go alone, and come when called.</p>
            <p>As to the Objection, <hi>That Infants can't be Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,</hi> Its too trivial to be taken notice of. Can't they be Reproached.

            <p>Our Adversaries Practice indeed makes evident their belief, that Infants can't be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This threatning of our <hi>Lord</hi> gainst those that do offend these little Ones, would Else make them tremble, when they deny them the Ordinances of the Gospel, a Station in the Church, and <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> and Rank them among the Heathen.</p>

It would be most Uncharitable Cruelty, as well as Express Contradiction to the Scriptures, to Deny Salvation unto all Infants, and to Damn them by whole-sale. And if they are saved without <hi>Faith,</hi> it must be in some way that the Gospel has never proposed; Nay, it must be in away directly Repugnant to the terms of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, proposed in the Gospels.

               </gap>race, have a Right to have the Covenant Sealed to them by Baptism. But Infants of Believers are in the Covenant of Grace. This whole Argument receives sufficient Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from that <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Then</hi> Peter <hi>said unto them, Repent, and be Baptized, every one of you, in the name of Iesus Christ; for the Remission of Sins, &amp;c.</hi> For <hi>the Promise is unto you, and to your</hi> Children. The Major of this Argument is plain from the Words, The Tittle they had to <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the Grounds of their being exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, was their Interest in the Covenant Promises; <hi>Be Baptized; for the Promise is unto you.</hi> And that Infants are in the Covenant of Grace, is no less Evident, <hi>For the Promise is unto you, and your</hi> Children: What can be plainer? And by the way, you may observe, That Infants have the same Claim to <hi>Baptism,</hi> as the Adult. By the Apostles argument in this Text, they are Exhorted to Be <hi>Baptized,</hi> in Order to receive Remission of Sins, and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which Exhortation is pressed upon them, from their Interest in the Promise, as an Enforcing Motive

and Encouragemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and as a Reason why they ought to be <hi>Baptized</hi> Infants have the like Interest in the Promise (<hi>The Promise is to you, and to your Children</hi>) and therefore by Irresistible Consequence, the like Claim to <hi>Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It can't be Reasonably objected, That their Interest in the Promise was urged, only as an Encouragement unto them, that they should Receive Remission of Sins, and the Gift of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; and not as a motive to their Being <hi>Baptized</hi>; For the Argument of the Apostle must have the next and most Immediate Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to their being <hi>Baptized</hi>; Because it was their Interest in the Promise, upon which their Right to <hi>Baptism,</hi> is founded. Their being Children of the Covenant, entitles them to the Seals of it. The Argument is very apt and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable; <hi>Be Baptized, Got the Covenant Sealed,</hi> (in order to your Enjoying the Blessings and benefits thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Pardon and Sanctification) For you have a Covenant Right, and therefore ought to enjoy Covenant Priviledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Argument is not so applicable, as an Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement to their Receiving the Gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; For there are many that have a visible Covenant Right, who never Receive the Gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, If this Text does not Sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily strengthen the Argument, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (as you'l be Convinced) will fall nothing short of Demonstration.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Abrahamitical Covenant</hi> did include,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002215_0051_0FDACF6E54A47068"/>
and was Sealed unto Infants, as well as the Adult, none can doubt, that will Read the 17 Chap. of <hi>Gen.</hi> and that it Extends in the same Latitude to Believers under the Gospel, is Evident, in that <hi>Abraham</hi> was made the <hi>Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Gen. 17.5. of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as <hi>Iews,</hi> and therefore the Covenant with him and his seed, Extended in the same Latitude to his Gentile seed, as to his seed after the flesh. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Covenant was made with, and sealed to his natural Progeny, and their Infant seed, Even so to the Believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and their Infant seed. The Apostle Confirms this, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>The blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>comes on the</hi> Gentiles <hi>through Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Objection, That this Covenant which was Sealed by Circumcision, was only a Promise of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> is almost too Trifling to be taken notice of. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There was not a fourth part of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Posterity, (none but the Progeny of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>Iacob</hi>) that were to Expect, or ever did Enjoy a portion in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is much more implyed in the very words of the Covenant, as in the 7<hi>th</hi> Verse of the fore-cited Chap. of <hi>Gen. And I will Establish my Covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their Generations, for an</hi> Everlasting <hi>Covenant, to be a</hi> God <hi>unto thee, and thy seed after thee.</hi> The Covenant was an <hi>Everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> but the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Portion. The Tenor of the Covenant was
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002215_0052_0FDACF707628E228"/>
That he would be a God unto <hi>Abrah.</hi> and his seed. The promise of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was but a Subjoined Article of Divine favour to, and Care of him and his. This is further Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11.13. (where God Renews this Covenant with the Posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and their little Ones) <hi>Ye stand this Day all of you, before the Lord your God, your Captains of your Tribes, your Elders and your Officers, with all the men of Israel, your</hi> Little Ones, &amp;c. <hi>that he may establish thee to Day, for a people unto himself; and that he may be unto thee</hi> a God, <hi>as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy Fathers, to</hi> Abraham, <hi>to</hi> Isaac, <hi>and to</hi> Jacob.</p>
            <p>It may be here Remark't, that God takes their <hi>Little Ones</hi> into Covenant with him, as well as themselves; and that the Blessings of the Covenant made with them, and their Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> were no less than the enjoying <hi>God</hi> himself, as their Portion. This was the Covenant, whereof Circumcision was a Seal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Covenant could not be a Promise only of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in that the Blessings thereof Extend to believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as <hi>Iews,</hi> who are the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the Spirit, and Heirs of this very Promise, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that was made with him, as was before noted, and is very plain from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>And if ye be Christs, then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed, and heirs according to the Promise.</hi> Heirs of what? Of the Land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> No Surely! we have no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002215_0053_0FDACF71521DD140"/>
there; But there are Richer Blessings in store, for those that are Members of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> their having God himself, their Portion for Ever.</p>
            <p>If I have been too long in answering this Trifling Objection, you know where to Lay the fault, I'll conclude this Argument by only adding,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That either Infants are yet Included in the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual seed, both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ought to have it Sealed unto them, as formerly, or else it lies at our Adversaries Doors, to shew us from Scripture, How, Why, and When they were cut off from the Covenant, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed Priviledges.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That either Infants have an Interest in the Covenant, and a just claim to have it Sealed unto them, or else the Blessings and Priviledges of the <hi>New Testament</hi> Dispensation, are far less than the Old. That the Covenant of Grace, and the Seals thereof are Blessings and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, none can be so hardy as to Deny: nor dare any Christian suppose, that the Evangelical Dispensation, has Lessened the Priviledges of the Faithful, Therefore the Covenant of Grace must Extend, and be Sealed to Believers, and their Infant seed. <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. And now <hi>Sir,</hi> I shall venture (not withstanding <hi>Mr. Gale</hi> would even Laugh us out of it) to argue from Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and it will appear, that this so often Baffled Plea (as he calls it) will yet be able to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002215_0054_0FDACF72D4EED360"/>
bear the Shock. of their fiercest Opposition. I thus argue;</p>
            <p>If <hi>Baptism</hi> comes in the Room and stead of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> It ought to be administred to Infants, as Circumcision was. This is a Clear Consequence, and admits of no Debate. To say, that this is not Commanded, as that was, is a begging the Question; for if it succeeds in the Room of Circumcision, it must be used in the Room thereof, and then certainly be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to the same Subjects. It only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lies before us to prove that <hi>Baptism</hi> does succed unto, and come in the Room and stead of Circumcision, which will receive clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from these Scriptures.</p>
            <p>I shall first turn to <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>In whom also they are Circumcised, with the Circumcision made without hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Flesh, By the Circumcision of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ist; Buried with him in Baptism.</hi> The Apostle in the fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verse, tells them, That <hi>they were compleat in Christ</hi>; But it might something plausibly be objected, That they could not be compleat, that wanted Circumcision, the Seal of the Covenant, and Symbol of their Covenant Right. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a Sufficient matter of Satisfaction to 'em in that point, tells them, That they had (1.) the thing signifyed by Circumcision, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Circumcision</hi> of the Heart. (2) That they had the <hi>Covenant</hi> Sealed by another Ordinance, that (since the abrogation of Circumcision) suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to, and was in the Room and Place of,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002215_0055_0FDACF74709AC3A8"/>
the former. They had not only the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made without Hands; but were also Buried with Christ in Baptism. This is (I think) the plain and natural meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>Let us next look into <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27.29. <hi>For as many of you as have been Baptized into Christ, have put on Christ, and if they be Christs than are they</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams <hi>Sued and Heirs according to the Promise.</hi> Hence I argue</p>
            <p>If <hi>Baptism</hi> be now a Sign and Seal of the very same thing whereof <hi>Circumcision</hi> was appointed a Sign and Seal, under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Then <hi>Baptism</hi> comes in the Room and stead of <hi>Circumcision</hi>; The Consequence is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and can't be Opposed And that <hi>Baptism</hi> is a Sign and Seal of the same thing, is express in the Text, where we find <hi>Baptism</hi> to be a Sign and Symbol of our belonging to Christ, and thereby of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, and Heirs according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as Circumcision also was; See <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. This is also Evident from</p>
            <p>Acts 2 41. <hi>Then they that gladly Received his Word were Baptised, and the same Day were added unto them about Three Thousand Souls.</hi> From whence I argue.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Baptism</hi> be a Note and Symbol of our being Received into, and being Members of the Church, then it Succeeds in the Room and stead of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.</hi> The Consequence is clear, in that Circumcision was a Symbol thereof, see <hi>Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>If the same Covenant and Promise, whereof Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was a Seal, be the Grounds of Baptism, then Baptism comes in the Stead of Circumcision; The Consequence is Clear, and needs no Proof.

            </p>
            <p>I have here indeed taken liberty to differ from our English Translation, by Rendring the Word <hi>Matheteusate,</hi> by <hi>Disciple,</hi> instead of <hi>Teach,</hi> and the genuine natural sense; and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the word bears me out in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Gale</hi> indeed (as was his Interest) stands up for our Translation, and something plausibly attempts to prove, that The Word always signifyes to <hi>Teach,</hi> But his Reasonings will prove Superficial Enough, when they come to be Scann'd,</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let us take it for granted, that the word does signify <hi>to make Disciples,</hi> as I have Rendred it, and then I can't see why the words mayn't be thus understood, <hi>Go make Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all Nations, by Baptizing them, and by

            <p>If it be thus Understood, the Case is plain, That if Infants be a part of all Nations, to whom they were sent out upon this Errand, (Capable of being made <hi>Disciples</hi> by <hi>Baptism</hi>) they ought to Enjoy this Ordinance, for that End.</p>
            <p>And this Sense of the Words will appear very natural and Reasonable, when we consider, That Infants were acknowledg'd <hi>Disciples</hi> under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> Dispensation, and made such by <hi>Circumcision,</hi> in the Room whereof, <hi>Baptism</hi> is now Instituted; as has been made evident above.

            <p>But whatever is the true meaning of that Word, <hi>Infant Baptism</hi> may be proved from the <hi>Commission,</hi> as you'l be sensible, If you'l take

               <hi>Mr. Gale</hi> in his 7<hi>th</hi> Letter, Entertains us with a very Large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tedious Discourse, wherein he undertakes to make it Evident, that the <hi>Commission</hi> does directly Exclude Infants from <hi>Baptism</hi>; The Sum of all his Argumentation upon that Topick, I find thus proposed, <hi>Page</hi> 258.
<q>Infants are such a part of the Nations as are not capable of being Taught, and so not to be <hi>Baptized,</hi> because the <hi>Commission</hi> does as much command to <hi>Teach,</hi> as to <hi>Baptize</hi> all Nations.</q>
The whole Stress of his argument has its dependance upon the Greek Word <hi>Matheteusate,</hi> which he translates <hi>Teach</hi>; this he acknowledges, and fairly tells us, that <hi>Page</hi> 259.
<q>If the Greek Word does signify barely to <hi>Disciple,</hi> by <hi>Baptizing</hi> suppose, or any other way, without Including to Teach, all our Argument from this Place, unavoidably falls to the Ground.</q>
That now lies before us to Examine, and if upon the Stric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est Tryal, it appears that the Word does signify barely to <hi>Disciple,</hi> he must acknowledge that he is fairly beat out of the field, with his own Weapon.</p>
            <p>The Methods he proposes, are very fair, and such as (Duely observed) will Infallibly bring us to the Sense of the Word. Let us therefore follow him in his own Track.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:002215_0068_0FDACF8711FCACE0"/>He first Searches into the Origination of the Word, to see if he can find any thing to his purposes from thence; and I am of Opinion, that there is no way more sure to find out the true sense of a Word, than this; This shews its native meaning, and therefore is more to be depended upon, than the figurative use Words often obtain among Authors.</p>
            <p>Let us Seek therefore into the Etymology of the Word, and we shall find this Renowned Critick, Chargeable with the Greatest vanity Imaginable in venturing to say, <hi>Page</hi> 263.
<q>it makes it necessary to understand the Word, to signify to <hi>Teach, Instruct,</hi> or the like.</q>

               </gap>. But you'l say perhaps, how can Infants be Constituted <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</hi> I answer, by <hi>Baptism,</hi> whereby they are Laid under awful Obligations to Learn (as soon as capable) both the Doctrines and Practice of <hi>Christianity</hi>; And whereby their Parents do Solemnly Dedicate them to Christ, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige themselves to bring them up in his <hi>School.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now (<hi>Sir</hi>) would not even a <hi>School Boy,</hi> but newly initiated in the Rudiments of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, Laugh to Scorn <hi>Mr. Gales</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prove that <hi>Matheteuo,</hi> signifies to <hi>Teach?</hi> Could he not tell him, That the Theam from whence it comes, signifyes to <hi>Learn,</hi> and that all its Derivatives bear a like Sgnification? Could he not Instruct him in the difference, between <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi>?</p>
            <p>And yet how seriously does he proceed to say, <hi>Page</hi> 263
<q>Since then the Primitive Signifies to <hi>Learn,</hi> and all its Derivatives and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds Retain the like sense, why must <hi>Mathetes</hi> and <hi>Matheteuo</hi> be Excepted?</q>
I say, why Indeed? But who is it that does Except them? Is it not they that thus Industriously attempt to Change their True Native sense; and argue (tho' Ridiculously enough) that <hi>Manthano</hi> and its Derivatives signifies to <hi>Learn,</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:002215_0070_0FDACF8A1E05A370"/>
Therefore <hi>Matheteuo,</hi> one of its Derivatives must signify to <hi>Teach</hi>?</p>
            <p>One would think that this Gentleman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed his Book for the Veiw of None but Illiterate men, or Dunces, that could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish between <hi>Teaching and Learning,</hi> why Else did he take such Elaborate pains to Expose both himself, and his Cause?</p>
            <p>But as tho' he had not Effectually Bantered his Cause, he gravely undertakes to Shew the meaning of the Word <hi>Disciple</hi> among our selves, and likewise the use of it, among the Latin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, from whom we have borrowed it. <hi>Page</hi> 297.
<q>Now its plain (says he) that <hi>Discipulus</hi> is formed from <hi>Disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re,</hi> to <hi>Learn,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
If this be true, (as he has made it appear to be by many quotations from Ancient Latin Authors) to make <hi>Disciples</hi> is (as the Greek Word <hi>Matheteuo,</hi> signifies) to Constitute them <hi>Learners,</hi> and not to <hi>Teach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you See [<hi>Sir</hi>] how unhappy his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been from the Origination of the Word, that instead of Clearing the Cause he undertakes to Defend, they have abundantly Confirmed ours.</p>
            <p>He next proceeds to Shew how the word is used in Greek Authors, which he says, <hi>Page</hi> 266. "will perhaps be thought less liable to Exception, than arguing from Etymologyes.</p>
            <p>But I would Intreat <hi>Mr. Gales</hi> Pardon, if I am forced to believe, that this is much more liable to Exception, than arguing from Etymologies;

            <p>So that if <hi>Mr Gale</hi> by Unwearied application, can Collect some passages from Authors, where the Word in Debate is used in the Sense he pleads for, (and yet I even despair of finding that done) it will not determine the Sense of the Word, inasmuch as they may (and in this Case cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly must) have taken the common liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>His <hi>Third</hi> Instance is as clear as the Meridian Sun to our Purpose, it is from that some <hi>Epistle of Ignatius</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> where he directs them how to behave themselves towards unbelievers and strangers to the Faith; and advises them to Pray for all Men; <hi>For</hi> (says he) <hi>there is some hope that they may Repent, and obtain the Mercy of God, Let the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y,</hi> by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation and good works; but they might be <hi>Discipled,</hi> i. e. So won by their watchful walk, and Charitable, Christian-like Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to be brought to declare for Christ, and bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into his <hi>School,</hi> or (as you find the word properly Signifies) to be constituted Learners of him.</p>
            <p>His fourth Instance <hi>I</hi> have considered already,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:002215_0076_0FDACF9312BA3850"/>
and therefore now pass it over.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Fifth</hi> Instance, the Word is a little altered from Its native sense, and yet makes clearly against him. It is taken from <hi>Clemens Alexand. Strom. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 320, Where he says, <hi>If they are Learners (Matheteuontes) of any thing, from the Hebrew Phylosophy, let them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it.</hi> If they <hi>Teach</hi> any thing from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Philosophy, it must be Rendred, in order to be made any thing Serviceable to <hi>Mr. Gales</hi> Undertaking, which is to prove, that the Word signifies to <hi>Teach</hi>; But this is an Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, even too great for him to espouse.</p>
            <p>Here the Word indeed does not properly signify to make, or Constitute <hi>Learners,</hi> but it Signifies being <hi>Disciples,</hi> or <hi>Learners,</hi> which is but little different.</p>
            <p>His 6<hi>th</hi> Instance is taken from the same <hi>Clemens Strom. Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Page.</hi> 691. Who there says, <hi>To Converse not only with the</hi> Greeks, <hi>but with the</hi> Barbarians <hi>too, and by these common ways of Improving their knowledge, they are brought to the Faith; And then having laid the Foundation of the Truth, they are better enabled to go on in the Search after it; and hence it is that they delight in being,</hi> Discipled, (Matheteusamenoi) <hi>to Christ, and by pursuing after knowledge, they Vigorously pursue Salvation.</hi> The Word is necessary, if you Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, (1) The purport of the Argument here Improved, which is to shew, that the Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Faculties by all Sorts of knowledge, will Render the Profession of <hi>Christianity</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:002215_0077_0FDACF94932AC0E8"/>
in our first entring upon it, or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be <hi>Learners,</hi> or <hi>Disciples</hi>; and make us willing to pursue further Degrees of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. (2.) The Word here Respects the <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundation of the Truth,</hi> as the fore-going, and following Paragraphs make evident; And is not <hi>the Foundation of the Faith laid</hi> by our being made <hi>Disciples</hi> of Christ?</p>
            <p>Thus [<hi>Sir</hi>] I have gone thro' <hi>Mr. Gales</hi> first <hi>Six</hi> Instances, (and might, with the like advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, take notice of the Rest) and we find him as unhappy in this Undertaking, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer from the Origination of the Word.</p>
            <p>He next brings in Sundry of our Modern Authors accepting the Word in his Sense; to which it's sufficient answer, That numberless others, as great men, and as much to be Relyed on as they, Justly Contradict 'em.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to justify his Sense of the Word, from the various Translations of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament:</hi> But here also he fails of Success; for tho' some of them do make for, yet others against him, and therefore all Argument from that head, must fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Translation renders it by <hi>Lamad,</hi> which properly signifyes to <hi>Learn</hi> (as Jer. 10.2. <hi>Learn not of the Heathen</hi>) and in <hi>Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Some of those Versions he mentions, I know nothing of, and am not therefore capable to Examine.</p>
            <p>He next proceeds to tell us, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Primitive Church, Understood the Word in this Sense; but this is all of a piece with the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n</hi> to signify to <hi>Teach,</hi> because they use the same Word, in their Comments upon the Text.</p>
            <p>There's indeed several Passages he quotes, that make it plain, that they did understand the Word to enjoyn <hi>Teaching,</hi> in Order to <hi>Baptism</hi>; but its Evident (as you'l be sensible, if you'l Read his Quotations) that they had a peculiar Reference to the Adult only; and that such are to be made Disciples by Teaching, every body owns, tho' Infants may be Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled otherwise.</p>
            <p>He next undertakes to prove from Scripture, that the Word does signify to <hi>Teach</hi>; and if his performance had been any thing answerable to his undertaking, we must have been forever Silent upon this head.</p>
            <p>He first from <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37 Argues, That <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> previous to his <hi>Baptizing</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed him.

            <p>He next argues from <hi>Acts.</hi> 14.21. <hi>They had preached the Gospel in that City, and had Taught many.</hi> This Word (says he) is the same with that in the <hi>Commission,</hi> and is here Rendred <hi>Taught</hi>; But why may we not Read it, had made many

            <p>You'l now <hi>(Sir)</hi> I'm sure, Excuse me from any further Remarks on <hi>Mr. Gales</hi> Book, when you consider, that his 9<hi>th</hi> and 10<hi>th</hi> Letters, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about the Customs among the <hi>Iews,</hi> and their manner of admitting their Proselytes, which I think can't have so much stress laid upon it, as to be worthy our present Enquiry; And that all the Rest of his Book, is an Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Mr. Walls</hi> Arguments from Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Had <hi>Mr. Gale</hi> found any authority to Confirm his bold Assertion, that <hi>Page.</hi> 541.
<q>There is abundant grounds to Deny, that it <hi>(Infant Baptism)</hi> was used above two hundred years after Christ, </q>There would have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Considerable, in the Argument:
But since he layes it down praecariously, without one single Author saying a Word in his favour, we have found so very little grounds to depend upon his bare Word, that we may fairly Reject it. I should indeed have been willing to make some Enquiry into the truth hereof, if I had by me, or could in this Dark Corner of the World, come at the Ecclesiastical Writers of the first Centuries; But yet I must tell you, that I can't help but Conclude, that the writings
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:002215_0082_0FDACF9C1294E988"/>
of the Earliest and purest Times, are not so silent in this Case, as <hi>Mr. Gale</hi> pretends; for I find <hi>Clemens Romanus, Ireneus, Iustin Martyr,</hi> &amp;c. quoted to this purpose, by those, whose Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Faithfulness I shall not question, Until I see it disproved; And I'm pretty well assured, that there's nothing in the primitive Fathers against Infant <hi>Baptism</hi>; if there had, <hi>Mr. Gale</hi> would not have scrupled to let us know it.

            </p>
            <p>These Testimonies are as full and plain as can be written, and tho' <hi>Mr. Gale</hi> intimates, that they are too late to determine the matter; I think not so; for can it be supposed, that in an affair of this Nature, the Church should be thus Imposed upon a Foundation laid for turning the true <hi>Baptism</hi> out of Doors, and even Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching the World (the necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of bringing in Infant <hi>Baptism</hi> Contrary to Christs Institution, as I observed before) And this be received as the Ordinance of Christ, and the Constant Faith of the Church, in all Quarters of the World; And yet all Footsteps of this Innovation be oblitterated, and the Remembrance and Knowledge of it utterly Effaced, in two or three Hundred Years? It does not look possible.</p>
            <p>Many Errors indeed did creep into the Church in these Centuries, but as they generally met
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:002215_0085_0FDACFA091F507D8"/>
with opposition, so we have for the most part an account, by what means they were brought in. But this Doctrine (tho' of such great moment) must at once creep into all parts of the Earth, and without any opposition, like an Irresistible Charm, gain universal Credit; and all Circumstances of this Change, be hid from the knowledge of Next Ages: And thus the true Ordinance of Christ, (which by his Promise was to continue to the End of the Worl) must fall a Sacrifice to this Innovation, and not one Tongue or Pen stand up in its defence.</p>
            <p>Its Strange (if this were an Innovation) that there can be no account when it was Introduced. <hi>Mr. Gale</hi> is Ready, <hi>Pag.</hi> 528. to account it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that it was Introduced in <hi>Affrica,</hi> at or near <hi>St. Cyprians</hi> Time; But then, its Strange that <hi>Augustine</hi> in so little a time after, should know nothing of this, and boldly affirm, That the Church had always had, and held <hi>Infant Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Gale</hi> frequently tells us, that the Mode of administring this Ordinance in <hi>England,</hi> was Changed about <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> time; but would he not take it as an Affront, if we should tell him, He is too late to determine this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we can't depend upon what he says in that respect; he speaks of an Affair of too ancient a date for him to know any thing about.</p>
