            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A comparative view of the</hi> PRIMITIVE <hi>and</hi> PRESENT <hi>ſtate of the Society of</hi> FRIENDS, <hi>particularly addreſſed to the Youth. Written in</hi> ENGLAND <hi>by an Obſerver, and preſented to</hi> FRIENDS' <hi>Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>THY daughters, Fox, in former days</l>
            <l>When they deſerv'd, contemn'd all praiſe,</l>
            <l>But, with a ſelf-approving mind,</l>
            <l>No charms in human praiſe they find;</l>
            <l>Yet let my muſe their virtues trace,</l>
            <l>And dwell with joy on ev'ry grace:</l>
            <l>The lovely portrait hung on high,</l>
            <l>Perhap's may ſtrike ſome fair one's eye;</l>
            <l>Its charms ſhall touch the <hi>modern</hi> dame,</l>
            <l>And fluſh her cheek with conſcious ſhame.</l>
            <l>No coſtly robes, no broider'd hair,</l>
            <l>No ſilks adorn'd the modeſt fair:</l>
            <l>Diſtended hoops would ſhock the eye—</l>
            <l>A naked breaſt would terrify!</l>
            <l>They held that wanton, gay attire,</l>
            <l>Was fuel for laſcivious fire,</l>
            <l>And valu'd more St. Paul's advice,</l>
            <l>Which bade them ſeek the <hi>pearl of price.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And why ſhould dreſs, our parent's ſhame,</l>
            <l>Their daughters breaſts with pride inflame?</l>
            <l>But tho' in ſimple robes array'd,</l>
            <l>Behold what beauties grace the maid.</l>
            <l>Upon her lip ſits ſacred truth,</l>
            <l>Temp'rance gives the bloom of youth;</l>

Within her breaſt dwells tranquil peace,</l>
            <l>With modeſt bluſhes in her face;</l>
            <l>Love ſparkles in her dove-like eyes,</l>
            <l>For innocence needs no diſguiſe,</l>
            <l>But prudence, on her brow enthron'd,</l>
            <l>Commands reſpect from all around.</l>
            <l>Fair Chaſtity her ſoul inſpires,</l>
            <l>And Charity's immortal fires;</l>
            <l>Virtue within her ſpotleſs mind</l>
            <l>Sits like a DEITY enſhrin'd.</l>
            <l>No vain romance, or wanton play,</l>
            <l>Could waſte a moment of the day,</l>
            <l>But oft with deep, attentive thought,</l>
            <l>They read the book with wiſdom fraught.</l>
            <l>They could employ their vacant hours,</l>
            <l>Extracting health from herbs and flowers,</l>
            <l>Which freely on the waters caſt,</l>
            <l>They doubt not will return at laſt.</l>
            <l>But ſee them now in crowds repair,</l>
            <l>To dwell within the houſe of pray'r.</l>
            <l>Here no cold forms, no ſlaviſh rules,</l>
            <l>(So oft the ſacrifice of fools)</l>
            <l>Confine the ſpark of heavenly flame,</l>
            <l>That would aſcend from whence it came.</l>
            <l>Now every human care reſign'd,</l>
            <l>Deep ſilence fills th' adoring mind;</l>
            <l>Patient they wait th' inſpiring breath,</l>
            <l>Which bade them riſe from life to death;</l>
            <l>That flame celeſtial, which inſpires</l>
            <l>The ardent ſoul with ſtrong deſires.</l>
            <l>But vain my efforts to deſcribe</l>

In their deſcendants can we trace</l>
            <l>Such virtues, ſanctity and grace?</l>
            <l>Ye fair apoſtates! who ſo long</l>
            <l>Have learn'd the Babyloniſh ſong,</l>
            <l>When e'er you turn the ſacred page,</l>
            <l>Let Dinah's fate your thoughts engage;</l>
            <l>None did aſſault the ſpotleſs maid,</l>
            <l>Whilſt in the Patriarch's tent ſhe ſtaid,</l>
            <l>But when ſhe quits the ſacred fence,</l>
            <l>She loſes fame and innocence:</l>
            <l>So you, while by ſage rules confin'd,</l>
            <l>Rules which by wiſdom were deſign'd,</l>
            <l>You ſhine as ſtars, with heavenly fire,</l>

            <l>But when beyond theſe bounds you ſtray,</l>

            <l>Beware, fair Nymphs! on glaſs you ſtand,</l>
            <l>And Hamor's ſons are near at hand.</l>
            <l>Why is the boſom open laid—</l>
            <l>Or veil'd beneath a cob-web ſhade?</l>
            <l>Why doth the wanton eye impart</l>
            <l>Its fire into another's heart?</l>
            <l>Are hoops, ye fair backſliders! ſay,</l>
            <l>Fit for the <hi>broad</hi> or <hi>narrow</hi> way?</l>

            <l>Will time's relentleſs weapon ſpare</l>
            <l>The faultleſs ſhape, or braided hair?</l>
            <l>In vain, my ſiſters, you conceal</l>

            <l>Fair decency, with ſolemn grace,</l>

And chief of theſe MARIA thou—</l>
            <l>Ye giddy fair in homage bow</l>
            <l>To that chaſte name, or let it fire</l>
            <l>Your frozen breaſts with ſtrong deſire;</l>
            <l>Your thoughts and hearts let it enflame,</l>
            <l>To imitate the matchleſs dame;</l>
            <l>But thou, MARIA, ſhalt engage</l>
            <l>The labors of a loftier page:</l>
            <l>Ill would keen ſatire's muſe agree</l>
            <l>With meek-ey'd Charity and thee.</l>
            <l>But you, ye modern dames, attend,</l>
            <l>Regard the counſels of a friend,</l>
            <l>And all religion's claim apart,</l>
            <l>If man's eſteem can touch your heart:</l>
            <l>If from the Gentiles you expect</l>
            <l>The tribute of ſincere reſpect,</l>
            <l>Would you from Eſau's lineage prove</l>
            <l>Sincere and undiſſembled love;</l>
            <l>If this you ſeek, alike renounce</l>
            <l>The hoop, the ruffle, and the flounce;</l>
            <l>A little lower ſet the hair,</l>
            <l>Forbid the practic'd eye to ſtare,</l>
            <l>And lay the ſweeping train aſide,</l>
            <l>With all the gaudy plumes of pride,</l>
            <l>Which but too much would tire the muſe,</l>
            <l>Should ſhe the copious ſubject chooſe.</l>
            <l>Your native dignity reſume,</l>
            <l>Shun the rich labors of the loom;</l>
            <l>Condemn the unavailing art</l>
            <l>Which ſtrikes the eye, but not the heart.</l>
            <l>Do this my friends, but ſtop not here,</l>
            <l>Something remains well worth your care.</l>

Methinks beam but a feeble ray;</l>
            <l>Its native luſtre is obſcur'd</l>
            <l>In the dark cells of ſin immur'd;</l>
            <l>I ſee the clouds around it ſpread,</l>
            <l>Dark ignorance here rears her head:</l>
            <l>Unbluſhing confidence is here,</l>
            <l>Preſumption, pride, and fooliſh fear.</l>
            <l>Here folly's bolt at random flies;</l>
            <l>Pride, eagle-wing'd, attempts the ſkies;</l>
            <l>And love I ſee, but not that love</l>
            <l>Which boaſts a ſanction from above.</l>
            <l>Say, is your monitor too bold,</l>
            <l>Who deems it is the love of gold?</l>
            <l>I ſee—But hold, preſumptuous muſe!</l>
            <l>A ſubject leſs offenſive chooſe;</l>
            <l>No more unveil the female breaſt,</l>
            <l>Let thy fair pupils find the reſt;</l>
            <l>But rather, if thou canſt, diſplay</l>
            <l>A light to guide them on their way:</l>
            <l>It's own'd by all the friendly band</l>
            <l>A guide, unerring, is at hand;</l>
            <l>A ray divine, whoſe ſov'reign light</l>
            <l>Can pierce the thickeſt ſhades of night;</l>
            <l>A potent friend, forever near,</l>
            <l>A "ſtill ſmall voice," which all can hear.</l>
            <l>And oh! ye fair, in vain would I</l>
            <l>The great, the ſolemn truth deny.</l>
            <l>There is indeed a pow'r within,</l>
            <l>That can both ſhow, and ſhield from ſin;</l>
            <l>Its gentle dictates, if obey'd,</l>
            <l>Will to the paths of ſafety lead:</l>
            <l>And ſure its aid is wanting here,</l>
            <l>Oh! learn in time, prudential fair;</l>

Let folly at a diſtance play;</l>
            <l>To ſhun temptation is the way.</l>
            <l>Truſt not too far in human ſtrength,</l>
            <l>The ſtrongeſt may be foil'd at length.</l>
            <l>The moth around the candle plays,</l>
            <l>'Till drawn by its attracting blaze</l>
            <l>Still near and nearer to the beam,</l>
            <l>It ſinks in the devouring flame.</l>
            <l>An empty name no longer boaſt—</l>
            <l>For ah! you bear that name at moſt:</l>
            <l>Up to your high profeſſion ſtand,</l>
            <l>Or join the "daughters of the land."</l>
            <l>If as you are, you will remain,</l>
            <l>If ſatire is employ'd in vain,</l>
            <l>At leaſt forgive the friendly care</l>
            <l>That tells you truly what you are.</l>
            <l>A cake unturn'd is Ephraim now,</l>
            <l>You in the houſe of Rimmon bow;</l>
            <l>And ſome—I ſpeak with grief and ſhame,</l>
            <l>Some that were waſh'd in Jordan's ſtream.</l>
            <l>To Idol Gods ſhall Iſrael bow?</l>
            <l>Like Laodicea, lukewarm grow?</l>
            <l>And maids of Judah ſacrifice,</l>
            <l>With hearts impure, and wanton eyes?</l>
            <l>To things forbidden, Saul aſpire?</l>
            <l>And Korah light unhallowed fire?</l>
            <l>The Ark is taken!—Paleſtine</l>
            <l>Exulting cries, "the day is mine!"</l>
