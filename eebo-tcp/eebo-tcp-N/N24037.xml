            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>TO promote this lovely ſentiment, and to provide its richeſt bleſſings, men in all ages, have formed various aſſociations. Among theſe, is the <hi>Order of Free Maſons,</hi> which we this day honor by our public ſolemnities, and by the conſecration of a Lodge, and its Officers, agreeably to this benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>THOUGH Maſonry, in its priciples, be venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the moſt antient traditions, yet its form muſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031798_0005_0FEE72313141F858"/>have been improved, by the progreſs of the human underſtanding. It roſe not a perfect building: It combined its grand proportions, as the arts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards perfection. It had a new aera, at the building of the T'emple, and muſt have ſeen new glory in the ages of chriſtianity, when Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian triumphed over Gothic ſtructures. From our preſent improvement, it becomes a pertinent enquiry, how our inſtitution received its laſt forms from the light which ſhone upon Europe. It has been pretended, that it was aided by the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſades, when Europe engaged in deſtructive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, formed an object for its ambition in religious enthuſiaſm. Such enthuſiaſts from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nations might require ſome aſſociating prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and originate ſome band of union. But this principle would be as far from ſcience, as was the deſign of their adventures. It would ſpring out of their enthuſiaſm, and bear the ſtrongeſt marks of a deſign to aſſiſt the cauſe in which they engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It would be as public as their deſign, and as memorable as its conſequences. They would think, not of Architecture, but of the March and the Camp; not of Geometry, but of the Croſs. But the red Croſs in the Banner is unknown to us, and our ſignal is not for victory. The age of chivalry has no better claim. It is unknown in our emblems, and prevailed in a country, we have
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031798_0006_0FEE7234064A3EA8"/>leaſt viſited. Our laſt hiſtory has nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with Grecian myſteries, or common with the Myſtics. Though allied to the antient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the north, it attended not in ſilence upon the circles of the Druids, where the ſcience of the ſquare never appeared. We look elſewhere for its preſent form. And we follow with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſteps, its progreſs from the eaſt. The old Chronicles atteſt, that early aſſociations exiſted in the northern regions, and that theſe fraternities, of which the nobility <note n="*" place="bottom">Mallet.</note> were members, long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their primitive form. Upon the reception of chriſtianity, they welcomed the doctrines and arts, which accompanied it. Their ſilence, their elections, their members, their monumental ſtones, concur to explain our progreſs. The conciſe Tacitus will give us many lines for compariſon. Even in Iceland, we ſee the five magiſtrates, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary meetings, the members, who were freemen, the aſſemblies at the ſolſtices, the pure manners, the ſubmiſſion, the ſongs, and the fund for the diſtreſſed, even before the uſe of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten laws. Part of the pay was feaſting, <note n="†" place="bottom">Tacitus.</note> and at theſe feaſts, their obligations were renewed. In the northern regions theſe Lodges are yet to be ſeen, and the monumental columns, and <note n="‡" place="bottom">Cordiner's Scenery of the North, 1780.</note> Torfeus will
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031798_0007_0FEE723800213400"/>inform us of the firſt artiſt, and of the contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe, to which we are indebted for the noble ſtructures of the tenth century. To be known abroad the Chriſtian Architects encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged our inſtitution. The Keledci, or Emiſſaries of the ſacred colleges employed it, as concurring with the beſt manners of their converts. The Runie character is ſtill imitated upon our records, as the firſt introduced into that part of Europe, from which we deſcended. Chriſtian have unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with antient emblems, that we might honor the beſt inſtitutions and partake of them, while we forget not our origin, or our antiquity, Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to light is Chriſtian, but our fellowſhip is more antient. The Lodge is finely ſituate on the ſhore, while the retreating tide tells the Brother <note n="*" place="bottom">

The Acacia is oppoſed to the Miſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe, and the body of Balder is not forgotten. The paintings ſhewn to the apprentice are of the original kind. The higher grades have been conjoined with leſſons from the ſchools of Greece, and more modern inventions. Each image is ſimple in the firſt order, and the progreſs is ſeen as we riſe. Hence we find as the antient order travelled ſouthward in Britain, after the conqueſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031798_0008_0FEE72398894CED0"/>of the Danes, that the York Lodge claims high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt antiquity, and united the ſimplicity of the north, with the gay freedom of a more ſouthern ſky. Builders then came from all nations, and this ſtately Fabric on its firſt foundations ſtands firm and glorious.</p>
                  <p>LET us examine this ſpacious habitation. A Lodge is not the abode of one ſolitary family. It bars not its doors in the ſtorm, and dreads not to give the aſſiſtance of the night. It has its build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings erected on the moſt deſert path of life, and they ſtand open to receive every fatigued and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nightened Brother. It is one, becauſe one ſoul inhabits all its regions. A Brother is at home wherever a Brother dwells. We have ſeen the worthy; who have had many an honor, come and expire calmly in our arms. We dropped the Acacia into the tomb, and have ſeen them ſlumber in peace. We have given the kind ſalutation to the hoſtile ſons of Afric's once delightful ſhore. They have eaten of our bread, and have taſted of our wine, with which they have been refreſhed. We have ſeen Brethren retreating from the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of blood, partaking of our joys. Theſe kind offices have extended our thoughts to generous love. We have ſearched for, and we have found, from different nations, the ſame friends of mankind.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031798_0009_0FEE723B12AAABD8"/>How uſeful would be a true hiſtory of Maſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! The Saints have their Books of Martyrs. The gay world, their novels for amuſement. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have their hiſtory. Might not Maſonry, through the State find a ſubject worthy of the friend of mankind? To ſee the hoſpitable lodges diſtrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted around the enlightened world, and to travel in one evening of meditation through all the Lodges on the globe. We truſt that our riſing order will not long be deprived of this invaluable pleaſure. To adorn a quiet ſeat may be our delight; but to enter with the ſentiment, that we belong to the world of friendſhip and life, muſt give the higheſt glory to the character of man.</p>
                  <p>THEN ſhall we aſſemble the hoſpitable virtues from all nations. The eaſtern traveller ſhall tell his tale, enlivened by fancy and by hope, to awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en every kind attachment, and to command in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and cheerful relief to ſorrow. The ready oil, not leſs pure than the Samaritan's, ſhall be poured by the injected thought of kindneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one fear to check it as it freely flows. Then, as in the hardy north, the good man ſhall feaſt at his open door, and invite each longing appetite to come and be ſatisfied. Then ſhall the kind peaſant riſe to ſurvey the dangers of the path and the mountain, while the inhabitant of the ſhore

Sweet confidence ſhall then dwell in the breaſt of man, and cheerfulneſs diſcover, how he repoſes on the lap of friendſhip. Who can forget the importunity of old Abraham with the ſtranger! What has civil life done to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the pleaſure of this invitation! In theſe forms ſhall we learn to love. They diſplay the lovely attractions of ſimplicity, native innocence, and ready ſympathy, the pureſt virtues of the heart.</p>
                  <p>WHAT will then be our enquiries? Who knocks now at the Lodge? Who has been wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed and bleſſed? What cares diſturb a weary Brother, and whence can he have relief? Where does his light ſhine, and is it bright? Are his ſeet ready at the door for offices of love? Does he come hand in hand with the brethren? Is his heart free to conceive, and his hand ready to beſtow? How many days in each month has he recorded on his heart the kindneſs done to a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to renew it? In how many nights has he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en light to the path of a ſtranger? Can he ſay to a Brother, Let me ſee thy countenance, and let me hear thy voice; for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance delights me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:031798_0011_0FEE7241EB5AEC38"/>
BUT when is the heart of man moſt open? It is then, we will embrace and enjoy him.</p>
                  <p>AND are we not all agreed, that man is only ſeen in his friendly diſpoſitions, when the ſoul is cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Then all the cauſes, which concur to ſhut the heart, are leaſt felt. Cheerfulneſs is required in every ſtate of innocence and love. The teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of mankind is ready. How abundant are examples in the ſcriptures of all antiquity. How emblematical the wine, which cheers the heart, and how ſtrong the pictures of a Mahomedan, and of every heaven! Cheerfulneſs was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached in Jeſus, but beloved by him, becauſe it may correct every vice, and corrupts no principle of virtue. See it, when it accompanies life's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. It is the ſame health of the mind as a good organization is of the body. Then the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding dwells in a clear ſky, and the affections, like the pure ſtreams of life, have a divine light to invigorate them. Not all the wiſdom of man, not all the motives of his happineſs can exalt him like the heart thus free to enjoy the affections brought pure into his ſoul. The man, cheerful at his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, never forſakes it. Cheerful in his domeſtic affections, he never wanders from his home. All nature ſpreads her charms before him. Do you ſee the intemperate man. He is flying from the cares
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031798_0012_0FEE7244C1F042F8"/>and duties of his life. He is not in love with himſelf and the world. Does he ſhun domeſtic life, his ſoul is not in peace. Does he ſolicit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion for his thoughts, ſerene pleaſure will never bring him virtue and happineſs. Take the good apprentice, and it is the cheerful youth, ready for every duty of his calling. Take the good huſband, and his heart is clear as the light, and cheerful as the day. The countenance of the good citizen warms wherever it ſhines. The public ſpirited man is cheerful when bleſſings multiply around him.</p>
                  <p>BUT cheerfulneſs is not ſpontaneous in the heart; elſe why ſhould ſo many gloomy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, never cleared, offer to our ſight? Why ſo many imaginary cares, to produce endleſs diſquiets, and to conjure miſery from the dead? Why is man ſo eaſily diſturbed?</p>
                  <p>WE muſt then plant and cultivate the virtue, where the pureſt ſympathies may nouriſh it; where the ſun of benevolence may daily cheer it, and where generous ſpirits may refreſh it. Then it will gather ſtrength in habit, and ſtand firm againſt every blaſt by its own power.</p>
                  <p>IN MASONRY, we cultivate this virtue in the beſt manner, by removing from every thing which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031798_0013_0FEE724785015388"/>confines the heart. Do competitions in life raiſe the angry ſtorm;—here the breezes refreſh from general and diffuſive hope. Does the ſad counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance alarm by ſympathy;—here it flies, like the white cloud above us, waſting in aether. Do reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fears ſtraighten the breaſt, and heave a ſigh, as in the dull air of a miſty morning;—here the ſun riſes, ſoon to ſcatter them, and all the air is in love. Do angry paſſions hang, like the ſtorm, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart of man;—here they are driven away by the breath of charity. Do parties thunder like the meeting clouds, and waſte their lightning on the guiltleſs;—here is the ſerene air, and the bright horizon of peace. Do fears, like the gale, riſe adverſe to our hopes;—ſoon we quit our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and take the gale free in the ocean of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. Does diſturbed joy, like the guſt, for a moment defy our ſkill;—we ſoon reach the winds which bend their conſtant ſummer courſe towards the regions where are balſamic flowers, rich ſpices, and the land of plenty.</p>
                  <p>COME Cheerfulneſs, and find a ſeat with us. The tales of Aſia, and the borrowed romance of Europe, know thee not ſo well as we. No, not the man of nature, hovering over a winter's fire, to tell his gay loves, and to forget the ſtorm in friendſhip and in glee. We will make thee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031798_0014_0FEE724B86718558"/>We will open our hearts to thee. We fly not our cares. We only ſeat ourſelves here, to return with greater delight. We meet from every circle of active life, in one grand circle of love. But it is, to carry home the rich proviſion with which thou canſt fill us, till we meet again. We leave the world behind not to hate it, but to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble all thy bleſſings into our boſoms, and to go abroad and ſcatter them. The friend of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt love ſhall confeſs, that we tranſplant all thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be enriched in her boſom. Cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, come and ſit with us. Here is love waiting to be cheered by thee. Here all the graces ſhall attend thee. Joy ſhall enkindle at thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and laughter be ready at thy call. Social glee ſhall ſport without guilt, and inſtruction ſteal with kind inſinuation into every heart. Charity ſhall tell her deeds to learn to multiply them, and Sympathy ſhall repeat them, mirth ſhall be gay, and the ſong ſhall enrapture the ear, while the thought on which it lives goes welcome to the heart, to dwell there forever. Where canſt thou find better friends? Where canſt thou inſpire purer joys? Enchanted, we will hold thee, and never ſeparate from thee. Whither thou goeſt, we will go. Thou mayſt viſit other friends, but here ſhall be thy habitation.</p>
                  <p>

LET us now enquire, how the MASON is prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the greateſt virtue of the heart, and the exalted duties of an enlightened underſtanding. Should he not diſcover his qualifications for the higheſt character, let him renounce the honor of his name. We expect that he will be among the MOST GENEROUS OF MEN,—among the moſt EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGHTENED IN SOCIETY,—and among the moſt CHARITABLE IN RELIGION. This is the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he claims, and this, it is his ambition to deſerve. To become the moſt generous of men, when a Maſon leaves his Lodge, he reflects—I have pledged my love, and promiſed every kind ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to my brethren of every name. How ſhall I perform my obligation? Can I have a juſt expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that my virtues will be more pure, becauſe I have breathed a freer air than belongs to the crowded habitations of men? Can I then at once return to the contagion of impure regions, and will the paſt draught then nouriſh me? Shall not my every thought in life be free as in the Lodge, and corrupt by no vile affection? It is not a ſhort viſit to the happieſt clime, which enables us fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to inhale the beſt ſweets of life. It is the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in theſe purer ſkies. Each duty then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its fragrance, and the ſtrength is recruited at every hour. A Maſon may change his place, but not his heart. He lives in love, and when he
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031798_0016_0FEE724FE291DE68"/>dies, love fits on his lips, and ſpeaks the laſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>In ſociety the Maſon maintains his dignity. He has ſeen competition loſt, in kind diſcourſe and mutual endearment. He has often ſeen the gay freedom of one nation, enliven the ſedate and penſive countenance of another. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of one nation has yielded to the inſinuating manners of another. The buſineſs of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and the induſtry of the huſbandman have not made them inſenſible to the good humor of the gay. The profeſſed friends of ſcience have not forgotten to mingle with mankind. And having like ſo many ſtreams united, they have more bountifully ſupplied life, with wiſdom and happineſs. He has ſeen man, as he is, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of all his fondeſt habits, his deareſt ſelf, and when ſeparated from the partial views of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt. And the character of man is ſo much the ſame, that he is ſure of the true image of the family, and that one nature belongs to them. He lives then as under common wants, and as capable of relief from the ſame virtues. All may have the countenance of love, and he ſtudies to bring the kindeſt glances upon himſelf. He aſks only what he is ready to give, and if refuſed, refuſes not again. Noble life this! Here we fill
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031798_0017_0FEE7252A539F7E0"/>our cup of bleſſedneſs. It inſpires by the freeſt draught, and by its fullneſs, we are made divine.</p>
                  <p>BUT what rites conſecrate this interwiew of the bleſſed? The prieſt looks for his mitre in vain. The altar is a pure heart, and the wiſe man is a friend. The Mahomedan has left his robes, and enters in peace, and the Chriſtian diſplays not his croſs. Religion is reverenced in ſilence, and man appears in the virtues of the heart, beloved for the poſſeſſion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ergion, as his greateſt good, and moſt ample recommendation. Virtue takes its value not from names, or the opinions with which it is aſſociated, but from the bleſſings it brings. The greateſt offering is ſocial duty, and the richeſt poſſeſſion is love. Thus free, how happy is man. With himſelf to chooſe; but with the world to love goodneſs, wherever it can be found.</p>
                  <p>BUT we are to remember that we are friends of an inſtitution, and that we are to commend it not only as pure in its principles, but as ſupported by peculiar duties, which we owe to it.</p>
                  <p>TO enter a Lodge does not make a man a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, more than to enter a Church makes him a Saint. He has his duties there, ſacred as his happineſs, and perpetual as his hopes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="unknown:031798_0018_0FEE725573BEDF38"/>
IT is then apparent, that every man cannot be a fit ſubject of its honors. A ſlave to prejudice, he cannot be enlightened by truth: Unable to ſeparate the ſocial character from the religious opinion, he is not capable of philanthropy: Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of an ingenuous mind in private life, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exerciſe a rational and univerſal benevolence.</p>
                  <p>IT is evident, that a Brother owes alſo his full concurrence in the liberal purpoſes of his Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. By a conſtant attention he gives his perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al virtues to the Lodge. Abſent, he withdraws his beſt influence from the inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>A Brother alſo cannot be loſt in a circle of private friends. We might as well ſit near our fires, and detail ſtories about London and Paris, and call ourſelves merchants of thoſe cities, as to have no correſpondence with the great world of Maſons in our Grand Lodges.</p>
                  <p>A Brother cannot forget the importance of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, and the judgment to be employed in them. The Officers are the ſoul of the Lodge, and they impart their own character to it. If they are active, conſtant and charitable, the Lodge will imitate them. If they fail of their duty, the beſt hopes are loſt. They will therefore be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031798_0019_0FEE72598563CE78"/>by the greateſt reſpect. Good Officers will create this reſpect, but worthy members may eſtabliſh it. Doubtleſs in attention to appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the world, we may covet to ſee men in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, who have correſponding offices in civil life. This is a great advantage, but no love of rank ſhould incur any hazard of the neglect of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any appointment. This would be a pride fatal to our Lodge, and contemptible in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aſſociations. To be fine abroad, and poor at home, has not even decency to recommend it. It is uſeful to remember the danger, and never to forget, That the beſt Maſter ſhould be always the beſt Maſon.</p>
                  <p>A Brother ſhould conſider alſo, how much his perſonal virtues aſſiſt an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> order to which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. The public honors come with double pleaſure to us, when we are told, that he who has deſerved them, is a Brother. And the great Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of the Lodges of Maſſachuſetts is recollected with this pleaſure. When we behold the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ument, which ſtands high upon his grave near their Capital, we remember that it is ſacred to a Maſon. The friends of WASHINGTON know him in this character. An enthuſiaſm to give our order ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from our perſonal character, is the moſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous we can entertain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:031798_0020_0FEE725B0F706C50"/>
A TRUE Brother will alſo be attentive to the endearments of life, and be the greateſt friend to the companion of man. The ſympathy of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is the bliſs of man. But though equal in her rights, ſhe depends on the generous goodneſs of man, for her beſt hopes. She depends on man, for the opinion, which gives laws to her condition, and for the power to render them ſacred. It is with him to enlarge her education, that ſhe may know her worth, and be able to preſerve it. She repays by her ſympathy, but ſhe receives from generous virtue. Always the friend of man, ſhe is his ſlave, his domeſtic ſervant, or his boſom friend, at his own diſcretion. By exalting her, he exalts himſelf. The kinder forms of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the moſt noble thoughts of Love belong to the protection of our Order, in its beſt deſigns to advance human happineſs. A greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach cannot fall upon a Maſon, than that he is a ſtranger to domeſtic peace. It is not a want of confidence that has kept our ſiſters from our aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, but the eſtabliſhed order of Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The enlightened Brother knows, that if his mind can comprehend his exalted duty, it muſt be the tenderneſs of female ſympathy which muſt qualify him to receive it.</p>
                  <p>A TRUE Brother will always venerate age. He ſuffers it to lean upon his ſhoulder. He covers its
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031798_0021_0FEE725C9B448F70"/>infirmities, and aſſiſts to remove its cares. It is his glory to enrich age with bleſſings, to provide its conſolations, and to fill it with hope. Its occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional wants he may not always diſcover, but its natural wants he cannot forget.</p>
                  <p>A Brother will not be an idle ſpectator of the world. We live in an age of revolutions. Our inſtitution requires no revolution; but admits our warmeſt friendſhip. While every inſtitution profeſſes to collect new force, it is in our power to riſe with glory. Our principles are juſt, and are eternal. They regard the higheſt virtues of enlightened ſociety; but they exiſt in minds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly developing. Their truth is eternal; but may be more clear. They may enjoy a brighter ſky. The wiſdom of each generation may be like the mildneſs of our climate, the more viſible, the longer it is inhabited. May it not then be ſaid, that it muſt afford us the greateſt pleaſure, as Brethren, in having contributed to the honor of the Craft, by perſonal merit, and the reputation of our Lodge.</p>
                  <p>A YEAR had not clapſed, after Maſonry had been welcomed to New England, before New Hampſhire was bleſſed with its light. So congen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id in its character with Maſſachuſetts, and emulous
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031798_0022_0FEE7260B1B31178"/>of all its advantages, this State concurred in the deſign of giving ſupport to Maſonry. The bands of union have ever been firm between theſe States, and on theſe ſolemnities, we truſt that we ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to perpetuate the friendſhip. Happy indeed are we to ſee, beyond any former example in our own country, the two Grand Lodges united in this purpoſe, and concurring in the conſecration of Lodges in their reſpective juriſdictions.</p>
                  <p>AS they began together, may they continue united in the common cauſe. Thus the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Brethren pervades the whole Fraternity. Viſits to the Lodges, and the preſence of Lodges with each other at celebrations, are now proved to be in the ſpirit of the inſtitution. May this union of our Grand Lodges be one of the happy events which ſhall prepare for a repreſentation of the order through the world.</p>
                  <p>FROM the undiſſembled joy, good order, and harmony of the Brethren, we may congratulate our Brethren of the Lodge this day conſecrated, upon their opening proſpects.</p>
                  <p>To our brother elected as Maſter of this Lodge we may give our friendly ſalutation. It is the higheſt glory of God to be loved, by thoſe whom he protects. We love him, becauſe he firſt loved
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031798_0023_0FEE726380C1D130"/>us. A faithful Maſter will have our affections, and in them has the higheſt honors we can render him.</p>
                  <p>YE Watchmen, who guard our Temple, we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you. Perpetual are the bleſſings of the Sun, whether he ſhine in the weſt or the ſouth. He declines, but he turns a full orb of light to the world. He ſets to riſe again with his wonted vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. We know his courſe, and are ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>YE attendant Lights, we bleſs you. If ye ſerve not as miniſters at every hour, your order makes nature perfect.</p>
                  <p>HEAVEN has its records and its treaſure. The pure mind keeps the firſt, but the eldeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keeps the laſt. He was tried, and found faithful. May the ſame benevolence and fidelity poſſeſs the heart of him who keeps your depoſit.</p>
                  <p>BRETHREN,</p>
                  <p>WE ſincerely rejoice with you on the preſent occaſion. The duty and the dignity of our order has been our theme. Your virtues can outſpeak deſcription, and by becoming what ye ought to be, ye will prove to the world, that TRUE MASONS ARE THE MOST ENLIGHTENED, AND THE MOST BENEVOLENT OF MEN.</p>

For myſelf, I ſhall make no apology, leſt I ſhould ſhare the fate of moſt apologizers on ſimilar occaſions, that is, of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031798_0026_0FEE726D1DC809E8"/>having my ſincerity queſtioned, inſtead of engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the candor of my audience.</p>
                  <p>OUR Society claim the honor of being ancient as any among men; and of being extended as far as the civilized world: and we glory in the thought, that no Lodge of Maſons was ever juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chargeable with attempting to raiſe diſturbances in church or ſtate.</p>
                  <p>INFLUENCED by principles of benevolence, we wiſh a decreaſe of miſery, and an increaſe of happineſs to all mankind; not confining our views to particular friends, nations or countries, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our good will to all nations, countries and languages. We wiſh to ſee peace on earth, while we feel good will to all men.</p>
                  <p>THE Lodge now conſtituted in this public manner is diſtinguiſhed by the name of THE BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEVOLENT LODGE: and the grand principle of Maſons is <hi>brotherly love;</hi> and every practice incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent herewith, is abhorrent to their feelings, while thoſe which are calculated to increaſe the general felicity are congenial with their moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wiſhes.</p>

THE Fraternity of Free and Accepted Maſons preſent, of whatever rank, will permit me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate them on this auſpicious day, and unite with them in ſupplicating that no miſconduct of the <hi>Benevolent Lodge</hi> may ever caſt a gloom upon it. Our country affords an ample field of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to ſpeculative minds. But a few cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies paſt, it was wholly inhabited by ſavage beaſts, or more ſavage men. Now, millions of civilized men are ſpread over it. Our anceſtors, often in danger of being deſtroyed in their youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate, were as often, almoſt, miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; till they arrived at mature age; when they were obliged to vindicate their rights, with the ſword and bayonet, againſt the parent ſtate. But thanks to that kind providence, without the notice of which not a <hi>ſparrow</hi> falls to the ground, and by which the <hi>hairs</hi> of our heads are all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered; they ſupported a dangerous war; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an honorable peace; eſtabliſhed their rights on a firm baſis; and we may now <hi>ſit every one under his own vine and figtree and have none to make us afraid.</hi> Happy we may be if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our own intereſts, and have virtue enough to purſue them.</p>
                  <p>WE have now a right to claim rank among the nations of the world. We enjoy proſperity
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031798_0028_0FEE727186C0D9F0"/>which few others know; and if we are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ourſelves, may continue a happy people. For theſe favors we ought to acknowledge with gratitude that providence which extends through creation; that providence which improved our illuſtrious Brother WASHINGTON in conducting the war; and ſince that, at the head of our civil government: In both which he has eſtabliſhed a reputation which does honor to our Craft, to his country, to human nature; and which cannot be fullied by the tongues of ſlander, nor exalted by the pens of panegyriſts.</p>
                  <p>EVENTS that are future are in a great degree hidden from our knowledge; but it requires no ſpirit of prophecy to determine that within a century or two more, this country will be populous as moſt of the countries in Europe; and if not equal in wealth, vet before them in the means of real happineſs.</p>
                  <p>IN this State, we have a ſtriking diſplay of the increaſe of population. But little more than half a century ſince, to wit, at the time of the ſettlement of the Rev. Mr WILKINS, lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceaſed; this town did not contain twenty fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies: and to the north, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:031798_0029_0FEE7178305853D8"/>Rivers, to the ſettlements in Canada; except a few on the banks of thoſe Rivers. There are now, perhaps, an hundred towns, containing from forty or fifty to an hundred and fifty or two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred families, and the means, not barely of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, but of enjoyment, bear proportion to the rapid increaſe of inhabitants. What was, within the memory of many now living, a howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wilderneſs, is turned to fruitful fields;— what was a frightful deſert, now bloſſoms as the roſe. And doubtleſs in other States more ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, and where there are more inviting advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, population and improvement on lands have made a proportionable progreſs. Well may our country rejoice in the rapidity of her population and improvement, if not too rapid. Well may we of the Maſonic Fraternity felicitate ourſelves on the proſpects before us; and though we urge none to join our ſociety, we may be allowed to hope that the principles of it will be diffuſed in proportion to the population of our country, and may reſt aſſured that they will be in proportion to the degrees of light and knowledge that are attained by our fellow citizens, whether they join our ſociety or not. Our fervent prayer is, that brotherly love may be univerſally diffuſed, and the happineſs it is calculated to produce, as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally enjoyed. And to my Brethren of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031798_0030_0FEE727876A51320"/>Fraternity, I may ſay, that we ſhall beſt contribute to this happy purpoſe, by conducting agreeable to our principles and obligations; to excite us to which, we ſhould conſider, that many eyes are upon us beſide the all-ſeeing one; that we are as a city ſet on a hill, and under indiſpenſable obligations ſo to order our converſation, at all times, that thoſe who wiſh to find occaſion to ſpeak evil of us, may be aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>THIS aſſembly in general will permit me to aſk them their motives, in coming together at this time. Was it a wiſh to profit by the public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the day? If it was, you will not looſe your time, if you rightly improve the advice you have had from our worthy monitor of the day; and if you will not do this, you muſt charge your loſs of time to your own negligence, and not to the occaſion;—Or was it mere curioſity which brought you together? If it was, we wiſh you may be as fortunate as Zaccheus of old, who, from the ſame motive, climb a tree to ſee our common lord.</p>
                  <p>HERE, perhaps, ſome of you will inquire why, if our principles are ſo noble, and our intentions ſo benevolent, we do not lay open all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to the world, and not have any ſecrets in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031798_0031_0FEE727A045F9930"/>our meetings? In this we are not ſingular; Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Phyſicians, Merchants, and moſt Mechanics, have their ſecrets, which they will not diſcloſe to any but ſuch as merit them. But we have more to ſay: The ſecrets of our Craft cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to one who is not a Maſon. Should we attempt it, our words would be thought idle tales, and we ſhould not be believed;—that if a man wiſhes to learn the ſecrets of Free Maſonry, he muſt become a Maſon, as otherwiſe he can no more underſtand them than a natural man can diſcern thoſe things which are only ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>SOME of you, perhaps, have imbibed an idea, that we indulge too much in mirth for our ſober profeſſions: Of ſuch I would inquire, whether the chriſtian, who leads a gloomy, ſour, moroſe life, does more honor to his profeſſion than he who leads a cheerful one? We follow reaſon, which teaches us, that the man who is pleaſed with his maſter, and with his ſervice, and feels no guilt on his conſcience, has the beſt right to be merry, and will feel the greateſt inclination to it. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and gladneſs for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:031798_0032_0FEE727CC8779E28"/>
SOME very captious perſons may farther object to us, that we admit unworthy members. We ſubmit to the charge, and confeſs that we have not the means of ſearching hearts, but are liable to be impoſed on; but is not this the caſe with all other ſocieties? Do not chriſtians of every denomination, with the ſublimeſt precepts, and the brighteſt example ever given to man, err in the ſame way? When unworthy perſons creep in unawares to our ſociety, we wiſh they had not been admitted.</p>
                  <p>MY fair hearers, who honor us with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at this time, and add ſo much to the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy of the day, demand particular attention. Methinks I almoſt hear you inquire why you are not invited to partake of our pleaſures, and make a part of our ſocial meetings? It might be aſked in return, why you are not choſen govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, councillors, ſenators, &amp;c. but this will not ſatisfy you; I muſt therefore tell you an honeſt truth, which I almoſt bluſh to own, but of which you are our witneſſes; to wit, that in all feſtive meetings where your ſex and ours join, your charms engage ſo much of our attention, and the pleaſure of pleaſing you, ſo entirely engroſſes the time, that no ſerious buſineſs is attended to; and, as it would be more mortifying to you to be in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031798_0033_0FEE727F96499100"/>our company and not the principal objects of our attention; and our meetings are for ſerious buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though ſoftened and enlivened by mirth and hilarity; and we muſt either deny ourſelves the pleaſure of your company, or neglect our moſt important buſineſs: we prefer the former, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hard the taſk; and hope you will rather commend than cenſure us for ſometimes attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the calis of duty in preference to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of love: eſpecially if at other times you find us as faithful and affectionate huſbands, as ardent lovers, as kind parents, as dutiful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as truſty friends, and in all reſpects as good members of ſociety as other men; and we flatter ourſelves you will, on no other occaſions, find us behind your warmeſt admirers.</p>
                  <p>To this aſſembly, I beg leave to add;—wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we can anſwer to univerſal ſatisfaction all the objections that may be brought againſt us, or not; we are entitled to the ſame exerciſe of candor and charity which men in general have a right to expect from their fellow creatures, conſidering that the right of private judgment is unalienable, and as we have one common maſter in heaven, ſo to him we muſt, each one for himſelf, finally ſtand or fall. As we all acknowledge the ſame rule of faith, and that rule moſt ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031798_0034_0FEE72825ED2F208"/>that we love one another; let us, laying aſide all evil ſurmiſes, jealouſies, and ſuſpicions, endeavor to conduct towards each other on the preſent ſcene of action in ſuch a manner, that our own hearts may not reproach us while we live; and when this drams ſhall be cloſed; this world and all things in it be diſſolved, and even the ſolid works of Maſonry be involved in the common ruin; may we, through the mercy of the great Architect of the univerſe, and the merit of the Grand Maſter of the chriſtian church, be admitted to a ſeat in that MOUSE WHICH IS NOT MADE WITH MANDS, BUT WHOSE BUILDER AND MAKER IS GOD.</p>
