            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE abilities of LORD CHESTERFIELD to inculcate ſuch precepts as ſhould form the mind and faſhion the manners of youth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are too uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally admired to need encomium. In the ADVICE of that noble EARL to his SON, there are to be found ſuch judicious remarks on men, manners, and things, connected with ſo intimate a knowledge of the world, that the ſentiments, conſidered as maxims, form a very valuable ſyſtem of education.</p>
            <p>But as the obſervations of different writers on the ſame ſubject are mutually illuſtrative of each other; to render the following work ſtill more acceptable, the MARCHIONESS DE LAMBERT's "Advice to her Son," a tract particularly recommended by Lord CHESTERFIELD to HIS SON, is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>That nothing might be wanting to render the following work complete, the PRECEPTS of Lord BURLEIGH to his SON are added, as highly eſtima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble on the ſubjects of manners and education. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AN Abſent Man is generally either a very weak, or a very affected man; he is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a very diſagreeable man in company. He is defective in all the common offices of civility; he does not enter into the general converſation, but breaks into it from time to time, with ſome ſtarts of his own, as if he waked from a dream.

He may be in the beſt companies all his life-time (if they will admit him), and never become the wiſer: we may as well converſe with a deaf man, as an abſent one.

               <p>Indeed, without attention nothing is to be done: want of attention, which is really want of thought, is either folly or madneſs. You ſhould not only have attention to every thing, but a quickneſs of attention, ſo as to obſerve, at once, all the people in the room, their motions, their looks, and their words; and yet, without ſtaring at them, and ſeeming to be an obſerver. This quick and unobſerved obſervation is of infinite advantage in life, and is to be acquired with care; and, on the contrary, what is called abſence, which is a thoughtleſſneſs and want of attention about what is doing, makes a man ſo like either a fool or a madman, that, for my part, I ſee no real difference. A fool never has thought; a madman has loſt it; and an abſent man is, for the time, without it.</p>

                  </gap> they are unqueſtionable proofs of the regard and conſideration which we have for the perſons to whom we pay them. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Suppoſe you invited any body to dine or ſup with you, you ought to recollect if you had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that they had any favourite diſh, and take care to provide it for them: and when it came, you ſhould ſay,
<q>You ſeemed to me, at ſuch and ſuch a place, to give this diſh a preference, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ordered it.</q>
—This is the wine that I obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you liked, and therefore I procured ſome." Again: Moſt people have their weakneſſes; they have their averſions or their likings to ſuch or ſuch things. If we were to laugh at a man for his averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a cat or cheeſe (which are common antipathies) or, by inattention or negligence, to let them come in his way where we could prevent it; he would, in the firſt caſe, think himſelf inſulted, and in the ſecond, ſlighted; and would remember both. But, on the other hand, our care to procure for him what he likes, and to remove from him what he diſlikes, ſhews him that he is at leaſt an object of our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, flatters his vanity, and perhaps makes him more you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult your own breaſt, and recollect how theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle attentions, when ſhewn you by others, flatter that degree of ſelf-love and vanity from which no man living is free.

               <head>AWKWARDNESS OF DIFFERENT KINDS.</head>
               <p>MANY very worthy and ſenſible people have certain odd tricks, ill habits, and awkward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in their behaviour, which excite a diſguſt to, and diſlike of their perſons, that cannot be removed or overcome by any other valuable endowment or merit which they may poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>Now awkwardneſs can proceed but from two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When an awkward fellow firſt comes into a room, it is highly probale, that his ſword gets between his legs, and throws him down, or makes him ſtumble, at leaſt; when he has recovered th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

again. If he drinks tea or coffee, he certainly ſcalds his mouth, and lets either the cup or the ſacer fall, and ſpills the tea or coffee in his breeches. At dinner, his awkwardneſs diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes itſelf particularly, as he has more to do; there he holds his knife, fork, and ſpoon, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently from other people; eats with his knife to the great danger of his mouth, picks his teeth with his fork, and puts his ſpoon, which has been in his throat twenty times, into the diſhes again. If he is to carve, he can never hit the joint; but, in his vain efforts to cut through the bone, ſcatters the ſauce in every body's face. He generally daubs himſelf with ſoup and greaſe, though his napkin is commonly ſtuck through a button-hole, and tickles his chin. When he drinks, he infallibly coughs in his glaſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkles the company. Beſides all this, he has ſtrange tricks and geſtures; ſuch as ſnuffing up his noſe, making faces, putting his fingers in his noſe, or blowing it and looking afterwards in his handkerchief, ſo as to make the company ſick. His hands are troubleſome to him when he has not ſomething in them, and he does not known where to put them; but they are in perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between his boſom and his breeches: he does not wear his cloaths, and, in ſhort, does nothing like other people. All this, I own, is not in any degree criminal; but it is highly diſagreeable and ridiculous in company, and ought moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided by whoever deſires to pleaſe.</p>
               <p>From this account of what you ſhould not do, you may eaſily judge what you ſhould do; and, a due attention to the manners of people of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and who have ſeen the world, will make it habitual and familiar to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:025064_0015_0FCE48461508EB10"/>There is, likewiſe, an awkwardneſs of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and words moſt carefully to be avoided; ſuch as falſe Engliſh, bad pronunciation, old ſayings, and common proverbs; which are ſo many proofs of having kept bad and low com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. For example: If inſtead of ſaying, that
<q>taſtes are different, and that every man has his own peculiar one,</q>
you ſhould let off a proverb, and ſay, that
<q>what is one man's meat is another man's poiſon;</q>
or elſe,
<q>every one as they like, as the good man ſaid when he kiſſed his cow;</q>
every body would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that you had never kept company with any body above footmen and houſemaids.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe an awkwardneſs of the mind, that ought to be, and with care may be avoided; as, for inſtance, to miſtake or forget names. To ſpeak of Mr. What-d'ye-call Him, or Mrs. Thingum, or How-d'ye call Hear, is exceſſively awkward and ordinary. To call people by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper titles and appellations is ſo too; as, My Lord for Sir, and Sir for My Lord. To begin a ſtory or a narration when you are not perfect in it, and cannot go through with it, but are forced, poſſibly, to ſay in the middle of it,
<q>I have forgot the reſt,</q>
is very unpleaſant and bungling. One muſt be extremely exact, clear, and perſpicuous in every thing one ſays; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, inſtead of entertaining or informing others, one only tires and puzzles them.</p>

               <head>BASHFULNESS.</head>
               <p>BASHFULNESS is the diſtinguiſhed character of an Engliſh booby, who appears fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened out of his wits if people of faſhion ſpeak
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025064_0016_0FCE48486FCFE9F8"/>
to him, and bluſhes and ſtammers without being able to give a proper anſwer; by which means he becomes truly ridiculous, from the groundleſs fear of being laughed at.</p>
               <p>There is a very material difference between mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and an awkward baſhfulneſs, which is as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous as true modeſty is commendable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to be a ſimpleton as to be an impudent fellow; and we make ourſelves contemptible, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come into a room and ſpeak to people without being out of countenance, or without embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A man who is really diffident, timid, and baſhful, be his merit what it will, never can puſh himſelf in the world; his deſpondency throws him into inaction, and the forward, the buſtling, and the petulant, will always precede him. The manner makes the whole difference. What would be impudence in one man, is only a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and decent aſſurance in another. A man of ſenſe, and of knowledge of the world, will aſſert his own rights, and purſue his own objects, as ſteadily and intrepidly as the moſt impudent man living, and commonly more ſo; but then he has art enough to give an outward air of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty to all he does. This engages and prevails, whilſt the very ſame things ſhock and fail, from the over-bearing or impudent manner only of doing them.</p>
               <p>Engliſhmen, in general, are aſhamed of going into company. When we avoid ſingularity, what ſhould we be aſhamed of? And why ſhould not we go into a mixed company with as much eaſe, and as little concern, as we would go into our own room? Vice and ignorance are the only things we ought to be aſhamed of: while we keep clear of them, we may venture any where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

fear or concern. Nothing ſinks a young man into low company ſo ſurely as baſhfulneſs. If he thinks that he ſhall not, he moſt ſurely will not pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Some, indeed, from feeling the pain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of baſhfulneſs, have ruſhed into the other extreme, and turned impudent; as cowards ſometimes grow deſperate from exceſs of danger: but this is equally to be avoided, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The medium between theſe two extremes points out the well-bred man, who always feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf firm and eaſy in all companies; who is modeſt without being baſhful, and ſteady without being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.</p>
               <p>A mean fellow is aſhamed and embarraſſed when he comes into company, is diſconcerted when ſpoken to, anſwers with difficulty, and does not know how to diſpoſe of his hands; but a gentleman who is acquainted with the world, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in company with a graceful and proper aſſurance, and is perfectly eaſy and unembar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed. He is not dazzled by ſuperior rank; he pays all the reſpect that is due to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being diſconcerted; and can converſe as eaſily with a king as with any one of his ſubjects. This is the great advantage of being introduced young into good company, and of converſing with our ſuperiors. A well-bred man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſe with his inferiors without inſolence, and with his ſuperiors with reſpect, and with eaſe. Add to this, that a man of a gentleman like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, though of inferior parts, is better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived than a man of ſuperior abilities, who is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the world.

               <head>COMPANY.</head>
               <p>TO keep good company, eſpecially at your firſt ſetting out is the way to receive good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. Good company is not what reſpective ſets of company are pleaſed either to call or think themſelves. It conſiſts chiefly (though not wholly) of people of conſiderable birth, rank, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; for people of neither birth nor rank are frequently and very juſtly admitted into it, if diſtinguiſhed by any peculiar merit, or eminency in any liberal art or ſcience. So motly a thing is good company, that many people, without birth, rank, or merit, intrude into it by their own forwardneſs, and others get into it by the protection of ſome conſiderable perſon. In this faſhionable good company, the beſt manners and the pureſt language are moſt unqueſtionably to be learned: for they eſtabliſh and give the TON to both, which are called the language and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of good company, neither of them being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained by any legal tribunal.</p>
               <p>A company of people of the firſt quality can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called good company, in the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the phraſe, unleſs they are the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable and accredited company of the place; for people of the firſt quality can be as ſilly, as ill-bred, and as worthleſs, as people of the meaneſt degree: and a company, conſiſting wholly of people of very low condition, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their merit or talents may be, can never be called good company; and therefore ſhould not be much frequented, though by no means deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:025064_0019_0FCE484DB469D8C0"/>A company wholly compoſed of learned men, though greatly to be reſpected, is not meant by the words <hi>good company</hi>: they cannot have the eaſy and poliſhed manners of the world, as they do not live in it. If we can bear our parts well in ſuch a company, it will be proper to be in it ſometimes, and we ſhall be more eſteemed in other companies for having a place in that.</p>
               <p>A company conſiſting wholly of profeſſed wits and poets, is very inviting to young men who are pleaſed with it, if they have wit themſelves; and if they have none, are fooliſhly proud of being one of it. But ſuch companies ſhould be frequented with moderation and judgment. A wit is a very unpopular denomination, as it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries terror along with it; and people are as much afraid of a wit in company as a woman is of a gun, which ſhe ſuppoſes may go off of itſelf, and do her a miſchief. Their acquaintance, however, is worth ſeeking, and their company worth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting; but not excluſively of others, nor to ſuch a degree as to be conſidered only as one of that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſet.</p>
               <p>Above all things, endeavour to keep company with people above you; for there you riſe, as much as you ſink with people below you. When I ſay company above you, I do not mean with regard to their birth, but with regard to their merit, and the light in which the world conſiders them.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of good company; one which is called the BEAU MONDE, and conſiſts of thoſe people who have the lead in cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025064_0020_0FCE484EE411C7A8"/>
who excel in ſome particular or valuable art or ſcience.</p>
               <p>Be equally careful to avoid that low company which, in every ſenſe of the word, is low indeed; low i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>r crimes, has ſunk many a man into company in every light infinitely below him, for the ſake of being the firſt man in it. There he dictates, is applauded, and admired; but he ſoon diſgraces himſelf, and diſqualifies himſelf for any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter company.</p>
               <p>Having thus pointed out what company you ſhould avoid, and what company you ſhould aſſociate with, I ſhall next lay down a few CAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN ADOP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TING THE MANNERS OF A COMPANY.</p>
               <p>WHEN a young man, new in the world, firſt gets into company, he determine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to conform to and imitate it. But he too often miſtakes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his imitation. He has frequently heard the abſurd term of genteel and faſhionable vices. He there obſerves ſome people who ſhine, and who in general are admired and eſteemed; and perceives that theſe people are rakes, drunkards, or gameſters; he therefore adopts their vices, miſtaking their defects for their perfections, and imagining that they owe their faſhion and their l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtre to theſe genteel vices. But it is exactly the reverſe; for theſe people have acquired their reputation by their parts, their learning, their good-breeding, and other real accompliſhments: and are only blemiſhed and lowered in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025064_0021_0FCE48545ECE71B0"/>
of all reaſonable people by theſe general and faſhionable vices. It is therefore plain that, in theſe mixed characters, the good part only makes people forgive, but not approve the bad.</p>
               <p>If a man ſhould, unfortunately, have any vices, he ought at leaſt to be content with his own, and not adopt other people's. The adoption of vice has ruined ten times more young men, than natural inclinations.</p>

This miſtake is very well ridiculed in the Stratagem, where Scrub ſays, "I am ſure they talked of me, for they laughed conſumedly." A well-bred man ſeldom thinks, but never ſeems to think himſelf ſlighted, undervalued, or laughed at in company, unleſs where it is ſo plainly marked out, that his honour obliges hm to reſent it in a proper manner. On the contrary, a vulgar man

               <head>FRIENDSHIP.</head>
               <p>YOUNG perſons have commonly an unguarded frankneſs about them, which makes them the eaſy prey and bubbles of the artful and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced: they look upon every knave or fool who tells them that he is their friend, to be really ſo; and pay that profeſſion of ſimulated friendſhip with an indiſcreet and unbounded confidence, always to their loſs, often to their ruin. Beware of theſe proffered friendſhips. Receive them with great civility, but with great incredulity too; and pay them with compliments, but not with confidence. Do not ſuppoſe that people become friends at firſt ſight, or even upon a ſhort acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Real friendſhip is a ſlow grower; and never thrives, unleſs ingrafted upon a ſtock of known and reciprocal merit.</p>
               <p>There is another kind of nominal friendſhip among young people, which is warm for the time, but luckily of ſhort duration. This friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is haſtily produced, by their being acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally thrown together, and purſuing the ſame courſe of riot and debauchery. A fine friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, truly! and well cemented by drunkenneſs and lewdneſs. It ſhould rather be called a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt morals and good manners, and be puniſhed as ſuch by the civil magiſtrate. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they have the impudence and the folly to call this confederacy a friendſhip. They lend one another money for bad purpoſes; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in quarrels, offenſive and defenſive, for their accomplices; they tell one another all they know, and often more too; when of a ſudden,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025064_0036_0FCE487228DFA750"/>
ſome accident diſperſes them, and they think no more of each other, unleſs it be to betray and laugh at their imprudent confidence.</p>
               <p>When a man uſes ſtrong proteſtations or oaths to make you believe a thing, which is of itſelf ſo probable that the bare ſaying of it would be ſufficient, depend upon it he deceives you, and is highly intereſted in making you believe it, or elſe he would not take ſo much pains.</p>
               <p>Remember to make a great difference between companions and friends; for a very complaiſant and agreeable companion may, and often does, prove a very improper and a very dangerous friend. People will, in a great degree, form their opinion of you, upon that which they have of your friends; and there is a Spaniſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, which ſays very juſtly,
<q>Tell me who you live with, and I will tell you who you are.</q>
One may fairly ſuppoſe, that a man who makes a knaves or a fool his friend, has ſome thing very bad to do, or to conceal. But at the ſame time that you carefully decline the friendſhip of knaves and fools, if it can be called friendſhip, there is no occaſion to make either of them your enemies, wantonly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked; for they are numerous bodies; and I would rather chuſe a ſecure neutrality, than alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or war with either of them. You may be a declared enemy to their vices and follies, without being marked out by them as a perſonal one. Their enmity is the next dangerous thing to their friendſhip. Have a real reſerve with almoſt every body; and have a ſeeming reſerve with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nobody; for it is very diſagreeable to ſeem reſerved, and very dangerous not to be ſo.

               <head>GOOD-BREEDING.</head>
               <p>GOOD-BREEDING has been very juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be
<q>the reſult of much good-ſenſe, ſome good-nature, and a little ſelf-denial for the ſake of others, and with a view to obtain the ſame indulgence from them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Good-breeding alone can prepoſſeſs people in our favour at firſt ſight; more time being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to diſcover greater talents. Good-breeding, however, does not conſiſt in low bows and formal ceremony; but in an eaſy, civil, and reſpectful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
               <p>Indeed, good-ſenſe in many caſes muſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine good-breeding; for what would be civil at one time, and to one perſon, would be rude at another time, and to another perſon; there are, however, ſome general rules of good-breeding. As for example: To anſwer only Yes, or No, to any perſon, without adding, Sir, My Lord, or Madam (as it may happen), is always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely rude; and it is equally ſo not to give proper attention and a civil anſwer when ſpoken to: ſuch behaviour convinces the perſon who is ſpeaking to us, that we deſpiſe him, and do not think him worthy of our attention, or an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>A well-bred perſon will take care to anſwer with complaiſance when he is ſpoken to; will place himſelf at the lower end of the table, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025064_0038_0FCE48782C7FF7C0"/>
bid to go higher; will firſt drink to the lady of the houſe, and then to the maſter; he will not eat awkwardly or dirtily, nor ſit when other ſtand; and he will do all this with an air of complaiſance, and not with a grave ill natured look, as if he did it all unwillingly.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more difficult to attain, or ſo neceſſary to poſſeſs, as perfect good-breeding; which is equally inconſiſtent with a ſtiff formality, an impertinent forwardneſs, and an awkward baſhfulneſs. A little ceremony is ſometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; a certain degree of firmneſs is abſolutely ſo; and an outward modeſty is extremely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming.</p>
               <p>Virtue and learning, like gold, have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic value; but if they are not poliſhed, they certainly loſe a great deal of their luſtre; and even poliſhed braſs will paſs upon more people than rough gold. What a number of ſins does the chearful, eaſy, good-breeding of the French fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cover!</p>
               <p>My Lord Bacon ſays,
<q>That a pleaſing figure is a perpetual letter of recommendation.</q>
It is certainly an agreeable ſore-runner of merit and ſmooths the way for it.</p>
               <p>A man of good-breading ſhould be acquainted with the forms and particular cuſtoms of courts. At Vienna, men always make curtſies, inſtead of bows, to the Emperor: in France, nobody bows to the King, or kiſſes his hand; but in Spain and England, bows are made, and hands are kiſſed. Thus every court has ſome peculiarity, which thoſe who viſit them ought previouſly to inform themſelves of, to avoid blund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs and awkward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:025064_0039_0FCE4879A6680030"/>Very few, ſcarcely any, are wanting in the reſpect which they ſhould ſhew to thoſe whom they acknowledge to be infinitely their ſuperiors. The man of faſhion, and of the world, expreſſes it in its fulleſt extent; but naturally, eaſily, and without concern: whereas a man who is not uſed to keep good company, expreſſes it awkwardly; one ſees that he is not uſed to it, and that it coſts him a great deal: but I never ſaw the worſt-bred man living guilty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olling, whiſtling, ſcratching his head, and ſuch like indecencies in company that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>In mixed companies, whoever is admitted to make part of them, is, for the time at leaſt, ſuppoſed to be upon a footing of equality with the reſt; and conſequently, every one claims, and very juſtly, every mark of civility and good-breeding. Eaſe is allowed, but careleſſneſs and negligence are ſtrictly forbidden. If a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſts you, and talks to you ever ſo dully or fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volouſly, it is worſe than rudeneſs, it is bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to ſhew him, by a manifeſt inattention to what he ſays, that you think him a fool or a blockhead, and not worth hearing. It is much more ſo with regard to women; who, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rank they are, are intitled, in conſideration of their ſex, not only to an attentive, but an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious good-breeding from men. Their little wants, likings, diſlikes, preferences, antipathies, fancies, whims, and even impertinencies, muſt be officiouſly attended to, flattered, and, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, gueſſed at and anticipated by a well-bred man. You muſt never uſurp to yourſelf thoſe
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025064_0040_0FCE487B25584D80"/>
conveniencies and <hi>agremens</hi> which are of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right; ſuch as the beſt places, the beſt diſhes, &amp;c. but, on the contrary, always decline them yourſelf, and offer them to others; who, in their turns, will offer them to you; ſo that, upon the whole, you will, in your turn, enjoy your ſhare of common right.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of good-breeding is local, and is variouſly modified in not only different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but in different towns of the ſame country. But it muſt be founded upon the two former ſorts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are the matter, to which, in this caſe, faſhion and cuſtom only give the different ſhapes and impreſſions. Whoever has the firſt two ſorts will eaſily acquire this third ſort of good-breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which depends ſingly upon attention and obſervation. It is properly the poliſh, the luſtre, the laſt finiſhing ſtrokes of good-breeding. A man of ſenſe, therefore, carefully attends to the local manners of the reſpective places where he is, and takes for his models thoſe perſons whom he obſerves to be at the head of the faſhion and good-breeding. He watches how they addreſs themſelves to their ſuperiors, how they accoſt their equals and how they treat their inferiors; and lets none of thoſe little niceties eſcape him, which are to good-breading what the laſt delicate and maſterly touches are to a good picture, and which the vulgar have no notion of, but by which good judges diſtinguiſh the maſter. He attends even to their air, dreſs, and motions, and imitates them liberally, and not fervilely: he copies, but does not mimic. Theſe perſonal graces are of very great conſequence. They anticipate the ſentiments before merit can engage the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; they captivate the heart, and give riſe.

                  <p>THE deſire of pleaſing is at leaſt half the art of doing it; the reſt depends only upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which attention, obſervation, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good company will teach. Thoſe who are lazy, careleſs, and indifferent whether they pleaſe or not, we may depend upon it, will never pleaſe. The art of pleaſing is a very neceſſary one to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, but a very difficult one to acquire. To do as one would be done by, is the ſureſt method of pleaſing. Obſerve carefully what pleaſes us in others, and probably the ſame things in us will pleaſe others. If we are pleaſed with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance and attention of others to our humours, our taſtes, or our weakneſſes; the ſame complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and attention on our parts to theirs, will equally pleaſe them. Let us be ſerious, gay, or even trifling, as we find the preſent humour of the company: this is an attention due from every individual to the majority. The art of pleaſing cannot be reduced to a receipt; if it could, that receipt would be worth purchaſing at any price. Good ſenſe and good-nature are the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients; and our own obſervation, and the good advice of others, muſt give the right colour and taſte to it.</p>

I have known many a woman, with an exact ſhape, and a ſymmetrical aſſemblage of beautiful features, pleaſe nobody; while others, with very moderate ſhapes and features, have charmed every body. It is certain that Venus will not charm ſo much without her attendant Graces, as they will without her.

of pleaſing, and therefore an object of ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; for we cannot help forming ſome opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a man's ſenſe and character from his dreſs. All affectation in dreſs implies a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e accurately clean for their own ſake, but all the reſt is for the ſake of other people. A man ſhould dreſs as well, and in the ſame manner, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſenſe and faſhion of the place where he is: if he dreſſes more than they, he is a fop: if he dreſſes leſs, he is unpardonably negligent: but of the two, a young fellow ſhould be rather too much than too little dreſſed; the exceſs of that ſide will wear off, with a little age and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Diogenes the Cynic was a wiſe man for deſpiſing them, but a fool for ſhewing it.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould not attempt to rival, or to excel a fop in dreſs; but it is neceſſary to dreſs, to avoid ſingularity and ridicule. Great care ſhould be taken to be always dreſſed like the reaſonable people of our own age in the place where we are, whoſe dreſs is never ſpoken of one way or another, as neither too negligent, or too much ſtudied.</p>
                  <p>Awkwardneſs of carriage is very alienating, and a total negligence of dreſs and air, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent inſult upon cuſtom and faſhion. Women

                  <p>When we are once well-dreſſed for the day, we ſhould think no more of it afterwards; and, without any ſtiffneſs for fear of diſcompoſing that dreſs, we ſhould be as eaſy and natural as if we had no cloaths on at all.</p>
                  <p>Dancing, likewiſe, though a ſilly trifling thing, is one of thoſe eſtabliſhed follies which people of ſenſe are ſometimes obliged to conform to; and if they do, they ſhould be able to perform it well.</p>
                  <p>In dancing, the motion of the arms ſhould be particularly attended to, as theſe decide a man's being genteel or otherwiſe, more than any other part of the body. A twiſt or ſtiffneſs in the wriſt will make any man look awkward. If a man dances well from the waiſt upwards, wears his hat well, and moves his head properly, he dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces well. Coming into a room and preſenting yourſelf to a company ſhould be alſo attended to, as this always gives the firſt impreſſion, which is often indelible.

or woman; who never fail to ſay, upon ſuch an occaſion,
<q>that they muſt own you have behaved yourſelf very handſomely in the whole affair.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, let this be one invariable rule of your conduct: Never to ſhew the leaſt ſymptom of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, which you cannot, to a certain degree, gratify; but always to ſmile where you cannot ſtrike. There would be no living in the world, if one could not conceal, and even diſſemble the juſt cauſes of reſentment, which one meets with every day in an active and buſy life. Whoever cannot maſter his humour, ſhould leave the world, and retire to ſome hermitage in an unfrequented deſart. By ſhewing an unavailing and ſullen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, you authorize the reſentment of thoſe who can hurt you, and whom you cannot hurt; and give them that very pretence, which perhaps they wiſhed for, of breaking with and injuring you; whereas the contrary behaviour would lay them under the reſtraints of decency at leaſt, and either ſhackle or expoſe their malice. Beſides, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, ſullenneſs, and pouting, are moſt exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly illiberal and vulgar.</p>
               <p>Though men are all of one compoſition, the ſeveral ingredients are ſo differently proportioned in each individual, that no two are exactly alike; and no one, at all times, like himſelf. The ableſt man will, ſometimes, do weak things; the proudeſt man, mean things; the honeſt man, ill things; and the wickedeſt man, good things. Study individuals then, and if you take (as you ought to do) their outlines from their prevailing paſſion, ſuſpend your laſt finiſhing ſtrokes till you have attended to and have diſcovered the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their inferior paſſions, appetites, and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:025064_0065_0FCE48AEE9D60988"/>
humours. A man's general character may be that of the honeſt man in the world; do not diſpute it; you might be thought envious or ill-natured; but, at the ſame time, do not take this probity upon truſt, to ſuch a degree as to put your life, fortune, or reputation in his power. This honeſt man may happen to be your rival in power, in intereſt, or love; three paſſions that often put honeſty to moſt ſevere trials, in which it is too often caſt; but firſt analyſe this honeſt man your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and then only you will be able to judge, how far you may, or may not, with ſafety truſt him.</p>
               <p>If you would particularly gain the affection and friendſhip of particular people, whether men or women, endeavour to find out their predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant excellency, if they have one, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing weakneſs, which every body has; and do juſtice to the one, and ſomething more than juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the other. Men have various objects in which they may excel, or at leaſt would be thought to excel; and though they love to hear juſtice done to them where they know that they excel, yet they are moſt and beſt flattered upon thoſe points where they with to excel, and yet are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whether they do or not. As for example: Cardinal Richelieu, who was undoubtedly the ableſt ſtateſman of his time, or perhaps of any other, had the idle vanity of being thought the beſt poet too; he envied the great Corneille his reputation, and ordered a criticiſm to be written upon the <hi>Cid.</hi> Thoſe, therefore, who flattered ſkilfully, ſaid little to him of his abilities in ſtate affairs, or at leaſt but <hi>en paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt,</hi> and as it might naturally occur. But the incenſe which they gave him, the ſmoke of which they knew would
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025064_0066_0FCE48B0DB9E6388"/>
turn his head in their favour, was as a <hi>bel eſprit</hi> and a poet. Why? Becauſe he was ſure of one excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and diſtruſtful as to the other.</p>
               <p>You will eaſily diſcover every man's prevailing vanity, by obſerving his favourite topic of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; for every man talks moſt of what he has moſt a mind to be thought to excel in. Touch him but there, and you touch him to the quick.</p>
               <p>Women have in general but one object, which is their beauty; upon which ſcarce any flattery is too groſs for them to ſwallow. Nature has hardly formed a woman ugly enough to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to flattery upon her perſon; if her face is ſo ſhocking, that ſhe muſt, in ſome degree, be conſcious of it, her figure and her air, ſhe truſts, makes ample amends for it. If her figure is deformed, her face, ſhe thinks, counterba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances it. If they are both bad, ſhe comforts herſelf that ſhe has graces; a certain manner; a <hi>je ne ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ais quoi,</hi> ſtill more engaging than beauty. This truth is evident from the ſtudied and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate dreſs of the uglieſt women in the world. An undoubted, unconteſted, conſcious beauty is, of all women, the leaſt ſenſible of flattery upon that head; ſhe know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it is her due, and is therefore obliged to nobody for giving it her. She muſt be flattered upon her underſtanding; which though ſhe may poſſibly not doubt of herſelf, yet ſhe ſuſpects that men may diſtruſt.</p>
               <p>Do not miſtake me, and think that I mean to recommend to you abject and criminal flattery: no, flatter nobody's vices or crimes; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, abhor and diſcourage them. But there is no living in the world without a complaiſant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence for people's weakneſſes, and innocent
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025064_0067_0FCE48B1F752C7E0"/>
though ridiculous vanities. If a man has a mind to be thought wiſer, and a woman handſomer than they really are, their error is a comfortable one to themſelves, and an innocent one with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to other people; and I would rather make them my friends, by indulging them in it, than my enemies, by endeavouring (and that to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Suſpect, in general, thoſe who remarkably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any one virtue; who raiſe it above all others, and who, in a manner, intimate that they poſſeſs it excluſively. I ſay, ſuſpect them; for they are commonly impoſtors: but do not be ſure that they are always ſo; for I have ſometimes known Saints really religious, Bluſterers really brave, Reformers of manners really honeſt, and Prudes really chaſte. Pry into the receſſes of their hearts yourſelf, as far as you are able, and never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly adopt a character upon common fame; which, though generally right as to the great outlines of characters, is always wrong in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>

               <p>If a man uſes ſtrong oaths or proteſtations to make you believe a thing which is of itſelf ſo likely and probable that the bare ſaying of it would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, depend upon it he lies, and is highly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in making you believe it; or elſe he would not take ſo much pains.</p>
               <p>There is an incontinency of friendſhip among young fellows, who are aſſociated by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual pleaſures only, which has, very frequently, bad conſequences.

The confidences are as indiſcreetly repealed as they were made; for new pleaſures and new places ſoon diſſolve this ill cemented connection, and then very ill uſes are made of theſe raſh confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.

Truſt thoſe only to ſome tried friend, more experienced than yourſelf, and who, being in a different walk of life from you, is not likely to become your rival; for I would not adviſe you to depend ſo much upon the heroic virtue of mankind, as to hope, or believe, that your competitor will ever be your friend, as to the object of that compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025064_0069_0FCE48B4E24B2108"/>
commonly adviſeable to ſeem ignorant of what people offer to tell you; and when they ſay, Have not you heard of ſuch a thing? to anſwer, No; and to let them go on, though you know it already. Some have a pleaſure in telling it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think they tell it well; others have a pride in it, as being the ſagacious diſcoveries; and many have a vanity in ſhewing that they have been, though very undeſervedly, truſted: all theſe would be diſappointed, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed, if you ſaid, Yes. Seem always ignorant (unleſs to one moſt intimate friend) of all matters of private ſcandal and defamation, though you ſhould hear them a thouſand times; for the parties affected always look upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver to be almoſt as bad as the thief; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they become the topic of converſation, ſeem to be a ſceptic, though you are really a ſerious believer; and always take the extenuating part. But all this ſeeming ignorance ſhould be joined to thorough and extenſive private informations; and, indeed, it is the beſt method of procuring them; for moſt people have ſuch a vanity in ſhewing a ſuperiority over others, though but for a moment, and in the mereſt trifles, that they will tell you what they ſhould not, rather than not ſhew that they can tell what you did not know; beſides that, ſuch ſeeming ignorance will make you paſs for incurious, and conſequently undeſigning. However, fiſh for facts, and take pains to be well informed of every thing that paſſes; but fiſh judiciouſly, and not always, nor indeed often, in the ſhape of direct queſtions; which always put people upon their guard, and, often repeated, grow tireſome. But ſometimes take the things that you would know for granted;

Whoever is admitted or ſought for, in company, upon any other account than that of his merit and manners, is never reſpected there, but only made uſe of.—
<q>We will have ſuch-a-one, for he ſings prettily; we will invite ſuch-a-one to a ball, for he dances well; we will have ſuch-a-one at ſupper, for he is always joking and laughing; we will aſk another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he plays deep at all games, or becauſe he can drink a great deal.</q>
Theſe are all vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying diſtinctions, mortifying preferences, and exclude all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Dignity of manners is not only as different from pride as true courage is from bluſtering, or true wit from joking, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Abject flattery and indiſcriminate oſtentation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, as much as indiſcriminate contradiction and noiſy debate diſguſt; but a modeſt aſſertion of one's own opinion, and a complaiſant acquieſcence to other people's preſerve dignity.</p>
               <p>Vulgar low expreſſions, awkward motions and addreſs, vilify as they imply either a very low turn of mind, or low education and low company.</p>
               <p>Frivolous curioſity about trifles, and a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention to little objects, which neither require nor deſerve a moment's thought, lower a man; who from thence is thought (and not unjuſtly) incapable of greater matters.

               <p>A certain degree of exterior ſeriouſneſs in looks and motions gives dignity, without excluding wit and decent chearfulneſs, which are always ſerious themſelves. A conſtant ſmirk upon the face, and a whiffling activity of the body, are ſtrong indications of futility. Whoever is in a hurry ſhews that the thing he is about is too big for him.

On the other hand, the cunning, crafty man thinks to gain all his ends by gentleneſs of manners only: <hi>he becomes all things in all men</hi>; he ſeems to have no opinion of his own, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilely adopts the preſent opinion of the preſent perſon; he inſinuates himſelf only into the eſteem of fools, but is ſoon detected, and ſurely deſpiſed by every body elſe. The wiſe man (who differs as much from the cunning as from the choleric man) alone joins ſoftneſs of manners with firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind.</p>
               <p>The advantages ariſing from an union of theſe qualities are equally ſtriking and obvious. For example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you are in authority, and have a
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:025064_0078_0FCE48C5A3A317B8"/>
right to command, your commands delivered with mildneſs and gentleneſs will be willingly, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and conſequently well obeyed; whereas, if given brutally, they will rather be interpreted th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> executed. For a cool, ſteady reſolution ſhould ſhew, that where you have a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you will be obeyed; but, at the ſame time, a gentleneſs in the manner of enforcing that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhould make it a chearful one, and ſoften, as much as poſſible, the mortifying conſciouſneſs of inferiority.</p>
               <p>If you are to aſk a favour, or even to ſolicit your due, you muſt do it with a <hi>grace,</hi> or you will give thoſe who have a mind to refuſe you, a pretence to do it, by reſenting the manner; but, on the other hand, you muſt, by a ſteady perſeverance and decent tenaciouſneſs, ſhew firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſolution. The right motives are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the true ones of men's actions, eſpecially of people in high ſtations; who often give to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and fear what they would refuſe to juſtice or to merit. By gentleneſs and ſoftneſs engage their hearts, if you can; at leaſt prevent the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of offence; but take care to ſhew reſolution and firmneſs enough to extort from their love of eaſe, or their fear, what you might in vain hope for from their juſtice or good-nature. People in high life are hardened to the wants and diſtreſſes of mankind, as ſurgeons are to their bodily pains; they ſee and hear of them all day long, and even of ſo many ſimulated ones, that they do not know which are real and which are not. Other ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are therefore to be applied to, than thoſe of mere juſtice and humanity: their favour muſt be captivated by the Graces; their love of eaſe diſturbed by unwearied importunity, or their
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:025064_0079_0FCE48CB100F1198"/>
fears wrought upon by a decent intimation of implacable, cool, reſentment. This precept is the only way I know in the world, of being loved without being deſpiſed, and feared without being hated. It conſtitutes the dignity of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which every wiſe man muſt endeavour to eſtabliſh.</p>
               <p>To conclude: If you find that you have a haſtineſs in your temper, which unguardedly breaks out into indiſcreet ſallies, or rough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to either your ſuperiors, your equals, or your inferiors, watch it narrowly, check it carefully, and call the Graces to your aſſiſtance. At the firſt impulſe of paſſion, be ſilent till you can be ſoft. Labour even to get the command of your countenance ſo well, that thoſe emotions may not be read in it: a moſt unſpeakable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in buſineſs! On the other hand, let no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, no gentleneſs of temper, no weak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of pleaſing on your part—no wheedling, coaxing, nor flattery on other people's make you recede one jot from any point that reaſon and prudence have bid you purſue; but return to the charge, perſiſt, perſevere, and you will find moſt things attainable that are poſſible. A yielding, timid meekneſs is always abuſed and inſulted by the unjuſt and unfeeling; but when ſuſtained by firmneſs and reſolution, is always reſpected, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>In your friendſhips, and connections, as well as in your enmities, this rule is particularly uſeful; let your firmneſs and vigour preſerve and invite attchments to you; but, at the ſame time, let your manner hinder the enemies of your friends and dependents from becoming yours: let your enemies be diſarmed by the gentleneſs of
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025064_0080_0FCE48CC60DCD398"/>

               <head>COMMON-PLACE OBSERVATIONS.</head>
               <p>NEVER uſe, believe, or approve Common-place Obſervations. They are the common topics of witlings and coxcombs; thoſe who really have wit have the utmoſt contempt for them,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025064_0083_0FCE48D159143250"/>
and ſcorn even to laugh at the pert things that thoſe would-be wits ſay upon ſuch ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Religion is one of their favourite topics; it is all prieſt-craft, and an invention contrived and carried on by prieſts of all religions for their own power and profit: from this abſurd and falſe principle flow the common-place inſipid jokes and inſults upon the clergy. With theſe people every prieſt of every religion is either a public or a concealed unbeliever, drunkard, and whoremaſter; whereas I conceive that prieſts are extremely like other men, and neither the better nor the worſe for wearing a gown or a ſurplice; but if they are different from other people, probably it is rather on the ſide of religion and morality, or at leaſt decency, from their education and manner of life.</p>
               <p>Another common topic for falſe wit and cold raillery is matrimony. Every man and his wife hate each other cordially, whatever they may pretend in public to the contrary. The huſband certainly wiſhes his wife at the devil, and the wife certainly cuckolds her huſband. Whereas I preſume, that men and their wives neither love nor hate each other the more, upon account of the form of matrimony which has been ſaid over them. The cohabitation, indeed, which is the conſequence of matrimony, makes them either love or hate more, accordingly as they reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively deſerve it; but that would be exactly the ſame, between any man and woman who lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without being married.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a trite common-place obſervation, that courts are the ſeats of falſhood and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. That like many I might ſay moſt common-place obſervations is falſe. Falſhood

               <p>Theſe and many other common-place reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon nations, or profeſſions, in general (which are at leaſt as often falſe as true) are the poor refuge of people who have neither wit nor invention of their own, but endeavour to ſhine in company by ſecond hand finery.

This diſconcerts them, as they have no reſources in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and have but one ſet of jokes to live upon. Men of parts are not reduced to theſe ſhifts, and have the utmoſt contempt for them: they find proper ſubjects enough for either uſeful or lively converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they can be witty without ſatire or common-place, and ſerious without being dull.</p>

               <head>ORATORY.</head>
               <p>ORATORY, or the art of ſpeaking well, is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in every ſituation of life, and abſolutely neceſſary in moſt. A man cannot diſtinguiſh himſelf without it in parliament, in the pulpit, or at the bar; and even in comon converſation, he who has acquired an eaſy and habitual elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and who ſpeaks with propriety and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy, will have a great advantage over thoſe who ſpeak inelegantly and incorrectly. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of oratory is to perſuade; and to pleaſe is the moſt effectual ſtep towards perſuading. It is very advantageous for a man who ſpeaks in public to pleaſe his hearers ſo much as to gain their attention; which he cannot poſſibly do, without the aſſiſtance of oratory.</p>
               <p>It is certain that by ſtudy and application every man may make himſelf a tolerable good orator, eloquence depending upon obſervation and care. Every man may, if he pleaſes, make choice of good inſtead of bad words and phraſes, may ſpeak with propriety inſtead of impropriety, and may be clear and perſpicuous in his recitals, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of dark and unintelligible; he may have grace inſtead of awkwardneſs in his geſtures and deportment: in ſhort, it is in the power of every man, with pains and application, to be a very agreeable inſtead of a very diſagreeable ſpeaker; and it is well worth the labour to excel other men in that particular article in which they excel beſt.</p>
               <p>Demoſthenes thought it ſo eſſentially neceſſary to ſpeak well, that though he naturally ſtuttred,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025064_0086_0FCE48D754CA47E8"/>
and had weak lungs, he reſolved by application to overcome thoſe diſadvantages. He cured his ſtammering by putting ſmall pebbles in his mouth, and gradually ſtrengthened his lungs by daily uſing himſelf to ſpeak loudly and diſtinctly for a conſiderable time. In ſtormy weather he often viſited the ſea-ſhore, where he ſpoke as loud as he could, in order to prepare himſelf for the noiſe and murmurs of the popular aſſemblies of the Athenians, before whom he was to ſpeak. By this extraordinary care and attention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the conſtant ſtudy of the beſt authors, he became the greateſt oratory that his own, or any other age or country have produced.</p>
               <p>Whatever language a perſon uſes, he ſhould ſpeak it in its greateſt purity, and according to the rules of grammer; nor is it ſufficient that we do not ſpeak a language ill, we muſt endeavour to ſpeak it well; for which purpoſe we ſhould read the beſt authors with attention, and obſerve how people of faſhion and education ſpeak. Common people, in general, ſpeak ill; they make uſe of inelegant and vulgar expreſſions, which people of rank never do. In numbers they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly join the ſingular and plural together, and confound the maſculine with the feminine gender, and ſeldom make choice of the proper tenſe. To avoid all theſe faults we ſhould read with attention, and obſerve the turn and expreſſions of the beſt authors; nor ſhould we paſs over a word we do not perfectly underſtand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſearching or enquiring for the exact meaning of it.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that a man muſt be born a poet, but it is in his own power to make himſelf an orator; for to be a poet requires a certain degree of ſtrength and vivacity of mind; but that attention, reading, and labour, are ſufficient to form an orator.</p>

               <p>EVERY excellency and every virtue has its kindred vice or weakneſs; and, if carried beyond certain bounds, ſinks into the one or the other.

               <p>HOW little do we reflect on the uſe and value of time! It is in every body's mouth, but in few people's practice. Every fool who ſlatterns away his whole time in nothings, frequently utters ſome trite common-place ſentence to prove at once the value and the fleetneſs of time. The ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials all over Europe have ſome ingenious inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that effect; ſo that nobody ſquanders away their time without frequently hearing and ſeeing how neceſſary it is to employ it well, and how irrecoverable it is if loſt. Young people are apt to think they have ſo much time before them, that they may ſquander what they pleaſe of it, and yet have enough left; as great fortunes have frequently ſeduced people to ruinous profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But all theſe admonitions are uſeleſs, where

there is not a fund of good-ſenſe and reaſon to ſuggeſt rather than receive them.</p>
               <p>Time is precious, life ſhort, and conſequently not a ſingle moment ſhould be loſt. Senſible men know how to make the moſt of time, and put out their whole ſum either to intereſt or pleaſure; they are never idle, but continually employed either in amuſements or ſtudy. It is an univerſal maxim, that idleneſs is the mother of vice. It is, however, certain, that lazineſs is the inheritance of fools, and nothing can be ſo deſpicable as a ſluggard. Cato the Cenſor, a wiſe and virtuous Roman, uſed to ſay, there were but three actions of his life that he regretted: The firſt was, the having revealed a ſecret to his wife; the ſecond, that he had once gone by ſea when he might have gone by land; and the third, the having paſſed one day without <hi>doing any thing.</hi>

I therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you to take care of minutes, for hours will take care of themſelves.

<q>At a more convenient ſeaſon I will ſpeak to thee.</q>
The moſt convenient ſeaſon for buſineſs is the firſt; but ſtudy and buſineſs, in ſome meaſure, point out their own times to a man of ſenſe: time is much oftener ſquandered away in the wrong choice and improper methods of amuſement and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>

                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:025064_0097_0FCE48EEA2AC8A88"/>Diſpatch is the ſoul of buſineſs; and nothing contributes more to diſpatch than method. Lay down a method for every thing, and ſtick to it inviolably, as far as unexpected incidents may allow. Fix one certain hour and day in the week for your accounts, and keep them together in their proper order; by which means they will require very little time, and you can never be much cheated. Whatever letters and papers you keep, pocket and tie them up in their reſpective claſſes, ſo that you may inſtantly have recouſe to any one. Lay down a method alſo for your reading, for which you allot a certain ſhare of your mornings; let it be in a conſiſtent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutive courſe, and not in that deſultory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methodical manner, in which many people read ſcraps of different authors upon different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Keep a uſeful and ſhort common place-book of what you read, to help your memory only, and not for pedantic quotations. Never read hiſtory without having maps, and a chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolagical book or tables lying by you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly recurred to; without which Hiſtory is only a confuſed heap of facts.</p>
               <p>You will ſay it may be, as many young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would, that all this order and method is very troubleſome, only fit for dull people, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable reſtraint upon the noble ſpirit and fire of youth. I deny it; and aſſert on the contrary, that it will procure you both more time and more taſte for your pleaſures; and ſo far from being troubleſome to you, that after you have purſued it a month, it would be troubleſome to you to lay it aſide. Buſineſs whets the appetite, and gives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

raiſes the ſpirit, for pleaſures; and a <hi>ſpectacle,</hi> a ball, an aſſembly, will much more ſenſibly affect a man who has employed, than a man who has loſt, the preceding part of the day; nay, I will venture to ſay, that a fine lady will ſeem to have more charms to a man of ſtudy or buſineſs, than to a ſaunterer. The ſame liſtleſſneſs runs through his whole conduct, and he is as inſipid in his pleaſures as inefficient in every thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I hope you earn your pleaſures, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taſte them; for, by the way, I know a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men who call themſelves men of pleaſure, but who, in truth, have none. They adopt other people's indiſcriminately, but without any taſte of their own. I have known them often inflict exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon themſelves, becauſe they thought them gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel; though they ſat as awkwardly upon them as other people's cloaths would have done. Have no pleaſures but your own, and then you will ſhine in them.</p>
               <p>Many people think that they are in pleaſures, provided they are neither in ſtudy nor in buſineſs. Nothing like it; they are doing nothing, and might juſt as well be aſleep. They contract habitudes from lazineſs, and they only frequent thoſe places where they are free from all reſtraints and attentions. Be upon your guard againſt this idle profuſion of time; and let every place you go to be either the ſcene of quick and lively pleaſures, or the ſchool of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

or any body can want: more is only lazineſs and dozing; and is both unwholeſome and ſtupifying. If by chance your buſineſs or your pleaſures ſhould keep you up till four or five o'clock in the morning, riſe exactly at your uſual time, that you may not loſe the precious morning hours; and that the want of ſleep may force you to go to bed earlier the next night.</p>

Knick-knacks, butterflies, ſhells, inſects, &amp;c. are the objects of their moſt ſerious reſearches. They contemplate the dreſs, not the characters of the company they keep. They attend more to the decorations of a play, than to the ſenſe of it; and to the ceremonies of a court, more than to its politics. Such an employment of time is an abſolute loſs of it.</p>

               <p>VIRTUE is a ſubject which deſerves your and every man's attention. It conſiſts in doing good, and in ſpeaking truth; the effects of it, therefore, are advantageous to all mankind, and to one's ſelf in particular. Virtue makes us pity and relieve the misfortunes of mankind; it makes us promote juſtice and good order in ſociety; and, in general, contributes to whatever tends to the real good of mankind. To ourſelves it gives an inward comfort and ſatisfaction, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can do, and which nothing can rob us of. All other advantages depend upon others,

as much as upon ourſelves. Riches, power, and greatneſs may be taken away from us by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and injuſtice of others, or by inevitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; but virtue depends only upon ourſelves, and nobody can take it away from us. Sickneſs may deprive us of all the pleaſures of the body; but it cannot deprive us of our virtue, nor of the ſatisfaction which we feel from it. A virtuous man, under all the misfortunes of life, ſtill finds an inward comfort and ſatisfaction, which makes him happier than any wicked man can be with all the other advantages of life. If a man has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great power and riches by falſehood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and oppreſſion, he cannot enjoy them: becauſe his conſcience will torment him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reproa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A MAN who does not ſolidly eſtabliſh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſerve, a character of truth, probity, good manners, and good morals, at his firſt ſetting out in the world, may impoſe, and ſhine like a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor for a ſhort time, but will very ſoon vaniſh, and be extinguiſhed with contempt. People eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in young men, the common irregularities of the ſenſes; but they do not forgive the leaſt vice of the heart.</p>
            <p>The greateſt favours may be done ſo awkward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bunglingly as to offend; and diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things may be done ſo agreeably as almoſt to oblige.</p>
            <p>There are very few Captains of Foot who are not much better company than ever Deſcartes or Sir Iſaac Newton were. I honour and reſpect ſuch ſuperior genuiſes; but I deſire to converſe with people of this world, who bring into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany their ſhare, at leaſt, of chearfulneſs, good-breeding, and knowledge of mankind. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life, one much oftener wants ſmall money, and ſilver, than gold. Give me a man who has ready caſh about him for preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t expences; ſix-pences, ſhillings, half-crowns, and crowns, which circulate eaſily; but a man who has only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025064_0104_0FCE48F923442708"/>
of gold about him, is much above common pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and his riches are not handy nor convenient. Have as much gold as you pleaſe in one pocket, but take care always to keep change in the other; for you will much oftener have occaſion for a ſhilling than for a guinea.</p>
            <p>Advice is ſeldom welcome, and thoſe who want it the moſt always like it the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Envey is one of the meaneſt and moſt tormenting of all paſſions, as there is hardly a perſon exiſting that has not given uneaſineſs to an envious breaſt; for the envious man cannot be happy while he beholds others ſo.</p>
            <p>A great action will always meet with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, and the inward pleaſure which it produces is not to be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Humanity is the particular characteriſtic of great minds; little vicious minds abound with anger and revenge, and are incapable of feeling the exalted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of forgiving their enemies.</p>
            <p>The ignorant and the weak only are idle; thoſe who have acquired a good ſtock of knowledge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was deſire to increaſe it. Knowledge is like power in this reſpect, that thoſe who have the moſt are moſt deſirous of having more. Idleneſs is only the refuge of weak minds, and the holiday of fools.</p>
            <p>Every man has a natural right to his liberty; and whoever endeavours to raviſh it from him, deſerves death more than the robber who attacks us for our money on the highway.</p>
            <p>Modeſty is a commendable quality, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally accompanies true merit; it engages and captivates the minds of people; for nothing is
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:025064_0105_0FCE48FB02304D80"/>
more ſhocking and diſguſtful, than preſumption and impudence. A man is deſpiſed who is always commending himſelf, and who is the hero of his own ſtory.</p>
            <p>Not to perform our promiſe is a folly, a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and a crime. It is a folly, becauſe no one will rely on us afterwards; and it is a diſhonour and a crime, becauſe truth is the firſt duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and morality: and whoever is not poſſeſſed of truth, cannot be ſuppoſed to have any one good quality, and muſt be held in deteſtation by all good men.</p>
            <p>Wit may create many admirers, but makes few friends. It ſhines and dazzles like the noon-day ſun, but, like that too, is very apt to ſcorch, and therefore is always feared. The milder morning and evening light and heat of that planet ſooth and calm our minds. Never ſeek for wit: if it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf, well and good; but even in that caſe, let your judgment interpoſe; and take care that it be not at the expence of any body. Pope ſays very truly.
<q>
                  <l>"There are whom heaven has bleſt with ſtore of wit,</l>
                  <l>"Yet want as much again to govern it."</l>
               </q>
And in another place, I doubt with too much truth,
<q>
                  <l>"For wit and judgment ever are at ſtrife,</l>
                  <l>"Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A proper ſecrecy is the only myſtery of able men; myſtery is the only ſecrecy of weak and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:025064_0106_0FCE48FC38C28098"/>To tell any friend, wife, or miſtreſs, any ſecret with which they have nothing to do, is diſcovering to them ſuch an unretentive weakneſs, as muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that you will tell it to twenty others, and conſequently that they may reveal it without the riſk of being diſcovered. But a ſecret properly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated only to thoſe who are to be concerned in the queſtion will probably be kept by them, though they ſhould be a good many. Little ſecrets are commonly told again, but great ones generally kept.</p>
            <p>A man who tells nothing, or who tells all, will equally have nothing told him.</p>
            <p>If a fool knows a ſecret, he tells it becauſe he is a fool; if a knave knows one, he tells it whereever it is his intereſt to tell it. But women and young men are very apt to tell what ſecrets they know, from the vanity of having been truſted. Truſt none of theſe, wherever you can help it.</p>
            <p>In your friendſhips, and in your enmities, let your confidence and your hoſtilities have certain bounds: make not the former dangerous, nor the latter irreconcileable. There are ſtrange viciſſitudes in buſineſs!</p>
            <p>Smooth your way to the head through the heart. The way of reaſon is a good one; but it is commonly ſomething longer, and perhaps not ſo ſure.</p>
            <p>Spirit is now a very faſhionable word: to act with ſpirit, to ſpeak with ſpirit, means only to act raſhly, and to talk indiſcre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tly. An able man ſhews his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by gentle words and reſolute actions: he is neither hot nor timid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:025064_0107_0FCE48FEEE0FB3C8"/>Patience is a moſt neceſſary qualification for buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; many a man would rather you heard his ſtory than granted his requeſt. One muſt ſeem to hear the unreaſonable demands of the petulant, unmoved, and the tedious details of the dull, untired. That is the leaſt price that a man muſt pay for a high ſtation.</p>
            <p>It is always right to detect a fraud, and to perceive a folly; but it is often very wrong to expoſe either. A man of buſineſs ſhould always have his eyes open, but muſt often ſeem to have them ſhut.</p>
            <p>In courts, <hi>(and every where elſe)</hi> baſhfulneſs and timidity are as prejudicial on one hand, as impudence and raſhneſs are on the other. A ſteady aſſurance and a cool intrepidity, with an exterior modeſty, are the true and neceſſary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</p>
            <p>Never apply for what you ſee very little proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of obtaining; for you will, by aſking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and unattainable things, accuſtom the Miniſters to refuſe you ſo often, that they will find it eaſy to refuſe you the propereſt and moſt reaſonable ones. It is a common, but a moſt miſtaken rule at Court, to aſk for every thing in order to get ſomething: you do get ſomething by it, it is true; but that ſomething is, refuſals and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule.—This maxim, like the former, is of general application.</p>
            <p>A chearful, eaſy countenance and behaviour are very uſeful: they make fools think you a good-natured man; and they make deſigning men think you an undeſigning one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:025064_0108_0FCE49001E0F8A98"/>There are ſome occaſions in which a man muſt tell half his ſecret, in order to conceal the reſt; but there is ſeldom one in which a man ſhould tell it all. Great ſkill is neceſſary to know how far to go, and where to ſtop.</p>
            <p>Ceremony is neceſſary, as the outwork and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of manners.</p>
            <p>A man's own good breeding is his beſt ſecurity againſt other people's ill-manners.</p>
            <p>Good-breeding carries along with it a dignity, that is reſpected by the moſt petulant. Ill-breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invites and authorizes the familiarity of the moſt timid. No man ever ſaid a pert thing to the Duke of Marlborough. No man ever ſaid a civil one (though many a flattering one) to Sir Robert Walpole.</p>
            <p>Knowledge may give weight, but accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only give luſtre; and many more people ſee than weigh.</p>
            <p>Moſt arts require long ſtudy and application; but the moſt uſeful art of all, that of pleaſing requires on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the deſire.</p>
            <p>It is to be preſumed, that a man of common ſenſe who does not deſire to pleaſe, deſire nothing at all; ſince he muſt know that he cannot obtain any thing without it.</p>
            <p>A ſkilful negociator will moſt carefully diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the little and the great objects of his buſineſs; and will be as frank and open in the former, as he will be ſecret and pertinacious in the latter.—This maxim holes equally true in common life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:025064_0109_0FCE4901D82D06A0"/>The Due de Sully obſerves very juſtly, in his Memoirs, that nothing contributed more to his riſe, than that prudent oeconomy which he had obſerved from his youth; and by which he had always a ſum of money before-hand, in caſe of emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies.</p>
            <p>It is very difficult to fix the particular point of oeconomy; the beſt error of the two, is on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimonious ſide. That may be corrected, the other cannot.</p>
            <p>The reputation of generoſity is to be purchaſed pretty cheap; it does not depend ſo much upon a man's general expence, as it does upon his giving handſomely where it is proper to give at all. A man, for inſtance, who ſhould give a ſervant four ſhillings, would paſs for covetous, while he who gave him a crown wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld be reckoned generous; ſo that the difference of thoſe two oppoſite characters turns upon one ſhilling. A man's character, in that particular, depends a great deal upon the report of his own ſervants; a mere trifle above common wages makes their report favourable.</p>
            <p>Take care always to form your eſtabliſhment ſo much within your income, as to leave a ſufficient fund for unexpected contingencies, and a prudent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality. There is hardly a year, in any man's life, in which a ſmall ſum of ready money may not be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to great advantage.</p>

            <head>ADVICE. OF A MOTHER TO HER SON.</head>
            <p>WHATEVER care is uſed in the education of children, it is ſtill too little to anſwer the end: to make it ſucceed, there muſt be excellent governors; but where ſhall we find them, when princes find it difficult to get and keep them for themſelves? Where can we meet with men ſo much ſuperior to others, as to deſerve to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with their conduct? Yet the firſt years of a man's life are precious, ſince they lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the merit of the reſt.</p>
            <p>There are but two ſeaſons of life in which truth diſtinguiſhes itſelf for our advantage: in youth, for our inſtruction; and in our advanced years, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us. In the age that paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> reign, truth gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally quits us for the time.</p>
            <p>Two celebrated <note n="*" place="bottom">P. Bouhours and P. Cheminals.</note> men, out of their friendſhip to me, have had the care of your education; but as they were obliged to follow the method of ſtudies ſettled in Colleges, they applied themſelves more in your early youth to improve your mind with learning, than to make you know the word, or inſtruct you in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corums of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:025064_0112_0FCE4908398E3CD8"/>I am going, my ſon, to give you ſome precepts, for the conduct of your's: read them without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a trouble. They are not dry lectures, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the air of a mother's authority; they are rather the advice of a friend, and have this merit, that they come from my heart.</p>
            <p>At your entering the world, you muſt certainly propoſe to yourſelf ſome end or other: you have too much ſenſe to care to live without any deſign at all; nor can you aſpire to any thing more becoming and worthy of you than glory. 'Tis a noble view for you to entertain; but it is fit for you to know what is meant by the term, and what notion you frame of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis of various kinds, and each profeſſion has a glory that is peculiar to it. In your's, my ſon, it means the glory that attends valour. This is the glory of heroes; it makes a brighter figure than any other; it always carries with it the true marks of honour, and the recompences it deſerves; Fame ſeems to have no tongue but to ſound their praiſe; and when you arrive at a certain degree of reputation, every thing you do is conſiderable. All the world has agreed to give the pre-eminence to military vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; 'tis no more than their due. They coſt dear enough; but there are ſeveral ways of diſcharging their obligations.</p>
            <p>Some engage in the profeſſion of arms, merely to avoid the ſhame of degenerating from their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; others follow it not only out of duty but inclination. The firſt ſcarce ever raiſe themſelves above their rank in the world: 'tis a debt they pay, and they go no further. The others, fluſhed with hopes, and carried on by ambition, march a giant's pace in the road of glory. Some propoſe only to make their fortune: others have their
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025064_0113_0FCE490A332B2EA0"/>
advancement and immortality itſelf in view. Such as ſtint themſelves to the making a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, never have a very extenſive merit. A man that does not aim at raiſing to himſelf a great name, will never perform any great actions. And ſuch as go careleſsly on in the road of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, ſuffer all the fatigues, without acquiring either the honour or recompence that naturally attend it.</p>
            <p>If people underſtood their own intereſt rightly, they would not lay a ſtreſs upon raiſing a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but would in all profeſſions have their glory and reputation in view. When you attain to a certain degree of merit, and it is generally known, the great glory and reputation you have acquired ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails to make your fortune. A man cannot have too much ardour to diſtinguiſh himſelf, nor can his deſires of advancement be encouraged by hopes that are too flattering.</p>
            <p>There muſt be great views to give a great vigour to the ſoul; 'tis not eaſy otherwiſe to make it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert itſelf. Let your love of glory be ever ſo eager and active, you may ſtill fall ſhort of your aim; yet tho' you ſhould advance but half way, 'tis always glorious to have dared.</p>
            <p>There is nothing ſo improper for a young man as that modeſty which makes him fancy he is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of great things. This modeſty is a faintneſs of ſoul, which hinders it from exerting itſelf, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a ſwift career toward glory. Ageſilaus was told that the king of Perſia was the greateſt king:
<q>Why ſhould he be greater than me (replied he), ſo long as I have a ſword by my ſide?</q>
There is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior genius and merit in ſome perſons, that tells them nothing is impoſſible for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:025064_0114_0FCE490C26263470"/>Great names are not formed in a day; nor is it Valour alone that makes extraordinary men: She begins indeed to form them, but other virtues muſt concur to finiſh them.</p>
            <p>The notion of a hero is inconſiſtent with the character of a man without juſtice, probity, and magnanimity. 'Tis not enough to have a name for your valour; you muſt have a name likewiſe for your probity. All the virtues muſt unite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to form a hero. Valour, my ſon, is not to be inſpired by advice; 'tis a gift of nature—but ſuch a one that a perſon may poſſeſs it in the higheſt degree, and yet deſerve very little eſteem in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>

            <p>Take care, my ſon, to be in reality what others promiſe or pretend to be; you have patterns ſet you in your own family.

            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:025064_0115_0FCE490E1991F988"/>You will find, my ſon, all the paths that lead to glory traced out and trod alredy before you; there is not a greater treaſure than a good name, and the reputation of one's anceſtors. They have put you in a capacity of attaining to any thing; 'tis not enough to equal them, you muſt go beyond them, and arrive to the goal, I mean the honours which they were at the point of enjoying, when they were carried off by an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death.</p>
            <p>Great fortunes are ſo ſeldom innocent, that I eaſily forgive your anceſtors for not leaving you any. I have done all I could to bring out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs into ſome order; a point in which women can diſtinguiſh themſelves no way but by oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy. I ſhall do my utmoſt to diſcharge every duty incumbent upon me in my circumſtances: I ſhall leave you as much as is fitting for you, if you are ſo unhappy as to have no merit; and enough in all reaſon, if you have the virtues I wiſh you.</p>
            <p>As I deſire nothing upon earth ſo much as to ſee you a perfectly honeſt man, let us ſee what ſort of conduct is neceſſary to give one a title to that character, that we may know what we ought to do to deſerve it. I improve myſelf by theſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and may perhaps be one day happy enough to change my precepts into examples.</p>
            <p>She that exhorts another ought to lead the way herſelf. A Perſian ambaſſador aſked the wife of Leonidas,
<q>Why they paid ſuch honours to the women at Lacedaemon?</q>
''Tis (replied ſhe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'they have entirely the forming of the men. A Greek lady ſhowed her jewels to Phocion's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aſked to ſee her's: The noble Athenian pointed to her children, and ſaid to her, 'Theſe
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:025064_0116_0FCE490EE15F5D90"/>
are my finery and jewels.' I hope, my ſon, to find in time a like ſubject of glory in you. But let us return to the obligations which men are obliged to diſcharge.</p>
            <p>There is a certain order in theſe obligations. A man ſhould know how to live with his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, his equals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his inferiors, as well as with himſelf. With his ſuperiors he ſhould know how to pleaſe without ſinking into mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould ſhew an eſteem and friendſhip to his equals, ſhould condeſcend to his inferiors ſo as not to let them feel the weight of his ſuperiority, and ſhould keep up a dignity with himſelf.</p>
            <p>All theſe obligations are ſtill inferior to the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration you owe to the Supreme Being. Religion is a correſpondence ſettled between God and man, by the favours of God to men, and the worſhip that men pay to God. Souls of a ſuperior genius have noble ſentiments for the Deity, and pay him a worſhip pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to themſelves, very different from that of the vulgar: it all comes from their heart, and is directed immediately to God. Moral virtues are very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious without the chriſtian to ſupport them. I do not recommend to you a piety blended with weakneſs and ſuperſtition; I only inſiſt, that the love of order ſhould make you ſubmit your underſtanding and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents to God, and ſhould ſhew itſelf in every part of your conduct; it will inſpire juſtice into you, and juſtice is the baſis of all other virtues.</p>
            <p>The generality of young men think to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves now-a-days by aſſuming a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine air, which degrades them among men of ſenſe: Such an air, inſtead of arguing a ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

of underſtanding, ſhews only the depravity of the heart. People never attack religion, but when they have an intereſt to attack it: Nothing makes a man happier than to have his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding convinced, and his heart affected with it; 'tis of excelent uſe in every ſeaſon and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of life. Such as are not happy enough to believe as they ought, do yet find it reaſonable to ſubmit to the eſtabliſhed religion: They know that what is miſcalled prejudice has a great vogue in the world, and ought to be treated with reſpect.</p>
            <p>A libertine way of thinking, and licentiouſneſs of manners, ought to be baniſhed under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reign.</p>
            <p>The behaviour of the Sovereign is a ſort of law to regulate that of others; it enjoins whatever he practiſes, and forbids what he declines doing. The failings of princes are multiplied, and their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are renewed by imitation. Though cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers ſhould be debauched in their ſentiments, there is ſtill a politeneſs reigning at court, which ſerves to throw a veil over vice. We have the good fortune to be born in an age when purity of morals and a reſpect for religion are neceſſary to pleaſe the Prince.</p>

Conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which your father left me: I had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed all that belonged to me to raiſe his fortune, and I loſt my all at his death.

I met with enemies in my own family: I had a

I gained it at laſt without any power of my own, and without any cringing to others. In a word, I made the beſt I could of my ill circumſtances; and as ſoon as my own fortune was mended, I ſet myſelf to make your's. Give me the ſame ſhare in your friendſhip, that I ſhall give you in my little fortune.</p>
            <p>I will have no affected reſpect: I would have all your regards to me come not from conſtraint, but purely from your heart. Let them proceed entirely from your inclinations, without being influenced by any motive of intereſt. In ſhort, take care of your own glory, and I'll take care of every thing elſe.</p>
            <p>You know how to conduct yourſelf with your ſuperiors: but there are ſtill ſome inſtructions to be given with regard to the duty you owe your Prince. You are of a family that has ſacrificed their all for him. As for the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are various ſorts of dignity, and they re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quire as various kinds of reſpect.</p>
            <p>There are real and perſonal dignities, and there are dignities of inſtitution: There is always a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to perſons in elevated ſtations, but it is merely an outward reſpect: Our real reſpect and eſteem is due only to merit. When fortune and virtue have concurred to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſe a man to a high poſt, there is a double empire in the caſe, which
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:025064_0119_0FCE491976E04B48"/>
commands a double ſubmiſſion; but let not the glittering of grandeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> dazzle and impoſe upon you.</p>
            <p>There are ſome mean ſouls that are always crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and grovelling before grandeur. One ought to ſeparate the man from the dignity, and ſee what he is when he is ſtripped of it. There is another great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs very different from that which power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity give. 'Tis neither birth nor riches that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh men; the only real and true ſuperiority among them is merit.</p>
            <p>The character of an honeſt man is a nobler ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle than any that fortune can beſtow. In ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern poſts one is neceſſarily dependent: one muſt make one's court to the miniſters, but it muſt be made with dignity. I ſhall never give you any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>inging lectures; 'tis your ſervices that ſhould ſpeak for you, and not any unbecoming ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions.</p>
            <p>Men of merit, when they make their court to Miniſters, do them an honour, but ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels diſgrace them. Nothing is more agreeable than to be a friend of perſons of dignity; but what lays the foundation of this friendſhip, is a deſire to pleaſe them.</p>
            <p>Let your acquaintance be with perſons that are above you; you will by that means get a habit of reſpect and politeneſs. People are too careleſs when they converſe with their equals; they grow dull for want of exerting their parts.</p>
            <p>I do not know whether one may hope to find friends at court. As for perſons of eminent dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, their poſt exempts them from a great many duties, and covers abundance of their failings. 'Tis good to examine into men to know them
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:025064_0120_0FCE491AE2337E40"/>
thoroughly, and ſee them with their every day's merit about them. The favourites of fortune im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon you, when you look upon them at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; the diſtance puts them in a point of view that is favourable to them: Fame always enhances their merit, and flattery deifies them. Examine them near, and you'll find them to be but men. What a number of ordinary creatures do we find at court! To rectify one's notions of greatneſs, one muſt view it near; you'll ceaſe immediately either to deſire or fear it.</p>
            <p>Let not the failings of great men corrupt you, but rather teach you to correct your own. Let the ill uſe which they make of their eſtates teach you to deſpiſe riches, and keep yourſelf within bounds. Virtue ſeldom has the direction of their expences.</p>
            <p>Among the infinite number of taſtes invented by luxury and ſenſuality, why has there not been one formed for relieving the miſerable? Does not humanity itſelf make you feel the neceſſity of aſſiſting your fellow-creatures? Good-natured and generous tempers are more ſenſible of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that lies upon them to do good, than they are of all the other neceſſities of life. Marcus Aurelius thanked the Gods for his having always done good to his friends, without making them wait for it. 'Tis the great felicity of grandeur when others find their fortune in our's:
<q>I can't (ſaid that Prince) have any reliſh of a happineſs that nobody ſhares in but myſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt exquiſite pleaſure in nature is to make the pleaſure of others; but for this end one muſt not be too fond of the goods of fortune. Riches never were the parent of virtue, but virtue has often been the cauſe of riches. What uſe,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025064_0121_0FCE491C6024B2E0"/>
too, do the generality of great men make of the glory of their ſtation? They put it all in exterior marks, and in an air of pride. Their dignity ſits heavy on them and depreſſes others; whereas true greatneſs is humane; it is always eaſy of acceſs, and condeſcends even to ſtoop to you: ſuch as really enjoy it, are at their eaſe, and make others ſo too as well as themſelves. Their advancement does not coſt their any virtue, and the nobleneſs of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents had formed, and in a manner habituated them to it beforehand. Their elevated ſtation ſeems natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to them, and nobody is a ſuffer by it.</p>
            <p>Titles and dignities are not the bonds that unite us to men, or gain them to us: Without merit and beneficence to recommend our grandeur to them, we have but a precarious tenure of their friendſhip; and they will only ſeek to indemni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y themſelves at our expence, for the homage which they have been forced to pay to the poſt, rather than to the man that enjoys it, whom they will not fail to arraign freely, and condemn in his abſence. If envy be the motive that makes us love to leſſen the good qualities of men in great poſts, 'tis a paſſion we ought to oppoſe, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them the juſtice that they deſerve. We fancy frequently that we have no grudge but againſt the men, when indeed our malignity is owing to their places: Perſons in great poſts never yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed them with the good liking of the world, which only begins to do them juſtice when they are out of place. Envy in ſuite of itſelf pays a homage to greatneſs, at the ſame time that it ſeems to deſpiſe it; for to envy places is to honour them. Let us not out of diſcontent condemn agreeable ſtations, which have no fault but that
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:025064_0122_0FCE4921680AEA60"/>
we are not in them ourſelves.—'Tis time now to paſs to the duties of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Men have found it neceſſary as well as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to unite for the common good: They have made laws to reſtrain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he wicked; they have agreed amongſt themſelves as to the duties of ſociety, and have annexed an honourable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to the practice of thoſe duties. He is the honeſt man that obſerves them with the moſt exactneſs, and the inſtances of them multiply in proportion to the degree and nicety of a perſon's honour.</p>
            <p>Virtues are linked together, and have a ſort of alliance with one another: What conſtitutes a hero is the union of all the virtues. After pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the duties neceſſary for their common ſecurity, men ſet themſelves to make their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation agreeable, and ſettled certain rules of politeneſs and living to be obſerved by perſons of birth and quality.</p>
            <p>There are ſome failings, againſt which no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are to be given: There are certain vices that are unknown to men of honour. Probity, fidelity in keeping one's word, and a love of truth, are ſubjects that I think I need not inſiſt on, and recommend to you: You know that a man of honour knows not what it is to tell a lie. What eulogiums does not the world give, and give deſervedly, to lovers of truth: The man, ſay they, that does good and ſpeaks truth, reſembles the Deity, whoſe eſſential properties are goodneſs and truth. We are not indeed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged always to ſpeak what we think, but we muſt always think what we ſpeak. The true uſe of ſpeech is to promote truth. When a man has acquired a reputation for veracity, his word
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:025064_0123_0FCE49226447F2D8"/>
is taken implicitly; it has all the authority of an oath, and the world receives what he ſays with a ſort of religious reſpect.</p>
            <p>Falſhood in actions is full as inconſiſtent with a love of truth as falſhood in words. Men of honour are never falſe; what indeed have they to diſguiſe? Nor are they fond of ſhewing themſelves, becauſe, ſooner or later, true merit will make its way.</p>
            <p>Remember that the world will ſooner pardon you your failings, than the affectation of pretending to virtues which you have not in reality. Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood affects to put on the air of truth, but a falſe man's profeſſions go no further than his looks and diſcourſes; whereas a man of veracity's are made good by his actions. It has been ſaid a long time ago, that hypocriſy is an homage which vice pays to virtue: But the principal virtues are not of themſelves ſufficient to qualify a man to pleaſe; he muſt have likewiſe agreeable and engaging qualities.</p>
            <p>When one aims at gaining a great reputation, one is always in a ſtate of dependence on the opinion of others. It is very difficult for a man to riſe to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours by his ſervices, unleſs he has friends to ſet them forth, and a manner of behaviour proper to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them.</p>
            <p>I have told you already, that in ſubaltern poſts a man can't ſupport himſelf but by a knack of pleaſing; as ſoon as ever he is neglected, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes from that moment inconſiderable: There is nothing ſo diſagreeable as to ſhew a too great fondneſs for one's ſelf, and expoſe one's vanity, ſo as to make people ſee that we like ourſelves above all the world, and that every thing centers in us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:025064_0124_0FCE4923E37D3098"/>A man with a great deal of wit may make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very diſagreeable, when he only employs it to find out the failings of others, and expoſe them publicly. As for this ſort of men who only ſhew their wit at other people's expence, they ought to conſider that no body's life is ſo perfectly without a blemiſh, as to give him a right to cenſure another man's.</p>
            <p>Rallery makes a part of the amuſements of converſation, but is a very nice matter to manage. Perſons that want to traduce, and love to rally, have a ſecret malignity in their heart. The moſt agreeable rallery in nature gives offence, if it advances a ſtep too far; ſo eaſy is the tranſition from the one to the other. A falſe friend often abuſes the liberty of banter, and reflects upon you: In all caſes of this nature, the perſon that you attack has the ſole right of judging whether you are in jeſt or no; the moment that he takes offence, it ceaſes to be rallery; 'tis a downright affront.</p>
            <p>Rallery ſhould never be uſed but with regard to failings of ſo little conſequence, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerned may be merry on the ſubject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Nice rallery is a decent mixture of praiſe and reproach; it touches ſlightly upon little fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, only to dwell the more upon great qualities. Monſieur de la Rochefoucault ſays, that
<q>the man who diſhonours another, does leſs miſchief than he that ridicules him:</q>
I ſhould be of his opinion for this reaſon, that it is not in any body's power to diſhonour another; 'tis not the diſcourſe or reflections of others; 'tis only our own conduct that can diſhonour us. The cauſes of diſhonour are known and certain, but ridicule is entirely arbitrary: It depends on the manner
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:025064_0125_0FCE4925B83D6660"/>
how objects appear to us, and on our manner of thinking and taking them.

               </gap>mpanies, would be admired in others, where there are men of ſenſe and merit.</p>
            <p>A man's humour too contributes much to the making him agreeable or otherwiſe; dark and ſour humours, that have a ſpice of malevolence in them, are vaſtly diſagreeable.</p>
            <p>Humour is the diſpoſition with which the ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the impreſſion of objects; good-natured tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers take nothing ill; their indulgence is of benefit to others, and ſupplies them with what they want in themſelves.</p>
            <p>The generality of mankind imagine, that it is to no purpoſe to attempt to correct their humour; they ſay 'I was born ſo,' and fancy this excuſe is enough to juſtify their not taking any pains about it. Such tempers muſt infallibly diſpleaſe; men owe you nothing, any farther than you are agreeable to them. The way to be ſo is to forget one's ſelf, to put others upon ſubjects which they like, to make them pleaſed with themſelves, to ſet them out with advantage, and allow them the good qualities which others diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their having. They believe you give them what the world does not allow them: Their merit ſeems in ſome ſort to be of your creation, whilſt you exalt them in the opinion of others: But this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be puſhed ſo far as to commence flattery.</p>
            <p>Nothing pleaſes ſo much as ſenſible tender perſons trying to make a friendſhip with others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:025064_0126_0FCE4926E04C9DA0"/>Take care to carry yourſelf in ſuch a manner, that your behaviour may at once make a tender of your own friendſhip, and invite the friendſhip of others. You can never be an amiable man without knowing how to be a friend, without a taſte and knowledge of friendſhip. 'Tis this corrects the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſociety; it ſoftens the roughneſs of people's natures; it brings down their vanity, and makes them know themſelves. All the obligations of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour are included in the obligations of perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>In the hurry and buſtle of the world, take care, my ſon, to have a ſure friend to whiſper truth to your ſoul: Be always ready to hear the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of your friends. The owning of faults is no hard matter for perſons that find a fund within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to mend them: Think that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>u have never done enough, when you find that you can ſtill do better. No body takes a reproof ſo kindly as he that deſerves moſt to be commended. If you are happy enough to find a true friend, you have found a treaſure; his reputation will ſecure your own: He will anſwer for you to yourſelf; he will alleviate all your troubles, and multiply all your pleaſures. But if you would deſerve a friend, you muſt know how to be one.</p>
            <p>All the world is complaining of the want of friends, and yet ſcarce any body gives himſelf the trouble of bringing the neceſſary diſpoſitions to gain and preſerve them. Young men have their companions, but they very rarely have any friends: Pleaſures are what unite them, but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are not ties worthy of friendſhip. I do not pretend to make a diſſertation on this ſubject; I only touch ſlightly on ſome duties of civil life: I refer you to your own heart, which will put
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:025064_0127_0FCE492A109C4DD8"/>
you upon deſiring a friend, and make you feel the neceſſity of having one. I depend upon the nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your ſentiments to inſtruct you in the duties of friendſhip.</p>
            <p>If you would be perfectly an honeſt man, you muſt think of keeping yourſelf within bounds, and placing it on a good object. Honeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in waiving one's own rights, and paying a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to thoſe of others. If you ſet up to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py alone, you will never be ſo; all the world will diſpute your happineſs with you: but if you are for making the world happy as well as yourſelf every body will aſſiſt you. All vices whatever flatter ſelf-love, and all the virtues agree to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack it; valour expoſes it; modeſty lowers it; generoſity throws it away; moderation mortifies it; and zeal for the public ſacrifices it to the good of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Self-love is a preferring of one's ſelf to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as honeſty is the preferring of others to one's ſelf. There are two kinds of ſelf-love; the one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, lawful, and regulated by juſtice and reaſon; the other vicious and corrupt. Our firſt object is certainly ourſelves; 'tis only reflection that calls us back to juſtice. We don't know how to love ourſelves; we either carry our ſelf-love too high, or exerciſe it improperly. To love one's ſelf as one ought is to love virtue; to love vice is to ſtrike in with a blind and miſtaken love.</p>
            <p>We have ſometimes ſeen perſons advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ill ways; but if vice is preferred, it is not for any length of time; corrupt perſons ruin themſelves by the very means, and with the ſame principles that raiſed them. If you would be happy with ſecurity, you muſt be ſo with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.

There is no power ſure and laſting but that of virtue.</p>
            <p>There are ſome amiable tempers that have a fine and natural congruity with virtue: Thoſe to whom nature has not been ſo bountiful muſt be watchful over their conduct, and know their true intereſt, to be able to correct an evil diſpoſition. Thus the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding rectifies the heart.</p>
            <p>The love of eſteem is the life and ſoul of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; it unites us to one another: I want your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, you ſtand in need of mine. By forſaking the converſe of men, we forſake the virtues neceſſary for ſociety; for when one is alone, one is apt to grow negligent; the world forces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Politeneſs is the moſt neceſſary quality for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; 'tis the art of employing the exterior marks of breeding, which after all gives us no aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a man's inward qualities.

            <p>I do not confine politeneſs to that intercourſe of civilities and compliments, which is ſettled by common uſe; they are made without meaning, and received without any ſenſe of obligation: People are apt to over-do the matter in this ſort of intercourſe, and abate of it upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>

               <pb n="123" facs="unknown:025064_0129_0FCE492D2A4B2DD0"/>Politeneſs is a deſire to pleaſe the perſons with whom we are obliged to live, and to behave our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch a manner, that all the world may be ſatisfied with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our ſuperiors with our reſpects; our equals with our eſteem; and our inferiors with our kindneſs and condeſcenſion. In a word, it conſiſts in a care to pleaſe, and ſay what is proper to every body. It ſets out their good qualities; it makes them ſenſible that you acknowledge their ſuperiority; when you know how to exalt them, they will ſet you out in their turn; they will give you the ſame preference to others, which you are pleaſed to give them to yourſelf, their ſelf love obliges them to do ſo.</p>
            <p>The way to pleaſe is not to diſplay your ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority; 'tis to conceal it from being perceived. There is a great deal of judgement in being po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite; but the world will excuſe you at an eaſier rate.</p>
            <p>The generality of people require only certain manners that pleaſe: if you have them not, you muſt make up the defect with the number of your good qualities. There muſt be a great deal of merit to get over a clowniſh awkward behaviour. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let the world ſee that you are fond of your own perſon: A polite man never finds time to talk of himſelf.</p>
            <p>You know what ſort of politeneſs is neceſſary to be obſerved to the women. At preſent it looks as if the young men had made a vow not to practiſe it, 'tis a ſign of a careleſs education.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more ſhameful than a voluntary rudeneſs; but let them do their worſt, they can never rob the women of the glory of having formed the fineſt gentlemen of the laſt age. 'Tis
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:025064_0130_0FCE492E6A8ADE80"/>
to them that they owed all the complaiſance of behaviour, the delicacy of inclinations, and the fine gallantry of wit and manners which were then remarkable.</p>
            <p>At preſent, indeed, exterior gallantry ſeems to be baniſhed; the manners of the world are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and every body has loſt ſomething by the change; the women the deſire of pleaſing, which was the ſource of their charms; and the men the complaiſance and fine politeneſs, which is only to be acquired in their converſation. The generality of men fancy that they owe them neither probity nor fidelity: it looks as if they had a licence to betray them, without affecting their honour. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would think fit to examine into the motives of ſuch a conduct, would find them very ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. They are faithful to one another, becauſe they are afraid, and know they ſhall be called to an account; but they are falſe to the women without fear of ſuffering, and without remorſe. This ſhews their probity to be only forced, to be rather the effect of fear than the love of juſtice: and accordingly, if we examine cloſe into ſuch as make a trade of gallantry, we ſhall find them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be men of no honour; they contract ill habits; their manners are corrupted: they grow indifferent to truth, and indulge themſelves in their habitual neglect of their word and oaths.</p>
            <p>What a trade is this! where the leaſt ill thing that you do, is to ſeduce the women from their duty, to diſhonour ſome, to make others deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, where a ſure calamity is oftentimes all the recompence of a ſincere and conſtant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>The men have no reaſon to find ſo much fault with the women; for it is by them that they loſe
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025064_0131_0FCE49310C3686A0"/>
their innocence. If we except ſome women that ſeem deſtined to vice from their cradle, the reſt would live in a regular practice of their duty, if the men did not take pains to turn them from it: but, in ſhort, 'tis their buſineſs to be on their guard againſt them. You know that it is never allowable to diſhonour them; if they have had the weakneſs to truſt you with their honour, 'tis a confidence that you ought not to abuſe. You owe it to them, if you have reaſon to be ſatisfied with them; you owe it to yourſelf, if you have reaſon to compain of them. You know, too that by the laws of honour you muſt fight with equal weapons; you ought not therefore to expoſe a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to diſhonour for her amour, ſince ſhe can never expoſe you for yours.</p>
            <p>I muſt, however, caution you againſt incurring their hatred; it is violent and implacable. There are ſome offences which they never pardon, and people run a greater riſk than they imagine, in wounding their honour; the leſs their reſentment breaks out, the more terrible is it; by being held in, it grows the fiercer. Have no quarrel with a ſex that knows ſo well how to reſent and revenge themſelves; and the rather, becauſe the women make the reputation of the men, as the men make that of the women.</p>
            <p>'Tis a happy talent, but very rarely to be met with, to know how to manage the point of praiſe, to give it agreeably and with juſtice. The moroſe man does not know how to praiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his judgement is ſpoiled by his temper. The flatter, by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing too much, ruins his own credit, and does ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to nobody. The vain man deals out his praiſes only to receive others in return; he ſhews too plainly that he praiſes merely out of affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:025064_0132_0FCE49321FF939F8"/>
Shallow underſtandings eſteem every thing, becauſe they know not the value of things: they cannot make either their eſteem or contempt paſs in the world. The envious wretch praiſes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, for fear of putting others on a level with himſelf. An honeſt man praiſes in the right place: he feels more pleaſure in doing juſtice, than in raiſing his own reputation by leſſening that of others. Perſons that reflect, and are nice upon this article, are very ſenſible of all theſe differences. If you would have your praiſes of any body be of ſervice to you, always praiſe out of the regard you have for others, and not out of any regard to yourſelf.</p>
            <p>One ſhould know how to live with one's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors; there is nothing more common than to wiſh to raiſe one's ſelf above them, or to try to ruin them: But there is a much nobler conduct; 'tis never to attack them, and always ſtrive to exceed them in merit; 'tis a handſome action to yield them the place which you think is due to them.</p>
            <p>An honeſt man chuſes rather to neglect his own fortune, than to fail in a point of juſtice. Diſpute about glory with yourſelf, and ſtrive to acquire new virtues, and to improve the merit of thoſe which you have already.</p>
            <p>One muſt be very cautious in the article of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; it is often of uſe to make one's ſelf fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it is almoſt always dangerous to revenge one's ſelf. There is not a greater weakneſs than to do all the miſchief that we can. The beſt manner of revenging an injury is not to imitate the perſon that did it. 'Tis a fight worthy of honeſty men to oppoſe patience to paſſion, and moderation to juſtice. An extravagant hatred
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:025064_0133_0FCE4933A1E77568"/>
puts you beneath the perſons you hate. Do not juſtify your enemies; do nothing that can excuſe them; they do us leſs miſchief than our own faults. Little ſouls are cruel, but clemency is the virtue of great men. Caeſar ſaid, that
<q>the moſt agreeable fruit of his victories was the having it in his power to give people their lives who had attempted his own.</q>
There is nothing more glorious and exquiſite than this kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: 'tis the only one that men of honour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themſelves to take. As ſoon as your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my repents and makes his ſubmiſſion, you loſe all manner of right to revenge.</p>
            <p>The generality of mankind bring nothing into the intercourſe of life but their weakneſs, which ſerves for ſociety. Honeſt men form an intimacy by their virtues, the ordinary ſort of men by their pleaſures, and villains by their crimes.</p>
            <p>Good-fellowſhip and gaming have their exceſs and their dangers: Love has others peculiar to itſelf; there is no playing always with beauty; it ſometimes commands imperiouſly. There is nothing more ſhameful in a man than exceſſive drinking, and drawing his reaſon, which ought to be the guide of his life. To give up one's ſelf to voluptuouſneſs is to degrade one's nature. The ſureſt way to avoid it is not to grow familiar with it; one would think the voluptuous man's ſoul was a charge to him.</p>
            <p>As for gaming, 'tis the deſtruction of all deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. The prince forgets his dignity at it, and the woman her modeſty. Deep play carries with it all the ſocial vices. They rendezvous at certain hours to hate and ruin one another; 'tis a great trial of probity; and few people have preſerved theirs unſpotted in a courſe of gaming.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="unknown:025064_0134_0FCE493522600C80"/>The moſt neceſſary diſpoſition to relif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wiſdom makes uſe of the love of glory to guard againſt the meanneſs into which ſenſuality hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ries a man. But one muſt ſet to work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to keep one's ſelf free from paſſions; they may in the beginning be under command, but they domineer at laſt: They are more eaſy to be overcome than ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Keep yourſelf from envy, 'tis the loweſt and moſt ſhameful paſſion in the world; it is always diſowned. Envy is the ſhadow of glory, as glory is the ſhadow of virtue. The grateſt ſign that a man is born with great qualities is to ſay, that he has no envy in his nature.</p>
            <p>A man of quality can never be amiable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out liberality. The covetous man cannot fail of being diſagreeable. He has within him an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to all virtues: he has neither juſtice nor humanity. When once a man gives up himſelf to avarice, he renounces glory: it is ſaid, there have been illuſtrious villains, but that there never were any illuſtrious miſers.</p>
            <p>Though liberality is a gift of nature, yet if we had a diſpoſition to the contrary vice, we might by good ſenſe and reflection correct it.</p>
            <p>The covetous man enjoys nothing. Money has been ſaid to be a good ſervant, though an ill maſter: but it is good on account of the uſe we can make of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:025064_0135_0FCE4937DAA939D0"/>The covetous wretch is more tormented than the poor man. The love of riches is the root of all vices, as diſintereſtedneſs is the firſt principle of all virtues.</p>
            <p>Riches muſt be immenſe, in order to be enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to the firſt place among the goods of life: they are indeed the firſt object of the deſires of the greateſt part of mankind; yet virtue, glory, and a great reputation, are vaſtly preferable to all the gifts of fortune.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſenſible pleaſure of honeſt men is to do good, and relieve the miſerable. What a wide difference is there between having a little more money, or loſing it for one's diverſion, and the parting with it in exchange for the reputation of goodneſs and generoſity? 'Tis a ſacrifice that you make to your glory. Deny yourſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lay up a fund for your liberality; 'tis an excellent point of oeconomy, which naturally tends to advance you, and gain you a good cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>A great reputation is a great treaſure. We muſt not imagine that a great fortune is neceſſary to enable one to do good; all the world can do it in their ſeveral ſtations, with a little attention to themſelves, and others; fix this inclination in your heart, and you'll find wherewith to gratify it: occaſions enough offer themſelves before you, and there are but too many unhappy perſons that ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit you.</p>
            <p>Liberality diſtinguiſhes itſelf in the manner of giving. The liberal man doubles the merit of a preſent by the good-will with which he makes it: the covetous wretch ſpoils it by his regret at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it. Liberality never ruined any body. Families are not raiſed by avarice, but they are
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025064_0136_0FCE493A63620390"/>
ſupported by juſtice, moderation, and integrity. Liberality is one of the duties of a noble birth. When you do good, you only pay a debt; but ſtill prudence is to govern you in ſuch caſes; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of profuſeneſs are not ſhameful, but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it are dangerous.</p>
            <p>There are few men know how to live with their inferiors. The great opinion that we entertain of ourſelves makes us look upon all below us as a diſtinct ſpecies; but how contrary are ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents to humanity! If you would raiſe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a great name, you muſt be affable and eaſy of acceſs; your military profeſſion gives you no diſpenſation in this point. Germanicus was adored by his ſoldiers. To learn what they thought of him, he walked one evening through his camp, and overheard what they ſaid at their little meals, where they take upon them to paſs their judgment on their general; 'he went ſays Tacitus) to enjoy his reputation and glory.'</p>
            <p>You muſt command by example, rather than authority: Admiration forces men to imitation much ſooner than command: To live at your eaſe, and treat your ſoldiers harſhly, is to be their Tyrant, and not their General.</p>
            <p>Conſider with what view authority was firſt inſtituted, and in what manner it ſhould be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; 'tis virtue, and the natural reſpect which the world pays to it, that made men conſent to obedience. You are an uſurper of authority, if you do not poſſeſs it upon that ſooting. In an empire where reaſon ſhall govern, all the world ſhould be on a level, and no diſtinction be paid but to virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="unknown:025064_0137_0FCE493BE0394868"/>Humanity itſelf ſuffers by the vaſt difference that fortune has put between one man and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. 'Tis not any dignity or haughtineſs, but your merit, that ſhould diſtinguiſh you from the vulgar. Conſider the advantages of a noble birth and high ſtation only as goods which fortune lends you, and not as diſtinctions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to your perſon, and that make a part of yourſelf. If your quality raiſes you above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary world, think how much you have in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with other men by your weakneſſes, which confound you with them: let juſtie then ſtop the motions of your pride, which would diſtinguiſh you from them.</p>
            <p>Know that the firſt laws which you ought to obey are thoſe of humanity: Remember that you are a man, and that you command over men. When the ſon of Marcus Aurelius loſt his preceptor, the courtiers found fault with him for weeping on that occaſion. Marcus Aurelius ſaid to them,
<q>Allow my ſon to be a Man, before he comes to be an Emperor.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Forget always what you are, when humanity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it of you; but never forget it when true glory calls upon you to remember it. In fine, if you have any authority, uſe it only for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of othes. Admit them near you, if you are great yourſelf, inſtead of keeping them at a diſtance: never make them feel their inferiority; and live with them as you would have your ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors live with you.</p>

            <p>You love ſolitude; they reproach you with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too private; I do not find fault with your taſte, but you muſt not let the ſocial virtues ſuffer from it. Retire into yourſelf, ſays Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius; practiſe often this retreat of the ſoul, you will improve yourſelf by it.

            <p>I ſhall exhort you, my ſon, rather to take pains with your heart, than to improve your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; that ought to be the great ſtudy of your life. The true greatneſs of man lies in the heart; it muſt be elevated by aſpiring to great things, and by daring to think ourſelves worthy of them.

            <p>Take care to have thoughts and ſentiments worthy of you. Virtue raiſes the dignity of man, and vice degrades him. If one was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy enough to want an honeſt heart, one ought for one's own intereſt to correct it: nothing makes a man truly valuable but his heart, and nothing but that can make him happy; ſince our happineſs depends only on the nature of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. If they are ſuch as lead you to trifling paſſions, you will be the ſport of their vain attachments: they offer you

            </p>
            <p>We muſt not indulge ourſelves long in things that pleaſe us; the moment that we give our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to them, we lay the foundation of our ſorrows. The generality of mankind employ the firſt part of their life in making the reſt of it miſerable. You muſt not abandon reaſon in your pleaſures, if you would find it again in your troubles.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, keep a ſtrict guard over your heart; it is the ſource of innocence and happineſs. You
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:025064_0141_0FCE4943F73D9A00"/>
will not pay too dear for the freedom of your mind and heart, though you purchaſe it by the ſacrifice of your pleaſures, as was the ſaying of an ingenious ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. Never expect then to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile ſenſuality, with glory, or the charm of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs with the recompence of virtue. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when you bid adieu to pleaſures, you will find in other things ſatisfaction enough to make you amends. There are various ſorts of it: Glory and truth have their pleaſures; they are the delights of the ſoul and heart.</p>
            <p>Learn likewiſe to reverence and ſtand in awe of yourſelf. The foundation of happineſs is laid in the peace of the mind, and ſecret teſtimony of the conſcience. By the word conſcience, I mean the inward ſenſe of a nice honour, which aſſures you that you have nothing to reproach yourſelf with. Again, how happy is it to know how to live with one's ſelf, to renew your acquaintance there with pleaſure, and quit yourſelf for a time with regret! The world then indeed is leſs neceſſary to you; but take care it does not make you out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with it. One muſt not entertain an averſion for men; they will deſert you when you deſert them: You have ſtill occaſion for them; you are not either of an age or profeſſion to do without them; but when one knows how to live one's ſelf as well as with the world, they are two plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that ſupport one another.</p>
            <p>A paſſion for glory may contribute greatly to your advancement and happineſs; but it may likewiſe make you unhappy and diſpicable, if you know not how to govern it: 'tis the moſt active and laſting of all our inclinations. The love of glory is the laſt paſſion that quits us; but we muſt not confound it with vanity. Vanity aims
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:025064_0142_0FCE494623D16F00"/>
at the approbation of other people; true glory at the ſecret teſtimony of the conſcience. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to gratify the paſſion that you have for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, make ſure of this inward teſtimony; your tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal is ſeated in your own breaſt, why then ſhould you ſeek it elſewhere? You can always be a judge of your own worth. Let men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute your good qualities if they pleaſe; as they do not know you, you can eaſily conſole your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It is not of ſo much conſequence to be thought an honeſt man, as to be one. Such as do not mind the approbation of other people, but only aim at deſerving it, take the ſureſt way to obtain both. What affinity is there between the greatneſs of man, and the littleneſs of the things which make the ſubject of his glorying? There is nothing ſo ill ſuited as his dignity and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that he derives from an infinite number of trifling things: a glory ſo ill-grounded ſhews a great want of merit. Perſons that are truly great are not ſubject to the infatuations of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory.</p>
            <p>One muſt, if it be poſſible, my ſon be content with one's condition in the world: there is nothing more rare and valuable than to find perſons that are ſatisfied with it. 'Tis our own fault. There is no condition of life ſo bad, but it has one good ſide. Every ſituation has its point of view; we ſhould place it in that favourable light, and ſhall find that it is not the fault of our ſituations, but purely our own. We have much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of our own temper than of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. We lay all the blame upon events, when all the fault lies upon our own diſcontent; the evil is within us, let us not ſeek for it any where elſe. By qualifying our temper, we often change
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:025064_0143_0FCE49478EA40430"/>
our fortune. It is much eaſier for us to adjuſt ourſelves to things, than to adjuſt things to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A great application to find out a remedy frequently irritates the diſeaſe, and the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſpires with the pain to increaſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it. A dwelling upon misfortunes renews them, by making them preſent to the mind. An uſeleſs ſtruggling to get out of our circumſtances, makes us ſlower in contracting an acqaintance with them, which would make them ſit eaſy on us. One muſt always give way to misfortunes; have recourſe to patience: 'tis the only way to alleviate them.</p>
            <p>If you would do yourſelf juſtice, you will be content with your ſituation. I dare ſay, that after the loſs we have ſuffered, if you had another mother you would be ſtill fuller of complaints. Reflect on the advantages of your condition, and you will be leſs ſenſible of the difficulties of it. A wiſe man, in the ſame circumſtances with others, has more advantages, and feels fewer inconveniencies than they.</p>
            <p>You may depend upon it that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but has its troubles; 'tis the ſituation of human life; there is nothing pure and unblended in it. 'Tis to pretend to exempt one's ſelf from the common law of our nature to expect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant happineſs. The very perſons that you think the happieſt would hardly appear ſo to you, if you knew the exact ſituation of their fortune or their heart. Thoſe that are raiſed the higheſt are frequently the moſt unhappy. With great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and vulgar maxims one is always reſtleſs and uneaſy: 'tis not places, but reaſon that removes anxiety from the mind. If you are
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:025064_0144_0FCE4948B398E490"/>
wiſe, fortune can neither increaſe nor diminiſh your happineſs.</p>
            <p>Judge by yourſelf, and not by the opinions of others. Misfortunes and diſorders ariſe from falſe judgments, falſe judgments from our paſſions, and paſſions from our converſation with mankind; you always come from them more perfect than you were before. To weaken the impreſſion that they make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pon you, and to moderate your deſires and inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, conſider that time is continually running away with your pains as well as your pleaſures; that every moment, young as you are, carries off a part of yourſelf, that all things are perpetually ſinking into the abyſs of paſt time, thence never to return again.</p>
            <p>All that you ſee greateſt on earth meets with the very ſame treatment as yourſelf. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, the dignities, the precedences ſettled among men, are mere ſhows and ceremonies, without any reality; do not imagine that they are qualities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from their being. Thus ought you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſuch as are above you; but take in your view likewiſe an infinite number of miſerable wretches that are below you: the difference between you and them is owing only to chance, but pride and the great opinion we have of ourſelves make us think that the good condition we are in is no more than our due, and conſider every thing that we do not enjoy as a robbery of what ſhould belong to us: you cannot but ſee plainly that nothing is more unreaſonable than ſuch an imagination. Enjoy, my ſon, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of your circumſtances; but ſuffer patiently the inconveniencies that attend them: Conſider that wherever there are men, there are unhappy creatures. Enlarge your mind, if poſſible, ſo far as to foreſee and know all the accidents that can befall you. In a word, remember that a man's happineſs depends
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:025064_0145_0FCE494A21CA3908"/>
on his manners and conduct; but the higheſt felicity is to ſeek for it in the paths of innocence, and there one never fails to find it.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE virtuous inclination of thy matchleſs mother, by whoſe tender and goldly care thy infancy was governed, together with thy education under ſo zealous and excellent a tutor, puts me in rather aſſurance than hope, that you are not ignorant of that <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> which is only able to make thee happy as well in thy death as life; I mean, the true knowledge and worſhip of thy Creator and Redeemer, without which all other things are vain and miſerable: ſo that, thy youth being guided by ſo ſufficient a teacher, I make no doubt but he will furniſh thy life with divine and moral documents. Yet, that I may not caſt off the care beſeeming a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent towards his child, or that you ſhouldeſt have cauſe to derive thy whole felicity and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare rather from others, than from whence thou receivedſt thy breath and being, I think it fit and agreeable to the affection I bear thee, to help thee with ſuch rules and advertiſements for the ſquaring of thy life, as are rather gained by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience than by much reading; to the end that entering into this exorbitant age, thou mayeſt be

the better prepared to ſhun thoſe ſcandalous courſes whereunto the world, and the lack of experience, may eaſily draw thee. And becauſe I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thy memory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have reduced them in Ten Precepts; and, next unto Moſes' Tables, if thou imprint them in thy mind, thou ſhalt reap the benefit, and I the content. And they are theſe following:</p>
            <div n="1" type="precept">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>WHEN it ſhall pleaſe God to bring thee to man's eſtate, uſe great providence and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection in chuſing thy wife; for from thence will ſpring all thy future good or evil: and it is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, like unto a ſtratagem of war, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man can err but once. If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hy eſtate be good, match near home and at leiſure; if weak, far off and quickly. Enquire diligently of her diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how her parents have been inclined in their youth. Let her not be poor, how generous ſoever; for a man can buy nothing in the market with gentility. Nor chooſe a baſe and uncomely creature altogether for wealth; for it will cauſe contempt in others, and loathing in thee. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make choice of a dwarf, or a fool; for by the one thou ſhalt beget a race of pigmies, the other will be thy continual diſgrace; and it will irke thee to hear her talk; for thou ſhalt find it to thy great grief, that there is nothing more fulſome than a ſhe-fool.</p>
               <p>And, touching the guiding of thy houſe, let thy hoſpitality be moderate; and, according to the means of thy eſtate, rather plentiful than ſparing, but not coſtly; for I never knew any man grow poor by keeping an orderly table.
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:025064_0149_0FCE4953311A86B0"/>
But ſome conſume themſelves through ſecret vices, and their hoſpitality bears the blame. But ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſwimiſh drunkards out of thine houſe, which is a vice imparing health, conſuming much, and makes no ſhow. I never heard praiſe aſcribed to the drunkard, but for the well-bearing of his drink; which is a better commendation for a brewer's horſe or a dray-man, than for either a gentleman or a ſerving-man. Beware thou ſpend not above three or four parts of thy revenues, nor above a third part of that in thy houſe; for the other two parts will do no more than defray thy extraordinaries, which always ſurmount the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary by much: otherwiſe thou ſhalt live, like a rich beggar, in continual want. And the needy man can never live happily nor contentedly; for every diſaſter makes him ready to mortgage or ſell; and that gentleman who ſells an acre of land ſells an ounce of credit: for gentility is nothing elſe but ancient riches; ſo that if the foundation ſhall at any time ſink, the building muſt need follow.

Give them good countenance and convenient mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance according to thy ability, otherwiſe thy life will ſeem their bondage; and what portion thou ſhalt leave them at thy death, they will thank Death for it, and not thee. And I am perſuaded that the fooliſh cockering of ſome parents, and the over-ſtern carriage of others, cauſeth more men and women to take ill courſes, than their own vicious inclinations. Marry thy daughters
