            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAVING very lately, without any other authority, than THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS, uſhered into the hands of the public, certain ſpeculations</p>
            <p>FOR AMERICAN INDEPENDENCY.</p>
            <p>By the ſame AUTHORITY, <abbr>viz.</abbr> THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS: ROBERT BELL, Provedore to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaliſts; hath printed, publicſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is now ſelling (Price Three Shillings) to all who are capable of practicing ſo much impartiality, as to give a hearing to the other Side, by lending their attention towards certain ſpeculations.</p>
            <p>AGAINST AMERICAN INDEPENDENCY.</p>
            <p>And that no malicious perſon, or perſons, may plead ignorance of this indubitable and firmly eſtabliſhed AUTHORITY, THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS, which doth, and forever will prevail in all thoſe countries, where FREEDOM is the Baſis of their CONSTITUTION. The Printer, hath hereunto ſubjoined, the following very ſubſtantial and definitive TESTIMONIES.</p>

            <head>Extracts from the ſagacious and patriotic JUNIUS, Author of the celebrated FREE LETTERS, to his preſent Majeſty and his Miniſters.</head>
            <p>"THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS is the <hi>Palladium</hi> of all Civil, Political, and Religious Rights".</p>
            <p>"A conſiderable latitude muſt be allowed in the diſcuſſion of public affairs, or the liberty of the PRESS will be of no benefit to ſociety.—The liberty of the PRESS is our only reſource. It will command an audience, when every honeſt man in the kingdom is excluded."</p>
            <p>"This glorious privilege may be a ſecurity to the King, as well as a reſource to his people. Had there been no ſtar-chamber, there would have been no rebellion againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. The conſtant cenſure and admonition of the PRESS, would have probably corrected his conduct, prevented a civil war, and ſaved him from an ignominious death."</p>

If, for example, in an Empire of the Eaſt, a ſanctuary could be found, which, (rendered reſpectable by the ancient religion of the people,) might inſure ſafety to thoſe, who ſhould bring thither their obſervations of any kind; and that, from thence, PRINTED PAPERS ſhould iſſue, which, under a certain ſeal, might be equally reſpected; and which, in their daily appearance, ſhould examine and freely diſcuſs, the conduct of the Cadis, the Baſhaws, the Vizir, the Divan, and the Sultan himſelf: Theſe PRINTED PAPERS would introduce immediately ſome degree of LIBERTY."</p>

            <head>PLAIN TRUTH; CONTAINING REMARKS ON A LATE PAMPHLET, ENTITLED, COMMON SENSE.</head>
            <p>I HAVE now before me the Pamphlet, entitled COMMON SENSE; on which I ſhall remark with freedom and candour. It may not be improper to remind my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the inveſtigation of my ſubject, demands the utmoſt freedom of enquiry. I therefore entreat his indulgence; and that he will carefully remember, that intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate zeal, is as injurious to liberty, as a manly diſcuſſion of facts is friendly to it. "Liberty, ſays the great MONTESQUIEU, is a right of doing whatever the laws permit; and if a citizen could do what they forbid, he would no longer be poſſeſſed of liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all his fellow citizens would have the ſame power." In the beginning of his pamphlet, the Author aſſerts, that ſociety in every ſtate is a bleſſing. This in the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my heart I deny; for it is ſupreme miſery to be aſſociated with thoſe, who to promote their ambitious purpoſes, flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:015088_0009_0F95E4525D2C4AD0"/>
pervert the ends of political ſociety. I do not ſay that our Author is indebted to BURGH'S POLITICAL DISQUISITIONS, or to ROUSSEAU'S Social Compact for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Government, and his large Tree; although I wiſh he had favoured his reader with the following extract from that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime reaſoner. "To inveſtigate thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of ſociety which may beſt anſwer the purpoſe of nations, would require the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of ſome ſuperior intelligence, who ſhould be witneſs to all the paſſions of men, but be ſubject itſelf to none, who ſhould have no connections with human nature, but ſhould have a perfect knowledge of it: A Being, in ſhort, whoſe happineſs ſhould be independent of us, and who would nevertheleſs employ itſelf about us. It is the province of Gods to make laws for Men." With the utmoſt deference to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated ROUSSEAU, I cannot indeed ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that laws even ſo conſtructed, would materially benefit our imperfect race; unleſs omniſcience deigned previouſly to exalt our nature. The judicious reader will therefore perceive, that malevolence only, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to declaim againſt, and arraign the moſt perfect governments. Our <hi>Political Quack,</hi> avails himſelf of this trite expedient, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole the people into the moſt abject ſlavery,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:015088_0010_0F95E45296C6C7B0"/>
under the deluſive name of independence. His firſt indecent attack is againſt the Engliſh conſtitution; which with all its imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is, and ever will be the pride and envy of mankind. To this panegyric involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily our author ſubſcribes, by granting indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals to be ſafer in England, than in any other part of Europe. He indeed inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attributes this pre-eminent excellency, to the conſtitution of the people, rather than to our excellent conſtitution. To ſuch contemptible ſubterfuge is our Author reduced. I would aſk him, why did not the conſtitution of the people afford them ſuperior ſafety, in the reign of Richard the Third, Henry the Eighth, and other tyrannic princes? Many pages might indeed be filled with encomiums beſtowed on our excellent conſtitution, by illuſtrious authors of different nations.</p>
            <p>This beautiful ſyſtem (according to MONTESQUIEU) our conſtitution is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy. But it is often ſaid, that the Sovereign, by honours and appointments, influences the Commons. The profound and elegant HUME agitating this queſtion, thinks, to this circumſtance, we are in part indebted for our ſupreme felicity; ſince without ſuch controul in the Crown; our
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015088_0011_0F95E4535A84AA70"/>
Conſtitution would immediately degenerate into Democracy; a government, which in the ſequel, I hope to prove ineligible. Were I aſked marks of the beſt government, and the purpoſe of political ſociety, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, the encreaſe, preſervation, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its members, in no quarter of the Globe, are thoſe marks ſo certainly to be found, as in Great Britain, and her depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. After our Author has employed ſeveral pages, to break the mounds of ſociety by debaſing Monarchs: He ſays, "The plain truth is, that the antiquity of Engliſh Monarchy will not bear looking into."</p>
            <p>HUME treating of the original contract, has the following melancholy, but ſenſible obſervation, "Yet reaſon tells us, that there is no property in durable objects, ſuch as lands, and houſes, when carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, in paſſing from hand to hand, but muſt in ſome period, have been founded on fraud and injuſtice. The neceſſities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſociety, neither in private or public life, will allow of ſuch an accurate enquiry; and there is no virtue or moral duty, but what may, with facility, be refined away, if we indulge a falſe philoſophy, in ſifting and ſcrutinizing, by every captious rule of logic, in every light or poſition in which it may be placed."</p>

Say ye votaries of honour and truth, can we adduce a ſtronger proof of our Author's turpitude, than his quoting the anti-phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical ſtory of the Jews, to debaſe Monarchy, and the beſt of Monarchs. Briefly examining the ſtory of this contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible race, more barbarous than our ſavages: We find their hiſtory a continued ſucceſſion of miracles, aſtoniſhing our imaginations, and exerciſing our faith. After wandering forty years in horrid deſarts, they are chiefly condemned to periſh for their perverſeneſs, although under the immediate dominion of the KING of HEAVEN. At length, they arrive in the ſterile country of Paleſtine; which they conquer, by exterminating the inhabitants, and warring like Demons. The inhabitants of the adjoining regions, juſtly therefore held them in deteſtation, and the Jews finding themſelves conſtantly abhorred, have ever ſince hated all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This people, as deſtitute of arts and induſtry, as humanity, had not even in their language a word expreſſive of education. We might indeed remind our Author, who ſo readily drags in the Old Teſtament to ſupport his ſiniſter meaſures; that we could draw from that ſource, many texts, favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Monarchy, were we not conſcious, that the Moſaic Law, gives way to the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015088_0013_0F95E454E3C82418"/>
Goſpel Diſpenſation. The reader no doubt will be gratified by the following extract from a moſt primitive Chriſtian. "Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is a ſpiritual religion, relative only to celeſtial objects. The Chriſtian's inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not of this world. He performs his duty it is true, but this he does with a profound indifference for the good or ill ſucceſs of his endeavours: Provided he hath nothing to reproach himſelf, it is of little conſequence to him whether matters go well or ill here below. If the ſtate be in a flouriſhing condition, he can hardly venture to rejoice in the public felicity, leaſt he ſhould be puffed up, with the inordinate pride of his country's glory. If the ſtate decline, he bleſſes the hand of GOD, that humbles his people to the duſt."</p>
            <p>Having defined the beſt government, I will humbly attempt to deſcribe good Kings by the following unerring rule. The beſt Princes are conſtantly calumniated by the envenomed tongues and pens of the moſt worthleſs of their ſubjects. For this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy truth, do I appeal to the teſtimony of impartial hiſtorians; and long experience. The noble impartial hiſtorian Sully, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the almoſt divine Henry the Fourth of France ſays, "Thus was this god like prince repreſented (by the diſcontented of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015088_0014_0F95E455A9060F58"/>
theſe days) almoſt throughout his whole kingdom, as a furious, and implacable tyrant: They were never without one ſet of arguments to engage his catholic nobility in a rebellion againſt him; and another to ſow ſedition among his proteſtant officers and gentry." HUME ſays, that the cruel unrelenting tyrant, Philip the Second of Spain, with his infernal Inquiſition, was not more deteſted by the people of the Netherlands; than was the humane Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, with his inoffenſive Liturgy; by his mutinous ſubjects. The many unmerited inſults offered to our gracious Sovereign; by the unprincipled Wilkes, and others down to this late Author; will forever diſgrace humanity. For he ſays, "that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was the moſt proſperous inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Devil ever ſet on foot for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of idolatry. It is the pride of Kings which throws mankind into confuſion: In ſhort, continues this Author, monarchy and ſucceſſion, have laid not this or that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom only, but the World in blood and aſhes." How deplorably wretched the condition of mankind, could they believe ſuch execrable flagitious jargon. Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily indeed, mankind in every age are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of deluſion; but ſurely our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's poiſon carries its antidote with it.

Attentive to the ſpirit of his publication, we fancy ourſelves in the barbarous fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century; in which period our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have figured with his " Common Senſe—and blood will attend it."</p>
            <p>After his terrible anathema againſt our venerable conſtitution, and monarchy; let us briefly examine a democratical ſtate; and ſee whether or not it is a government leſs ſanguinary. This government is extremely plauſible, and indeed flattering to the pride of mankind. The demagogues therefore, to ſeduce the people into their criminal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns ever hold up democracy to them; although conſcious it never did, nor ever will anſwer in practice. If we believe a great Author, " There never exiſted, nor ever will exiſt a real democracy in the World." If we examine the republics of Greece and Rome, we ever find them in a ſtate of war domeſtic or foreign. Our Author therefore makes no mention of theſe ancient States. "When Alexander ordered all the exiles, to be reſtored throughout all the cities, it was found that the whole amounted to twenty thouſand, the remains probably of ſtill greater ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and maſſacres. What an aſtoniſhing number in ſo narrow a country as ancient Greece? and what domeſtic confuſion,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015088_0016_0F95E457263F8100"/>
jealouſy, partiality, revenge, heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings muſt tear thoſe cities, where factions were wrought up to ſuch a degree of fury and deſpair." Apian's hiſtory of the civil wars of Rome, contains the moſt fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful picture of maſſacres, proſcriptions, and forfeitures that ever were preſented to the world.</p>
            <p>The excellent Monteſquieu declares, "That a democracy ſuppoſes the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a number of circumſtances rarely united, in the firſt place, it is requiſite that the ſtate itſelf ſhould be of ſmall extent; ſo that the people might be eaſily aſſembled and perſonally known to each other. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the ſimplicity of their manners, ſhould be ſuch as to prevent a multiplicity of affairs, and perplexity in diſcuſſing them: And thirdly, there ſhould ſubſiſt a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of equality between them, in point of right and authority: Laſtly, there ſhould be little or no luxury, for luxury muſt either be the eflect of wealth, or it muſt make it neceſſary. It corrupts at once, both rich and poor: The one, by the poſſeſſion, and the other, by the want of it."To this may be added continues the ſame Author, "that no government is ſo ſubject to CIVIL WARS, and INTESTINE COMMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS, as that of the democratical or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015088_0017_0F95E457D4AF0B40"/>
form; becauſe, no other tends ſo ſtrongly and ſo conſtantly to alter, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſo much vigilance, and fortitude to preſerve it from alteration. It is indeed, in ſuch a conſtitution, particularly, that a Citizen ſhould always be armed with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and conſtancy; and ſhould every day, in the ſincerity of his heart, guard againſt corruption, ariſing either from ſelfiſhneſs in himſelf, or in his compatriots; for if it once enters into public tranſactions, to root it out afterwards would be miraculous.</p>
            <p>Our Author aſſerts, that Holland and Swiſſerland are without wars domeſtic or foreign. About a century ago, Holland was in a few weeks over-run by the arms of France, and almoſt miraculouſly ſaved by the gallantry of her Prince of Orange, ſo celebrated afterwards by the name of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the Third. Almoſt from that period, until the treaty of Utrecht, Holland was a principal in wars, the moſt expenſive and bloody, ever waged by humankind. The wounds ſhe then received were unhealed in 1744, when reluctantly rouſed from her pacific lethargy, ſhe was dragged into war; and loſing her impregnable Bergenopzoom, and Maeſtricht; was again on the brink of becoming a province to France, when happily liberated by the Britiſh Nation.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015088_0018_0F95E45896F096D0"/>
In the war of 1756. Holland continually inſulted in the capture of her ſhips, by our cruiſers; preſerved a humiliating neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If victory indeed had not crowned the the Britiſh banners; the Dutch indubitably would have aſſiſted their natural Allies, in whatever quarter of the globe attacked: For it is inconteſtibly true; that the exiſtence of Holland, as a State, depends, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably will depend, on the proſperity of Great Britain. Since the murder of Barne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt, and the immortal Dewits, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded furious people, Holland hath too often been convulſed by anarchy, and torn by party. Unfortunately alas! for the cauſe of humanity; the rugged and incult deſerts of Swiſſerland, preclude not ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſedition, and anarchy. Her bleak and barren mountains do not ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſecure precarious liberty, as daily vend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſons to the adjoining nations, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to France; by whom the thirteen Cantons, could be ſubjected in as many days, did that court meditate ſo ſenſeleſs and deluſive an object. Nugatory indeed, if we conſider, that France derives more ſubſtantial advantage from the preſent ſtate of Swiſſerland, than if ſhe exhauſted herſelf, to maintain numerous Battalions, to bridle the Cantons. A moment, let us
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015088_0019_0F95E45A64B59D10"/>
ſuppoſe, that our Author's aſſeverations of Holland and Swiſſerland, are as real as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive: His inferences do not flow from his premiſes; for their ſuperior advantages, do not ariſe from their popular government, but from circumſtances of peculiar local felicity, obliging the Princes of Europe, to defend them from the omnipotent land force, if I may ſo ſpeak of France. After impotently attacking our Sovereign; and the conſtitution: He contradicts the voice of all mankind, by declaring, that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica " would have flouriſhed as much, and probably much more, had no European power taken any notice of her."</p>
            <p>If he means, that had this Continent been unexplored, the original inhabitants would have been happier: For once, I agree with him. Previous to the ſettlement of theſe Provinces by our Anceſtors. The kingdom of France was convulſed by religious phrenzy. This, and Sebaſtian Cabot's prior diſcovery, perhaps, happily afforded the people of England, an opportunity of locating theſe Provinces. At length, peace being reſtored to France, by her Hero, Henry the Fourth: His nation in turn, were ſeized with the rage of colonizing. Finding the Engliſh claimed the Provinces on the Atlantic; they appropriated the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015088_0020_0F95E45ADA073158"/>
ſnow banks of Canada, which we dare not ſuppoſe, they would have preferred to theſe fertile Provinces, had not the prior occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancy, and power of England interfered. I hope it will not be denied, that the notice taken of us, at this time by an European Power, was rather favourable for us.—Certain it is, had not England then taken notice of us, theſe delectable Provinces would now appertain to France; and the people of New England, horrid to think, would now be counting their beads. Some years after the Aera in queſtion, the civil wars intervening in England, afforded to the Swedes and Dutch, a footing on this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. Charles the Second being reſtored; England reviving her claim, rendered abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the Swediſh pretenſions; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and granting Surinam to the Dutch, procured the ceſſion of ther uſurpation, now New York. I do indeed confeſs, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity to diſcern the injury ſuſtained by this ſecond "notice taken of us, by an European Power;" in default of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention, the Swedes, to this hour, would have retained their ſettlement, now the famed Pennſylvania; and the Dutch, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, had retained theirs. Some time after this period, the people of New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and were employed, in framing and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015088_0021_0F95E45B95A86348"/>
laws, ſo intolerant and ſanguinary, that to us, they ſeem adapted for devils, not men.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is worthy of note, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Jamaica, Barbadoes, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, at that very time, enacted laws, breathing the ſpirit of humanity, and ſuch as men could bear. Soon after the period in queſtion, arrived the great and good WILLIAM PENN, with his philoſophic people called Quakers; together with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, induſtry, and permanent credit. The people of England, encouraged by the extenſion of their laws and commerce to thoſe colonies, powerfully aſſiſted our merchants and planters, inſomuch, that our ſettlements encreaſed rapidly, and throve apace. It may be affirmed, that from this period, until the preſent unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py hour. No part of human kind, ever experienced more perfect felicity. Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire indeed ſays, that if ever the Golden Age exiſted, it was in Pennſylvania. France diſguſted with the unhappy ſituation of her American Colonies, had long me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated the conqueſt of one of our middle provinces. To accompliſh this purpoſe, ſhe extended a line of forts on our fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and actually fortified the place now called Pittſburgh. Juſtly alarmed by theſe
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015088_0022_0F95E45C5B4CD4A0"/>
encroachments in the hour of our diſtreſs, we called aloud on Great Britain for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, nor was ſhe deaf to our cries. The Engliſh miniſtry, after in vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting all the arts of negociation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared war againſt France. After ſpilling torrents of blood, after expending one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety millions of their dollars, and four or five millions of ours. They gloriouſly reduced the French ſettlements. Surely it will not be ſaid, that this laſt NOTICE taken of us by the people of England, was injurious to us. Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies indeed allege, that this laſt interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by bloating us with pride, will even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ruin us, and render the people of Britain objects of deriſion, for laviſhing their blood and treaſure, in defence of provinces; "a match not only for Europe, (according to our author,) but for the world."—Our author next remarks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "that the commerce by which ſhe hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched herſelf, are the neceſſaries of life, and will always have a market while eating is the cuſtom of Europe,"</p>
            <p>I reply, that our exporting grain, is as it were of yeſterday, that the recent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was principally occaſioned by the diſtractions in Poland, and other parts of Europe, and probably will totally or partly
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015088_0023_0F95E45D15B03348"/>
fail, ſoon as the fertile country of Poland, and more fertile Ukraine ſhall again become cultivated. I believe the Europeans did eat before our merchants exported our grain, and perhaps will eat, when they ceaſe to export it. I deny, that this momentary commerce hath enriched us; and I could adduce numberleſs melancholy proofs of the contrary. I ſhall only remark, that in the moſt fertile and delectable wheat coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in America, bounded by Cheſopeak-bay, and almoſt adjoining that of Delaware. A tract of the beſt wheat land ten years ago, would hardly have exceeded a guinea and a half per acre, indeed, in 1773, ſuch land covered with wood, would ſcarcely have ſold for four guineas an acre, an undoubted proof of want of PEOPLE, induſtry, and wealth; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, if we conſider that one crop of corn and wheat on ſuch land judiciouſly cultivated, would actually repay the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed price. Our author aſſerts, "that our preſent numbers are ſufficient to repel the force of all the world. That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent hath at this time the largeſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined army of ANY POWER UNDER HEAVEN. That the Engliſh navy is only worth three millions and a half ſterling," which, in effect, would reduce it to thirty-five
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015088_0024_0F95E45DDB0BB8A8"/>
ſhips of the line, twenty ſhips of forty guns, twenty of thirty-ſix, and eight of twenty guns. "That if America had only a twentieth part of this force, ſhe would be by far an over-match for Britain, that Independence is neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe France and Spain cannot aſſiſt us, until ſuch an event;" he alſo affirms, "that Great Britain cannot govern us, and that no good can ariſe from a reconciliation with her."</p>
            <p>I ſhall humbly endeavour to ſhew, that our author ſhamefully miſrepreſents facts, is ignorant of the true ſtate of Great Britain and her Colonies, utterly unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the arduous taſk, he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly aſſumed; and ardently intent on ſeducing us to that precipice on which himſelf ſtands trembling. To elucidate my ſtrictures, I muſt with fidelity expoſe the circumſtances of Great Britain and her colonies. If therefore, in the energy of deſcription, I unfold certain bold and honeſt truths with ſimplicity, the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reader will remember, that true knowledge of our ſituation, is as eſſential to our ſafety, as ignorance thereof may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger it. In the Engliſh provinces, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of negroe and other ſlaves, we have one hundred and ſixty thouſand; or one hundred and ſeventy thouſand men capable
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015088_0025_0F95E45E9ED6DA08"/>
of bearing arms. If we deduct the people called Quakers, Anabaptiſts, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioniſts averſe to arms; a conſiderable part of the emigrants, and thoſe having a grateful predilection for the ancient conſtitution and parent ſtate, we ſhall certainly reduce the firſt number to ſixty or ſeventy thouſand men. Now admitting thoſe equal to the Roman legions, can we ſuppoſe them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of defending againſt the power of Britain, a country nearly twelve hundred miles extending on the ocean. Suppoſe our troops aſſembled in New-England, if the Britons ſee not fit to aſſail them, they haſte to and deſolate our other provinces, which eventually would reduce New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. If by dividing our forces, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to defend our provinces, we alſo are infallibly undone. Our moſt fertile pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, filled with unnumbered domeſtic enemies, ſlaves; interſected by navigable rivers, every where acceſſible to the fleets and armies of Britain, can make no defence. If without the medium of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and prejudice, we view our other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, half armed, deſtitute of money and a navy: We muſt confeſs, that no power ever engaged ſuch POTENT ANTAGONISTS, under ſuch peculiar circumſtances of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. In the better days of Rome, ſhe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015088_0026_0F95E45F5FF90730"/>
permitted no regular troops to defend her. Men deſtitute of property the admitted not into her militia, (her only army.) I have been extremely concerned at the ſeparation of the Connecticut men from our army. It au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd not an ardent enthuſiaſm for liberty and glory. We ſtill have an army before Boſton, and I ſhould be extremely happy to hear ſubſtantial proofs of their glory. I am ſtill hopeful of great things from our army before Boſton, when joined by the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now forming, which WANT OF BREAD will probably ſoon fill. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the predilection I have for my countrymen, I remark with grief, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto our troops have diſplayed but few marks of Spartan or Roman enthuſiaſm. In the ſincerity of my heart, I adjure the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to believe, that no perſon is more ſenſibly afflicted by hearing the enemies of America remark, that no General ever fell ſingly and ſo ingloriouſly unrevenged before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auſpicious affair of Quebec. I am under no doubt, however, that we ſhall become as famed for martial courage, as any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever the ſun beheld. Sanguine as I am, reſpecting the virtue and courage of my countrymen, depending on the hiſtory of mankind, ſince the Chriſtian Aera, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not however imagine, that zeal for liberty
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015088_0027_0F95E46022C8D0D0"/>
will animate to ſuch glorious efforts of heroiſm, as religious enthuſiaſm hath often impelled its votaries to perform. If the cruel unrelenting tyrant Philip the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Spain, had never attempted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce into the Low Countries, the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tribunal of the Inquiſition: It is moſt probable, that the preſent States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, would to this time have remained provinces to Spain, and patiently paid the fiftieth penny and other grievous exactions. Certain it is, that the fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of Scotland, and people of England, had never armed againſt the firſt Charles, if religious enthuſiaſm had not more powerfully agitated their minds, than zeal for liberty, the operations of which, on the human mind, hath ſince the Aera in queſtion, ever been more languid, than the former moſt powerful paſſion. Theſe hardy aſſertions, are ſupported as well by notorious facts, as by the learned HUME, and other judicious hiſtorians. I cannot here omit remarking the inconſiſtency of human nature. The Scotch, the moſt furious enthuſiaſts then in Europe, were ſlaughtered like ſheep, by Cromwell at Dunbar, where their formidable army hardly made any reſiſtance, if we except that made by a handful of loyaliſts, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015088_0028_0F95E460DF8780B0"/>
of that paſſion. Certain it is, that thoſe enthuſiaſts, were often cut in pieces by their countryman, the gallant Marquis of Montroſe, whoſe troops (Highlanders and other loyaliſts,) held Preſbyterianiſm in contempt.</p>
            <p>With the utmoſt deference to the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Congreſs; I do not view the moſt diſtant gleam of aid from foreign powers. The princes alone, capable of ſuccouring us, are the Sovereign's of France and Spain. If according to our Author, we poſſeſs an eighth part of the habitable globe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually have a check on the Weſt India commerce of England. The French indigo, and other valuable Weſt India commodities, and the Spaniſh galeons, are in great jeopardy from our power. The French and Spaniards, are therefore wretched politicians, if they do not aſſiſt England, in reducing her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies to obedience.—Pleaſantry apart! Can we be ſo deluded, to expect aid from thoſe princes, which inſpiring their ſubjects with a reliſh for liberty, might eventually ſhake their arbitrary thrones.—Natural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed enemies to our ſacred cauſe: Will they cheriſh, will they ſupport the flame of liberty in America? Ardently intent, on extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its latent dying ſparks in their reſpective dominions. Can we believe, that thoſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015088_0029_0F95E461D3E54EB8"/>
princes will offer an example ſo dangerous to their ſubjects and colonies, by aiding thoſe provinces to independence? If inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, aggrandized by infinite numbers from every part of Europe, this Continent would rapidly attain power aſtoniſhing to imagination. Soon, very ſoon would we be conditioned to conquer Mexico; and all their Weſt India ſettlements, which to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy, or poſſeſs, we indeed are moſt happily ſituated. Simple and obvious as theſe truths are, can they be unknown to the people and princes of Europe? Be it however admitted, that thoſe princes unmindful of the fatal policy of RICHLIEU'S arming Charles's ſubjects againſt him, and the more fatal policy of LEWIS the fourteenth permitting our glorious deliverer to effect the Revolution. I ſay, be it admitted, that thoſe princes regardleſs of future conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and the ineptitude of the times, are really diſpoſed to ſuccour us. Say, ye friends of liberty and mankind, would no danger accrue from an army of French and Spaniards in the boſom of America? would ye not dread their junction with the Canadians and Savages, and with the numerous Roman Catholics, diſperſed throughout the Colonies?</p>

Let us now briefly view the pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently envied ſtate of Great Britain. If we regard the power of Britain, unembarraſſed with Continental connections, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical balance, we may juſtly pronounce her what our author does, AMERICA;—"A match for all Europe." Amazing were the efforts of England, in the war of Queen Ann, when little benefited by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony commerce, and e'er ſhe had availed herſelf of the courage, good ſenſe, and numbers of the people of Scotland and Ireland.</p>
            <p>That England then preſcribed laws to Europe, will be long remembered. Laſt war, her glory was, if poſſible, more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently exalted, in every quarter of the globe did victory hover round her armies and navies, and her fame re-echoed from pole to pole. At preſent Great Britain is the umpire of Europe. It is not exaggeration to affirm, that the Ruſſians principally are indebted for their laurels, to her power, which alone retained France from prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ruin of her ancient faithful ally, The Ottoman Porte, ſuperfluous it were to enumerate her powerful alliances, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her immenſe reſources. Her raiſing the incredible ſums of eighteen, nineteen, and twenty-two millions ſterling for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015088_0031_0F95E464AB8C8770"/>
of the years 1759-60, and 61, was more aſtoniſhing to Europe, than the victories of her fleets and armies. The annual rents of the kingdom of England only, many years ago, amounted to thirty three millions ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Thirty five millions buſhels of wheat are annually produced in that kingdom; and perhaps as many buſhels of other grain: Twelve millions of fleeces of wool are there yearly ſhorn. In ſhort, the Kingdom is a perfect Bee-hive, in numbers and induſtry; and is ſaid to contain more induſtry, conſequently more wealth, than all the reſt of Europe. The famed HUME ſays, "I ſhould as ſoon dread, that all our rivers and ſprings, ſhould be exhauſted, as that money ſhould abandon a kingdom, where there are people and induſtry." The Britiſh navy, at the cloſe of laſt war, conſiſted of nearly two hundred ſhips of the line, one hundred large frigates, and about one hundred ſmaller frigates, or other armed veſſels. Since the peace, I believe, the navy has been moſt vigilantly preſerved by Lord Sandwich, (ſaid to be as equal to that ardous department, as any man in Europe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Since the war, ſeveral capital ſhips have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually been built; and it is moſt certain, that on ſix months notice, Great Britain could equip fleets, ſufficiently formidable, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with all the naval force, that could,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015088_0032_0F95E465633F8388"/>
or would act againſt her. The immenſe quantity of naval and other ſtores, in the different arſenals, with the royal navy<note n="*" place="bottom">Seventeen capital ſhips were built from 1763 until 1771.</note> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at this time be worth leſs than twenty millions ſterling. The iſland of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, between ſix and ſeven hundred miles in length, and upwards of two thouſand miles circumference; and being every where indented with harbours, forms (with other cauſes) ſuch nurſeries of ſeamen, as the world cannot produce.</p>
            <p>Let us now examine our Author's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the navy of Great-Britain. "It is ſays he, worth no more than three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and an half ſterling." This in effect will reduce it to ten ſecond rate ſhips of war, ten third rate, fifteen fourth rate, ten ſhips of forty guns, ten of thirty-ſix, and eight of twenty. "If America ſays he, had only a twentieth part of the naval force of Britain, ſhe would be by far an over-match for her, becauſe as we neither have, nor claim any foreign dominion, our whole force would be employed on our own coaſt; where we ſhould in the long-run have two to one the advantage of thoſe who had three or four thouſand miles to ſail over,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015088_0033_0F95E46622CAE028"/>
before they could attack us; and the ſame diſtance to return, in order to refit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit. And although Britain by her fleet, hath a check over our trade to Europe, we have as large a one over her trade to the Weſt Indies, which, by laying in the neighbourhood of the Continent, lies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at its mercy."</p>
            <p>Were it lawful to joke on ſo ſerious an occaſion, I would remind the reader of our Author's modeſty, in ſaying, "that we claim no foreign dominion:" Since we have the moſt numerous, and beſt diſciplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed army under the Heaven; and a navy ſufficiently ſtrong to combat that of Great Britain. For our preſent naval armament compoſe a fleet more than equal to a twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of the Britiſh navy, (according to our Author's eſtimation.) Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Author's delicacy, relying on the well known utility of Melaſſes, to the New-England governments: I hope they will order Admiral Manly to ſeiſe Jamaica, and the other Weſt India Iſlands. The Admiral cannot be at a loſs for men; ſince, according to our Author, "a few ſocial ſailors, will ſoon inſtruct a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of active land-men, in the common work of a ſhip. I do indeed confeſs, that the Britiſh ſhips of war, are conſtantly
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015088_0034_0F95E466E23318B0"/>
equipt altogether with very ſocial ſailors; and as conſtantly drub the French ſhips, double mann'd, with active landmen, tho' ſufficiently inſtructed by a few <hi>ſocial ſailors.</hi> The reader will perceive, that our Author, has humbled the naval power of Britain, with more facility, than France and Spain could have done: And, has alſo expelled her from our ports with happier ſucceſs, than did Spain; who was compelled to yield her Gibralter and Portmahon, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of her fleets and commerce.</p>
            <p>We muſt indeed allow, that Spain, tho' poſſeſſed of Mexico and Peru, cannot maintain the moſt numerous and beſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined army under Heaven, nor equip a navy fit to contend with the fleets of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. It muſt alſo be confeſſed, that he makes Great Britain, very favourably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of her humbled navy; by employing nineteen parts of it in the Mediterranean, Aſia, Africa, and I know not where: When he knows we have ſo great a check on her Weſt India trade, a commerce, of the laſt importance to her.</p>
            <p>I would bluſh for poor human nature, did I imagine that any man, other than a bigot could believe theſe ridiculous ſtories, theſe arrant gaſconades, reſpecting our numerous and beſt diſciplined army under heaven,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015088_0035_0F95E467A1F2CFA8"/>
about our navy, and a few ſocial ſailors, and that France and Spain will not aſſiſt us, (who by-the-by, according to our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, are able to conquer them,) until playing upon words, we declare ourſelves INDEPENDENT. Can a reaſonable being for a moment believe that Great Britain, whoſe political exiſtence depends on our conſtitutional obedience, who but yeſterday made ſuch prodigious efforts to ſave us from France, will not exert herſelf as powerfully to preſerve us from our frantic ſchemes of Independency. Can we a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doubt, that the Sovereign of Great Britain and his miniſters, whoſe glory as well as perſonal ſafety depends on our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, will not exert every nerve of the Britiſh power, to ſave themſelves and us from ruin.</p>
            <p>"Much ſays our author has been ſaid of the ſtrength of Britain and the Colonies, that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world; but this is mere preſumption, the fate of war is uncertain."</p>
            <p>Excellent reaſoning, and truly conſiſtent with our author. We of ourſelves are a match for Europe, nay for the world; but in junction with the moſt formidable power on earth; why then, the matter is mere preſumption. The fate of war is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015088_0036_0F95E46864EC1A48"/>
It is indeed humiliating to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that this author ſhould vamp up a form of government, for a conſiderable part of mankind; and in caſe of its ſucceeding, that he probably would be one of our ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, until we prayed ſome more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tyrant of the army, to ſpurn him to his primeval obſcurity; from all his ill-got honours flung, turned to that dirt from whence he ſprung. "A government of our own, is our natural right," ſays our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, "had right decided, and not fate the cauſe, Rome had preſerved her Cato and her laws." Unfortunately for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, thoſe are fine ſounding words, which ſeldom or ever influence human affairs. If they did, inſtead of appropriating the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant lands to ſchemes of ambition, we muſt inſtantly deputiſe envoys to the Indians, praying them to re-enter their former poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and permit us quietly to depart to the country of our anceſtors, where we would be welcome gueſts. But continues our author, "What have we to do with ſetting the world at defiance? our plan is commerce, and that well attended to, will ſecure us the peace and friendſhip of all Europe. Becauſe it is the intereſt of all Europe, to have America a free-port, her trade will always be her protection, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015088_0037_0F95E46923599368"/>
her barrenneſs of gold and ſilver, will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her from invaders."</p>
            <p>I am perfectly ſatiſfied, that we are in no condition to ſet the world at defiance, that commerce and the protection of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain will ſecure us peace, and the friendſhip of all Europe. But I deny, that it is the intereſt of all Europe, to have America a free port, unleſs they are deſirous of depopulating their dominions. His aſſertions, that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs of gold and ſilver will ſecure us from invaders, is indeed highly pleaſant, have we not a much better ſecurity from invaſions, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the moſt numerous and beſt diſciplined army under heaven; or has our author al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſbanded it. Pray how much gold and ſilver do the mines of Flanders pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce? and what country ſo often has ſeen its unhappy fields drenched with blood, and fertiliſed with human gore. The princes of Europe have long dreaded the migration of their ſubjects to America; and we are ſenſible, that the king of Pruſſia is ſaid more than once to have hanged Newlanders, or thoſe who ſeduced his ſubjects to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate. I alſo humbly apprehend, that Britain is a part of Europe. Now <hi>old gentleman,</hi> as you have clearly ſhewn, that we have a check upon her Weſt India trade? Is it her intereſt to give us a greater check
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015088_0038_0F95E469E4F6CC90"/>
upon it, by permitting America (as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it,) to become a free port. Can we ſuppoſe it to be her intereſt to loſe her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable commerce to the Colonies, which effectually ſhe would do, by giving up A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica to become your free port. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the intereſt of all Europe, to have America a free port: The people of Britain are extremely ſimple to expend ſo many millions ſterling to prevent it. "It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the nature of things to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples from former ages, to ſuppoſe that this Continent can long remain ſubject to any external power."</p>
            <p>Antiquity affords us to eclarciſement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the future government of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Rome ſituated in a ſterile corner of Italy, long, long, retained the then world in chains, and probably had maintained her dominion longer, had not the croſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the empire to Byzantium, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the eagles, and in turn, juſtly been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Barbarians. I ſee no reaſon to doubt, that Great Britain, may not long retain us in conſtitutional obedience. Time, the deſtroyer of human affairs may indeed, end her political life by a gentle decay. Like Rome, ſhe may be conſtrained to defend herſelf from the Huns, and Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks of the North. Ingratefully ſhould we endeavour to precipitate her political
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015088_0039_0F95E46C702D1588"/>
demiſe, ſhe will deviſe every expedient; to retain our obedience; and rather than fail, will participate thoſe provinces amongſt the potent ſtates of Europe. "The authority of Great Britain over this Continent, is a form of government which ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt have an end."</p>
            <p>This I have granted, and I add, that a million of revolutions may happen on this Continent, for every one of which, I am not indeed ſo over ſolicitous, as our Phoenix of Whims, the Author of Common Senſe. "The Colonies have manifeſted ſuch a ſpirit of good order and obedience to continental government, as is ſufficient to make every perſon happy on that head."</p>
            <p>What is this union ſo highly vaunted off? whence the marching and counter-march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through almoſt every province to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm thoſe denominated tories?—I perfectly agree, that glorious is our union.—I exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate thoſe who ſay, it has been cemented by every ſpecies of fraud and violence: Yet notwithſtanding I dread its fragility; were an army of Britons in the middle of our country. As the Author of Common Senſe is now in the grand monde; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acquainted with the language of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people in the provinces: I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the general purport of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.—"We, ſay they, do not ſee
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015088_0040_0F95E46D2F5314F0"/>
through the wiſdom of the preſent times. We remember with unſeigned gratitude, the many benefits derived through our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections with Great Britain, by whom but yeſterday, we were emancipated from ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and death. We are not indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware, that Great Britain is uniformly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with defending us from intereſted motives. In like manner, however, may every ingrate, reproach his benefactor; ſince all benefactions may be ſaid to flow from no purer fountain. With predilection, we view our parent ſtate, and wiſhfully contemplate on our late felicity, almoſt realizing that ſtate of old, ſo beautifully feigned by the poets. We venerate the conſtitution, which with all its imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (too often exaggerated) we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend almoſt approaches as near to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as human kind can bear. We ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the idea of arming with more virulence, more unremitting ardour, againſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate, than againſt France; by whom our RIGHTS, CIVIL, as well as RELIGIOUS, certainly were more imminently endangered. With horror we reflect on the former civil wars, when every crime, odious and baneful to human nature, were alternately perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the ſoldiers, particularly by the Independents."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:015088_0041_0F95E46DA3F17250"/>
"Every quiet method of peace has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual: our prayers have been rejected with diſdain." I do not indeed agree with the people of England in ſaying, that thoſe, who ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully laboured to widen the breach—deſired nothing leſs than peace. That they who ſhortly were to command the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and beſt diſciplined army under Heaven; and a navy fit to contend with the fleets of England; imagining, <hi>the time had found us,</hi> diſdained to be juſt. I highly venerate a majority of the Delegates. I have not indeed the honour of knowing all the worthy members; however, I wiſh the Gentlemen of the Congreſs, 'ere they entered on their important charge, had been better acquainted, with the ſtrength of our friends in parliament. I ſincerely lament, that the King did not receive the laſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ellent petition from the Congreſs; and I as ſincerely wiſh, the Gentlemen of the Congreſs had not addreſſed themſelves at that juncture, to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> of Ireland. "As to government matters," (continues our Author,) "it is not in the power of Britain to do this Continent juſtice: The buſineſs of it will ſoon be too weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of convenience, by a power ſo very diſtant from us, and ſo very ignorant of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015088_0042_0F95E46E64A9F4B0"/>
us; for if they cannot conquer us, they cannot govern us. The difference between Pennſylvania, and Connecticut, reſpecting ſome unlocated lands, ſhews the inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance of a Britiſh government, and fully proves, that nothing but Continental au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can regulate Continental matters."</p>
            <p>Until the preſent unhappy period, Great Britain has afforded to all mankind, the moſt perfect proof of her wiſe lenient, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous government of the Colonies—The proofs to which we already have alluded, <abbr>viz.</abbr> our ſupreme felicity, and amazing increaſe. Than the affair of the Connecticut invaders; Omnipotence only could grant us ſtronger reaſons for praying a continuance of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer beneficent government. Moſt certainly, every diſpaſſionate perſon, as well as the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Pennſylvanians, muſt confeſs; that the Arm of Great Britain alone detained thoſe Free-booters aforeſaid, from ſeiſing the city of Philadelphia, to which without all doubt, they have as juſt a claim, as to thoſe fertile regions in Pennſylvania, which they ſurrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiouſly have poſſeſſed themſelves of. In wrath to mankind, ſhould Heaven permit our Author's new fangled government to exiſt; I as a friend to Pennſylvanians, adviſe them to explore new ſettlements, and avoid the cruel mortification of being expelled by the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015088_0043_0F95E46F243593B8"/>
               <hi>Saints</hi> from their delicious abodes and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fields—"But (ſays the Author) the moſt powerful argument is, that nothing but independence, (that is a Continental form of government) can keep the peace of the Continent, and preſerve it inviolate from civil wars. I dread the event of a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation now with Britain, as it is more than probable, that it will be followed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt ſomewhere; the conſequences of which may be far more fatal than all the malice of Britain. Thouſands are already ruined by Britiſh barbarity, thouſands more will probably ſhare the ſame fate. Theſe men have other feelings, than thoſe who have nothing ſuffered: All they now poſſeſs is liberty, what they before enjoyed is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to its ſervice, and having nothing more to loſe, they diſdain all ſubmiſſion."</p>
            <p>Here we cannot miſtake our Author's meaning, that if one or more of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or ſouthern Colonies reconcile with Great Britain, they will have war to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with New England; "the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of which may be more detrimental, than all the malice of Britain." This ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible denunciation, fortunately for ſuch Colonies; is as futile as its author. Should Great Britain re-eſtabliſh her authority in the ſaid Colonies by negociation; ſurely it
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015088_0044_0F95E46FDFCD6F08"/>
is not temerity to add, that the weight of Britain, in the ſcales of thoſe provinces, would preponderate againſt the power of New England. If Britain ſhould reduce the colonies by arms, (which may Heaven avert!) The New England provinces will have as little inclination, as ability, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the peace of their neighbours. I do indeed moſt ſincerely compaſſionate thoſe unhappy men, who are ruined by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate diſtractions. I do fervently pray, that Britain, and the Colonies may moſt effectually conſider their peculiar infelicity. Such attention will do infinite honour to the parent ſtate; who cannot view them as enemies, but as men unhappy irritated by the impolitic meaſures of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. "The diminution of trade affords an army, and the neceſſities of an army, create a new trade." (So ſays our Author) I am ſurpriſed the miniſtry, ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with ruining the commerce of Britain; never urged, (what was never thought or ſaid before.) Our Author's excellent axiom; "that the diminution, &amp;c." Certain it is, the minority had replied, ſince the commencement of this century; the diminution of the commerce of France hath afforded her nearly one million of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; but the neceſſities of this prodigious
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015088_0045_0F95E470A5CCA2C0"/>
number of troops, created her ſo bad a commerce, that ſhe hath twice proved bankrupt ſince, and more than once experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the miſeries of famine.</p>
            <p>"If premiums (ſays our Author) were to be given to Merchants to build and employ in their ſervice, ſhips mounted with 20, 30,40, or 50 guns, the premiums to be in proportion to the loſs of bulk to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. Fifty or ſixty of thoſe ſhips, with a few guard ſhips on conſtant duty, would keep up a ſufficient navy, and that without burdening ourſelves with the evil ſo loudly complained of in England, of ſuffering their fleets in time of peace to lie rotting in their docks." Yield the palm of ingenuity to our Author, ye Dewits, Colberts, Pelhams, and Pitts. He has outdone ye by conſtructing a beautiful navy; alas! on paper only.—Firſt, no nation in Europe depends on ſuch ſhips for her defence: Secondly, ſuch ſhips would be unfit to contend with capital ſhips: Thirdly, in the hour of danger, theſe ſhips on their voyage, or return, would alternately be taken by an active enemy: Laſtly, ſix times as many ſuch ſhips would be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually matched with that part of the naval power of Britain, which ſhe actually could ſpare to combat on our coaſts. This cannot be thought exaggeration, if we conſider
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015088_0046_0F95E47163ECABA8"/>
that the Britiſh navy, laſt war, carried about ſeventeen thouſand guns; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of ninety five thouſand ſocial ſeamen."No country (ſays our Author) is ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſituated, or internally capable of raiſing a fleet as America. Tar, timber, Iron and cordage are her natural produce." He ſpeaks of forming a fleet, as if he could do it by his fiat. A third rate ſhip of the line fitted for ſea, is allowed to coſt ſeventy four thouſand pounds ſterling, which at the preſent exchange, is about one hundred and twenty nine thouſand pounds. Now, as labour, ſail cloth, cordage, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites, are dearer than in Europe, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe the advanced price, at twenty-five per cent. which makes the amount one hundred and fifty four thouſand pounds. We muſt next ſuppoſe our navy equal to that of France; which conſiſts of ſixty four ſhips of the line (fifty gun ſhips incluſive) twenty five frigates, with ſhips of inferior force. In caſe of independence, we cannot admit a ſmaller naval force. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when joined to the fleets of France and Spain, the natives ſo united, and navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated principally with landſmen, inſtructed by a few ſocial ſailors, will be vaſtly infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the ſquadrons of Britain. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount therefore of ſuch our navy, will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015088_0047_0F95E4722849C820"/>
require the trifling ſum of twelve mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, ſix hundred and twenty five thouſand pounds currency, which I am very willing to believe we can ſpare, being ſcarcely one fourth the value of our property, real and perſonal. With excellent management, our navy would laſt eight, nine, or ten years: we therefore would find it extremely conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to rebuild it conſtantly at the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that term: Of this there cannot be a doubt, when we remember with our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, "that ſhip-building is America's greateſt pride. The vaſt empire of Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia is almoſt ſhut out from the ſea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her boundleſs forreſts, her tar, iron, and cordage, are only articles of commerce." I reply, that Ruſſia containing ten times our numbers, is deſtitute of Induſtry and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. She has ports ſufficient to build and contain a navy to ſubdue the world. Deſtitute as we have remarked of induſtry and commerce, her navy is inconſiderable; and being equipt with landſmen, cannot figure againſt ſhips navigated by ſocial ſailors. Who can doubt the ability of Spain to build a navy. The cargo of two or three of her annual galeons were ſufficient to build a navy as formidable as that permitted to Great Britain (by the Author of Common Senſe.) In her Iſland of Cuba, poſſeſſed of
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015088_0048_0F95E472E8B38670"/>
an immenſity of fine cedar; ſhe might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct a navy as formidable as that of Great Britain, but to what purpoſe, other than to adorn the triumph of her enemies; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe could arm her ſhips otherwiſe than by active landſmen, inſtructed by a few ſocial ſailors. Our Author ſays, "that the Terrible, Capt. D<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath ſtood the hotteſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of any ſhip laſt war, yet had not twenty ſailors on board," (tho' her compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men was upwards of two hundred)</p>
            <p>We do indeed confeſs ourſelves doubtful on this head, and therefore wiſh our Author had produced his authority. We do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that naval actions, very generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on ſeaman-ſhip, that is, on dextrouſly working the ſhip during the combat. Now the judicious reader will remember, that ſhips of war in engagement cannot be navigated by a few ſocial ſailors, nor even by a bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, unleſs ſuch ſailors are more invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable than was the great Achilles.</p>
            <p>"Were the Continent (ſays our Author) crowded with inhabitants, her ſufferings under the preſent circumſtances, would be intolerable, the more ſea ports we had, the more we ſhould have both to defend, and to loſe." This is rather incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I cannot imagine, that we would be leſs formidable with ten times our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:015088_0049_0F95E4754CA99F78"/>
numbers, if at preſent we can defend one ſea-port; ſurely, with ten times as many inhabitants, we could equally defend ten. If with our preſent numbers, we are a match for the world, conſequently with ten times as many, we would be a match for ten worlds, which would indeed be prodigious! The infant ſtate of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies as it is called, ſo far from being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, is an argument in favour of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence." This aſſertion is as abſurd, as if he had maintained, that twenty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior in number to two. "But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and diſadvantages we ſuſtain by that connection, are without number, and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to ourſelves, inſtruct us to renounce the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance. Becauſe any ſubmiſſion to, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon Great Britain, tends di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to involve this Continent in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean wars and quarrels. As Europe is our market for trade, we ought to form no poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical connection with any part of it." Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable are the advantages of our connection with Britain; and a juſt dependence on her, is a ſure way to avoid the horrors and calamities of war. Wars in Europe, will probably than heretofore become leſs frequent, religious rancour, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly animated princes to arms, is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015088_0050_0F95E475F1C827E8"/>
by a ſpirit of philoſophy extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friendly to peace. The princes of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope are or ought to be convinced by ſad experience, that the objects of conqueſt, are vaſtly inadequate to the immenſe charge of their armaments. Prudential motives, therefore, in future, will often dictate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, inſtead of war. Be it however admitted, that our ſpeculations are nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and that as uſual, we are involved in war. In this caſe we really do not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate a twentieth part of the miſery and hardſhips of war, experienced by the other ſubjects of the empire. As future wars will probably be carried on by Britain in her proper element, her ſucceſs will hardly be doubtful, nor can this be thought audacity, if we remember the great things effected by Britain in her naval wars, then ſecondary objects to her Germanic Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, to which ſhe now politically ſeems indifferent. Our ſailors navigating our veſſels to the Weſt Indies during war, are exempted from impreſſment, and if our trade to any part of Europe is then ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, it flows with uncommon rapidity in the Weſt Indies, nor is the object of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>Our author ſurely forgets that when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, we cannot trade with Europe,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:015088_0051_0F95E476A9BDF190"/>
without political connections, and that all treaties made by England or other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial ſtates are, or ought to be, ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately ſubſervient to their commerce. "But (ſays our author,) admitting that matters were now made up what would be the event? I anſwer, the ruin of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and that for ſeveral reaſons." Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation would conduct us to our former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſtate. The happineſs of the governed is without doubt the true intereſt of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and if we aim not at independence, there cannot be a doubt of receiving every advantage relative to laws and commerce that we can deſire. Monteſquieu ſpeaking of the people of England ſays. "They know better than any people on earth, how to value at the ſame time theſe three great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, religion, liberty, and commerce." "It is a matter worthy of obſervation, that the more a country is peopled, the ſmaller their armies are." This indeed would be worthy of obſervation, did not daily experience contravert it. The armies of Ruſſia, France, Auſtria, England, and Pruſſia, are certainly more numerous than thoſe of Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, and Sardinia. Now, the firſt five ſtates contain nearly ſixty millions, and the laſt kingdoms do not contain fourteen millions
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015088_0052_0F95E47763CC3328"/>
of people. "In military numbers, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients far exceeded the moderns, and the reaſon is evident, for trade being the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of population, men become too much abſorbed thereby, to attend to any thing elſe, commerce diminiſhes the ſpirit both of patriotiſm, and military defence."</p>
            <p>Every man of ſenſe, now rejects the fabulous numbers of the army of Xerxes, and other fabled armies of antiquity. The ancient armies, did not exceed in numbers the armies of the moderns. If ſo, their ſtates had been deſolated by the horrid carnage of their battles, ariſing from the military ſpirit of defence, from the nature of their arms, and the arrangement of their armies, which permitted the combatants to buckle together, who ſeldom gave quarter. The Roman armies never exceeded twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five legions, which including auxiliaries, did not exceed two hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, a number greatly inferior to the armies of France or perhaps Britain during war. Notwithſtanding my ardour for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, I do moſt fervently pray, that we may ever exchange the ſpirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, for that of military defence, even at the price of augmenting our armies. Let us hear the teſtimony of Monteſquieu in favour of commerce: "Commerce ſays
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015088_0053_0F95E47820B3FE78"/>
he, is a cure for the moſt deſtructive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, for it is almoſt a general rule, that wherever we find agreeable manners, there commerce flouriſhes. Let us not be aſtoniſhed then, if our manners are now leſs ſavage than formerly. Commerce has every where diffuſed a knowledge of all nations, theſe are compared one with another, and from this compariſon ariſe the greateſt advantages. Peace is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural effect of trade, &amp;c." The Athenian people, perhaps the moſt reſpectable of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, did not long poſſeſs a commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſpirit, but were almoſt continually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by this ſpirit of military defence. The common people in effect diſtributed the public revenues amongſt themſelves, while the rich, were in a ſtate of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. According to Lyſius the orator and others, it was their cuſtom, when in want of money, to put to death ſome of the rich citizens, as well as ſtrangers, for the ſake of the forfeiture. In ſhort, could we enumerate the infinite train of misfortunes inflicted on mankind, in every clime and age by this ſelf-ſame ſpirit of military de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; our readers would ſurely join us in opinion, that commerce has moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily humanized mankind. I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware, that there are many declamations
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:015088_0054_0F95E478E73B9440"/>
againſt commerce, theſe I have ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as trials of wit, rather than ſerious productions. Our author's antipathy, and extreme averſion to commerce, is eaſily accounted for. If his independence takes place, I do aver, that commerce will be as uſeleſs, as our ſearching for the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's ſtone. "And hiſtory (ſays he,) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently informs us, that the braveſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements were always accompliſhed in the non-age of a nation." The Greeks in their early ſtate were pirates, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans robbers and both warred in character. Their glorious actions were performed, (if I may ſo expreſs myſelf) in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their empire. Carthage, Greece, Aſia, Spain, Gaul, and Britain, were not indeed conquered during the non-age of the republic. Agincourt, Creſſy, Oude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Ramillies, Blenheim, Dettingen, and Minden, ſurely were not fought in the infancy of the Engliſh empire. "With the encreaſe of commerce, England has loſt her ſpirit." This is really a curious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; who is unacquainted, that the Engliſh are the lords and factors of the univerſe, and that Britain joins to the commerce of Tyre, Carthage and Venice, the diſcipline of Greece, and the fire of old Rome. "The City of London, ſubmits to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:015088_0055_0F95E479A7D9D3F8"/>
inſults, with the patience of a coward. The more men have to loſe, the leſs wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they are to venture, and ſubmit to courtly power with the trembling duplicity of a ſpaniel." That an inconſiderable part of the people in London, ſubmit to a perſon not very honourably diſtinguiſhed in the world is certain, but that the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſubmits to continued inſults is certainly a miſtake. I ſuppoſe our author means, that by ſubmitting to the beſt laws on earth they ſubmit to continued inſults. The rich, whom he ſo very honourably diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, can be at no loſs for his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. An Agrarian law, would perhaps be convenient for himſelf and his independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. It may not however be amiſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind him of that, which in the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his projects, he may have forgot, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the richeſt part of the community will always be an overmatch for the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part. "It might be difficult, (ſays our author,) if not impoſſible, to form this Continent into a government half a century hence."</p>
            <p>Here I humbly apprehend our author's meaning is truly conſpicuous. This Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent fifty years hence, infallibly will be richer, and much better peopled than at preſent; conſequently abler to effect a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:015088_0056_0F95E47A5FB270E0"/>
But alas e're that period, our author will forever be forgotten; impelled therefore by his villainous ambition, he would rather precipitate his country into every ſpecies of horror, miſery, and deſolation, rather than forego his fancied protectorſhip. "But if you have, (ſays our author) and ſtill can ſhake hands with the murderers, then are ye unworthy the name of huſband, father, friend, or lover, and whatever may be your rank or title in life, you have the heart of a coward, and the ſpirit of a ſycophant, &amp;c. To talk of friendſhip with thoſe in whom our reaſon forbids us to have faith, and our affections wounded through a thouſand pores, inſtructs us to deteſt is madneſs and folly."</p>
            <p>Ye that are not drunk with fanaticiſm anſwer me? Are theſe words dictated by peace, or baſe foul revenge, the conſtant attendant on COWARDS and ſycophants; Does our author ſo perfectly verſed in ſcripture, mean to conduct us to peace or deſolation; or is he fit to legiſlate for men or Devils? Nations after deſolating each other, (happily for mankind,) forgive, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, and reconcile; like individuals who quarrel, reconcile, and become friends. Following the laudable example of the CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRESS; we lately have moſt readily ſhaken
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:015088_0057_0F95E47B2395D530"/>
hands with our inveterate enemies the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who have ſcalped nearly as many of our people as the Britiſh troops have done: Why therefore may we not forgive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile—By no means, it blaſts our author's ambitious purpoſes. The Engliſh and Scotch, ſince the firſt Edward's time, have alternately ſlaughtered each other, (in the field of Bannockburn, more men fell, than are now in the New-England provinces) to the amount of ſeveral hundred thouſand: And now view each other as ſubjects, deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the efforts of certain turbulent ſpirits, tending the rekindle the ancient animoſity. Many of the unhappy men criminally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with the Pretender: reconciled by humane treatment to that family againſt whom they rebelled; ſerved in their armies a few years after. Indeed the conduct of the Canadians to our troops, as effectually illuſtrates our doctrine, as it reprobates the Anti-chriſtian, diabolical tenets of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.—"The unwarrantable ſtretch like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which that houſe made in their laſt ſitting, to gain an undue authority over the Delegates of that province, ought to warn the people at large, how they truſt POWER OUT OF THEIR OWN HANDS. A ſet of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for the Delegates were put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which in point of ſenſe, and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:015088_0058_0F95E47BDF397FF0"/>
would have diſhonored a ſchool-boy, and after being approved by a few, a very few, without doors, were carried into the houſe, and there paſſed in behalf of the whole Colony. Whereas, did the whole Colony know, with what ill will that houſe hath entered on ſome neceſſary public mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they would not heſitate a moment to think them unworthy of ſuch a truſt." This very inſidious charge, we cannot read without indignation. If the Pennſylvanians, had happily adhered to their virtuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, it is more than probable, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional reconciliation had e're now taken place. Unfortunately, reſcinding their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, they perhaps adopted the ſentiments of <hi>certain perſons,</hi> by no means ſuperior in virtue or knowledge. Thoſe not inebriated with independency, will certainly allow, that the inſtructions to their Delegates, were dictated by the true ſpirit of peace, juſtice, and exalted policy. If inſpiration had dictated thoſe Reſolves; obnoxious as they are to independency, our author had repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated them. How dare the author of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe ſay, "that they attempted to gain an undue authority over the Delegates of their province?" Who ſo proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, as thoſe choſen by the people; not in the hour of paſſion, riot, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015088_0059_0F95E47CA35A75F8"/>
but in the day of peace and tranquil reflection. The gentleman, whom our author impotently attacks, in this and other innuendos; will be long revered by his grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countrymen, and the friends of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; as well for his true patriotiſm and extenſive abilities, as his unbounded bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. Would we profit by the unhappy examples of our anceſtors, (which alas! mankind too ſeldom do,) let us remember the fate of thoſe illuſtrious patriots, of the firſt Charles's time: Allied at firſt with the independents; they did not ſuſpect thoſe execrable hypocrites, of the horrid deſign of deſtroying the King and conſtitution. When they ſaw through their abominable views, it was too late to ſave the King and kingdom: For the independents had ſeized the ſovereignty. Soon as they were firmly poſſeſſed of power; they perſecuted thoſe illuſtrious patriots, with more unrelenting virulence, than the profeſſed advocates of arbitrary power, Every virtuous Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanian, muſt be fired with indignation at the inſidious attack made by this indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the reſpectable aſſembly of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Indeed, the Aſſembly of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania in this unworthy treatment have a ſure earneſt of their future expectations.—"It is the cuſtom of nations, (ſays our author)
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:015088_0060_0F95E47F274B0560"/>
when any two are at war, for ſome other powers not engaged in the quarrel, to ſtep in as mediators, and bring about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries of a peace. But while America calls herſelf the ſubject of Britain, no power, however well diſpoſed ſhe may be, can offer her mediation. Wherefore in our preſent ſtate we may quarrel on forever."</p>
            <p>Nations, like individuals, in the hour of paſſion attend to no mediation. But when heartily drubbed, and tired of war, are very readily reconciled, without the intervention of mediators; by whom, belligerents, were never reconciled, until their intereſts or paſſions dictated the pacification. If we may uſe our author's elegant language mediation is "farcical." I grant however, that the idea of our forcing England by arms to treat with us is brilliant. "It is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable continues (our author) to ſuppoſe that France and Spain will give us any kind of aſſiſtance, if we mean only to make uſe of that aſſiſtance for the purpoſe of repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the breach, and ſtrengthening the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between Britain and America; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe powers would be ſufferers by the conſequences."</p>
            <p>Conſidering "we have the moſt number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and beſt diſciplined army under Heaven;
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:015088_0061_0F95E47FC9D3BB58"/>
and a fleet fit to contend with the navy of Britain;" we muſt ſuppoſe our Author's brain affected by dwelling conſtantly on his beloved independency, elſe he would not have the imbecillity to require the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of France and Spain. The manner of his prevailing on France and Spain to aſſiſt us, is alſo a ſtrong proof of his inſanity. Did thoſe powers, heſitate to ſuccour the Scotch rebels in 1745, becauſe they did not declare themſelves independent. It then was their intereſt to create a diverſion, alas! too ſerious in the ſequel for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded rebels in that kingdom; and were they now intereſted in aiding us; they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly would do it in ſpite of quibbles. In ſuch caſe, e're this time, their armies and navies had joined us without interruption: For we muſt confeſs, that the efforts of Britain hitherto, would not have precluded the republic of Genoa from aiding us. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Author, had a ſon or an apprentice eloped to his intimate acquaintance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to enter into his ſervice: If this perſon replied to the youth? I know your appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip is unexpired, notwithſtanding declare yourſelf a freeman, and I will hire and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you. I demand, would ſuch odious, ridiculous duplicity, render our ſuppoſed perſon, leſs criminal in the eyes of our
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:015088_0062_0F95E480623C7EF0"/>
Author, or render the example leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to his own apprentice. "Were a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſto (ſays our Author) diſpatched to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign courts, &amp;c." This alſo is a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive proof of our Author's maniacum deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium. Our Author "challenges the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advocate for reconciliation to ſhew a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle advantage this Continent can reap, by being connected with Great Britain. I repeat the challenge, not a ſingle advantage is derived: Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe:" Were the Author's aſſertions reſpecting our power, as real as deluſive; a reconciliation on liberal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with Great Britain, would be moſt excellent policy. I wave ſimilarity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, laws, and cuſtoms, moſt friendly indeed to perpetual alliance. The greateſt part of our plank, ſtaves, ſhingles, hoops, corn, beef, pork, herrings, and many other articles, could find no vent, but in the Engliſh Iſlands. The demand for our flour would alſo be conſiderably leſſened. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards have no demand for theſe articles; and the French little or none. Britain would be a principal mart for our lumber, part of our grain, naval ſtores, tobacco, and many other articles, which perhaps are not generally wanted in any kingdom in Europe. If it is ſuggeſted, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:015088_0063_0F95E4811FB297F0"/>
Iſlands, impelled by neceſſity would trade with us. I reply, that it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common to ſee Engliſh flour for ſale in thoſe Iſlands; as our merchants have more than once found to their coſt. Since 1750, flour hath ſold in the iſlands, at ten and twelve per cent. the price being reduced by flour from England.</p>
            <p>Britain is alſo better calculated to ſupply us, with woollen goods and other neceſſary articles, than any kingdom in Europe. Should a ſeparation enſue; Britain will open an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive commerce to the Baltick, and Ruſſia, for all, or many of the commodities, ſhe now receives from us. The Ruſſians, ſince their laſt glorious treaty with the Port; can now export the commodities of their moſt fertile Ukraine, through the Mediterranean, until that period, they were conſtrained to carry their hemp, eight or nine hundred miles to the Baltick, whence by a long and dangerous navigation, it reached the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ports in the Atlantic. I need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the reader that ſuch immenſe land carriage, precluded the ſubjects of Ruſſia from raiſing wheat, which generally ſold in the Ukraine for ten-pence per buſhel, as did rye at five-pence, in that extenſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than which no country on earth is more happily adapted for that grain.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:015088_0064_0F95E481E2367028"/>
The Britiſh nation, pre-eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for induſtry and enterpriſe, will eſtabliſh factories in the provinces of Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and animate thoſe people to emulate our productions, which they will tranſport by the Mediterranean, to the ports of Europe, and the Weſt-Indies.—By theſe means, and the culture of Poland, our grain would probably be reduced to its priſtine price, two ſhillings and ſix pence. As our Author is ſo violently bent againſt reconciliation; he muſt either ſuppoſe a conſtant war with the incenſed power of England; or admit that he is a proper inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of the domains of Arioſto, (the world in the moon) Now, admitting "we have the moſt numerous, and beſt diſciplined army under Heaven; and a navy formidable for that of England;" pray, what are our reſources to pay ſuch conſiderable armaments? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I do not wiſh to mortify my countrymen; I muſt acknowledge, that the neat proceeds of all our produce is inadequate to that end. Our Author al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows "that we have a conſiderable check on the Weſt India commerce of Britain, and that Great Britain has a conſiderable check upon our European trade."</p>
            <p>In caſe Great Britain inſults therefore our European bound ſhips, we have only to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:015088_0065_0F95E482A4C7C198"/>
our admirals to ſeiſe their Weſt India<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Unfortunately, the Algerines, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther piratical ſtates of Africa, have no Weſt-India commerce; and not having the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtinctions of thine and mine; will be apt to ſeiſe our veſſels. Our author affirms "that our trade will always be our protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." I therefore crave his pardon, and ſhall believe, that the ſight of our grain, and ſmell of the New England Codfiſh, will effectually ſerve as a Mediterrannean paſs, to the piratical rovers. I do humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſuſpicions, leaſt Portugal extremely dependent on Great Britain, may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult us. When independent, we no doubt will receive ſtrong proofs of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from France and Spain: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, with the utmoſt humility I imagine, could we ſeiſe Gibraltar or Portmahon, and there ſtation a formidable ſquadron of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſhips; we might as effectually protect our commerce, as our trade will protect us. The author of Common Sense confidently affirms, "that our trade will always be its protection." I cannot imagine that his purſe or watch would effectually protect him on Hounſlow, or Blackheath from footpads or highwaymen. Hitherto we have treated of reconciliation on the principles of our
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:015088_0066_0F95E48362858E10"/>
being as potent as Great Britain. Let us now conſider our army, nearly as I have ſtated it, and our navy as an object by no means ſublunary. It now behoves us well to conſider, whether it were better to enter the harbour of peace with Great Britain, or plunge the ſhip into all the horrors of war.—Of civil war. As peace and a happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of commerce, are objects infinitely better for Great Britain; than war and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of her commerce. It therefore is her intereſt to grant us every ſpecies of indulgence, conſiſtent with our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional dependence, ſhould war continue, there can be no doubt of the annihilation of our ſhips, ports and commerce, by Great Britain. The King's ſhips now in New England, unhappily are more than ſufficient to ruin the ports and commerce of theſe provinces. New York is already ſecured; and I ſhould be extremely grieved to hear, that a ſmall armament, were deſtined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Philadelphia. In the opinion of the beſt officers of the navy; Philadelphia is acceſſible to a few forty and fifty gun ſhips, in deſpite of our temporary expedients to fortify the river Delaware. If ſuch opinion is groundleſs, the miniſtry by their imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have befriended us; ſince by guarding the River Delaware with a few frigates on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:015088_0067_0F95E4841F9B04C8"/>
they had precluded us from arming our veſſels and ſtrengthening the river Delaware. I would remind our author of the conſtant language, and apparent purport of all ranks in oppoſition to Great Britain: "We have (ſay they) been the happieſt people on earth, and would continue to be ſo, ſhould Great Britain renounce her claim of taxation. We have no ſiniſter views, we claim not independence; No! Periſh the thought." Such I believe alſo was the tenor of the petitions from the Congreſs to his Majeſty. Now I would aſk every man of ſentiment, what opinion our friends in Great Britain, nay the whole world will entertain of us, if ingratefully, and madly adopting our author's frantic ſchemes, we reject reaſonable terms of reconciliation? Will they not moſt aſſuredly believe, that our popular leaders, have by infinite art, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded the unwary people into their pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed ſchemes; on ſuppoſition, <hi>that the time had found us?</hi> Thoſe acquainted with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain muſt confeſs, that the minority in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, hitherto have been our main prop. Now independency for ever annihilates this our beſt reſource. Let us admit a part of the minority, republicans, or what is more probable, bent on removing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miniſtry from their power. Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:015088_0068_0F95E484DC1986F8"/>
ſchemes annihilates all their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, all their oppoſition. In caſe of our independence, ſhould a BARRE, or BURKE, patroniſe our government; ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, would infallibly participate the fate of the great and good DEWITS; be torn in pieces by the furious People.—If my remarks are founded on truth, it reſults, <hi>that the time hath not found us;</hi> that inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency is inexpedient, ruinous, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, and that reconciliation with Great Britain on good terms, is our ſole reſource. 'Tis this alone, will render us reſpectable; it is this alone, will render us numerous; it is this only, will make us happy.</p>
            <p>I ſhall no longer detain my reader, but conclude with a few remarks on our Author's ſcheme. The people of thoſe Colonies would do well to conſider the character, fortune, and deſigns of our Author, and his independents; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with thoſe of the moſt amiable and venerable perſonages in, and out of the Congreſs, who abominate ſuch nefarious meaſures. I would humbly obſerve, that the ſpecious ſcience of politics, is of all others, the moſt deluſive. Soon after the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the ableſt ſtates-men in England, and other parts of Europe; confidently
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:015088_0069_0F95E485A5439CA0"/>
predicted National ruin, infallible ruin, ſoon as the Public debt exceeded fifty millions ſterling. The Nation now indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nearly thrice that ſum; is not arrived at the zenith of her credit and power. It is perhaps poſſible to form a ſpecious ſyſtem of government on paper which may ſeem practicable, and to have the conſent of the people; yet it will not anſwer in practice, nor retain their approbation upon trial. "All plans of government (ſays HUME) which ſuppoſe great reformation in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of mankind, are merely imaginary."</p>
            <p>The fabricators of Independency have too much influence; to be entruſted in ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous and important concerns. This reaſon alone, were ſufficient at preſent, to deter us from altering the Conſtitution. It would be as inconſiſtent in our leaders in this hour of danger to form a government; as it were for a Colonel forming his battalion in the face of an enemy, to ſtop to write an eſſay on war.</p>
            <p>This author's Quixotic ſyſtem, is really an inſult to our underſtanding; it is infinitely inferior to HUME'S idea of a perfect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth; which notwithſtanding his acknowleged greatneſs of genius, is ſtill reprehenſible. It is not our buſineſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, in what manner this author's aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, acquired their knowledge in national
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:015088_0070_0F95E4865DC108F0"/>
affairs; but we may predict, that his ſcheme of independency would ſoon, very ſoon give way to a government impoſed on us, by ſome Cromwell of our armies. Nor is this ſentiment unnatural, if we are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to conſtant experience, and human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The ſublime MONTESQUIEU, ſo aptly quoted by the Congreſs, unhappily corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates our doctrine, "from (ſays he) a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thinking that prevails amongſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. They ſet a higher value upon cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage than timorouſneſs, on activity than pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, on ſtrength than counſel. Hence, the army will ever deſpiſe a ſenate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their own officers. They will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſlight the order ſent them by a body of men whom they look upon as cowards, and therefore unworthy to command them, ſo that as ſoon as the army depends on the legiſlative body, it becomes a military one;" and if the contrary has ever happened, it has been owing to ſome extraordinary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſuch as Holland being able to drown her garriſons, and the Venetians having it in their power to compel their troops to obedience by the vicinity of the European armies. Reſources to which we forever muſt be ſtrangers. If indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence takes place, the New England men by their conſequence therein; will aſſume
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:015088_0071_0F95E4872223AF60"/>
a ſuperiority, impatiently to be born by the other Colonies.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding our Author's fine words about toleration: Ye ſons of peace and true chriſtianity; believe me, it were folly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, madneſs, to expect angelic toleration from New-England, where ſhe has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly been deteſted, perſecuted and execrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Even in vain would our Author; or our CROMWELL cheriſh toleration; for the people of New-England, not yet arrived in the ſeventeenth or eighteenth century, would reprobate her.—It is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to ſuppoſe, that the New-England go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments would have no objection to an Agrarian law; nor is it unreaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that ſuch diviſion of property would be very agreeable to the ſoldiers. Indeed their General could not perhaps with ſafety to his exiſtence as a General, refuſe them ſo reaſonable a gratification, particularly, as he will have more than one occaſion for their ſervices. Let us however admit that our General and troops, contradicting the experience of ages; do not aſſume the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty. Releaſed from foreign war; we would probably be plunged into all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of anarchy and inteſtine war. Can we ſuppoſe that the people of the ſouth, would ſubmit to have the ſeat of Empire at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:015088_0072_0F95E487E596ECC0"/>
or in New England; or that the people oppreſſed by a change of government, contraſting their miſery with their former happy ſtate, would not invite Britain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume the ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>A failure of commerce precludes the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous tribe of planters, farmers and others, from paying their debts contracted on the faith of peace and commerce. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor perhaps ought not to pay their debts. A war will enſue between the creditors and their debtors, which will eventually end in a general ſpunge or aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of debts, which has more than once happened in other Sates on occaſions ſimilar.</p>
            <p>Ye reſpectable deſcendants of the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Holland and Swiſſerland; who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that your fathers have inſtructed you to felicitate yourſelves in exiſting under the benign Britiſh government. And have taught you to execrate the Government of Holland and other popular ſtates, where the unhappy people unacquainted with trial by jury and other peculiar felicities of Britiſh Subjects are, (to uſe the ſignificant language of your fathers) under the harrow of oppreſſive Demagogues. Do ye poſſeſs the wiſdom to continue your happineſs by a well regulated connection with Britain?</p>

               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:015088_0073_0F95E48A47B586A8"/>
Volumes were inſufficient to deſcribe the horror, miſery and deſolation, awaiting the people at large in the ſyren form of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican independence. In ſhort, I affirm that it would be moſt excellent policy in thoſe who wiſh for TRUE LIBERTY to ſubmit by an advantageous reconciliation to the authority of Great Britain; "to accompliſh in the long run, what they cannot do by hypocriſy, fraud and force in the ſhort one." INDEPENDENCE AND SLAVERY ARE SYNONYMOUS TERMS.</p>

            <p>THE town has been lately amuſed with a new political pamphlet, entitled COMMON SENSE.</p>
            <p>This piece, though it has taken a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar name, and implies that the contents are obvious, and adapted to the underſtandings of the bulk of the people is ſo far from meriting the title it has aſſumed, that in my opinion it holds principles equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with learned and common Senſe.</p>
            <p>I know not the author, nor am I anxious to learn his name or character; for the book, and not the writer of it, is to be the ſubject of my animadverſions.</p>
            <p>'Tis the glory of a free country to enjoy
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:015088_0075_0F95E48BA2B427C0"/>
a free preſs, and of this, that the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and opinions of the meaneſt, equally with thoſe of the greateſt, are brought to view; for we know by frequent inſtances, that the rich and high born are not the monopolizers of wiſdom and virtue.—On the contrary, theſe qualities are oftener to be found among the middling claſs in every country, who, being leſs diſſipated and debauched than thoſe who are uſually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their betters, apply themſelves with more induſtry to the culture of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and in reality become better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the true intereſts of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in which they live.</p>
            <p>But to my great grief I have too often ſeen inſtances of perſons in every claſs of life, whoſe publications, at the ſame time they have reflected honor on the parts and genius of the authors, have been ſo ſhamefully wanting in candor as to attempt, by the cadence of words, and force of ſtile, a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal perverſion of the underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The pamphlet in queſtion ſeems to be plainly calculated to induce a belief of three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That the Engliſh form of government has no wiſdom in it, and that it is by no means ſo coſtructed as to produce the happineſs
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:015088_0076_0F95E48C63E08E18"/>
of the people, which is the end of all good government.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. That monarchy is a form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inconſiſtent with the will of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. That now is the time to break off all connection with Great Britain, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare an independence of the Colonies.</p>
            <p>It muſt be obvious to every impartial eye, that the author reaſons from the abuſes of, againſt the benefits derived from, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh conſtitution; and after reciting theſe abuſes concludes, very unfarily, that "it is incapable to produce what it ſeems to promiſe."—For if an argument of this ſort is to be received, it will prove perhaps ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than the author would chuſe—it would even prove that the Jewiſh theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy was quite as improper, and as inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to produce what it aimed at, as the reprobated Engliſh government.—The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of ſacred hiſtory inform us, that the law was given to the people from God, and that the great Jehovah himſelf conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to call them his <hi>choſen people.</hi> He ſignally interpoſed in their behalf in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of bondage, in preſerving them from the rage of Pharoah's army, and ſeating them in a land flowing with milk and honey, under his immediate goven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:015088_0077_0F95E48D46026038"/>
and laws, "written with his own finger."</p>
            <p>"And he will love thee and bleſs thee, and multiply thee: he will alſo bleſs the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land, thy corn and thy wine, and thy oil; the increaſe of thy kine, and the flocks of thy ſheep, in the land which he ſware unto thy fathers to give thee". Deut. vii. 13.</p>
            <p>"Thou ſhalt be bleſſed above all people, there ſhall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle." Deut. vii. 14.</p>
            <p>But what effects did all theſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favors and promiſes of the Deity himſelf produce upon that wicked, perverſe, ſtiff-necked people? Moſes tells them,</p>
            <p>"From the day that thou didſt depart out of the land of Egypt until ye came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this place, ye have been rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord." Deut. ix. 7.</p>
            <p>"You have been rebellious againſt the Lord from the day that I knew you." Deut. ix. 24.</p>
            <p>Profane as well as ſacred hiſtory informs us of the inneffectuality of the beſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the wiſeſt laws among a corrupt, degenerate people. It does not regularly
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:015088_0078_0F95E48DEE38B3E0"/>
follow, that if the people are not happy under an excellent form of civil polity, that the fault is in the government, it may be owing to the corruption of the people, and this I take to be the caſe in Great Britain at this day. When the Britiſh parliament is properly balanced, and each branch of the legiſlature faithfully executes its duty, I think I am ſafe in affirming there was never yet a form of government in the world ſo well calculated for the happineſs of a free people as this, and yet we are told by the author of the pamphlet, that the "preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Engliſhmen in favor of King, Lords and Commons, ariſes as much or more from national pride than reaſon." The world has already ſeen numberleſs inſtances of fine ſpun political theories, which, like the quackeries of mountebank doctors, are to cure all the political evils to which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature is liable.—But when the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment is made, they become aſtoniſhed at the ill ſucceſs of their boaſted ſchemes—they find a thouſand little paſſions and intereſts continually interfering with their deſigns, and at length retire again to their cloſets, chagrined they had not thought it neceſſary to ſtudy the great volume of human nature, before they ventured to ſay what was the beſt for mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:015088_0079_0F95E48EA6302F20"/>
The author, after venting his ſpleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Engliſh form of government, comes next to conſider the ſubject of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and hereditary ſucceſſion; in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he plainly diſcovers the utmoſt prepoſſeſſion in favor of a republic. I ſhall not follow him through his ſcripture quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which he has ſo carefully garbled to anſwer his purpoſe, but beg leave to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome authorities to it.</p>
            <p>The celebrated Trenchard, in No. 60, of Cato's Letters, ſays, "There is no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment now upon earth, which owes its formation or beginning to the immediate revelation of God, or can derive its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from ſuch revelation: It is certain, on the contrary, that the riſe and inſtitution, or variation of government, from time to time, is within the memory of men or of hiſtories; and that every government which we know at this day in the world, was eſtabliſhed by the wiſdom and force of mere men, and by the concurrence of cauſes evidently human."</p>
            <p>"Nor has God by any revelation nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated magiſtrates, ſhewed the nature or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their powers, or given a plan of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil polity for mankind." (Hutcheſon's Moral Philoſophy. p. 272.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:015088_0080_0F95E48F62AAC950"/>
               <hi>There being no natural or divine law for any form of government,</hi> or that one perſon rather than another ſhould have the ſovereign adminiſtration of affairs, or have power over many thouſand different families who are by nature all equal, being of the ſame rank, promiſcuouſly born to the ſame advantages of nature, and to the uſe of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faculties, therefore <hi>mankind is at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to chooſe what form of government they like".</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"God's providence or permiſſion ſuffered his own peculiar people the Jews to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der divers governments at divers times; as firſt under patriarchs. Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, &amp;c. then under judges, Othniel, Ehud and Gideon; then under high-prieſts, Eli and Samuel; then under kings, Saul, David and the reſt; then under captains and high prieſts again, "as Zerobabel, Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren; and the government was laſtly taken from them, and they brought under the power of Rome. And that God permits ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate or magiſtrates as the community thinks fit to approve, is plain by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Holy Scriptures; when God ſaid to Solomon, "By me kings rule, even all the judges of the earth." Prov. viii. 16.</p>
            <p>"When the ſons of Samuel were judges over Iſrael, they took bribes and perverted
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:015088_0081_0F95E4901E95C1F8"/>
judgment, therefore the elders of Iſrael de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Samuel to make them a king; and though the elders are only mentioned to have aſked a king of Samuel, they ſeem to have been deputed from the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; for God ſaid unto Samuel, <hi>"Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they ſay unto thee."</hi> I Sam. viii. 4, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"And Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord.</hi> 1 Sam. x. 25. 'Tis plain the manner of the kingdom ſignifies the conſtitution of the government, by which was meant the conditions on which Saul was to be king, and they his ſubjects; for though <hi>God had given him the crown,</hi> it was to rule the people according to juſtice and laws."</p>
            <p>"After the battle between Saul and the Ammonites, Samuel ſaid to the people, <hi>Come, let us go to Gi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gal; and there they made Saul king before the Lord.</hi> 1 Sam. xi. 1. 5, 6, 7. 14. 15. <hi>Now therefore behold the king, whom ye have choſen, and behold the Lord hath ſet a king over you."</hi> Sam. chap. 12. 13.</p>
            <p>Theſe latter quotations are taken from the great Lord Somers's book called the "judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whole Kingdoms and Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Rights of Kings and the People." This nobleman was Lord High chancellor of England in King William's reign, and
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:015088_0082_0F95E490E7EEEE50"/>
was remarkable for his revolution-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, great learning and unſhaken inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, in public and private life.</p>
            <p>It does therefore from the foregoing teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies appear, that monarchy (eſpecially a limited one, ſuch as that of England) is not inconſiſtent with the Holy Scriptures, as is ſet forth in ſaid pamphlet, but that it is as pleaſing to the Almighty, if agreeable to the people, as any other form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even the author's beloved republic.</p>
            <p>The writer next proceeds to inform his readers of the numerous wars and ſcenes of blood acted in England under their kings, and aſſerts that <hi>"Monarchy and ſucceſſion have laid the world in blood and aſhes. 'Tis a form of government which the word of God bears teſtimony againſt, and blood will attend it."</hi> Here are bold aſſertions indeed. To the latter part I have already endeavoured to make ſome reply, ſo far as he aſſerts it is contrary to the word of God; but will the author's candor permit him to inform his reader of the infinite diſtractions and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which have happened in the ancient and modern republics—Under this form there are always two parties, which divide the whole body of the people, and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal warfare ſubſiſts between them for power. The <hi>Conteſt</hi> is dreadful enough, but which ſoever party <hi>prevails,</hi> there is no rod heavy
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:015088_0083_0F95E491A8EA2EA0"/>
enough, no ſword ſufficiently ſharp, to puniſh thoſe whom they have ſubdued.—It then becomes a many headed monſter, a tyranny of many.</p>
            <p>Let any man read with an unprejudiced eye the accounts which hiſtorians give us of the famous Grecian Commonwealths, and I will venture to ſpeak for him, that he will not beſtow great commendations on them—The Athenians a wiſe and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed people, very often baniſhed their beſt citizens, from an apprehenſion of their power—a glorious reward for a virtuous citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, who, as was the caſe in more inſtances than one, had preſerved his country from deſtruction. In the latter times of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian and Roman republics, what conſtant ſcenes of blood and devaſtation does hiſtory preſent to us—The multitude in a perpetual ferment like the ocean in a ſtorm—In a ſtorm did I ſay,—like the waters of the ſea, agitated by a dreadful whirlwind, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the fury of one party encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rage of another.—Every trace of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity being thus loſt, men change their natures and become as fierce and ſavage as wolves and tygers.</p>
            <p>But let us deſcend nearer to modern times—let us look for happineſs and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the republic of Holland, ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and ſo little known—let us recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:015088_0084_0F95E49269B33F48"/>
the fate of the two brothers, Cornelius and John de Wit, Dutch miniſters, who were maſſacred by the people in the year 1672. Holland itſelf, from being a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, is become a downright ariſtocracy. Liberty did not continue long in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, notwithſtanding the blood and treaſure that were expended to acquire it. The people, ſo far from being free, have had no voice for many years paſt in the election of perſons to repreſent them in the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, nor have they any thing to do in the forming of laws by which they are to be governed. Whenever one of them dies, the vacancy is filled up without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the people, and this important change was made in the ſtate, becauſe of the intolerable feuds and animoſities which attended the elections of repreſentatives. Had they been to have choſen a king, what dangerous and deſtructive tumults muſt it have produced. Founded on the woeful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ages, it is now become a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fixed opinion, that hereditary is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to elective monarchy, on account of the terrible diſorders, outrages and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which uſually attend the election of a king; a pregnant inſtance of which, in our times, is the kingdom of Poland.</p>
            <p>In our own hiſtory, we ſee what was the effect of the much wiſhed for Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:015088_0085_0F95E494E4710290"/>
wealth after the death of the tyrant Charles—it did not produce liberty—it preſently ended in arbitrary power. The moment almoſt after the reins of government fell from Charles's hands, Cromwell took them up, and governed the nation with abſolute ſway.</p>
            <p>I cannot agree with the author of the pamphlet in opinion, that this is the time to declare an independence of the Colonies. This ought to be the dernier reſort of America. Let us not yet loſe ſight of the primary object of the diſpute, namely, a ſafe, honorable, and laſting reconciliation with Great Britain, until we are under a neceſſity of doing it. If an advantageous accommodation can be had, and a free conſtitution for this country be eſtabliſhed on mutual agreement and compact, 'twill be better and happier for us. But if juſtice is ſtill denied us, and we are to contend for liberty by arms, we will meet them in the field, and try our manhood againſt them, even to ſpilling the blood of every brave man we have. Should the miniſtry have recourſe to foreign aid, we may poſſibly follow their example; and, if it be eſſential then to our ſafety to declare an Independence, I would willingly embrace the neceſſity.</p>

            <head>EXTRACT from the ſecond Letter to the People of Pennſylvania; being that part of it which relates to INDEPENDENCY. By a WRITER under the Signature of CATO.</head>
            <p>UPON the whole, it appears that this writer (Caſſandra) is more an enemy to the buſineſs on which the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners are to be ſent, than really apprehenſive for our virtue. He ſeems to have drank deep of the <hi>cup of independency;</hi> to be inimical to whatever carries the appearance of <hi>peace;</hi> and too ready to ſacrifice the happineſs of a great continent to his favourite plan. Among ſuch writers I pretend not to claſs myſelf; for I am bold to declare, and hope yet to make it evident to every honeſt man, that the true intereſt of America lies in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> with Great-Britain, upon <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional principles,</hi> and I can truly ſay, I wiſh it upon no other terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:015088_0087_0F95E49627980838"/>
Why the many publications in favour of <hi>independency,</hi> with which our preſſes have lately groaned, have paſſed hitherto unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, I am not able to determine. But there are certainly times when public affairs become ſo intereſting, that every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a debtor to the community for his opinions, either in ſpeaking or writing. Perhaps it was thought beſt, where an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> was pretended to be made to the COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON SENSE of this country, to leave the people for a while to the free exerciſe of that good underſtanding which they are known to poſſeſs. Thoſe who made the <hi>appeal</hi> have little cauſe to triumph in its ſucceſs. Of this they ſeem ſenſible; and, like true quacks, are conſtantly peſtering us with their additional doſes, till the ſtomachs of their patients begin wholly to revolt. If little notice has yet been taken of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications concerning independence, it is neither owing to the popularity of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, the unanſwerable nature of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the fear of oppoſing them, as the vanity of the authors would ſuggeſt. I am confident that nine-tenths of the people of Pennſylvania yet abhor the doctrine.</p>
            <p>If we look back to the origin of the preſent controverſy, it will appear that ſome
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:015088_0088_0F95E496DB03D520"/>
among us at leaſt, have been conſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their views, and ſtretching them beyond their firſt bounds, till at length they have wholly changed their ground. From the claim of Parliament to tax us, ſprung the firſt reſiſtance on our part. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that unjuſt claim was ſet on foot, not an individual, not one of all the profound legiſlators with which this country abounds, ever held out the idea of independence. We conſidered our connection with Great-Britain as our chief happineſs—we flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, grew rich, and populous, to a degree not to be paralleled in hiſtory. Let us then act the part of ſkilful phyſicians, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adapt the remedy to the evil.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly ſome men may have harboured the idea of independence from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this controverſy. Indeed it was ſtrongly ſuſpected there were individuals whoſe views tended that way; but as the ſcheme was not ſufficiently ripened, it was reckoned ſlanderous, inimical to America, and what not, to intimate the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of this kind.</p>
            <p>Nor have many weeks yet elapſed ſince the firſt open propoſition for independence was publiſhed to the world.—By what men
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:015088_0089_0F95E49796629B28"/>
of conſequence this ſcheme is ſupported, of whether by any, may poſſibly be the ſubject of future enquiry—Certainly it has no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from the Congreſs, to whoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we look up with reverence. On the contrary, it is directly repugnant to every declaration of that reſpectable body. It would be needleſs to quote particular paſſages in proof of this, as they are to be met with in almoſt every page of their proceedings. I will refer to a few only, <abbr>viz.</abbr> their Reſolves, March 5, 1775—their Declaration, July 6—heir Addreſs to the King, July 8—their Letter to the Lord Mayor of London—and more eſpecially their Declaration for a faſt, June 12 in which with the deepeſt marks of ſincerity they call upon all America to join with them in addreſſing the great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the World—<q>humbly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to avert the deſolating judgments with which we are threatened, to bleſs our rightful ſovereign, &amp;c.—that ſo America may ſoon behold a gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of Heaven for the redreſs of her many grievances, the reſtoration of her invaded rights, and reconciliation with the parent ſtate, on terms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional and honorable to both.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:015088_0090_0F95E498550349A8"/>
Will any one be ſo hardy as to ſay, that either the appointment or obſervation of this ſolemn day was a mere mockery of Heaven and Earth, or even that any Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can joined in it, who was not ſincere?—I truſt not. But if multiplying authorities were of any uſe, I might add the ſentiments of our own Repreſentatives in aſſembly, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the inſtructions to their Delegates; the ſentiments of Maryland in ſimilar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; the Reſolves of New Jerſey and New-Hampſhire; nor ſhall the much injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed province of Maſſachuſetts Bay be left out of the catalogue; whoſe Provincial Congreſs, while yet bleeding with the wounds receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Lexington, thus addreſſed the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Great Britain—<q>Theſe are marks of miniſterial vengeance againſt this Colony, but they have not yet detached us from our royal Sovereign, &amp;c. truſting that in a <hi>conſtitutional</hi> connexion with the mother country, we ſhall ſoon be a free and happy people.</q> Theſe were the ſentiments of the Colony of the Maſſachuſetts, ſigned by that great Martyr to Liberty, Dr. WARREN, and ſoon after ſealed with his blood.</p>
            <p>The ſentiments of ſundry other Colonies might be ſhewn to have correſponded with
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:015088_0091_0F95E499180327E0"/>
theſe.—But this letter has already reached its full length. I ſhall take ſome future opportunity to examine the arguments which have been offered to induce a change of theſe ſentiments; and upon the whole I doubt not to make it appear that independence is not the cauſe in which America is <hi>now</hi> engaged, and is only the idol of thoſe who with to ſubvert all order among us, and riſe on the ruins of their country!</p>
