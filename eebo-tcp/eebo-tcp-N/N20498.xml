            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A SHORT contemplation of the animal oeconomy will convince us that life cannot be perpetual, under the preſent mode of exiſtence: For we quickly perceive, by the law of our nature, we are ſubjected to changes, diſeaſe and death. From the firſt diſeaſe that affected man, the healing art muſt have taken its origin; as it is natural to believe that mankind muſt have been thus early impelled by ſickneſs and pain to ſeek the remedies that nature afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the removal or mitigation of their miſery.—It is a pleaſing and uſeful ſpeculation, to trace our art from this embryo ſtate to its preſent condition of improvement and maturity. In the dawn of medical knowledge, the evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the human mind muſt have been ſlow and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Great diſtreſs muſt have been ſuffered before many medical facts could have been inveſtigated; and after all, theſe muſt have been the reſult of individual exertion. But, in the courſe of revolving time, and by the progreſs of civilization, the collective energies of men, under the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign influences of freedom and the ſocial compact, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred to a point, for accelerating the perfection of the art and ſciences. Among theſe, if you except agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the art of teaching children to think accurately and act well, the firſt in uſe, and the firſt in dignity, is the Healing Art, or the Science of Life—Yours is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs <hi>"to aſſociate for the expreſs purpoſes of promoting

ſocial and profeſſional intercourſe, as a happy means of diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating medical knowledge; of inveſtigating the diſeaſes and remedies peculiar to our country, and thereby to leſſen human miſery; and of giving reſpectability and order to the practice of Phyſic."</hi>

            <p>LET it then be the deſign of this diſcourſe, to call your attention to the <hi>Improvement of Medicine:</hi> For this will neceſſarily lead me, conciſely, to point out ſome of the principal objects of the Inſtitution, by which the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges derivable from this eſtabliſhment will be rendered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the Community; and, to ſhew ſome of the means of making the Inſtitution uſeful to the citizens, and honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its members.</p>
            <p>THE novelty of the occaſion, as well as the mixed aſpect of medical affairs, ſeemed to require that ſomething ſhould be offered on this ſubject. A ſhort eſſay on ſome therapeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſubject, perhaps, would be more acceptable to ſeveral of the members.—But, to adopt this plan, I truſt, will fulfil your deſign in appointing an anniverſary diſcourſe, and at the ſame time, be productive of more general utility.</p>
            <p>A DIFFIDENCE of my own abilities, would have forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den my appearing before you on this occaſion, had I not been confident of enjoying the exerciſe of that candour and generoſity of ſentiment, while an attempt is made to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duty you have aſſigned me, which has been ſo often conſpicuous in your ſtated meetings.</p>

They have brought us to the gate of the temple of nature; they have drawn aſide the veil of ignorance and myſteries; they have invited us to enter and accompany them, as patient inquirers in the inveſtigation of life, health, and diſeaſe.—With the other parts of united America, let us join our Brothers of the old world, in this excellent work of the ſtudy of nature. Thus ſhall we pay a debt that is due to ſociety and mankind, and "learn<note n="*" place="bottom">Pythagorae aurea carmino.

               </gap> America is repleniſhed with a rich variety of objects for the improvement of every branch of medicine—After we have attended to the geography of our country, one of the firſt ſubjects that ſhould arreſt our attention, is the effect that is produced on the public health, by the progreſs of agriculture, and the conſequent ſalutary changes of our climates.</p>
            <p>THE changes of temperature, and local ſituation, that are conſtantly taking place on this globe, afford ſubjects for uſeful medical reſearches.—It may be permitted to adduce a few facts to illuſtrate this point.—All the northern and weſtern parts of America, exhibit a good picture of the ancient condition of moſt of the European climates:—</p>
            <p>IN 860, the Mediterranean was covered with ice:</p>
            <p>IN 1296, the Baltic was frozen from Gothland to Sweden:</p>
            <p>AND in 1423, the ice bore riding from Pruſſia to Lubeck.</p>

IN the time of Galen, it was obſerved, that the peach-tree could not flouriſh in Italy, by reaſon of the cold of the winter.<note n="†" place="bottom">Vide Dr. Forſter's obſervations during Captain Cooke's voyage round the world, 1772—1775; page 81.—Henry Home's ſketches of the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of man.—Drs.

            <p>DURING theſe periods, moſt of the kingdoms in Europe were overſhadowed by impenetrable foreſts, and the greater part of the people lived by hunting and plunder. But, after a long interval of mental and moral darkneſs, when agriculture, with the other arts, were reſtored, we find no ſatisfactory account of the progreſſive melioration of thoſe climates, by clearing the countries of their foreſts and perfecting agriculture. The ſolution of this problem is left for the Phyſicians of America. To effect this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable object, many ingenious experiments and reſearches are neceſſary.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Vide Jefferſon's notes on Virginia.—Captain Carver's Travels.</note>

            <p>IT will be uſeful to make methodical regiſters of the thermometer, barometer,<note n="§" place="bottom">From the hiſtory of the barometer, we know, that the weight of the atmoſphere is greater at one time than another, in the ratio of one tenth of the baroſcopic column of mercury; ſo great a difference cannot but greatly affect us who are ſubject to it, ſeeing it amounts to 3200 lb.

This will require a multiplicity of meteorological obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and by experiments with the eudiometer and other chemical inveſtigations, perhaps, it will be found, that the true cauſe of intermitting fevers, and various other diſorders, both epidemic and endemic, is the carbonic

By knowing the nature of the cauſe, we ſhall gain much towards effecting a cure of theſe deſtructive maladies.</p>
            <p>THESE inquiries will alſo aſſiſt the Phyſician in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſcribing endemic and epidemic diſeaſes, as well as the diſeaſes of cattle and all ſorts of animals. And, as the pathology of vegetables is a moſt intereſting ſubject in the materia medica, and in huſbandry and gardening, the farmer will remember that theſe ſtudies will extend to the diſeaſes of his fruit-trees, his wheat, his corn, and all the productions of the farm. Will not the farmer then aſſociate his labours with the phyſician to record uſeful facts on theſe ſubjects? May not theſe ſtudies enable medical men to aſcertain the origin of epidemics with more ſucceſs and certainty than has hitherto been done? Of how much utility this may be to the commercial and political intereſts of our country, need not be mentioned before this enlightened audience.</p>
            <p>BUT to effect theſe purpoſes completely, it will be neceſſary to be conſtantly making additions of the beſt modern publications to the Society's Library, which is already an object of conſiderable advantage, eſpecially to the junior members. A Library has been called medicine for the mind: A Medical Library is a common bond of union among Phyſicians, and it renders the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of knowledge cheap and eaſy.</p>

            <p>THE philoſophy of the Atmoſphere and Winds, ſo far as they influence health, is an important ſubject. Which winds are moſt ſalutary, and which moſt noxious?

THE mariner, from the diſtinguiſhed rank that he holds in modern ſociety, and eſpecially in all commercial nations, deſerves great attention from the Phyſician.

The inveſtigation and cure of their diſeaſes remain, in a great meaſure, for the future labours of medical men. In doing this, many facts may be aſcertained for the explanation of that moſt remarkable property which exiſts in animal bodies of accommodating themſelves to the various condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life; ſuch as the changes of climate, heat and cold, diet, action of body and mind, ſleep and watching, the healing of wounds and the re-union of broken bones.

                  <p>"Mr. Girtanner's Theory of reſpiration is briefly this:" "During reſpiration the oxygene-gas of the atmoſphere is decompounded. One part of the oxygene unites with the venous blood and changes its dark co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour into a ſcarlet. Another part of the oxygene combines with the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone which is diſengaged from the venous blood, and forms carbonic acid gas. A third portion of the oxygene connects itſelf with the carbone of the dark coloured mucus, which is ſeparated in the branches of the Trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hea in conſiderable quantity; and in like manner turns to carbonic acid gas. A fourth portion of the oxygene, combines with the Hydrogene ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the venous blood, and conſtitutes the watery exhalation ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the breath.</p>
                  <p>"The caloric of the decompounded oxygene gas continues in part with the combined oxygene, and together with it, forms a combination with the venous blood; and hence proceeds the greater quantity of calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric in the arterial than in the venous blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Crawford has remarked. Another part of the caloric goes into union with the carbonic and gas. A third part of it enters into the formation of the Halitus."—The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of reſpiration he enumerates are theſe; 1ſt, a fluid animal oxyde, <hi>arterial blood.</hi> 2d, Carbonic acid gas. 3d, water. And 4th, a ſmall quantity of uncombined caloric. (Girtanner, <hi>anfangegrunde <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>THE ſtomach and the ſuccus gaſtrious, afford an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent leſſon of inſtruction. Who would not wiſh to profit by it in all his enquiries? If we imitate the wonderful operations of the organ ſo happily explained by the before-mentioned authors, we ſhall find, that many a bulky volume of hypotheſes will paſs down the <hi>primae viae</hi> of our minds, without leaving more than a few ſentences of uſeful truth, to invigorate the mind of the Phyſician in the acquiſition of medical knowledge.</p>
            <p>THESE facts will ſoon induce us to believe, that error is the ſole cauſe of the miſery of man. That the detection of error is the diſcovery of truth, is an excellent aphoriſm. A faithful detail of medical errors, properly managed, would
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026892_0023_0FD24B5EA7F3BCC8"/>
have the happieſt effect on practice—It would prevent the miſapplication of talents and time, and ſo facilitate the way to truth. This can no where be done ſo well as in a Medical Society—For, the truths that are diſperſed among various perſons, may be here collected and united into one general maſs of knowledge, which will enlarge the mind, and regulate the judgment of the practitioners, who having regularly received inſtructions from particular teachers, are now to conſider the ARS MEDENDI as their beſt teacher—The variety of facts, that each may ſhew to the other, will prevent partial views, and inſpire comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive conceptions; thus the judicious Phyſician, to whom are committed the deareſt intereſts of ſociety, will be enabled to ſteer his courſe more ſafely between the dangerous extremes of dogmatiſm and empiriciſm. It is very apparent that this practice muſt lead indirectly and ultimately to a great improvement in medicine—The colliſion of mind with mind, ought to ſtrike out ſome light, and we ought to collect the ſcattered rays to a focal point, by which ſome of the darker and more interior receſſes of the temple of medical ſcience might, in a future period, be happily illuminated.</p>
            <p>IN the preſent ſtate of ſociety, it is difficult to obtain ſubjects for faciſitating the ſtudy of Phiſiology and Patholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. The morbid appearances of dead bodies are examined under great embarraſſments—If we unite to demonſtrate to the public the advantages of theſe enquiries, we may hope to obtain the intereſt of the wiſe and prudent part of the citizens in favour of theſe purſuits. Prejudice and feeling are oppoſed, but reaſon may do much to remove theſe obſtacles.

ſociety are a part of the general ſyſtem of nature, and therefore, they cannot be violated in theſe inſtances with impunity. One of the firſt characters<note n="‖" place="bottom">Condorcet.</note> in the French Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, has obſerved with great truth, that, "Reſpect for the remains of men who have been dear to us, is no prejudice it is an affection inſpired by nature herſelf; who has places in the receſſes of our hearts, a veneration for every thing that can recal to our remembrance, beings whom friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or gratitude has rendered ſacred to our feelings. The liberty of offering a ſorrowful homage to their aſhes is then a precious right, to delicate minds; and the power of chooſing that which their ſenſations dictate, cannot, without injuſtice, be taken away."</p>

In the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and fertile territories between theſe extremes, we obſerve the Mohawk, Senaka and Geneſee; next, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſecting branches of the Delaware and Suſquehannah, and then the beautiful ponds, canals and ſmaller lakes, appear before us. And may we not anticipate the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern and weſtern inland lock-navigation? All theſe maſſes of water are ſituated in a climate that is expoſed to the moſt ſudden changes, ſtorms and tempeſts; and in the winter, to intenſe cold.

            <p>IN America we have always enjoyed, what France has lately reſtored to her Citizens, the union of Medicine with Chirurgery, which conſtitutes the Healing Art what it was in the Hippocratic Age. To ſeparate the practice of Phyſic from that of Chirurgery, would be like a diſunion of Light and Fire—Medical Surgery is, therefore, highly intereſting to the Phyſician and to the public—Perhaps, it is reſerved for the Phyſicians of America to diſcover the beſt methods of preventing or ſuperceding many of the ſeverer operations in ſurgery—Too much praiſe cannot be given to the humane, judicious, prompt and dexterous operator. But when will the preſumptuous exerciſe of the bloody ſcalpel and catlin of Radcliffe and Sigault be ſuſpended?

            <p>A FEW years ago, it was conſidered as a kind of daring impiety, for a Phyſician to attempt the cure of ſeveral diſeaſes of the mind; particularly thoſe of the moral faculty. But as long as we believe that men have the power of reſiſting inclination, and to weigh the motives of action, we need not fear the conſequences of trying the full effects of medicines that may operate by phyſical neceſſity on man. And, let it be remembered, when Hipparchus undertook to number the ſtars and trace their motions, his attempt was alſo derided as impious; becauſe, it was conſidered as a work that baffled all human labor and obſervation, and could be done only by the Deity.

Mark what followed: The labors of Hipparchus enabled Paul, a Florentine Phyſician,<note n="†" place="bottom">In 1474, he correſponded with Columbus, on the probability of finding India, in the weſt. Life of Columbus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Ferdinand Columbus.</note> to make maps and charts, by which he demonſtrated to Columbus the globurality of this Planet. All the events in nature are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully connected together by infinite wiſdom, and conſpire to make one complete and harmonious plan of Providence! Had it not been for what has falſely been called the raſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and enthuſiaſm of Hipparchus, the old world would never have come to the knowledge of America; and inſtead of aſſociating together, under a free government, to promote the intereſts of humanity, moſt of us who are preſent would, at this moment, have been the vaſſals of ſome European deſpot, as was once the lot of our perſecuted anceſtors.</p>
            <p>MAY it be the diſtinguiſhed fortune of ſome American Phyſicians, to become in the medical world, what Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus and Columbus were in Aſtronomy and Navigation!</p>
            <p>To the praiſe of America, there is a native of this country, who, by uniting the three characters of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, Patriot and Phyſician<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (need I name Dr. Ruſh?) has done much towards inveſtigating, explaining and curing many of the mental diſeaſes. But much ſtill remains to be done.</p>
            <p>THIS is an age of ſcepticiſm: and this is the time to obſerve and explain the effects of ſcepticiſm on health. Neither ſhould the curious and ſurpriſing operations of ſpeculative opinions in religion,<note n="§" place="bottom">Vid. Hannah Adams's View of Religions.

on health and diſeaſe. The ebulitions of enthuſiaſm, with dreams, viſions, trances, and all the illuſions of the ſenſes, particularly ſight and hearing, ſhould likewiſe engage the ſerious and careful attention and ſtudy of medical men. And, while we contemplate the injuſtice and impolicy of the ſlavery of the poor Africans, in our boaſted republican and free governments, ſhall we forget to obſerve the effects of ſlavery on the health, temper, genius and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the people, who advocate and practiſe this trafic and bondage of man?</p>
            <p>THE doctrine of the aſſociation of ideas is more uſeful to the Phyſician, than to the Profeſſor of any other art. Whoever knows how to avail himſelf of this ſubject in the practice of phyſic, may be ſaid to be in poſſeſſion of a key to unlock many of the apartments of the cabinet of nature. How often, by this taliſmanic charm, may the morbid condition be changed to the healthful! This was the BRAZEN SERPENT and the TALITHA-CUMI of Dr. Willis, when he cured the King of England.</p>
            <p>WHILE medicines are adminiſtered to change the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed action, or to remove the irregular action, to equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize the excitement and to vary its degree, and thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore health and happineſs; we find ample ſcope for ſcrutiniſing the operations of the mind, when we ſhall often obtain the greateſt advantages in changing the train of ideas.</p>

THE effects of reading Novels and Romances, on the Imagination, appetites and paſſions, particularly in young people, have not yet been inveſtigated by Phyſicians. To keep the paſſions<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. The Rev.

            <p>AN eloquent foreigner obſerves, that "union is an irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able panacea againſt the evils of pertinacity. It is union that compoſes the underſtanding and tranquilizes the affections;

ſhe ſtills the tumult of the paſſions, ſhe ſuperſedes perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal antipathies, ſhe diſenchants the deluded ſenſes, ſhe diſſipates the clouds by which truth is obſcured, ſhe ſheds the rays of diſtinction on the apoſtle of truth; he preſents her with modeſty, he is received without unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable prepoſſeſſions." Let us, then, unite our labours for the common good of Society: Thus ſhall we render this Inſtitution uſeful to the People, and honorable to its Members.</p>
            <p>THE patriotic Citizens will give their approbation to an Eſtabliſhment which has the public health for its object. May we not hope, that, the enlightened Legiſlators of a free People will give their ſanction to its Incorporation? All the objects of the Inſtitution can be promoted much better this way than any other. This Society may, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, have a HUNTER,<note n="†" place="bottom">Wm. Hunter.</note> a FOTHERGILL, a COPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY, a LETTSOME and a HAWES, who will inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Incentives and Rewards for Genius and Character.

            <p>I AM ſenſible, many objections are urged againſt all ſorts of Incorporations in a free government. But, theſe all ariſe from the effects of the ancient Incorporations being miſapplied to the preſent ſtate of Society. Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were invented by the Emperors of Germany, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the Peaſantry, when the Barons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Chieftains, under the feudal ſyſtem, conſpired together, in a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Ariſtocracy, againſt the Kings. Then it became the policy of Kings to check the encroachments of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026892_0034_0FD24B7B84645BF0"/>
or Nobles, on the uſurped and regal power; and artfully to ſtrengthen and increaſe this power, which was ever operating the degradation and miſery of mankind, by giving, as it was then falſely called, privileges to the Plebeians, or Peaſantry, and ſo defending them againſt the equally unjuſt claims of the Barons, in uniting them in the ſupport of Monarchy, which was conſtantly at war with Ariſtocracy. In America, there is no Peaſantry; but in room of it, a collective and united body of Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, called THE FREE YEOMANRY. There are more modern Corporations, with peculiar powers, which have ended in monopolies. Theſe, firſt, fattened on the blood and tears of the natives of the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies, and having become enebriated with the ſweat, extorted from the ſlave-wearied limbs of the Sons of Africa, they, afterwards, corrupt Society, with their unjuſtly accumulated wealth, and deſtroy themſelves. In all thoſe periods, the people were oppreſſed by an arbitrary Government, which did nothing relative to Medicine; if, you except the deſpotic decrees of the Parliament of Paris, reſpecting antimony; and the diſgraceful edict of Charles V. to regulate Venefection.</p>
            <p>INCORPORATIONS may be reformed, as well as any other political inſtitutions. May it be a part of modern policy to eſtabliſh certain incorporations, under ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as will check the violence of democracy; and tend, by promoting uſeful knowledge, to the ſupport, perhaps, to the perpetuity, of elective, free and well-balanced governments.</p>
            <p>THE wiſeſt phyſician<note n="†" place="bottom">Hippocrates de aere, locis et aquis.</note> of antiquity obſerved, that the Aſiatics were leſs warlike and more effeminate than the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026892_0035_0FD24B33DAC74D08"/>
Europeans. This he attributed, in part, to their climate, but principally, to the form and adminiſtration of their governments, which were all deſpotic and ſubject to the arbitrary will of their kings. We have the happineſs to live under a free government. At this time we ſcarce need recur to Longinus to be informed, that, <hi>'Liberty is formed to nurſe the ſentiments of great geniuſes, to inſpire them with hope; to puſh forward the propenſity of conteſt one with another, and the generous emulation of being the firſt in rank.'</hi> Our government, then, muſt produce great effects, not only on the genius, but alſo on the health of the people. The former will enable Phyſicians to obſerve with accuracy, and future ages will expect that their duty ſhould have impelled them to record with fidelity, THE EFFECTS OF FREE GOVERNMENTS ON THE HEALTH OF THE CITIZENS.</p>
            <p>FREEDOM! all-hallowed name! Thou friend of man! at thought of thee, our hearts are warmed with thy celeſtial fire! Already do we behold a hoſt of thy heaven-deſcended offspring:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>When Bacon, "from the gloom</l>
               <l>Of cloiſtered monks, and jargon-teaching ſchools</l>
               <l>Led forth the true Philoſophy, there long</l>
               <l>Held in the chain of words and forms</l>
               <l>And definitions void,"—</l>
            </lg>
            <p>thy victorious benignant hand guided his illumined mind: When he marked out the limits of human knowledge, thou didſt inſpire him. When Newton, greateſt ſage! calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, thou waſt with him. When Baile became the advocate-general of Philoſophers, then didſt thou give a ſubtlety and inſpire a confidence unknown to man before. When Locke made all the mental world his own, thy friendly genius guided him through all the deep reſearch,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026892_0036_0FD24B7D06B967B0"/>
and pointed the way to truth. In Milton, immortal name! thou didſt teach mankind that diſobedience to the will of Heaven is the true cauſe of all the tyranny and miſery in nature. When Clarke and Butler, by moral demonſtration, proved to be wildered men the truth of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, firſt taught in Judea, by Jeſus of Nazareth, which carries in its divine boſom, peace on earth and good will to men; thou didſt diſpel the darkneſs of ſuperſtition. When Raleigh, Ridley, Sidney, Ruſſell and Hamden expired, in ſealing the truth with their precious blood, thou, O FREEDOM! didſt conſecrate their names, in the ſacred temples of Virtue, Honor and Fame.</p>
            <p>IN thy venerable Rouſſeau, thou haſt pourtrayed all thy charms; by his eloquence haſt thou delineated the beauty and power of truth; and by his ſtrength and courage, didſt thou ſubſtantiate thy choiceſt bleſſings. In thy own Voltaire, thy benediction to all mankind was God and Liberty. In him didſt thou avenge the cauſe of humanity and deliver Europe from the yoke of the ancient deſpotiſm of Aſia: In him didſt thou give to truth the ſacred impreſſions of genius; and by his ſtrong arm didſt thou ſhake the diſgraceful remains of feudal and gothic vaſſalage. When Monteſquieu and Beccaria reſtored to humanity, her long loſt charms, thy friendly ſpirit did direct them.</p>
            <p>PRIESTLEY, illuſtrious ſage! The fruitleſs effort to ſave a ſinking realm is his crime: The greatneſs of his virtues and his ſufferings prove the deſpotiſm and misfortunes of that nation, whoſe hiſtory his future fame will adorn. He, O FREEDOM! hath fought, ſucceſsfully fought, under thy holy banners, and broken the fetters of reaſon. By him, haſt thou confounded the blind partizans of antiquity, and demoliſhed the antique pillars of the temple of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. But, in Britain ſhall it be ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, Erſkine his

friend, and the friend of Paine, can no longer defend the palladium of Liberty; and that he having become the chriſtian victim of the riotous triumph of mad hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical bigotry, ſuch as would have diſgraced the reign of Diocleſian or Nero, muſt flee his native land. Welcome, thrice welcome, to this weſtern world: thou bringeſt with thee all the treaſures of knowledge of all ancient and modern time. Come and animate the Americans with the amiable example of thy virtues.<note n="†" place="bottom">This was written after Dr. Prieſtley had informed ſeveral of his friends in America of his intention of leaving England, on account of civil and religious perſecution, and fleeing to America, the aſylum of thoſe who flee from the Tyrants of the old world.</note>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN Mirabeau, Condorcet, and that bright phalanx of patriots and heroes, arrayed, in the divine panoply of reaſon, waged ſucceſsful war againſt the many-headed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Tyranny, thou, O FREEDOM! didſt nerve their mighty arm with more than herculean ſtrength.</p>
            <p>THESE are the men whoſe fame will live forever: Theſe are the benefactors of mankind: their glory will embrace all the future generations of men. Who can ſtop the progreſs of their works! What can check the progreſs of truth! As ſoon might man ſtretch forth his feeble arm and ſay to you bright orb of day, retire and ceaſe to ſhine.</p>
            <p>BUT, what ſhall we ſay of the Legiſlators and Heroes of America? Theſe all uttered their voices, ſtrong as reaſon and ſublime as heaven, ſaying, <hi>Let America be free, and America was free.</hi> Under the auſpices of that freedom, in this Hall, are we now aſſembled.</p>

PHYSICIANS! you are convened on one of the moſt important occaſions that can excite the attention of the wiſe and virtuous part of mankind. Your profeſſion is to be the diſciples of nature. Your object is to be the mitigation and cure of diſeaſes. And, your ruling princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is to be active benevolence, by which you are to become the counſellors, the friends and the benefactors of mankind. Let us therefore make this day a ſolemn Jubilee, ſacred to the memory of all thoſe <hi>who have improved the healing-art,</hi> and promoted the intereſts of humanity in the world.</p>
