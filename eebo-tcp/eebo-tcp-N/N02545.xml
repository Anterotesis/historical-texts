            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to put my Thoughts in Writing, which I now offer to the Committee, for their Correction, Approbation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; which Last shall not at all displease me. I aim at nothing but the Good of the Trade in general, in which every Man's particular Good is included: Therefore, if the End aimed at be but obtained, I shall be very Thankful to any Gentleman, for communicating his Thoughts, tho' never so different from mine: So with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther Apology will come to my Matter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT is well known to us all, that the chief Cause of the Depression of the Trade, is from the great Ascendant the <hi>French</hi> Agent has got over us, which Ascendant is very natural; For, he being but One, and so very considerable a Buyer, must have a great Advantage over so many Sellers, acting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of Consultation, or Agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selves: Whereas, did we act in Concert, we might make our selves equal to him, and so keep up Tobacco at a living Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>, which is all I aim at. I am by no Means for running up Tobacco to an extravagant Price, or any other Way discouraging the <hi>French</hi> Trade, which is a valuable Consumption, and ought to be encouraged; but then it ought to be upon such Terms as the Planters and Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, may live by their Labour; which of late Years we know they have not done, &amp; all along with the <hi>French</hi> Agents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, every one of them, in their turns, have been (properly speaking) Sellers as well as Bavers: It has not been what Price we pleas'd, but They that have set the Price, and we could not help our selves, which has been of the worse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, because all other Buyers govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by what Price the <hi>French</hi> Agent gives; so that the good or ill Fortune of the Trade, depends altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon what Measures we take with the <hi>French.</hi>

to their own People, or rather have a fixed Price, from which they do not vary, let them buy Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co here never so cheap; and as they constantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy but one Agent at one Time, I think we might fall into a Method, so to incorporate our selves, as to treat as one Man with that Agent, for fixing the Price for such a Time as may be thought convenient; and so from Time to Time, to rise or fall the Price as the Circumstances of the Trade may require; which I wish to be done with all Civility, by Way of Contract, with the <hi>French</hi> Agent, by a Committee of the Trade specially appointed for that Purpose, at a General Meeting: And when the Time contracted for, is expired, or near expiring, then the same (or a new Committee) may be appointed, after Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the General Meeting, to renew the old, or make a new Contract, according to what shall be agreed upon by a Majority in the General Meeting. I cannot but think the <hi>French</hi> Agent, would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come into such a Method, as it would make Things easy to him; and being done by Treaty with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, will not look like Compulsion: As the Price will then be fixed and known, every Body will far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THIS Agreement I think ought only to be for <hi>Iames River</hi> Tobacco, which is almost only proper for the <hi>French</hi> Market, and such Part of <hi>Maryland</hi> Tobacco as is likewise proper for the <hi>French</hi> Market.</p>

of the Trade to have a Price fixed, below which, no Tobacco shall be sold, without Consent of a General Meeting.</p>
                        <p>I do not think it reasonable to attempt debarring the <hi>French</hi> Agent from Buying whole Ships Loads, or any Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

THE second Thing agreed to at last Meeting, was, The Continuing Three Pence <hi>per</hi> Hogshead on all Tobacco, which I very much approve of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such a Fund we shall not be able to defend our selves against many Incroachments, or Hardships, that may be offered (as in Times past) to be afresh put upon the Trade: That Duty has been a Means of uniting us so, as to ward off Foreign Evils that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected us only in common with our Fellow Subjects; but henceforward I hope a Part of that Duty will be employed so, as to ward off Evils immediately relating to our selves, by begetting a friendly Acquaintance and Society, towards which, Monthly Meetings will very much conduce.</p>
                        <p>AND therefore I propose Two or Three Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas be appropriated to defray the Charge of each Monthly Meeting: And, supposing so much may not be actually spent at each Meeting, I wish all the Savings may be kept distinct by it self; and when it amounts to a Sum sufficient, may be bestowed upon a Dinner, once or twice a Year, for the whole Trade. What I am at by this, is to beget a good Friendship and Harmony among the Merchants; which Eating together, does more often produce among Mankind, than bare Drinking.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. THE third Thing agreed at last Meeting, was, Continuing our Treasurer, Alderman <hi>Perry,</hi> than whom I think we cannot have a better.</p>

                        <p>FOR the orderly conducting our Meetings, in every one of them, I think there should be a Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and as there are Twelve Managers appointed, one of them may be the President in the Monthly Meetings; and so, by Rotation, may go thro' all the Managers in a Year.</p>
                        <p>AND as I propose the Managers to have a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between such Monthly Meeting, which I will call the Two Weeks Meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that was Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the last Monthly Meeting, to be Chairman of the next Two Weeks Meeting following that.</p>
                        <p>TO keep us together, I propose that every Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, at his Signing the Articles, deposit with the Treasurer, Three Pounds for the Use of the Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>BUT in my Opinion, it is not That Sort of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco that does us the Mischief, because for Colours we have many Buyers, and sundry Markets; so that if one Market will not answer, another may, and if one Buyer will not give a Price, another will; so that in that Case, it is more the Sellers Fault, than the Buyers, that the Price is run down.</p>

                        <p>WE very well know, the Price of all other sorts of Tobacco has risen and fell, in Proportion to what Price was giv'n for Tobacco by the <hi>French</hi>; that has govern'd the Market, and no doubt will do the like for the Future, or at least as long as those Sortments are in Demand, (almost only) for <hi>France:</hi> 'Tis true, were Leaf in Demand at other Markets, the Case would be altered; but as it is chiefly <hi>France</hi> that consumes that Sort, if the Trade of that Kingdom continues as now it is, in a Company, and that Company con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to employ but one Agent, to buy all the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco they have from <hi>London,</hi> it must be what To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco that Agent buys, that will for ever govern the Market, as in Times past it has done, and it is very natural it should be so.</p>

bound in Duty to offer my Thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wish every Other would as freely declare their Minds.</p>
                        <p>THE first and most natural Way, and what I chiefly wish may take Effect, or at least may be Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed, is, that the <hi>French</hi> Agent, and we, may come to a fair Treaty. He is so reasonable a Man, that were he made rightly sensible of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>nd we aim at, I cannot but think, so far from being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, he would think it reasonable every Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned should live by their Labour, and come into an Agreement with us, that would make both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and us easy.</p>
                        <p>THEREFORE I earnestly wish this Way be tried; and in the most genteel Way we can think of: If that should, as I am hopeful it may, take Effect, all other Methods will be needless to mention.</p>
                        <p>IF we do come to such a Treaty, I shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion some Things proper to be thought of in such an Agreement, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">I. THAT the Price to be agreed for, be only for those Three Sorts of Leaf he sends to <hi>France,</hi> which he usually marks ABC; we all know what Sortments they are.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. THAT the Agreement be for One whole Year, and no more.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. THAT the Price be either upon all Three Sortments in an Average,</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Or Three Prices, according to the Three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Qualities.</p>
                        <p>THE last I think is the most equitable Way, as it gives most Encouragement to the Planters to take Pains in handling their Tob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>TO prevent all Disputes about the different Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, I think we had better, to the <hi>French,</hi> make but Two Sortments of Leaf: For such as they call A's, will bear no Proportion to B and C, hardly Five such Hogsheads coming in an Hundred.</p>
                        <p>SO that were we to make Three Sortments, ABC, in equal Quantity, and let the middle Price be the Avarage Price <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THE Third, (or as I would have it,) the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sort, to be called C, and to consist of good Tobacco, proper for the <hi>French</hi> Use.</p>
                        <p>I would have a greater Disproportion made in the Price, between A and B, than between B and C; which two last Sortments, may be made pretty near in Number and Quantity to one another; always allowing the Advantage to the Buyer.</p>

            <p>THIS is plain, and needs no further Comment than to acquaint the Reader, that the Assistance here hinted at, is no more than some such Letter from all Parts of the Country, as is already sign'd by great Numbers, and sent from some Places.

               </gap>h Letter to the Merchants from all Parts of the Country as is already so Universally approv'd, and sign'd in all Places, where it has yet been offer'd: What ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be further necessary, and may be worthy of our Legislature's Consideration, is chiefly contain'd in Mr. <hi>Falconar</hi>'s Letters before recited, in Relation to the fixing a certain Time for the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off our Tobacco: The many Advantages and Conveniences that would attend such a Thing, are there so amply explain'd, that I need not add any Thing further to enforce them. And as lessening the Quantity, and mending the Quality of our Tobacco, is what every Body is already satisfy'd would be for the Universal Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as I have formerly, and several other Gentlemen since, proposed such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods as appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as the Evil we labour under, proceeds very much from the Discord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Merchants, to whom we Consign our To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, which they themselves allow, I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore particularly recommend it to the Consideration of our Legislature, Whether some effectual Means may not be found to oblige 'em to a strict and steady Union.
