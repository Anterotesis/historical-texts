            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE REASONS OF THE Conduct of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE whole Face of Affairs in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> is, within the ſpace of the laſt Year, ſo much altered, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible for the moſt uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Spectator to prevent his Thoughts from running out into Queſtions and Suppoſitions about it. Curioſity it ſelf, the loweſt Principle of all our Enquiries, will force its Way into ſuch a Scene: And will expect, or invent, ſome Account of ſo ſurprizing a <hi>Change;</hi> from a Calm hardly paralleled by any paſt <hi>Proſperity,</hi> to a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Gathering of Clouds; which, if not ſoon diſſipated, muſt burſt, and diſcharge themſelves ſome where or other.</p>
            <p>But when Self-Intereſt is joined to this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Curioſity, and it becomes a <hi>perſonal</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002880_0003_0FE685B2651B86E8"/>
               <hi>National</hi> Concern, to know the main Cauſes and Springs of ſuch Events, as All are intereſted in; there ſeems then to be a Right, ſtrictly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to demand and receive all the Satisfaction the Nature of ſuch Affairs can permit to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. In a free Nation eſpecially, where no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions can be effectual without the Conſent and ſupport of the Community, every Man, who can think at all, will think it an injurious Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if, at a proper Time, and in a proper Manner, ſome Light be not held forth to him; and ſome ſatisfactory Solution given of ſuch Appearances, as muſt otherwiſe very much perplex and diſturb him. And one Thing <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> themſelves are ſure to find, That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they ſhew ſuch a Regard to Thoſe who juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think they have a Claim to it, this Evil will come to paſs, that Mankind (always diſpoſed enough towards Diſſatisfaction, either through a ſort of natural Ill-will to Thoſe above them, or through a Wearineſs under the Continuance of the ſame <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> or through an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>Popularity,</hi> or real <hi>Patriotiſm</hi> not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſtructed) will take that Side of the Proſpect to dwell upon, which will af<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d them moſt Matter for Satyr at Home; and lay all the Load upon the Conduct of Thoſe, in whoſe Time of Power ſuch a <hi>Criſis</hi> of Political Affairs appears in the World.</p>
            <p>All this was never more true, than in this Nation, and at this Time. Every <hi>Briton</hi> who, either by his Treaſure or his Blood, by his Vote or his Intereſt, by his Perſon or his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, has in Time paſt bor'n any part
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002880_0004_0FE6858466EC2068"/>in procuring the common Peace, and eſtabliſhing the ſeveral Intereſts of <hi>Europe:</hi> Every ſuch Member of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, who, by this Time flatter'd himſelf with Hopes of enjoying the Reſult of all our Toil, and Taxes, and Blood, in an Univerſal Peace, and an extended undiſturbed Commerce, has a Right to ask,— How comes this Face of Things to be again over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded?—All <hi>Europe</hi> once more in Agitation— Three Fleets from <hi>Britain</hi> fitted out at a Great Expence, and with the utmoſt Expedition ſent to ſeveral parts of the World:—And, what is moſt unaccountable, the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> Powers that could hardly be kept within the Bounds of common Decency, towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by all the Addreſs of two powerful Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators in a publick Treaty, abandoning that Mediation; and, in the middle of it, privately running into one another's Arms, and uniting, in Deſigns deſtructive to the <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> of other Nations, with all the Marks of Cordial Affection, and a Reſolute Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>Is not This, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>—of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which has always felt the Want of the Friendſhip of <hi>Britain,</hi> more than of That of all other Nations beſides; to ſuch a Degree, that it has paſſed into a <hi>Proverb</hi> throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Paz con</hi> Inglatérra, <hi>con todos otros la Guerra: Peace with</hi> England, <hi>and War with all the World beſides?</hi> — of that <hi>Country,</hi> which reaps more Advantage from the Trade with <hi>England,</hi> than from that of all its other Neighbours put together?—And, Is not this
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002880_0005_0FE68625EBD0E370"/>the ſame King, whoſe Engagements to the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> in <hi>his</hi> Country, are as ſolemn and ſtrong, as the moſt expreſs Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can make them?—The ſame, who juſt before the Opening the Congreſs at <hi>Cambray,</hi> owned and ratified them all, by acceding in Form to the <hi>Quadruple Alliance;</hi> and accepting, by That, the Mediation of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And above all, if we turn our Eyes to the <hi>Emperor;</hi> Is not This the <hi>Prince,</hi> whom we once bore upon <hi>our</hi> Shoulders, out of the Reach of all his Enemies, and ſupported by <hi>our</hi> Strength, in the Time of his own greateſt Weakneſs?— The <hi>Prince,</hi> whom <hi>our</hi> Zeal, and <hi>our</hi> Fleets, and <hi>our</hi> Treaſure, laboured to ſix upon the Throne of <hi>Spain,</hi> at a Time when Difficulties and Dangers ſurrounded the whole Imperial Houſe at <hi>Vienna?</hi>—And now, Veſted, as we always wiſhed Him to be, with the High and Auguſt Dignity He enjoys; Is not this the <hi>Emperor,</hi> who may juſtly be ſaid to owe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation even of all his Hereditary Countries, and of his Imperial Crown it ſelf, (if we may have liberty to ſay ſo,) to that hazardous and unequalled March of the Confederate Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany,</hi> and to the happy Conſequences of it? To that <hi>Victory,</hi> in which the <hi>Britiſh, Dutch, Hanoverian, Pruſſian,</hi> and <hi>Heſſian</hi> Troops bore ſo great a part; and, in a particular Manner, to that <hi>Britiſh</hi> General, who projected and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the <hi>Whole?</hi>— And the ſame <hi>Emperor,</hi> who, as He was throughout the laſt War, the chief Object of the Love and good Wiſhes of this Nation, ſo, at the End of it, was eſtabliſhed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002880_0006_0FE685A51C6C0040"/>in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Flanders;</hi> and owes <hi>Oſtend</hi> it ſelf to thoſe victorious Arms, which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſupported his Perſon, and preſerved the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> for him? And all this long Scene of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Toil, entred into and proſecuted by us, We muſt own, againſt the repeatad Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of <hi>many,</hi> that We were haſtening apace to make Him a Power too great and too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable; and that we ſhould find in <hi>Him</hi> at laſt, the Enemy we then dreaded only in <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is natural for every <hi>Briton</hi> to look back, and to ask theſe and the like Queſtions. And the next Thought which ſucceeds, is almoſt as natural; That it is hardly to be ſuppoſed, that theſe Powers ſhould take ſuch Steps, without ſomething to juſtify them. We can hardly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine it poſſible, That, without ſome real and high Provocation, the <hi>Emperor</hi> could throw any the leaſt Indignity upon the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> or act any injurious or even hard Part towards a Nation who had ſacrificed ſo much Treaſure and ſo much Blood to his Service. And therefore we are apt enough to conclude, (and have Reaſon to do ſo, till we find it otherwiſe) That ſome great Miſmanagement on the Part of <hi>Britain;</hi> ſome unjuſtifiable Partiality towards Others; ſome Breach of Faith; ſome Outrage or other in Politicks, has been committed againſt his <hi>Imperial Majeſty:</hi> Or, that ſome unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Behaviour on our Part, with Regard to his juſt Intereſts, muſt have been the Occaſion of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct that ſo far exceeds the Common Maxims
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002880_0007_0FE6460F8C00FB98"/>of Princes and States towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And indeed, I ſhall be very free to own, If this be the Caſe; if either ſolemn <hi>Treaties,</hi> or any Engagements, with the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> have been broke through; if either Affronts, or even Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, inconſiſtent with the Duty of a faithful Ally, have been Part of the Conduct of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> towards his <hi>Imperial Majeſty;</hi> former Appearances ought not be ſpoken of; all paſt Obligations ought to be as nothing in the preſent Account: The <hi>Emperor</hi> has a Right to guard and ſtrengthen himſelf by Treaties <hi>contrary</hi> to his former Treaties, and to act the Part He judges beſt for his own Honour and Security: And we of this Nation have no Right to tax <hi>Him,</hi> either with Ingratitude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked, or with Breach of Faith without the Appearance of a Juſtification; but ought to turn all our Zeal againſt Thoſe, whoſe Counſels, and whoſe Behaviour, upon this Suppoſition, have made ſuch a Conduct on his part, wiſe, juſt and neceſſary. And the ſame muſt be acknowledged with Regard to <hi>Spain</hi> alſo; if any ſuch <hi>Excuſe</hi> can juſtly be alledged on that Side.</p>
            <p>We will now, therefore, enquire What has been the Behaviour of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſince his preſent <hi>Majeſty</hi> came to the Throne, towards the <hi>Emperor</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And, as we paſs, towards <hi>Spain</hi> alſo. And I will put the Account of this into <hi>two Periods.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> ſhall be, from his Majeſty's Acceſſion to the Crown, to the Opening the <hi>Congreſs</hi> at <hi>Cambray:</hi> The <hi>Second,</hi> from the Opening of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002880_0008_0FE6857DC2EDA240"/>that <hi>Congreſs</hi> to the Signing of the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> at <hi>Vienna</hi> between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the Time when his <hi>Majeſty</hi> came to the Throne of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſeveral Points of great Importance remain'd to be adjuſted, before the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> could be eſteem'd as a Thing fix'd upon any laſting and ſolid Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in particular, ſome Things very uneaſy to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and others very much deſired by <hi>Spain.</hi> In conſideration of this, his Majeſty, after other previous Treaties and Conventions, enter'd directly upon theſe neceſſary Points, which were fix'd in the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>London, July</hi> 22. 1718. entirely to the Enperor's Satisfaction: who was himſelf a <hi>Party</hi> in that Treaty, and confirm'd with his own Hand what his <hi>Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> had before ſign'd in his Name. His <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Dominions, always dear to him, He juſtly thought not very ſecure, without the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Sicily;</hi> upon which the Preſervation of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> very much depends. This great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Point, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> fix'd, as a main Article of this <hi>Treaty:</hi> and engaged, in Concert with <hi>France,</hi> that, <hi>Sardinia</hi> being deliver'd up to the <hi>Emperor</hi> by <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> ſhould accept of that Iſland in lieu of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which He ſhould yield to the <hi>Emperor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Part of <hi>Spain,</hi> a Favourite Point was likewiſe ſettled. Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> Son to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Queen,</hi> was eſtabliſh'd in the Succeſſion of <hi>Tuſcany, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Placentia:</hi> And This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, by the <hi>Emperor,</hi> who alone was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſturbing it; and effectually guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teed by the <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> I
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002880_0009_0FE685CAF1781FA0"/>will at preſent name no other Particulars, but theſe <hi>two</hi> principal ones. Some other Points, Circumſtances, and Incidents, in order to perfect the Peace between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd to be ſettled in a Congreſs, under the Mediation of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> And this <hi>Mediation</hi> made a Part and an expreſs Article of this <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to which the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> long ago, and <hi>Spain</hi> afterwards, ſet their Hands, and gave their ſolemn Conſent. The former of the two Articles now mentioned, <hi>viz. That</hi> relating to <hi>Sicily,</hi> did not long ſubſiſt in Words only; but was ſoon actually put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and the <hi>Emperor</hi> put in Poſſeſſion of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, Nothing but <hi>Friendſhip</hi> appears: And perhaps Friendſhip to Exceſs. What the <hi>Emperor</hi> exceedingly deſired, is granted to Him: And nothing granted to <hi>Others,</hi> but what the <hi>Emperor</hi> himſelf had previouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, as a reaſonable and fitting <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</hi> Neither had the King of <hi>Spain</hi> any Reaſon to complain, when the Succeſſion of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> was put in ſo ſure a Way of taking place at the Time appointed. So far indeed, was <hi>He</hi> from it; That, before the Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Congreſs,</hi> He himſelf acceded to the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and conſented to all the Allotments made in it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Congreſs</hi> was at length open'd at <hi>Cambray, Jan.</hi> 26. N. S. 1723-4. in order to ſettle all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Uncertainties, under the Care of the two mediating Powers, <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> This will be a <hi>Second Period;</hi> from this Opening at
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002880_0010_0FE685DF76C34598"/>
               <hi>Cambray,</hi> to the opening of another Scene at <hi>Vienna.</hi> And through the whole Management of this <hi>Congreſs,</hi> the Part the <hi>Mediators</hi> acted, was ſo impartial, ſo equitable, ſo agreeable to the Treaty of <hi>London,</hi> which was the Baſis of this Congreſs; that the moſt ſolemn Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal may be made to Both the <hi>conteſting Powers,</hi> Whether any one Step was taken, which could give any the leaſt juſt Ground of Complaint. No Appeal is, indeed, neceſſary. The <hi>Imperial Court</hi> would loudly have complain'd of any Conduct; if there had been any towards that Court which could have deſerv'd it. But there never was any Complaint of that Sort from thence: Nor indeed could there have been any made, without diſcovering at the ſame Time that there was nothing to complain of, but the too great Equity and Juſtice obſerv'd by the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators</hi> between the two contending Powers; and their reſolute Adherence to all <hi>Treaties;</hi> and particularly to <hi>that</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to which this Court itſelf had conſented. Nor did <hi>Spain</hi> make the leaſt Complaint againſt the Behaviour of the <hi>mediating Powers,</hi> through the whole Progreſs of the Mediation; but what aroſe from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Juſtice of the Mediators, in keeping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bounds of their Duty and Honour, and their not giving into any new and exorbitant Demands of that Court.</p>
            <p>Thus, therefore, ſtands the Caſe. Whilſt a <hi>Mediation</hi> was happily going on, under the Sanction of a ſolemn Treaty, appointing this <hi>Mediation;</hi> and this <hi>Appointment</hi> ſign'd, and conſented to, by theſe contending Crowns; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002880_0011_0FE685D574E88A58"/>any apparent Diſſatisfaction, or even the leaſt Pretence for it, a <hi>private Treaty</hi> is enter'd into, carried on, and finiſh'd at <hi>Vienna;</hi> in plain Contradiction to that <hi>Article</hi> relating to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,</hi> by which They had ſolemnly obliged themſelves to ſettle the Points in Difference, under the Eye and Influence of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> And the whole conducted with the higheſt Diſreſpect to the mediating Powers, and without the leaſt ſeeming Deſire of keeping the common Meaſures of Decency with them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, therefore, only the Manner and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending this Tranſaction between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> at <hi>Vienna;</hi> as it was a Violation of an <hi>expreſs Article</hi> of a former Treaty ſign'd by Themſelves, and an high and unprovoked Indignity offered to the <hi>Mediators;</hi> theſe were alone enough to juſtify the <hi>Mediators,</hi> in any publick act of due Reſentment of ſuch Uſage.</p>
            <p>But ſo far were They from ſhewing any ſuch Reſentment; ſo far from making this open Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, the Occaſion of an open Rupture; that, when the <hi>Signing of this Treaty was</hi> firſt, in Form, notified to the two Courts of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and it was declared to be no other than a <hi>Defenſive</hi> one, with Regard only to the mutual Satisfaction of the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and not contradictory, but perfectly agreeable, to the Treaty of <hi>London:</hi> So far were They from improving ſuch Uſage into a publick Quarrel, that both at Home, and by their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters every where Abroad, They expreſs'd a great Pleaſure that the <hi>Two Powers,</hi> whom the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators</hi> at <hi>Cambray</hi> could not bring even to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002880_0012_0FE6858C8C3DAEA8"/>Terms of common Civility towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had found the happy Means, without the Ceremony and Aſſiſtance of any <hi>Mediator,</hi> to get over Difficulties that had been declared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſuperable; and to link themſelves in the Bands of Friendſhip, upon Terms, not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent (as it was affirm'd) with the <hi>Repoſe</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> This was the great End of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs itſelf: And, if this End were anſwer'd; the Mediating Powers were not ſollicitous about the Means uſed in compaſſing it; but could paſs over the great Diſregard ſhewn towards Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in Conſideration of the ſolid and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good obtain'd by this Agreement.</p>
            <p>But in how decent a Manner ſoever, the Courts of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> treated this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair: Thoſe of the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſaw very well that ſuch a Step could not but be very ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Mediators;</hi> and ſtood in need of the beſt Apology They could make. And very luckily (as They or their <hi>Agents</hi> thought) for Themſelves, the Behaviour of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in ſending back the <hi>Infanta</hi> to <hi>Spain;</hi> joined with his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty's not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>ſole Mediation</hi> at <hi>Cambray;</hi> furniſhed them with One as good as they could have wiſh'd. And therefore, the <hi>Imperial Miniſters</hi> at <hi>Cambray,</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and at <hi>Paris,</hi> were very ready at firſt to put it all upon this; and to declare that, the Reaſon of this extraordinary Step was, that the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France</hi> having affronted his <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi> in ſo high and ſo unpardonable a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that <hi>Spain</hi> could not in Honour any longer act with the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> as a <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:002880_0013_0FE685D596C46A38"/>and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to act as <hi>ſole</hi> Mediator, when it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to Him to do ſo by the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> This broke off all Hopes of any Effect from the Congreſs at <hi>Cambray;</hi> and left his <hi>Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> nothing to do, but to fly to <hi>Vienna;</hi> and, out of a due Reſentment of ſo great an Injury, and the Neceſſity of his Affairs, to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entirely upon the Honour and Equity of that Court: And, more particularly, that his <hi>Imperial Majeſty,</hi> upon <hi>Ripperda</hi>'s firſt Applications, ſhewed a great Unwillingneſs to move the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations</hi> out of their Courſe at <hi>Cambray;</hi> but at laſt prevailed upon himſelf, out of Love to the <hi>Publick Tranquility,</hi> to conſent to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them on at <hi>Vienna,</hi> after he found it more and more plain, that the Reſentment of <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> and his <hi>Britannick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s Refuſal of the <hi>Sole Mediation,</hi> made it impoſſible to proceed at <hi>Cambray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the Language of the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> upon the firſt Notification of the <hi>Vienna Treaty,</hi> when they thought it needful to make an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for it. And tho' it cannot be affirmed that the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> did itſelf expreſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this, as the firſt moving Reaſon of that Piece of Conduct; yet (accorning to the beſt Accounts from <hi>Spain</hi>) upon the firſt publick News of the <hi>Vienna</hi> Treaty at <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Diſcourſes of many were taught to run that Way, and to dwell upon that ſame popular To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick. And without Doubt it was thought a very cunning Part, thus to attribute ſuch a Conduct to ſudden <hi>Rage</hi> and Paſſion; that <hi>this</hi> might
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002880_0014_0FE685E6F6E86D50"/>afford ſome Colour for a <hi>Treaty</hi> in Appearance ſo detrimental to <hi>Spain,</hi> and a little palliate the <hi>low Terms</hi> accepted by that Crown; and by this means, as they flattered themſelves, remove all Suſpicion of any pernicious and unjuſtifiable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret behind the Curtain, till the due Time came for revealing it.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Facts</hi> and <hi>Dates</hi> are ſtubborn Things, not to be ſhaken by the Sound of Words and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Speeches; this itſelf proved the moſt unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky Pretence poſſible: and only opened a Door to the beſt-grounded Suſpicions, that ſomething very bad, too bad to be owned, was at the Bottom of ſuch a Behaviour.</p>
            <p>The Courts of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were not ſo idle Spectators of the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> but that they had long before this the moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Proofs in their Poſſeſſion, that this Account of that Tranſaction was impoſſible to be true. The Reſolution of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> did not come (no, not in Suſpicion) to <hi>Madrid,</hi> till <hi>March</hi> 8. N. S. 1724-5. <hi>Ripperda,</hi> who conducted the <hi>new Treaty,</hi> had been ſent to <hi>Vienna</hi> above <hi>three Month</hi> before that: and even his <hi>full Powers</hi> for making this <hi>clandeſtine Treaty</hi> were ſign'd <hi>Novem.</hi> 22. 1724. And ſoon after the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> was ſign'd in form at <hi>Vienna,</hi> the publick Language at the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> was, That they had looked upon the <hi>Peace</hi> with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> as a Thing ſure ever ſince the preceding <hi>March</hi> 29. on which Day a <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> was known to come from <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> with the Nows of all the <hi>principal Articles</hi> being adjuſted, <hi>i. e. twenty one Days only,</hi> from the Day
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002880_0015_0FE685E8957122C0"/>of the firſt News at <hi>Madrid,</hi> of the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Reſolution of annulling his Marriage with the <hi>Infanta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſo evident a kind of Demonſtration, that Perſons of the loweſt Underſtanding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude from it, how abſurd it is, to make this <hi>Reſolution</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the firſt Step towards an excuſe for what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on, and ſet on foot, with full Powers ſigned for the Purpoſe, above three Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. For who is there, that cannot imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſee, That a proceeding authorized, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 22. could not be owing to an Affront which was not heard of, till <hi>March</hi> 8. follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And that a <hi>Treaty</hi> thoroughly adjuſted, in its main Articles, at <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſo early in <hi>March,</hi> as to be known at <hi>Madrid,</hi> the <hi>Twenty ninth</hi> of that Month, could not be ſo much as facilitated, or modelled by what was not known at <hi>Madrid</hi> till the <hi>Eighth</hi> of the ſame <hi>March:</hi> And which therefore, could not in ſo few Days be ſent to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to operate <hi>there;</hi> and the <hi>News</hi> of that <hi>Operation</hi> be return'd to <hi>Madrid?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if poſſible, it was ſtill more unaccountable to draw an Excuſe from his <hi>Britannick Majeſty</hi>'s not taking upon himſelf the <hi>ſole Mediation</hi> at <hi>Cambray:</hi> which it was well known he could not have done without an open Affront to <hi>France;</hi> and a manifeſt Violation of the <hi>Quadruple Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance;</hi> beſides other Inconveniencies. For it was not till <hi>March</hi> 9. 1724-5. that the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this.—The <hi>Motion</hi> was then to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>London;</hi> and the Anſwer to it, to be ſent back to <hi>Madrid.</hi> This Anſwer did not arrive
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002880_0016_0FE6859C1386D720"/>till about <hi>April</hi> 24. following: and therefore I need not ſay, could not have the leaſt Part in a <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> ſet on Foot above <hi>four Months</hi> before, and <hi>ſign'd</hi> in Form <hi>April</hi> 30. 1725. at <hi>Vienna, i. e.</hi> about a Week after his Majeſty's declining the <hi>ſole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation</hi> was known at <hi>Madrid;</hi> and when it was impoſſible to be known at <hi>Vienna.</hi> Theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were Pretences entirely foreign from the true Reaſons of that Conduct. The <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Vienna</hi> was authoritatively begun, and going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, long before the <hi>Provocation</hi> from <hi>France</hi> could poſſibly palliate that clandeſtine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable Proceeding. And it muſt have been brought to perfect Maturity, <hi>before</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo much as made to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to take on him the <hi>ſole Mediation;</hi> becauſe it was even ſign'd in Form before the Intelligence of the King's Reſolution againſt the <hi>ſole Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> could, with any Certainty, arrive at <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> And from ſuch an Apology at the firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the <hi>new Alliance,</hi> the Courts of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> had a Right to be jealous; and to ſuſpect ſome Secrets of a very pernicious Nature ſtill behind.</p>
            <p>But we have not yet done with this firſt Scene. It is proper to obſerve, that during this whole Proceeding, and for the Space of above three Months after the News of ſending back the <hi>Infanta</hi> was come from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Expreſſions of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> towards the <hi>Britiſh Court,</hi> ran as high as poſſible at the Court of <hi>Spain, viz.</hi> to this Purpoſe: <q>
                  <hi>That his</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty <hi>was reſolv'd to ſeperate himſelf for ever from</hi> France, <hi>and place his entire Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002880_0017_0FE68605756E5458"/>and Confidence ſolely in the</hi> King <hi>of</hi> Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain: — <hi>That to this End he now deſired to enter into the moſt ſtrict Engagements for the rendering that Friendſhip perpetual. — That it was hoped,</hi> his Majeſty <hi>would ſuffer</hi> the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations at Cambray <hi>to go on under</hi> his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation <hi>only,</hi> INTO WHOSE HANDS HE WAS DESIROUS TO PUT ALL HIS IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERESTS,<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> whilſt all this Time <hi>Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perda</hi> was acting with <hi>full Powers</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> in contradiction not only to this <hi>Mediation,</hi> and the Meaſures by which it muſt have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, had his Majeſty accepted it; but, as we ſhall ſoon ſee, to all ſubſiſting Engagements, and in Violation of the <hi>Laws</hi> of Friendſhip and Amity between Nations. Nay, whenever that <hi>Negotiation</hi> of <hi>Ripperda</hi>'s at <hi>Vienna</hi> happened to be touch'd upon, as a Piece of common Talk only, the Language of the Court <hi>of Spain</hi> was,
<q>
                  <hi>That he was an enterpriſing Man, and loved to make a Noiſe in the World:</hi>
               </q> inſinuating by this, that That <hi>Court</hi> had no Part in what <hi>Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perda</hi> was doing at <hi>Vienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>his Majeſty</hi>'s Reaſons for not taking upon himſelf the <hi>ſole Mediation</hi> were repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Force of them was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by that <hi>Court:</hi> and at the ſame Time a great Willingneſs was expreſſed to <hi>accept even of a Reparation from</hi> France, <hi>for the</hi> Indignity <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to</hi> Spain, <hi>ſo it might come thro' the Hands of the</hi> King <hi>of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>and the Pleaſure that</hi> Court <hi>would have, upon ſuch a</hi> Reparation,
<q>
                  <hi>in the Proſecution of the</hi> Negotiations <hi>at</hi> Cambray IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002880_0018_0FE685DF9983E7F8"/>WERE BEGUN; His Majeſty <hi>being a common Friend to both Parties, and One of whoſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> Spain <hi>had ſo often, and particularly</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this laſt Occaſion, received the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Proofs.</q> I hardly need to obſerve, that at this very Time Things were ſo ripe at <hi>Vienna,</hi> that the <hi>Treaty</hi> of Peace was ſign'd in Form, <hi>April</hi> 30. about ſeven or eight Days after this Language of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> at the Court of <hi>Madrid;</hi> and after theſe earneſt Deſires expreſſed, of the Continuation of the Negotiations at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray in the Manner in which they were begun</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Way of Speaking did not ceaſe yet: For after <hi>May</hi> 21. on which Day a Courier ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Madrid,</hi> with the News that the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Peace between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> was ſign'd on <hi>April</hi> 30. After this publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of a <hi>Treaty</hi> ſign'd at <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> was full of <hi>Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for not having communicated the Steps of this</hi> Negotiation <hi>at</hi> Vienna <hi>to</hi> his Britannick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and full of the uſual Profeſſions of
<q>a <hi>particular Regard for his Friendſhip, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Deſire of cultivating the ſtricteſt Union with him;</hi>
               </q> together with all Aſſurances, <q>
                  <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had been ſtipulated in this Treaty, in any wiſe prejudicial to the</hi> King, <hi>or to the Intereſts of his Subjects, or in the leaſt contrary to any of the Engagements enter'd into with him, either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately or jointly with</hi> France; and Expreſſions of a <hi>deep Senſe of the great Obligation that</hi> Court <hi>had to his Majeſty for the Proofs he had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given of his Friendſhip and regard for the Intereſt of</hi> Spain; always accompanied with
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002880_0019_0FE685E8B4839A80"/>the <hi>Hope, that what had happened would in no wiſe leſſen</hi> his Majeſty<hi>'s Friendſhip, which</hi> this Court <hi>entirely depended upon, and deſired to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate by all the Ways poſſible.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There were indeed Tokens and Symptoms of Evil continually, during this whole Scene of <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> ſhewing themſelves; fully ſufficient to guard againſt all Truſt in any ſuch Profeſſions, either of the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> or that of <hi>Vienna:</hi> and theſe, ſucceeded by <hi>worſe</hi> and <hi>worſe</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; and at laſt, by ſuch certain Proofs as can leave no doubt of a <hi>Secret Treaty</hi> of the moſt dangerous Conſequence between the two <hi>new Allies.</hi> And I will now mention ſome, in the Order of their Time.</p>
            <p n="1">1. On <hi>May</hi> 1. <hi>O. S.</hi> 1725. the <hi>Emperor's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> at <hi>London</hi> notified in Form to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the Signing of a <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> at <hi>Vienna</hi> between his <hi>Maſter</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> and communicated a <hi>Copy</hi> of that <hi>Treaty</hi> at the ſame Time. After Aſſurances that this <hi>Treaty</hi> was made upon the Foot of the <hi>Quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruple Alliance,</hi> with ſtrict Regard to all former Engagements, and the like; He expreſſed his Imperial Majeſty's Hope, that his <hi>Britannick Majeſty</hi> would <hi>accede</hi> to this <hi>Treaty;</hi> and by virtue of that <hi>Acceſſion</hi> be <hi>Cuarantee</hi> to the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> to the Territories of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> as ſettled in his Family by a late Conſtitution: and before he concluded, ſaid,
<q>That, after the ſigning of the <hi>Vienna Treaty, Ripperda</hi> acquainted the <hi>Emperor</hi> that there remain'd ſtill ſome Things to regulate between the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter, and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and that the <hi>King</hi> of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002880_0020_0FE685B28E06BE78"/>
                  <hi>Spain</hi> requeſted the <hi>Emperor</hi> to make uſe of his <hi>Mediation,</hi> for the ſettling them: That the <hi>Emperor</hi> had anſwer'd, that if theſe Affairs had any Relation to the Treaty of <hi>London,</hi> or aroſe in conſequence of that Treaty; and if it ſhould prove agreeable to his <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Majeſty,</hi> he would employ his <hi>Mediation;</hi> but otherwiſe, He would not concern himſelf with them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To all this it was anſwer'd,
<q>That, as for the <hi>Signing</hi> of the <hi>Treaty</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> it was no News here; his Majeſty having Iready by a Courier received Advice of it: That, with Regard to the <hi>Guaranty</hi> mentioned, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> could not conſent to burthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with new Obligations, by being <hi>Guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee</hi> of the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> lately eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Emperor;</hi> but was reſolved to leave his Hands at Liberty, in order to have it in his Power to regard, and aſſiſt, his true Friends upon all Occaſions that may ariſe; and that, as for what he had related as repreſented by <hi>Ripperda</hi> to his <hi>Imperial Majeſty,</hi> this Court knew of nothing <hi>Britain</hi> had to ſettle with <hi>Spain,</hi> but ſome Points of <hi>Commerce,</hi> for which there could be no need of a <hi>Mediator.</hi>
               </q>

            <p>And certainly, no one can think but that it was wiſely and happily judged, to refuſe a <hi>Guaranty,</hi> which might have been attended with ſo fatal Conſequences. For, as the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi>'s Children are now <hi>Females</hi> only; and the Influence of that <hi>Succeſſion</hi> upon <hi>Europe</hi> muſt depend upon the <hi>Marriages</hi> of theſe <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males;</hi> and as no one <hi>then</hi> knew, to what <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002880_0021_0FE685C41BC48D10"/>they might be hereafter married: It was wiſe in his <hi>Majeſty</hi> not to oblige <hi>himſelf</hi> to <hi>ſupport</hi> a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> which might poſſibly, by ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Marriages,</hi> become formidable to the reſt of <hi>Europe;</hi> and fatal in the End to <hi>Britain</hi> it ſelf. And as it was wiſe, ſo it is already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be <hi>happy,</hi> that ſuch an Engagement was refuſed: For (as it will by and by appear) the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> is <hi>already</hi> in Proſpect <hi>formidable;</hi> the <hi>Archdutcheſſes</hi> are deſtin'd to the <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Power</hi> ariſing from this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, as in all humane Probability may make the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> tremble.</p>
            <p>Nor can the Argument taken from the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi>'s <hi>Guaranty</hi> of the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> here, in his Majeſty's Family, (which has been ſince urged,) be of any Force in this Caſe. For, in the <hi>firſt Treaty</hi> between his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and the <hi>Emperor,</hi> this <hi>Prince</hi> abſolutely refuſed to be <hi>Guarantee</hi> to our <hi>Succeſſion;</hi> and never would hear of it, 'till by the <hi>Quadruple Alliance</hi> his <hi>Majeſty</hi> had obtained for Him the great Advantage of the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Sicily.</hi> As therefore, his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſty refus'd the <hi>Guaranty</hi> of the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> here, in his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Royal Family, in one Treaty, tho' a Treaty entered into and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with perfect Amity on both Sides; and as He would not <hi>afterwards</hi> come into it, but upon a very ſignal and beneficial Acquiſition to himſelf firſt ſettled: <hi>This</hi> cannot be judged a good <hi>Argument</hi> for his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to <hi>accede</hi> to a <hi>Treaty</hi> enter'd into and finiſh'd, not only without his Privity; not only without any Regard to his Friendſhip, or any one Mark
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002880_0022_0FE6864939527810"/>of Reſpect towards him; but in open Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>him,</hi> as <hi>Mediator</hi> at a Congreſs then ſubſiſting; and, under theſe very different Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, to become a <hi>Guarantee</hi> of a <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> of the Conſequences of which, to his own Kingdoms, and the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> no Judgment could be made, till the <hi>Marriages</hi> of the <hi>two Archdutcheſſes</hi> ſhould come to be ſettled and known. But, to return to our preſent Subject.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Propoſal</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s being a Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee for the <hi>new eſtabliſh'd</hi> Succeſſion in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> [to which the <hi>Emperor</hi> could not in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon expect a Compliance] conſider'd alone, gave Ground for a Suſpicion, that ſome latent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Quarrel was now treaſuring up. And this Suſpicion juſtly increaſed, upon the Offer of the <hi>Emperor's Mediation,</hi> coming at the ſame Time with this <hi>Treaty</hi> itſelf. For this <hi>Offer</hi> ſuppoſed <hi>Differences</hi> between <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> And as theſe muſt be <hi>Differences</hi> without any real Ground, (every material Thing being ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by <hi>Treaties</hi> between thoſe two Nations,) this look'd like a Deſign to blow up a Fire where there was none; and to preſume an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> which might be improved hereafter into an open Rupture.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible, as we paſs, not to obſerve how very artful the <hi>Manner</hi> of this <hi>firſt</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition muſt now appear, ſince Things have opened more to the Eyes of the World. The <hi>Offer,</hi> we ſee, is made for accomodating <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,</hi> withont naming, or hinting at, any particular one. There would be no doubt but that the <hi>Offer</hi> was really made with Relation to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002880_0023_0FE685C80D1814D0"/>
               <hi>Gibraltar.</hi> The Emperor's Miniſter was not to name this: But ſome time after, the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> openly ovowed, that the Mediation <hi>of the Emperor which Spain had accepted,</hi> was a <hi>Mediation for the Reſtitution of Gibraltar:</hi> Nay, and ſome time after that, the <hi>Emperor</hi> himſelf, (as we ſhall ſoon ſee) orders his <hi>Reſident</hi> here, to ſhew the <hi>Words</hi> in which he had obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this <hi>Mediation for Gibraltar.</hi> Again, this <hi>Offer</hi> is made, merely as ariſing from a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Ripperda</hi>'s; without the leaſt Hint of any <hi>Obligation</hi> upon the <hi>Emperor</hi> to make it, or to proſecute it. And afterwards, this Offer of <hi>Mediation</hi> appears, by Order of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Court, as an expreſs <hi>Article</hi> of a <hi>Treaty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> But, what is ſtill more, his Imperial Majeſty by his Miniſter repreſents his Anſwer to <hi>Ripperda</hi> to have been, that he would not concern himſelf in any Affair that did not ariſe in conſequence of the Treaty of <hi>London,</hi> not even ſo far as to uſe his <hi>Mediation:</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (as it will preſently appear) by his <hi>Reſident</hi> here, produces the Article itſelf, by which he had <hi>engaged</hi> himſelf to uſe his good Offices, that is, his <hi>Mediation,</hi> for the Reſtitution of <hi>Gibraltar;</hi> of that Place, the Poſſeſſion of which was known to be aſcertained to the Crown of <hi>Great Britain</hi> by that very <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> confirming the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht;</hi> and about which therefore, it was as well known, that there could be no juſt Ground for a Difference.</p>
            <p>All this ſufficiently confirms, in Event, the Juſtice of that <hi>Suſpicion</hi> of ſome <hi>Secret Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> between the <hi>Emperer</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002880_0024_0FE685BBB5F1B528"/>the Offer of this <hi>Mediation</hi> immediately raiſed in the Court of <hi>Great Britain:</hi> And this, before the Treaty of <hi>Peace</hi> now delivered could be read and conſidered. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the <hi>Treaty</hi> itſelf was read and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; and ſuch <hi>Friendſhip</hi> was ſeen to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed between <hi>ſuch Powers,</hi> upon <hi>ſuch Terms;</hi> the Conſideration of this might juſtly raiſe yet ſtronger Suſpicions. For thus the Caſe appeared. Nothing was found in this <hi>Treaty of Peace,</hi> of Importance, or, ſo much as in Appearance, Honourable to <hi>Spain:</hi> Nothing of the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> which had been ſo much inſiſted on at the Congreſs: Nothing of the <hi>Titles</hi> to be uſed by theſe <hi>Two Powers,</hi> but what might eaſily have been ſettled <hi>there,</hi> much more to the Honour of <hi>Spain.</hi> And, if we come to Points of much more Importance; the <hi>Neutral Garriſon<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> which, by the <hi>Quadruple Alliance,</hi> were to be the great Bulwarks of the Succeſſion of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> to <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> and every Thing the <hi>Mediators</hi> had propos'd for <hi>his</hi> Security, and that of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> were all loſt to <hi>Spain</hi> by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: Whilſt the <hi>Emperor</hi> gains every Thing, and particularly the <hi>Guaranty</hi> of his own <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> by <hi>Spain,</hi> which the <hi>Imperial</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors had ſollicited in vain at the <hi>Congreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſee, therefore, <hi>Two Powers,</hi> full of ſuch a Rancour againſt one another as had reſiſted the Influence of a powerful Mediation for <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Years, now in ſo ſhort a Space of Time run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into one another's Embraces, with ſo much Eagerneſs and Precipitations:—To find (upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002880_0025_0FE685C29ADB3E80"/>this <hi>new Treaty</hi> with <hi>former</hi> Pretenſions,) the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> at <hi>Cambray,</hi> ſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uneaſy with the good Terms it was ſure of obtaining by the <hi>Congreſs</hi> there; at <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſo <hi>readily</hi> ſubmitting to <hi>much worſe:</hi> —at <hi>Cambray,</hi> not to be ſatisfied with the Emperor's Faith, even with the <hi>Guaranty</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> together; at <hi>Vienna,</hi> entirely depending upon the Faith of the ſame <hi>Emperor,</hi> without <hi>any Guaranty</hi> preſent or to come: — What could be collected from ſuch an Appearance, even upon the firſt Reading, but that this <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> now communicated at <hi>London,</hi> was not the ſole Treaty made at <hi>Vienna;</hi> but that there muſt be a <hi>ſecret</hi> one ſtill behind, too unjuſtifiable to be yet revealed? And of this more <hi>Suſpicions</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thick upon one another. For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Soon after the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> was ſigned at <hi>Vienna,</hi> which was <hi>April</hi> 30. 1725. <hi>Ripperda</hi>'s Inſolences towards his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and even <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> began; and from that Time continued, till it was thought more <hi>politick</hi> to be more <hi>ſilent.</hi> Of theſe, the Advices from <hi>Vienna</hi> were now perpetually full. Such, for Inſtance, as theſe that follow, were his common Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>If King</hi> George <hi>ſupports</hi> France, we know <hi>very well how to place the Pretender upon the Throne.</hi> — Alberoni <hi>was a Great Man, but committed many Blunders: One great one was, That he ſent the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Fleet to</hi> Sicily, <hi>inſtead of Sending it to</hi> England, <hi>to dethrone the</hi> King; <hi>which might eaſily then have been done: and this once done, the Way had been made plain for every Thing elſe.—King</hi> George <hi>had beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002880_0026_0FE685E0DA690C20"/>how to come to Terms with us; for we have it in our Power to puſh the</hi> Pretender's <hi>Intereſt with</hi> Efficacy.</q> And in all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of this Sort, he always took it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Vienna</hi> would never make the leaſt Heſitation to enter into all the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Converſations of this peculiar Melignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Number, and without Meaſure. And ſo far was he from ſeeming to deſire, they might be kept ſecret, that <hi>one</hi> of his Speeches to his Company was this: <hi>I know all that I ſay, is told again. I am very glad of it. I ſay what I ſay, on Purpoſe that</hi> it may be <hi>told.</hi> Nor did he ſpeak with much greater Reſpect of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s Allies. Particularly, upon the Mention of the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Hanover,</hi> between the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Great Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> he ſaid aloud, <hi>Yes, yes, We ſhall teach theſe little Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen (Petits Meſſieurs) to make Treaties.</hi> And I will add here that, about this ſame Time, a very conſiderable Man in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> was not much behind <hi>Ripperda</hi> himſelf in his Regards towards his <hi>Majeſty;</hi> when, in a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> upon a Perſon's expreſſing his <hi>Doubt</hi> about his <hi>Britannick Majeſty's undertaking</hi> to be Guarantee of the <hi>Auſtrian Succeſſion,</hi> he anſwered with a great deal of Emotion. <hi>Then let him look to himſelf; for we are well inform'd they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be weary of him in</hi> England.</p>
            <p>We may well think theſe and many more <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults</hi> and <hi>Threatnings,</hi> from Perſons of ſuch Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure at that Time, ſufficient to create new <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:002880_0027_0FE6859BF1799A88"/>as well as to ſtrengthen Thoſe already created. Such Uſage, and ſuch Freedom of Language, could not ariſe out of <hi>nothing;</hi> but muſt be the <hi>Effect</hi> of ſome <hi>Agreements</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,</hi> not yet appearing to the World.</p>
            <p>4. Theſe <hi>Suſpicions</hi> were greatly confirm'd by the Accounts from <hi>Vienna</hi> of <hi>Ripperda</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of another ſort, immediately after the ſigning the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace: Expreſſions,</hi> I mean, dropt ſometimes, as it were accidentally, upon ſeveral very important Points. He did not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in proper Places, and upon proper Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to declare in Converſation, <hi>that</hi> Spain was <hi>engaged to ſupport the Oſtend Company;</hi> and when that led the Diſcourſe to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>We know</hi> Gibraltar <hi>to be impragnable; but by the Meaſures we have now taken here, we aſſure Our ſelves we ſhall oblige</hi> England <hi>to give it up.</hi> At the ſame Time, he ſpake of the <hi>Marriage of</hi> Don Carlos <hi>with the eldeſt</hi> Archdutcheſs, <hi>as a Thing</hi> agreed upon; and added, <hi>the</hi> Prince <hi>of</hi> Aſturias, <hi>for whom this Match was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, is conſumptive, and can't live.</hi> And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch <hi>Expreſſions</hi> muſt amount to the <hi>ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Suſpicions</hi> of a <hi>Treaty,</hi> as yet <hi>Secret,</hi> of which theſe <hi>Three</hi> important Points muſt make a Part. This is the <hi>leaſt</hi> we can ſay of ſuch Diſcourſe, coming from a Principal <hi>Agent</hi> in this <hi>New Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance;</hi> though at this Time only in the way of accidental Converſation.</p>
            <p>5. Theſe Suſpicions grew ſtonger, upon the Appearance of the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Commerce:</hi> which, tho' ſigned at <hi>Vienna</hi> on the Day after the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> yet, was not <hi>communicated</hi> to the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002880_0028_0FE685E0FB0D4770"/>Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> by the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Order: nor any <hi>Notification</hi> to this Hour, made, of ſuch a Treaty, either <hi>before</hi> or <hi>ſince</hi> the Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. The King's Miniſter at <hi>Vienna</hi> procured a <hi>Copy</hi> of it, as ſoon as it was printed there, and tranſmitted it to <hi>London.</hi> When this came to be read; and when it appeared in the plaineſt Light, that, by the Expreſs Words of it, ſuch <hi>Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were made in the <hi>Commerce</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> at muſt begin in the Ruine of our <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade, and end in that of all the other valuable Branches of our Commerce: What could the Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from ſuch a <hi>Treaty,</hi> but that even This, bad as it is, is not all; that there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet unknown to put in the <hi>Balance,</hi> on the Side of <hi>Spain,</hi> for all theſe unparalleled Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages given, againſt the expreſs Words of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treaties,</hi> to the <hi>Emperor</hi> and his <hi>Subjects;</hi> and that <hi>They,</hi> who were capable of entering into ſuch <hi>Articles</hi> as theſe, which now appear'd, could not hope to ſucceed in them, without <hi>other Articles,</hi> and <hi>another Treaty,</hi> ſtill kept in Darkneſs, till the proper Time of producing it ſhould come?</p>
            <p>6. About the End of <hi>July,</hi> or the Beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the D— of <hi>Wh—n</hi> arrived at <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Court of <hi>London</hi> was not ignorant of his real Errand: nor of the Sum of Money he received, in his Journey, towards his Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from the Pretender's Friends. And tho' he diſguis'd his Deſign a little, when he firſt appear'd at <hi>Vienna;</hi> and pretended to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s Friends there, that his View was only to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002880_0029_0FE6860EAF9B35C8"/>travel for a few Years, till the Memory of his Extravagancies at home might be a little effac'd, and his private Affairs in better order: yet, he quickly acted another Part in all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Conduct. He ſoon grew <hi>intimate</hi> with <hi>Ripperda,</hi> with whom he had frequent Conferences, and from whom he was known to receive Money. He was admitted to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi> of the <hi>principal Perſons</hi> of the Court of <hi>Vienna.</hi> And during his whole Stay, both <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Graham,</hi> the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Agent at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> had a very particular Intimacy with the <hi>Ruſſian Miniſter</hi> at that Court. At firſt the Project was, that He was to return to <hi>England,</hi> and do great Exploits there. But when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf began not to think <hi>England</hi> a very ſafe Place for one who had laid himſelf open; the Deſign of his Return thither was laid aſide; and another Plan was then concerted, of ſending him to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Pretender, and from thence to <hi>Spain.</hi> And before he parted from <hi>Vienna,</hi> his <hi>intimate</hi> and Fellow Labourer <hi>Graham,</hi> had long Conferences with a Perſon of great Importance at that <hi>Court:</hi> as he had <hi>afterwards</hi> ſeveral others. This <hi>Conduct</hi> of <hi>Wh—n</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and of ſo many conſiderable Perſons whilſt he was there, ſtill increaſed the Opinion, that the new <hi>Alliance</hi> could not be ſo innocent a Thing as the <hi>publick Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. The ſmooth Language at <hi>Madrid</hi> was by this Time gradually abated, and at length quite changed. At the End of <hi>June</hi> 1725. the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> openly avowed the Acceptance of the <hi>Emperor's Mediation</hi> for the Reſtitution of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar;</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:002880_0030_0FE685941834B378"/>but at the ſame Time made the uſual Profeſſions of Friendſhip for the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and hoped that this <hi>Acceptance</hi> of that <hi>Mediation,</hi> would not offend him. Nor did this Court make any Scruple frankly now to own that the <hi>Affair</hi> of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> had been from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a principal Point, concerted between the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> In Conſequence of this, about the Middle of <hi>July</hi> following, M. <hi>Grimaldo,</hi> by order of his Catholick Majeſty, wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his <hi>Britannick Majeſty</hi>'s Miniſter at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid;</hi> the Concluſion of which was very Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory: <q>That the Continuance of the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Commerce of <hi>Great Britain</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> depended upon his Majeſty's reſtoring <hi>Gibraltar</hi> forthwith.</q> And the Language of this Court, from this Time, was of an inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Strain, with Regard even to the <hi>King</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was then at <hi>Hanover;</hi> and in Words, not very civil, to this Effect, <q>
                  <hi>Let him make haſte home, and call his Parliament, and propoſe the</hi> Reſtitution <hi>immediately.</hi>
               </q> This <hi>Alteration</hi> in the <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Court of Madrid;</hi> this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Gibraltar</hi> in ſo peremptory a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> which <hi>Britain</hi> poſſeſſes by <hi>Treaties</hi> ſign'd by this <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> himſelf, gave another juſt Ground of Suſpicion of a <hi>Secret Offenſive Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> of a very pernicious Nature.</p>
            <p>8. What confirm'd all theſe Suſpicions very much, was, the <hi>Reception</hi> of <hi>Ripperda</hi> at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid;</hi> of the <hi>Man</hi> who had been the Maker of the <hi>Vienna Treaties,</hi> and who had uſed <hi>his Majeſty</hi> in ſo inſolent and outragious a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For, as <hi>before</hi> his coming thither, no Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002880_0031_0FE685F42B25B338"/>was ever given at <hi>Madrid,</hi> upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made of theſe <hi>Affronts</hi> and <hi>Threatnings:</hi> ſo, <hi>after</hi> it, all <hi>Honours, Profits,</hi> and <hi>Truſts,</hi> were heap'd upon him, in a Degree hardly ever known.</p>
            <p>And it was but reaſonable to conclude from hence, That, as the <hi>Court of Spain</hi> had veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied one Part of his Publick Diſcourſes at <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

9. As there are Times and Seaſons, when the Diſcovery of Secrets may be thought to be of ſuch ſingular Uſe, as to countervail all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of doing it: ſo it happened in this Caſe. <hi>Ripperda,</hi> now His <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi>'s Prime Miniſter at <hi>Madrid,</hi> thought it of the higheſt Importance to uſe all Means to prevent the Acceſſion of the <hi>Dutch</hi> to the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Hanover.</hi> And when he ſaw that other Methods failed of this Effect upon the <hi>Dutch Ambaſſador</hi> there; he had recourſe to thoſe which he thought would terrify the <hi>States,</hi> in their preſent Situation, from all Thoughts of doing it. At the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>February,</hi> 1725-6. With the utmoſt Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Poſitiveneſs, he aſſured both the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſter at that Court, that there was a <hi>ſecret offenſive Treaty</hi> between <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Emperor,</hi> in which They had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged themſelves mutually to ſupport one another in their ſeveral Demands: And of this <hi>Treaty</hi> he told them <hi>three</hi> particular <hi>Articles.</hi> I. That the Emperor was to aſſiſt <hi>Spain,</hi> in the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Gibraltar.</hi> II. That <hi>Spain</hi> was to ſupport the Emperor in his new <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of the <hi>Oſtend Company.</hi> III. And the <hi>Third</hi> was an <hi>Article,</hi> to ſettle the <hi>Quotas</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> on one Side, and <hi>Soldiers</hi> on the other, for the Purpoſes of this <hi>ſecret Treaty.</hi> This was to Influence the <hi>Dutch</hi> to judge that it would be in vain to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to alter or unſettle that <hi>Oſtend Trade,</hi> which was ſo reſolved upon, and ſo grounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Ripperda</hi> might have added another ſecret Engagement, into which the Courts of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Madrid</hi> had entered; <hi>viz.</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002880_0033_0FE6859623EA03F8"/>the placing the Pretender on the Throne of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and to begin with that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, before they proceeded to the Execution of their further Projects for involving all <hi>Europe</hi> in War and Confuſion. Of this Engagement the Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> received ſuch certain Intelligence from ſeveral Quarters; that it is no more to be doubted, than Theſe Particulars of the ſecret Offenſive Alliance, avowed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by <hi>M. de Ripperda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Ripperda</hi>'s profeſs'd Diſcovery of a ſecret <hi>Treaty,</hi> was ſoon farther confirmed by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. An Account of this frank and open Diſcovery was immediately ſent to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> And, at the opening of the laſt Seſſion of <hi>Parliament,</hi> A Noble Perſon in an high Station, agreeably to that Regard he owed to his Country, and to the Satisfaction due to that <hi>Auguſt Aſſembly,</hi> of which He was a Member, publickly declared it, in the Houſe of <hi>Lords,</hi> as an undoubted Truth, and what <hi>Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perda</hi> had own'd, That there was a ſecret <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive</hi> Alliance between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which contained <hi>Articles</hi> in it deſtructive of the Rights of <hi>Britain,</hi> both with Regard to its <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions</hi> and its <hi>Commerce</hi> abroad. This poſitive and undiſguiſed Declaration in <hi>Parliament,</hi> made a great Noiſe without Doors. And, upon the Signification of this, to the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> The <hi>Imperial Reſident</hi> here was ordered to give Satisfaction to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court, upon this Subject. Accordingly, he came to ſome of His Majeſty's Miniſters, and read out of a Paper the Words which he ſaid were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002880_0034_0FE685A692AADAB8"/>of the Article which His Maſter had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into, relating to <hi>Gibraltar:</hi> The which implied, that his Maſter had engaged to uſe his Good Offices for the Reſtitution of <hi>Gibraltar.</hi> And this was ordered to be produced, as a full and ſatisfactory Proof that there was no ſuch Thing as a ſecret <hi>Offenſive Alliance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two <hi>New Allies.</hi> One would think indeed, that no ſuch <hi>Effect</hi> could poſſibly have been intended by this Proceeding, or expected from it. For, as upon this Occaſion, it might have been naturally and juſtly expected, as a Thing abſolutely neceſſary to the Vindication of the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> that the <hi>Imperial Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> here, ſhould have been order'd to have ſhewn likewiſe what followed immediately this Article; and indeed the Treaty it ſelf, of which it was a part: And as neither of theſe was ordered or ſuffered to be done; the Whole of this taken together, will prove the Truth of that very imputation, which the Court of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> deſigned by this Step to vindicate itſelf from, as from ſomething unjuſtifiable and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable.</p>
            <p>If from <hi>Vienna,</hi> we go back once again to <hi>Madrid,</hi> we ſhall find ſtill more <hi>Evidences</hi> of a <hi>ſecret Treaty.</hi> For juſt about the ſame time that <hi>Ripperda</hi> ſpake ſo openly to the two <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himſelf wrote a Letter to the <hi>States General</hi> for the ſame Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of keeping them from acceeding to the Treaty of <hi>Hanover:</hi> which was read in the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland. Feb.</hi> 8. <hi>N. S.</hi> 1725-6. In <hi>this</hi> He acquaints Them, That
<q>He
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002880_0035_0FE685FDCEAB0CF8"/>ſtands obliged to aſſiſt his Imperial Majeſty, in caſe of a War, or Inſult — which He will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form — making it a common Cauſe — hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Enemies Thoſe who ſhall be Enemies of his <hi>Imperial Majeſty.</hi>
               </q> All which, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the States, who had no uneaſineſs with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> but on account of the <hi>Oſtend Company,</hi> muſt regard only That; and can have no Meaning but this, that, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould act, merely in their own Defence, and in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their own Rights, againſt that Company; His <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi> had entered into an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to aſſiſt the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and ſupport the <hi>Oſtend</hi> Company by Force, if needful: as it was explained by that King's <hi>Miniſter</hi> himſelf at the <hi>Hague,</hi> in a Declaration made by Him,
<q>That His Catholick Majeſty would look upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould be undertaken againſt the <hi>Oſtend Company,</hi> as done againſt himſelf.</q> This is an open owning of a Treaty, beſides That already <hi>Publick;</hi> and of an <hi>Engagement</hi> in it to ſupport the <hi>Oſtend</hi> Company by Force.</p>
            <p>To proceed; When about two Months after the firſt Declaration made by <hi>Ripperda,</hi> it was repreſented at <hi>Madrid</hi> how much the Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was ſurprized at this open Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, made to the <hi>Two Ambaſſadors, of a ſecret Offenſive Treaty:</hi> No other Reply could be obtained, but, in general Words, That the <hi>Court of Spain</hi> ſtill deſired the Friendſhip of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and that the Engagements en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into at <hi>Vienna,</hi> would not hinder this. Nor could any thing that was urged, move <hi>that Court,</hi> either to <hi>own</hi> this <hi>ſecret Treaty;</hi> or at all
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002880_0036_0FE6859649739610"/>to <hi>deny</hi> it. Very ſoon after this, the two <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> thought it proper to have a Conference with <hi>Ripperda;</hi> in which He began a little to ſhuffle, and to <hi>interpret away</hi> what he had ſaid of an <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Treaty,</hi> by endeavouring to perſuade them, That it was little more than a <hi>Defenſive One.</hi> But being preſs'd by <hi>Both,</hi> who agreed in what He had before told them; and required peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily to anſwer, whether he had not declared to Them expreſly that there was a <hi>ſecret</hi> Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Alliance between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> He anſwered, <hi>That he had told them ſo;</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>that all he had told them was true.</hi> And how indeed could he poſſibly deny it, ſince there was not a <hi>Foreigner</hi> of any Diſtinction at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who had not heard him, without Reſerve, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſame about this <hi>ſecret Offenſive Alliance?</hi> And whom can we believe in ſuch a Caſe; if not a Prime Miniſter ſo often affirming a matter of Fact to ſo many; whilſt neither the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> nor any of His other <hi>Miniſters</hi> at that time denied it; or at all look'd as if they had any Thoughts then of denying it?</p>
            <p>And once more, when an Application was made at <hi>Madrid,</hi> from the <hi>Britiſh Court,</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation particularly to the Part which <hi>Spain</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now to take in the Affair of the <hi>Oſtend Trade;</hi> at firſt nothing was avowed, but an Obligation to uſe <hi>Good Offices</hi> for accomodating that Affair. But, when a <hi>Propoſal</hi> was offer'd, which the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> acknowledg'd to be a very <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> one; and when upon this it was urg'd, That, ſince This Propoſal was thought a <hi>reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> One; if the Imperial Court ſhould refuſe to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002880_0037_0FE685F17A170860"/>liſten to it; This could be a <hi>juſt Reaſon</hi> why <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould not ſupport the <hi>Emperor</hi> any farther in what <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf judg'd to be unreaſonable; It was anſwered, <q>This could not be allowed: For <hi>Spain</hi> muſt ſtand by its <hi>Engagements</hi> with the Emperor.</q> This was a plain Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of farther <hi>Engagements,</hi> and of <hi>another</hi> Sort, than thoſe of a <hi>Friendly Accommodation;</hi> and by juſt Conſequence, of a <hi>ſecret Offenſive Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> For ſuch Engagements muſt be enter'd into by <hi>Treaty;</hi> and this <hi>Treaty</hi> muſt be diſtinct from <hi>That</hi> already <hi>publiſhed,</hi> which does not contain them; and it muſt be an <hi>Offenſive</hi> Treaty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in ſupport of an Invaſion made upon the <hi>Rights</hi> of others; and in oppoſition to Thoſe who act only in <hi>defenſe</hi> of thoſe Rights found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the moſt ſolemn Treaties.</p>
            <p>After all this, it is too late for the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſink the Credit of this <hi>Diſcovery</hi> made by <hi>Ripperda</hi> to the two Ambaſſadors; or to think of deſtroying the Credibility of what this Court it ſelf has given Teſtimony to. All the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of this Affair, as I have related them, make it too plain to be <hi>now</hi> evaded: And all who know any thing of <hi>Publick Affairs,</hi> will look upon what I have now produced, as a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and convincing <hi>Evidence</hi> of what before was only a ſtrong <hi>Suſpicion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore, we are too ſure of; That the now publick <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> made at <hi>Vienna,</hi> was it ſelf enter'd into without the leaſt Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from the <hi>Mediators;</hi> in contradiction to an <hi>Expreſs Article</hi> of the <hi>Quadruple Alliance,</hi> appointing this <hi>Mediation</hi> alone for the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002880_0038_0FE68605989ECBA0"/>remaining Differences; cover'd all the time at <hi>Madrid</hi> with the ſmootheſt Language, and the pretended earneſt Deſire of proceeding ſtill at <hi>Cambray;</hi> and made up of Articles ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to <hi>Spain,</hi> that nothing can account for them, but the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> of another, and this an <hi>Offenſive Treaty,</hi> yet private: That this is not only <hi>Suppoſition</hi> upon <hi>Conjecture;</hi> but is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to. Us, by Arguments too ſtrong to be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the repeated Affirmation of <hi>Him</hi> who was made Prime <hi>Miniſter of Spain</hi> after he had made this <hi>Treaty;</hi> the Acknowledgments in Effect of the Two Courts themſelves of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,</hi> with regard to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and the <hi>Oſtend Trade;</hi> and the Order from <hi>Vienna</hi> for producing at <hi>London</hi> an Article of a <hi>Treaty,</hi> in ſuch Words and in ſuch a manner, as makes it impoſſible to doubt of the Reality of it.</p>
            <p>We will now ſee what Light we can get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nature of This ſo certain <hi>Offenſive Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> and the other <hi>Treaties</hi> between the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> and in what manner <hi>We</hi> Our ſelves are likely to be affected by <hi>Them;</hi> with regard to, the great and only Security of all our other good Things, the preſent <hi>Proteſtant Royal Family;</hi> with regard to the Poſſeſſions of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> with regard to the ſettled Rights and Privileges of the Nation in <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce;</hi> and indeed, in conſequence of theſe, with regard to our being, or not being at all, a Nation worth exiſting. If after this, we extend our View farther, We ſhall ſee what is likely to be the Fate of Europe; and what will become
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002880_0039_0FE6861A0B455488"/>of the Ballance of Power, if the main Deſigns projected in this late Alliance at <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſhould be permitted to take effect. This Enquiry is the only way to our making a true Judgment of the Steps taken by <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Powers in Alliance with it. And when we have done this, — <hi>Let them that are Blind, be blind ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>firſt</hi> Enquiry which will offer it ſelf, upon this Occaſion, to the Mind of every True <hi>Briton,</hi> will ariſe from the Intereſt We all have, in the preſervation of our preſent <hi>Proteſtant Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment;</hi> and our <hi>concern</hi> to find out how <hi>This</hi> is already, or <hi>will</hi> probably be, affected by this <hi>New Alliance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know very well how eaſy and how common it is, to laugh at the Name of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is mentioned upon ſuch Occaſions; as a Political <hi>Bugbear,</hi> or <hi>Scare-crow,;</hi> a mere Word of Alarm; or a Puppet to be play'd by <hi>Stateſmen</hi> at their pleaſure, ond whenever their Deſigns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. But it would be very unfortunate for <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and end in the total Ruine of <hi>Us</hi> and our <hi>Poſterity;</hi> if Thoſe who are at the Helm, ſhould ſuffer themſelves, at the Pleaſure of ſuch as wiſh them no good, to be laugh'd out of that Care and Wakefulneſs which their <hi>King</hi> and their <hi>Country</hi> require of them. There is not a Day, nor an Hour, in which the neceſſity of Attention to this great Point, does not appear: Nor is there, I fear, any <hi>Criſis</hi> of Affairs in <hi>Europe</hi> poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at this time, without <hi>This</hi> bearing a great part in it. And therefore, when a Breach with a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who loves his <hi>Subjects</hi> too honeſtly to give up their greateſt
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002880_0040_0FE685A4FA9285A8"/>Concerns to the Demands of any Power upon Earth, is thought convenient and uſeful; no one can help concluding, from the known Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Courts of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the Moment They reſolved upon entring into an <hi>Alliance</hi> ſo injurious to his <hi>Britannick Majeſty,</hi> and ſo deſtructive to the Interiſts of <hi>Britain:</hi> The ſame Moment another Reſolution muſt alſo be taken: The Reſolution of giving his <hi>Majeſty</hi> all the uneaſineſs they could, even in his higheſt Rights; and either forcing Him by this Means to <hi>Their</hi> Terms; or prepairing the way for a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> after their own Hearts, from whom they may expect all Submiſſion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance. But this is only a probable Argument. Let us come now to <hi>Facts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already mentioned ſome Preliminaries; the Journey of <hi>Wh—n</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Intrigues and Encouragements there; as well as <hi>Ripperda</hi>'s <hi>threatning King George</hi> with the <hi>Pretender,</hi> before he left <hi>Vienna.</hi> But afterwards the <hi>Appearances</hi> of a <hi>ſettled Deſign</hi> againſt His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> and His <hi>Royal Family,</hi> ſoon began to thicken apace; and the <hi>Intelligences</hi> about it to be very poſitive, from all the Friends of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> at almoſt every Court of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, according to what had been before concerted at <hi>Vienna,</hi> the D— of <hi>Wh—n,</hi> with Letters Recommendatory from young <hi>Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perda,</hi> went for <hi>Rome,</hi> directly to the <hi>Spaniſh Miniſter</hi> reſiding there. By this Miniſter, he was introduced to the <hi>Pretender.</hi> In the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Houſe, he was kept cloſe ſhut up for <hi>Six Days;</hi> to hide, if poſſible, his being there: And, after
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002880_0041_0FE6859EC89B3388"/>very cloſe Conference, was poſted away to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> where old <hi>Ripperda,</hi> his great and intimate Friend, was now in high Credit and Honour.</p>
            <p>Thither he came with <hi>Credentials</hi> from the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender;</hi> and, as a publick Mark of Confidence in him, adorn'd with a Garter, and a new Title; and was very kindly entertain'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> with theſe open Diſtinctions of Treaſon and Perjury upon him. And tho' it was often ſaid, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and ſworn to, by <hi>Ripperda,</hi> that this <hi>New Agent</hi> ſhould be ſent away in <hi>twenty four Hours time;</hi> and as ſtrongly ſworn to, that he never admitted him, nor ever would, into his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; yet he ſtill remain'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> without any Mark of diſpleaſure, and was known to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with <hi>Rpperda</hi> himſelf in cloſe Conference. His intimacy with Count <hi>Konigſec,</hi> the <hi>Imperial</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the freedom of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits to him, were very remarkable, at a Time when he profeſs'd himſelf to come into <hi>Spain</hi> on no other Errand but the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Service; and this, without reſerve to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who were in the Friendſhip, and even in the Service of the Crown of <hi>Britain.</hi> This made it certain, that the Buſineſs of theſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Meetings with Perſons of Character, both in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Imperial</hi> Service, could be no other, than that which brought him to <hi>Madrid.</hi> At the ſame Time the late Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> was admitted to frequent <hi>Audiences</hi> at <hi>Court:</hi> In which no one could think that the Intereſts of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter were forgot. On the contrary, Now it was that ſeveral Projects for the Execution of what was the ſole End of <hi>Wh—n</hi>'s Journey to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:002880_0042_0FE68606C80AA3B8"/>were laid before the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to be weighed and conſidered in their ſeveral Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>What can the greateſt Well-wiſher to this <hi>New Alliance</hi> ſay, in Apology for this Conduct of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> as well theſe Audiences given now to the late Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> as the Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the D— of <hi>Wh—n</hi> was favour'd with, at a Time when he came directly commiſſion'd by the <hi>Pretender,</hi> and never attempted to hide the full intent of his Journey? What can any one ſay, who will but read the <hi>ſixth</hi> Article of the Peace of <hi>Utretcht?</hi> in which the <hi>Catholick King</hi> doth promiſe, <hi>as well in his own Name, as in that of his Heirs and Succeſſors, that they will not at any time diſturb or moleſt the</hi> Queen, <hi>her Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Proteſtant Line, being in the Poſſeſſion of the Crown of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>and the Dominions, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereunto; neither will the aforeſaid</hi> Catholick King, <hi>or any of his Succeſſors, give at any time</hi> any Aid, Succour, Favour <hi>or</hi> Counſel, <hi>directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, to any Perſon or Perſons, who on any Cauſe or Pretence ſhould hereafter endeavour to oppoſe the ſaid Succeſſion by open War, or by any Conſpiracies againſt ſuch Prince and Princes, poſſeſſing the Throne of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>by virtue of the Acts of Parliaments made there.</hi> And ſince his <hi>preſent Majeſty</hi> came to the Throne, in <hi>Article</hi> 5. of the <hi>Quadruple Alliance,</hi> (to which <hi>Quadruple Alliance</hi> the preſent King of <hi>Spain</hi> acceded, before the opening of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs at <hi>Cambray</hi>) his Catholick Majeſty (as the Emperor had done before) <hi>binds himſelf, his Heirs and Succeſſors, to maintain and guaranty the Succeſſion in the Kingdom of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>as eſtabliſhed in

Let but the late and preſent Conduct of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> be compar'd with theſe expreſs Stipulations; and every Reader may be left to make his own Inferences from ſuch a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. To return,</p>
            <p>The Evil I was ſpeaking of, was not to reſt in Words and Schemes; nor were the Projects I have mentioned, only propoſed in <hi>Theory.</hi> Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were actually made in <hi>Spain,</hi> to put the determin'd Purpoſe in Execution: Of which Preparations I will enumerate certain Particulars that could not be concealed.</p>
            <p>In <hi>February</hi> 1725-6, a Reſolution was taken to ſend a Body of Troops conſiſting of 12000 Men, to the Coaſts of <hi>Galicia</hi> and <hi>Biſcay.</hi> There were at that Time at <hi>Cadiz</hi> ſeveral <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships that were plainly deſigned for an Imbarkation: Two of them were of 70 Guns, one of 64, one of 56, one of 26, and one of 24; and all victuall'd for a hundred Days. And at <hi>Cadiz</hi> it <hi>now</hi> was, that 4800 Arms were known to have been bought, and deſtin'd to the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Service. His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s Miniſter at <hi>Madrid,</hi> did indeed, upon the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002880_0044_0FE68610B3915310"/>Diſcovery made to him of the Place where they lay in Pawn for a certain Sum, take effectual Care, by firſt laying down that Sum, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards paying their whole Price, to keep them out of the Hands of the firſt Purchaſers, who earneſtly ſollicited to have them, and frequently offer'd the Money which had been lent on them. For he knew from undoubted Intelligence, the Purpoſe They were intended for. Beſides theſe Ships at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> there were likewiſe then in <hi>Spain,</hi> three <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Men of War, one of 64 Guns, and the other two of about 40 Guns each, equipp'd ſome time before from <hi>Petersbourg,</hi> which came to <hi>Cadiz</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Winter</hi> 1725, to carry on the Pretence of Merchandize; but in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> went from thence to St. <hi>Andero,</hi> and lay there the three following Months.</p>
            <p>As to theſe three Ships, the Court of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſome time after they ſailed from <hi>Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> made a full Diſcovery, by Letters from the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Agent there, and others concerned in this Tranſaction, which fell into their Hands; that they had been fitted out at the Expence of the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Friends, with the Privity of the Court of <hi>Petersbourg,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Spain,</hi> to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in an Expedition for the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and that five more had been contracted for, and were deſign'd to follow. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the Time of their paſſing the <hi>Sound,</hi> ſo very particular a Joy was expreſs'd at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> by a certain <hi>Party</hi> there, that it could not but be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd by the Friends of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> at that place. And in their Paſſage, when they lay in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and afterwards were driven
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002880_0045_0FE685A6B39DF188"/>by Streſs of Weather into <hi>Ireland;</hi> his Majeſty's Officers belonging to the Cuſtoms, who, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Duty went on Board, found all the Symptoms of Enmity to his Majeſty; all poſſible Tokens of a warlike Deſign; and all the Fears of a Diſcovery that could ſhew themſelves. And <hi>after</hi> theſe Ships were ſafe in <hi>Spain,</hi> it was given out by one of the greateſt Men in the Court of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and written by another great Man, from his Mouth, to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> in order to influence the <hi>Swedes,</hi>
               <q>That the Alliance of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> would be of the leſs Moment; ſince the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court, and the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Meaſures in <hi>Spain,</hi> would now find thoſe two Powers full Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> And it was likewiſe <hi>after</hi> the ſafe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of theſe <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Ships at St. <hi>Andero,</hi> and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their ſtay there, that the Motions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Friends grew more and more vigorous in <hi>Spain</hi> Not only the late Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> admitted to frequent Audiences at this Juncture, but one <hi>Connock,</hi> the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s conſtant Miniſter at <hi>Madrid,</hi> hardly ever out of <hi>Ripperda</hi>'s Houſe; and one <hi>Pomphilly,</hi> lately come from <hi>England,</hi> offering Money to all the <hi>Broken Officers</hi> he could meet with at <hi>Madrid;</hi> (as ſeveral of them freely affirm'd, and particularly a <hi>Swiſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> One of thoſe to whom the Offer was made) and this profeſſedly upon a Deſign then on foot in favour of the <hi>Pretender.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the mention of theſe particular Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, I paſs on to ſhew what Uſe was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be made of the whole. So early as in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1725-6, 12000 Men (as has been ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove) were deſign'd to be ſent to the Coaſts of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002880_0046_0FE685F44E561AE0"/>
               <hi>Galicia</hi> and <hi>Biſcay,</hi> the firſt Project of the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> being to make an Attempt on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Dominions from thoſe Parts. But as ſuch a Body of Troops could not at that Juncture march thither, without giving an Alarm; the Pretence for it, made uſe of by the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> was, that they had certain Intelligence of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution taken by the Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to land a Number of Troops in that part of the Country; who were to burn and deſtroy all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and even the Shipping in all the Harbours. Under the Cover of this pretended Intelligence, which no one in <hi>England</hi> could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly give, and which no one at <hi>Madrid</hi> could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believe, the March of theſe Forces was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. But his Majeſty's Miniſter at <hi>Madrid,</hi> repreſenting to the Duke of <hi>Ripperda</hi> (who was then Prime Miniſter, and in the higheſt Degree of Truſt and Confidence with the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) that ſuch Intelligence could have no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and even that ſuch a Deſign from <hi>England</hi> was impoſſible; <hi>Ripperda</hi> promiſed the March of thoſe Troops ſhould be forborn, till a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court, to the Purpoſe of what Mr. <hi>Stanhope</hi> had ſaid, could be obtained. But the true Reaſon of delaying this March, was, that ſome of the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Friends had repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> that the ſending of 12000 Men to <hi>Galicia</hi> and <hi>Biſcay,</hi> without any Colour of Neceſſity for them, in a Country where there never uſed to be above two or three Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, would give ſuch an Alarm to <hi>England,</hi> as would inevitably put us upon our Guard; and therefore it would be more eligible to order that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002880_0047_0FE685848C5A4310"/>Body of Troops to <hi>Navarre,</hi> on a very natural Pretext of ſecuring that Frontier againſt <hi>France;</hi> but when there, they would be ſo near <hi>Gupiuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa,</hi> that they might be ready to imbark on a very ſhort Notice, in Tranſports to be provided at a Port of that Province; and be convoyed from thence by a Number of Men of War, of which thoſe three <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Ships were to be part. They propoſed at the ſame time, that ſome few Ships ſhould be ſent with Arms from <hi>Cadiz</hi> directly to <hi>Scotland;</hi> and a Body of 6000 Men kept ready by the Emperor at <hi>Oſtend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> being ſoon after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly informed, that ſuch vigorous Reſolutions were taken, and ſuch Preparations and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made, by <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that it was in vain for them to hope for any Succeſs at that Time from ſuch an Attempt; they ſuſpended for the preſent the putting this Deſign in Execution; the rather, finding themſelves obliged to ſend part of their Ships from <hi>Cadiz</hi> and St. <hi>Andero</hi> to the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indies:</hi> And the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Ships returned home.</p>
            <p>Thus in Fact ſtood the <hi>Caſe,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> at the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> before the <hi>vigorous Meaſures</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> alter'd it. And, who that conſiders the whole of this, will be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any the ſtrongeſt <hi>Verbal Aſſeverations</hi> of that Court, againſt ſuch Facts; when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd, That this whole Scene of the <hi>New Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,</hi> which is acknowledged to be framed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our <hi>Trade,</hi> and our Right to <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> was begun and carried on to perfection, under the Colour of the higheſt Regards to his Majeſty; and accompanied all along with the ſtrongeſt and moſt pathetick Aſſurances of <hi>Friendſhip?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:002880_0048_0FE6859EA1E1D400"/>
Eſpecially, if we add here, what ought to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court, and was ſufficient it ſelf to juſtify all their <hi>earlieſt Precautions</hi> and <hi>Preparations; viz.</hi> That ſoon after the publiſhing the <hi>Vienna Treaties</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> They had poſitive Intelligence, and Intelligence from more than one Perſon; and ſuch as could be entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on; That one expreſs Article of this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance</hi> between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> contain'd an Obligation in Favour of the <hi>Pretender;</hi> and a Stipulation to make the Attempt for him in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> before opening the War in any other parts. And by as undoubted Intelligence it was added, That the <hi>Pretender,</hi> in return, had ſince obliged himſelf to reſtore <hi>Gibraltar</hi> and Port <hi>Mahon</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> to be Guarantee of the Emperor's <hi>Oſtend-Trade;</hi> and lay open the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, with our <hi>Plantations</hi> abroad, to their Ships, with the fame Privileges as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves enjoy. And for this <hi>Article,</hi> enter'd into by the <hi>Emperor</hi> with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the Service of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> there is as certain Evidence, as of the Being of a <hi>ſecret Treaty:</hi> Of which I cannot think it poſſible to doubt, after what has been, and will be, ſaid upon the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> and the <hi>Oſtend-Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brings our Thoughts to the Court of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna;</hi> For <hi>This Article</hi> touches the <hi>Imperial Court,</hi> equal with <hi>That</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> and proves the <hi>Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s Cauſe, to be the Concern of the <hi>Former,</hi> as truly as of the <hi>Latter;</hi> and to be made ſo by an expreſs <hi>Stipulation</hi> in a <hi>Treaty.</hi> And this alone is <hi>Evidence</hi> enough of the worſt <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> towards a <hi>King,</hi> and a <hi>Nation,</hi> which have not deſerved
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002880_0049_0FE6859436743368"/>ſuch a Return from <hi>Vienna.</hi> For, <hi>This</hi> ſingle Point being certain, it will be of <hi>ſmall</hi> Importance to alledge the Conduct of this Court in not giving ſuch publick Tokens of <hi>this</hi> Diſpoſition, in <hi>Fact,</hi> as the <hi>Other</hi> has done: Which will only ſhew a cautious <hi>Prudence</hi> in the <hi>Execution,</hi> but not at all any <hi>Innocence,</hi> or <hi>Ignorance,</hi> of ſuch <hi>Deſigns.</hi> The <hi>Article</hi> alone demonſtrates the <hi>Deſign;</hi> and that is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>But indeed, if, <hi>after</hi> this, We conſider the moſt <hi>publick</hi> Parts of the late Conduct of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court towards this Nation, we cannot conclude leſs than this, That there is little Thought or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <hi>there,</hi> of keeping any. Terms with us, in any reſpect: I mean, that part of Conduct which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards our <hi>Trade,</hi> not only by Conſequence, but directly and immediately. At <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the preſent and future fatal <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> Eſtabliſhment are too viſible: At the ſame <hi>Oſtend,</hi> which was conquered and preſerved by <hi>our Arms,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> In <hi>Sicily,</hi> reſcued from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by our <hi>Fleet,</hi> as well as ſecured to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> by the good Offices of our King in the Treaty of <hi>London:</hi> In the ſame <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Kindneſs was ſoon returned by a <hi>prohibition</hi> of all our <hi>woollen Manufactures;</hi> and this <hi>prohibition</hi> not yet removed, but only <hi>ſuſpended</hi> for a while, upon the ſtrongeſt <hi>Repreſentations</hi> and the plaineſt Evidence, that this proceeding was againſt the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Treaties,</hi> which made the <hi>Britiſh Privileges</hi> there, exactly the ſame, as in all other Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Spain,</hi> to which it once belonged: Thoſe ſame <hi>Treaties,</hi> under which the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> at the Peace of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> took poſſeſſion of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:002880_0050_0FE685FA20077680"/>of <hi>Sicily;</hi> and under <hi>which</hi> the preſent <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> took it after him. And lately, in the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Dominions in <hi>Germany,</hi> preſerved from Ruine by <hi>the Arms</hi> and Money of Us and our Allies, moſt Species of our <hi>Manufactures</hi> are prohibited. So that in every Inch of Ground his <hi>Imperial Majeſty</hi> is poſſeſſed of; even in thoſe Countries gained by our Aſſiſtance, and where he is as cloſely bound by particular Treaties, as the moſt ſolemn and repeated Engagements can bind him: In all, He has acted the ſame part towards Us, in one of our tendereſt Concerns. And if the <hi>Imperial Court</hi> be reſolved to go on in theſe Paths; This alone muſt determine them to eſpouſe the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Intereſt: As They are fully aſſured of His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty's firm Reſolution never tamely to give up the Rights and Privileges of this Nation, in ſo eſſential a Point as that of Trade.</p>
            <p>But I have done: And I am ſure, have ſaid enough upon this <hi>firſt Point,</hi> to put it beyond all Doubt, that this <hi>New Alliance</hi> at <hi>Vienna</hi> contains in it, and will certainly bring after it, if not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gourouſly oppoſed, the moſt unſpeakable Evil to <hi>Great Britain;</hi> by engaging, and attempting, to ſubvert our preſent happy Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I will now ſay a Word or two about the Poſſeſſions of <hi>Great Britain</hi> within the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; and how They muſt be affected by this <hi>new Alliance.</hi> Theſe are <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and Port <hi>Mahon;</hi> won by our Arms in lawful War; aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to us as our Property, by all the Parties concerned in that War; and ſecured to us by all the Solemnity of Alliances, and Treaties, and particularly by this preſent King of <hi>Spain</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002880_0051_0FE6858258668560"/>in two expreſs Articles of the Treaty of <hi>Peace</hi> ſign'd at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> 1713. For, of the great <hi>Importance</hi> eſpecially of <hi>One of them,</hi> (I mean <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar)</hi> I would not be thought to ſpeak as any the leaſt <hi>Motive</hi> to a juſt and brave People to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and preſerve it, were not the Poſſeſſion of it founded upon the ſtricteſt Right, and the moſt undeniable Maxims of Political and National Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. But when that <hi>Importance,</hi> to which <hi>Spain</hi> gives Teſtimony by the eagerneſs diſcovered to wreſt it out of our Hands, is added to the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Poſſeſſion;</hi> No one among us, who is a true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his Country, can be eaſy under the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of an <hi>Alliance,</hi> which opened it ſelf to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> with the Civil Complement from <hi>Spain</hi> of demanding <hi>Gibraltar</hi> immediately, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Continuance of a Friendſhip, which cannot be violated without the Breach of all Faith and Truſt in Treaties; and with the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Obligation,</hi> to uſe His kind Help to bring <hi>Britain</hi> to a Compliance with that <hi>Demand.</hi> I have already ſpoken of this <hi>Demand,</hi> and this <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,</hi> as certain Evidences of a <hi>ſecret Offenſive Alliance</hi> between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> I now ſpeak of this <hi>mutual Engagement</hi> between theſe two Powers, for the Recovery of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> as <hi>one</hi> of the unjuſt and pernicious Conditions of their <hi>new Alliance.</hi> And, after I have before ſo plainly proved, That this <hi>Engagement</hi> makes one main part of it; not only from <hi>Ripperda</hi>'s repeated Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation both at <hi>Vienna</hi> and at <hi>Madrid;</hi> but from the perumptory Language uſed at <hi>Madrid</hi> after this <hi>Alliance</hi> at <hi>Vienna;</hi> and from the Teſtimony from <hi>Vienna</hi> added to This, that there was an
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002880_0052_0FE685FA43BE38B0"/>expreſs <hi>Article</hi> containing the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Stipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon this Head; and this <hi>Teſtimony</hi> given at <hi>London,</hi> by Order of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court, in a very remarkable manner. After the Proof of this Fact, I need ſay no more than that, if the Deſigns of this <hi>Alliance</hi> be not vigorouſly oppoſed, and effectually broke, the firſt unwelcome Evil to <hi>Great Britain</hi> muſt be, To ſee a place of the utmoſt Importance to us, if we will truſt the Confeſſion both of <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Enemies,</hi> wreſted from us by <hi>Force,</hi> (if it be poſſible) unleſs we will baſely yield it up to the importunity of Thoſe who ask it; and a place, which is our Honour, and our Strength abroad; a great <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Advantage</hi> to our extended <hi>Navigation;</hi> and a <hi>Convenience</hi> to our Ships of all ſorts, not to be equalled by any other Place, that can be offer'd by that <hi>Crown,</hi> which would deprive us of it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But indeed this <hi>Place,</hi> could it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to us by all our Strength and Prudence, would be of no Importance to us hereafter; if the <hi>other</hi> Schemes of This <hi>new Alliance</hi> ſtand good. It will be a ſmall Comfort to <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and little better than a <hi>Ridicule,</hi> to have in poſſeſſion ſo great a Convenience to <hi>Shipping</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> as <hi>Gibraltar</hi> is; if we are to be ſtripped of that <hi>Trade</hi> it ſelf, and to be reduced to the Condition of having little or no Occaſion for any <hi>Shipping</hi> at all. And yet, This I think muſt be the Caſe with us, if the <hi>Projects</hi> of this <hi>new Union</hi> are ſuffered quietly to ſucceed. For our <hi>Trade</hi> it ſelf, that Ornament and ſupport of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> muſt by Degrees be ſo affected, in almoſt every Branch of it, that it connot but
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002880_0053_0FE685F19C1266C0"/>naturally leſſen, Flag, and Dye, juſt in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this <hi>new Alliance</hi> gains Strength and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes. There can be little Hope, if this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction proceeds much farther, of obtaining any Redreſs for the many injuries in Commerce, already received; or of preventing many more, from the Side of <hi>Spain:</hi> and much leſs, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, of keeping the Deſigns at <hi>Oſtend</hi> from having Effect; which, taken with all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ill conſequences towards almoſt all the Branches of our Trade, are enough to awaken all <hi>Britons,</hi> who have been uſed to eſteem their <hi>Commerce,</hi> as their darling Good: — a Good, to the ſupport and increaſe of which, all their <hi>Treaties</hi> and <hi>Alliances</hi> have for many Years paſt ſolely tended; and in Compariſon of which they have deſpiſed, and left to Others the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi> of <hi>Tracts</hi> of Land, and <hi>Territories</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large Dominion and Power. Hitherto, We have always ſhewed our ſelves ſenſible that <hi>Trade</hi> was our proper Life; and the Encouragement of this, upon an honourable Bottom, the proper Nouriſhment of that Life. Every Inſtance of Conduct in any Power at Home, which has but ſeem'd to ſhake it a little, or to touch it, at a Diſtance, in an unkindly Manner, has been found to be ſo reſented, as to diſunite the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Friends; and at once to unite thoſe of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Views amongſt us, in a vigorous Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it. And every Step, in order to defend and promote it, has been received with univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Applauſe; and reconciled and enlarg'd the Affections of Men to ſuch Benefactors. And with regard to <hi>Foreign Nations;</hi> every hurt, any
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002880_0054_0FE685C440A9B168"/>of them do to our <hi>Commerce;</hi> every Breach into the Fences and Privileges with which that is guarded and enrich'd; every Shadow of a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency this way, has aways been view'd here, as the higeſt of all Injuries to this Nation, and the natural Subject for the genuine and juſt Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every true <hi>Briton.</hi> And if we are not dead to all this Senſe; if we ſtill retain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Life and Vigor of <hi>Britons;</hi> that is, of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion adorn'd and ſupported by the moſt extended Commerce that can be boaſted of by any People: What can we think of an Alliance between two powerful Princes, form'd, againſt the plain Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations of <hi>Treaties,</hi> in order to deprive us of our Glory, our Riches, our Strength, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend all upon our <hi>Trade;</hi> and afterwards, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend and preſerve Themſelves in their Acquiſitions of our Rights?</p>
            <p>Theſe are not Words without a Meaning; nor Fears merely of Imagination ſet on Work by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Reſentment: But real, Subſtantial, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable. For, if the Union of theſe two Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers proceeds upon the preſent Foot; and be not thoroughly broken in its terrible Parts; let any one ſay, what hope can remain of any Bounds to be ſet to the Injuries our Trade has ſelt, and muſt feel? Will thoſe <hi>Depredations</hi> and <hi>Hoſtilities,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of their Right to guard againſt <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine</hi> Trade; Thoſe Violences, by which the whole Commerce of <hi>Jamaica</hi> has been well nigh deſtroyed, and the Trade of that Iſland redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a miſerable Condition, be now redreſs'd? Or, will the Remonſtrances of theſe Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002880_0055_0FE68606E6F15C40"/>which have had no Effect <hi>before</hi> the Treaties of <hi>Vienna;</hi> now, <hi>after</hi> ſuch <hi>Treaties</hi> are made, meet with any better Reception at <hi>Madrid;</hi> and procure Us a more favourable Anſwer? Will any Complaints, or Repreſentations, in ſupport of the acknowledg'd Rights of the <hi>South-Sea-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> obtain now ſo much as a Hearing at the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> when the Strength of ſuch an <hi>Alliance</hi> is added to the former Diſinclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any Redreſs; and is ſuffered by the other Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> to exert itſelf? Or, will They, who have been hitherto unmoved by <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> at length <hi>voluntarily</hi> liſten to their Voices? Or, will the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which has ſtood out, <hi>before</hi> this Alliance, againſt all Sollicitations, relinquiſh the <hi>Pretenſions</hi> at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and act agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to <hi>former Treaties</hi> in the Affair of <hi>Commerce;</hi> now <hi>after</hi> the Riches of <hi>Spain</hi> are to come in, to the Aid of former Reſolutions?</p>
            <p>So far from this, that it is an expreſs <hi>Article,</hi> ſtipulated in this <hi>New Alliance,</hi> that, as the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> is to aſſiſt <hi>Spain</hi> in the regaining of <hi>Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;</hi> ſo is <hi>Spain</hi> obliged to ſupport the <hi>Emperor</hi> in his <hi>Oſtend Company,</hi> and his <hi>Commerce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Article, relating to the <hi>Oſtend Company,</hi> as part of a <hi>Secret Offenſive Alliance,</hi> (as I have before ſhewn) was more than once not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, but boaſted of, to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters at <hi>Madrid,</hi> by <hi>Ripperda,</hi> when he was prime Miniſter in <hi>Spain.</hi> But we have not only this Evidence. For, as in the Affair of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> himſelf, by producing an <hi>Article</hi> of a Treaty, gave Teſtimony to his having enter'd into <hi>Engagements</hi> relating to that
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002880_0056_0FE685D6E31E0938"/>Place; ſo, his <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi> has not ſcrupled to give his own Teſtimony, that, by this <hi>New Alliance,</hi> He has entered into <hi>Engagements</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Emperor</hi> in his Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Oſtend Company;</hi> not only by the Language of his Court at <hi>Madrid;</hi> but by what he wrote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ordered his <hi>Miniſter</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to denounce, by way of Threatning, to the <hi>States General,</hi> upon this Subject. of which I have given an Account before. And beſides all this, it is enough to look upon the <hi>Publick Treaty</hi> of Commerce ſign'd at <hi>Vienna, May</hi> 1ſt, 1725. to be ſatisfied, that ſuch Privileges in <hi>Commerce</hi> are granted, by <hi>Spain,</hi> to the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Subjects, as are contrary to many former <hi>Treaties,</hi> and to the moſt manifeſt <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>other Nations</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon thoſe Treaties.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enter minutely into all the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which are of <hi>Importance,</hi> upon this Head. The <hi>Subject</hi> has been ſo plainly ſtated, and even exhauſted, before the World aleady, that there can be no need of any Thing farther, than to refer thoſe who have not yet look'd into the Depth of this Affair, to the ſeveral <hi>Memorials</hi> of the <hi>States General,</hi> and of thoſe commiſſion'd by Them, upon this Occaſion; particularly thoſe which were printed here, in the <hi>Daily Courants</hi> of <hi>Dec.</hi> 16. 1725. <hi>Jan.</hi> 19. 25. <hi>Feb.</hi> 5. 8. 12, and 14. 1725-6. in which all the Pretences of their Enemies are compleatly and plainly anſwered; and the <hi>Matter</hi> placed in the moſt evident Light. I will only juſt ſtate the <hi>Dates</hi> and <hi>Intent</hi> of the Treaties, relating to the <hi>Commerce</hi> moſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acely affected by the new <hi>Oſtend Company;</hi> and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002880_0057_0FE6860E9245DF28"/>add a Word or two about the farther Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it.</p>
            <p>So long ago as the Year 1609, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the Truce then made with the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> granted them their firſt Privileges of <hi>Trade</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> by which the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Company has been from that time in Poſſeſſion of their Commerce in thoſe Parts. But theſe Privileges wanted <hi>Confirmation:</hi> and this they fully obtain'd from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> after long and mature deliberation, at the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Munſter</hi> in the Year 1648. by which, the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> not only granted the <hi>Hollanders</hi> theſe Privileges; but engag'd <hi>itſelf,</hi> to <hi>maintain and protect them, in the Enjoyment of theſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</hi> In this <hi>Treaty</hi> the Bounds were ſet to the ſeveral Pretenſions of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> and the <hi>Limits</hi> of their diſtinct <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Commerce</hi> there, exactly fix'd: and not only all other Subjects of <hi>Spain</hi> were totally excluded from the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> but the <hi>Caſtillans</hi> themſelves were for ever <hi>excluded</hi> from all <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Navigation</hi> within the <hi>Limits</hi> of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> as <hi>Theſe</hi> were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prohibited from entring into thoſe of the <hi>Caſtillans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, before this, the abſolute <hi>excluſion</hi> of all the Inhabitants of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> from all Trade or Commerce in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> was in the Year 1598 made an expreſs <hi>Article</hi> in the Act of <hi>Ceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> by <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the Marriage of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Iſabella</hi> to the <hi>Arch-Duke Albert:</hi> The <hi>Eighth</hi> Article of which <hi>Ceſſion</hi> is this, That
<q>The
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002880_0058_0FE6858C66283FE0"/>
                  <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> and <hi>Arch-Dutcheſs</hi> themſelves, and their Succeſſors, ſhall not exerciſe any Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and Commerce in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> under the Penalty of being deprived of thoſe Provinces; and if any of their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> ſhall act contrary to this, they ſhall be puniſhed with Rigour, in ſome Caſes even with Death itſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Neither was this at that time at all <hi>complain'd</hi> of by the States of thoſe <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> even when ſeveral other <hi>Conditions</hi> of the Reception of thoſe new <hi>Governours</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt, as ſo many Grievances upon the People of thoſe Provinces. Neither was there afterwards any <hi>Proteſt</hi> made by any Perſons concerned, againſt this <hi>Excluſion,</hi> whilſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was concluding the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> with the <hi>United Provinces.</hi> This ſhews that the preſent Complaint of the Hardſhip of ſuch <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> is <hi>new</hi> and <hi>artificial;</hi> and come many Years too late, as it comes after <hi>ſolemn Treaties</hi> made, and renewed, in expreſs Confirmation of this <hi>Excluſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed; After the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Munſter,</hi> an Accident happened, which plainly ſhewed, how the <hi>Fifth</hi> Article of that <hi>Treaty</hi> was underſtood, not only by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but by <hi>Spain</hi> alſo One <hi>Baſtien Brower,</hi> a Subject of <hi>Spain,</hi> either of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> or of <hi>Flanders,</hi> had obtain'd a <hi>Permiſſion</hi> from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to go to the Coaſts of <hi>China</hi> where he carried on a very profitable Trade. When this came to the Knowledge of the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Council</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India Company,</hi> they made a ſolemn <hi>Reſolution</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and ſent it as an Order to the Commanders
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002880_0059_0FE685E6D9867C20"/>of all their Ships, and to all their Subjects, <hi>to take this Man Priſoner;</hi> and if he defended himſelf, to uſe <hi>force</hi> againſt him. This had its Effect. The Man never appeared any more to give them far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trouble. Other Subjects of <hi>Spain</hi> deſiſted from all ſuch Voyages. The Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver complained of this Conduct; and by this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, plainly gave Teſtimony to the Juſtice of that <hi>Reſolution,</hi> as founded upon the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1667, by a Treaty between <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> all Privileges of <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in both the <hi>Indies,</hi> were granted to his <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Majeſty's Subjects, in as full and ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as they were granted to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the Treaty of <hi>Munſter.</hi> And in the Year 1713, a Treaty of <hi>Commerce</hi> was concluded at <hi>Utrecht</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Queen of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King of <hi>Spain:</hi> By the <hi>Firſt Article</hi> of which it is declared, That, <q>the Treaty of Peace, Commerce, and Alliance concluded at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in 1667, is ratified and confirmed by this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</q> and it is added, that, for the greater <q>Strengthening and Confirmation of the ſame, it has been thought proper to inſert it Word for Word in this Place.</q> Then follows that former Treaty thus ratified and confirmed.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1724, but one Year before this <hi>New Alliance</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> this ſame King of <hi>Spain</hi> was ſo ſenſible of his <hi>Obligations,</hi> lying upon him from the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> alone, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, by his Ambaſſador at <hi>London,</hi> a Memorial againſt the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Attempts upon <hi>Trade</hi> from <hi>Oſtend;</hi> in which he inſiſted, that the Aſſair of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:002880_0060_0FE6858AF5636B60"/>the <hi>Oſtend Company</hi> ſhould be brought before the <hi>Congreſs</hi> at <hi>Cambray,</hi> in order to have the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany aboliſhed, before he could in Conſcience think of confirming the Ceſſion of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> to the <hi>Emperor:</hi> And urges, that, if this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> ſhould be made by <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <q>without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving expreſly to it ſelf the excluſive Right on the Navigation to the <hi>Indies,</hi> in general, and without Exception; the <hi>States-General</hi> would be rightly entitled to demand Satisfaction of <hi>Spain,</hi> for having thereby made a great Infra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and would be diſengaged from the reciprocal Obligation to abſtain from the Navigation of the <hi>Spaniſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
               </q> That is, in other Words, that if he, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould not ſupport the <hi>Dutch</hi> (and conſequently the <hi>Engliſh</hi> alſo) againſt the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>'s new Eſtabliſhment at <hi>Oſtend; that then,</hi> I ſay, he himſelf ſhould be juſtly charged with a moſt <hi>diſhonourable Breach</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and Violation of ſolemn Treaties. Thus ſtands the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Spain,</hi> with regard to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the Affair of their <hi>Trade</hi> to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s new Attempts at <hi>Oſtend.</hi> Let us now conſider the <hi>Obligations</hi> and Engagements of the <hi>Emperor</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Alliance</hi> 1701, between the <hi>Emperor Leopold,</hi> King <hi>William,</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> is built upon this very Fountation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> as upon a <hi>main Ground</hi> of that Alliance. It opens itſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing, that upon the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> II. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> without Iſſue, the <hi>Emperor</hi> claimed the Right of Succeſſion to his Countries, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:002880_0061_0FE6858AD57E6930"/>to the <hi>Auſtrian Family;</hi> and, after other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, it follows,
<q>ſo that without ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy applied, the <hi>Emperor</hi> will loſe his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions; the Empire loſe its <hi>Fiefs</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> and the ENGLISH and UNITED PROVIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CES be deprived of the <hi>free Uſe</hi> of their NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIGATION and COMMERCE in the IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIES, and other Places,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it appears, 1. That the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claiming by <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> theſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> could not <hi>rightfully</hi> claim any <hi>Powers,</hi> but what were veſted and remained in <hi>Charles</hi> II. the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom they were to ſucceed; nor poſſeſs <hi>them,</hi> but upon the <hi>Conditions,</hi> upon which the deceaſed King himſelf had poſſeſſed them: And that the Emperor neither could, nor did, claim any thing that his Predeceſſors, Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> had parted with by ſolemn Treaties; and therefore neither could, nor did, claim thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but upon the ſome Terms and Contitions of Trade, on which King <hi>Charles</hi> II. of <hi>Spain</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed them, agreeably to ſolemn Treaties with other Powers. 2. That the Preſervation of the Trade in the <hi>Indies,</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Foot they enjoyed it, and in the Manner it was carried on, to the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. of <hi>Spain,</hi> was one ground, and a main one, of the <hi>Grand Alliance;</hi> and that the Emperor's Pretenſions to the Low-Countries were ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon this, amongſt other Conditions, that the Emperor ſhould reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precally ſupport their Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> on the Foot they had conſtantly enjoyed it. 3. It hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been already proved, that <hi>Holland</hi> ever ſince
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:002880_0062_0FE685C830F95A80"/>the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> in 1648, and <hi>England</hi> ever ſince the Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> in 1667, have carried on their Trade to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> to the Excluſion of the Subjects of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by Virtue of thoſe Treaties; it follows, That, in conſequence of this, and by Virtue of this <hi>Grand Alliance</hi> it ſelf (by which the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Claim to theſe Countries is allowed, and the <hi>Claim</hi> of the Allies to their <hi>Commerce</hi> alſo inſiſted on) the Emperor did in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect oblige himſelf and his <hi>Family,</hi> whenever in Poſſeſſion of theſe <hi>Countries,</hi> to take upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all the Obligations which the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom they ſucceeded, were under, to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> by former <hi>Treaties;</hi> and to ſupport this <hi>main End</hi> of the <hi>grand Alliance,</hi> relating to the Commerce of the Allies, (expreſsly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it,) as well as <hi>their own</hi> Pretenſions: and, inſtead of invading them themſelves, to defend them againſt all <hi>Invaders,</hi> according to the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of thoſe <hi>former Treaties.</hi> Nay, it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expreſsly ſtipulated, in this <hi>grand Alliance,</hi> ſuppoſing it to end ſucceſsfully; That the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> ſhould be (not the <hi>Property</hi> of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> abſolutely, and without any Conditions; but) a Barrier to the <hi>United Provinces.</hi> So that we ſee, the <hi>Emperor,</hi> in the <hi>grand Alliance</hi> itſelf, conſidered his own Right to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> with a View to the Trade of his <hi>Allies;</hi> and that the <hi>Spaniſh Low-Countries</hi> were eſtabliſhed in that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,</hi> as a <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Guard</hi> to thoſe <hi>Allies,</hi> whoſe Trade is now going to be ruined from them.</p>
            <p>But theſe <hi>Obligations</hi> are not only the real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and <hi>Conſequence</hi> of the <hi>grand Alliance:</hi> But it is declared in expreſs Words, in the Barrier <hi>Treaty</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:002880_0063_0FE685D706F02F20"/>concluded at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> in 1715, between his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Britannick Majeſty,</hi> this preſent <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> Art. 1. That <q>the <hi>Emperor</hi> (this preſent Emperor) ſhould enjoy the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> as they were enjoyed, or ought to have been enjoyed, by the late King <hi>Charles</hi> II. conformably to the Treaty of <hi>Ryſwick.</hi>
               </q> That is, with the <hi>ſame Privileges,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Obligations,</hi> neither greater nor leſs.</p>
            <p>After all theſe ſolemn Stipulations and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here recited, is it conceivable, what has now been done in the Face of the World? — That <hi>Emperor,</hi> who was under all his Father's Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: who could not ſucceed, even by his Title of Hereditary Right, to theſe <hi>Low Countries,</hi> but under the ſame <hi>Engagements</hi> with thoſe <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> to whom he ſucceeds: Who himſelf, in his own Perſon, has declared, in a ſolemn Treaty, that He enjoys theſe Countries no otherwiſe, than as they were enjoyed by the late King of <hi>Spain;</hi> that is, under the ſame Reſtrictions and Obligations to which that <hi>King</hi> was engaged: That ſame Emperor, inſtead of protecting the Commerce of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of others, himſelf openly invades it; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of puniſhing any of his Subjects in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> for <hi>Attempts</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> or reſtraining them, as he is ſtrictly obliged to do, He has himſelf <hi>erected</hi> a <hi>Company,</hi> and endowed it with great <hi>Privileges,</hi> on purpoſe to Trade thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, inſtead of yielding to the juſt Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of injured Neighbours, he has ſet them at Defiance, and ſtrengthened himſelf with a <hi>new Acceſſion</hi> of the Power and Riches of <hi>Spain,</hi> to
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:002880_0064_0FE685CACC472870"/>back this unjuſtifiable Seizure of thoſe Rights of <hi>Commerce,</hi> which are the <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> and peculiar Privileges of other Countries. Such has been the Conduct of the <hi>Emperor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the part which <hi>Spain</hi> has acted, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> is, if poſſible, ſtill more extraordinary; and more out of the <hi>common Road</hi> of dealing with <hi>Treaties</hi> and <hi>Alliances.</hi> For thus it is, — That <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> who enjoys his Kingdom under the <hi>Stipulations</hi> of the <hi>Treaties</hi> made by his <hi>Predeceſſors:</hi> — who has confirmed them all <hi>himſelf,</hi> in his own Perſon:— <hi>He,</hi> who in <hi>one</hi> Year declared it would be a Breach of his Treaties, for Him ever to acquieſce in the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Oſtend Eaſt-India</hi> Company: That ſame King, the next Year, does much more than this. He undertakes, by this <hi>new Alliance,</hi> to <hi>ſupport</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> in this very Eſtabliſhment. Not only this; but he grants to theſe very <hi>Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and all other Subjects of the <hi>Emperor</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> what he had no Right to grant to them, had they remained his own Subjects; nay, he grants them <hi>Privileges</hi> of his <hi>Ports</hi> and Places in the <hi>Indies,</hi> greater than are allowed to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> themſelves: And this, not only with reſpect to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> but the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> alſo. For by the 2d and 3d Articles of the <hi>Vienna Treaty</hi> of <hi>Commerce,</hi> a Liberty is granted to them, to frequent, and Trade in, the Ports of the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt Indies;</hi> Or, ſuppoſing this not directly granted, in expreſs Words, yet they are at leaſt permitted to <hi>enter</hi> into thoſe Ports for victualling or repairing their Ships: which will come to the ſame Thing. For if they may
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:002880_0065_0FE68610D6946158"/>enter into, and remain in thoſe Ports, till they have provided themſelves with all Neceſſaries, the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Bullion</hi> Trade is of that ſort, that no Precaution can prevent that Commerce.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible it may be objected here, that the Liberty granted to the Emperor's Subjects, by the Treaty of <hi>Vienna,</hi> to enter into the Ports of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in caſe of Diſtreſs of Weather, or for refreſhing themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no more than what was formerly granted to his Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> concluded in 1670. But it is well known, that the Liberty granted by that Treaty, has ceaſed for many Years; and that, in order to prevent the Abuſes that might be committed from ſuch a permiſſion, and that one Nation might not be more favoured than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother on any Pretext whatſoever in the Trade to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> ſufficient Care was taken of that Matter in the 8th Article of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> by which it is expreſsly ſtipulated, and declared in the following Words: <hi>Whereas among other Conditions of the general Peace, it is by common Conſent eſtabliſhed, as a chief and fundamental Rule, that the Exerciſe of Navigation and Commerce to the</hi> Spaniſh Weſt-Indies, <hi>ſhould remain in the ſame State it was in the Time of King</hi> Charles II. <hi>of</hi> Spain, <hi>and that therefore this Rule may hereafter be obſerved with inviolable Faith, and in a Manner never to be broken, and thereby all Cauſes of Diſtruſt and Suſpicion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Matter may be prevented and removed; it is eſpecially agreed and concluded, that no Licenſe, or any Permiſſion at all, ſhall at any Time be given to the</hi> French, <hi>or any other Nation whatever, in any Name, or under any Pretence, directly; or indirectly, to</hi> SAIL,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:002880_0066_0FE68619E8952900"/>
               <hi>Traffick,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the Dominions ſubject to the Crown of</hi> Spain <hi>in</hi> America; <hi>except what may be agreed by the Treaty, or Treaties of Commerce,</hi> (there referred to) <hi>and the Rights and Privileges granted in a certain Convention called,</hi> El Aſſiento de Negros. And the <hi>ſame Condition</hi> is likewiſe ſtipulated in the 34th Article of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the States. And there needs no other Argument to prove, that it was always underſtood by the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> itſelf, in the Senſe of not ſuffering any Ship to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Port of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> on any Pretext whatever, but to obſerve, That the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> are never permitted, though under the greateſt Diſtreſs of Weather, or want of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, to put into any of thoſe Ports; but their Ships if they come in, are conſtantly confiſcated: and upon this very Account, that, if once En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance were permitted, the Traffick could not but follow. Yet notwithſtanding that this is a fundamental Rule of the Treaties of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> and an Article of the general Peace, which is ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved with regard to all other Nations; it is notoriouſly violated, in Favour and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Emperor's Subjects.</p>
            <p>It is further to be obſerved, that with regard to the Articles of Commerce between <hi>Spain, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Liberty</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> of entring into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ports, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expreſly reſtrained to the <hi>Ports</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> But no ſuch <hi>Reſtriction</hi> is once mentioned in the late <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> with regard to the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Subjects. Nay, <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Privileges</hi> allowed to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> are in expreſs Words allowed to <hi>theſe;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:002880_0067_0FE685C2B86BF840"/>ſo much as an Exception to the <hi>South-Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ship,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſiento Contract:</hi> Whereas in the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht</hi> with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that Exception was expreſsly made. Thus has the King of <hi>Spain</hi> granted <hi>all</hi> our Privileges, and greater, to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of the <hi>Emperor;</hi> and inſtead of <hi>protecting Great Britain,</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> in their <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Commerce,</hi> according to former Treaties, he has now declared himſelf to be obliged and determined to protect, by Force, the <hi>Emperor</hi> and his <hi>Subjects,</hi> in their <hi>Invaſion</hi> of thoſe Rights. And, from all this put together, it muſt be as evident, as <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Facts</hi> compared can make any thing, That the <hi>Two Courts</hi> of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> have founded their <hi>New Alliance,</hi> as far as it reſpects <hi>Trade,</hi> on the Deſtruction of all publick <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Infraction</hi> of Treaties, and the <hi>Violation</hi> of all that can hold together <hi>Nations</hi> in Peace, and mutual Benevolence.</p>
            <p>After ſo plain a Proof of the great <hi>Injuſtice</hi> of the Attempt of the <hi>Imperial Court</hi> upon <hi>Trade,</hi> from the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands;</hi> and of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s determined Encouragement of it: It would not be improper here, to conſider at ſome length, the <hi>Importance</hi> and <hi>Conſequence</hi> of this Conduct to <hi>our ſelves;</hi> were it not that This has been ſet in ſo ſtrong a Light already, as to make it much leſs neceſſary; and particularly, in a <hi>ſhort Treatiſe,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>The Importance of the Oſtend Company conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Yet, before I paſs from this Subject, I muſt mention ſome few particular Conſequences of this new Eſtabliſhment at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and of the <hi>new Treaty</hi> of <hi>Commerce</hi> (by which ſo large Privileges are granted to the Subjects of the <hi>Netherlands</hi>)
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:002880_0068_0FE685BB9224ED90"/>with regard to our <hi>Trade;</hi> and in the end to our <hi>Liberties,</hi> and our <hi>Religion,</hi> themſelves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>United Provinces,</hi> it is plain from their whole Conduct, eſteem themſelves undone in their main Concern, if this <hi>Company</hi> be ſupported. And if <hi>They</hi> are undone in <hi>their Trade,</hi> it is well known to all, who are acquainted with the <hi>Track</hi> of <hi>Merchandize,</hi> that the Gain of their Loſs in Trade will not accrue to <hi>England,</hi> but fly to thoſe Countries where this Evil began. As to the <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>India Trade</hi> particularly; the ſame <hi>Rival,</hi> which ruines That in <hi>Holland,</hi> muſt by the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods inevitably ruine it in <hi>England.</hi> Nay, it muſt ruine it ſooner and more effectually here: Not only becauſe <hi>Holland</hi> has the ſole Property of the <hi>Spice</hi> Trade, beſides other Advantages; but becauſe the <hi>Dutch Merchandizes</hi> are free from the Burthen of <hi>Cuſtoms;</hi> whilſt our <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> give the greateſt Encouragement to the <hi>Oſtenders</hi> to run, and put off, a multitude of their Goods in <hi>England.</hi> The Damage and Ruine muſt be the ſame, as to our <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade, from the <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges</hi> granted by the <hi>Vienna Treaty</hi> of <hi>Commerce</hi> to the Emperor's Subjects: The <hi>Privilege</hi> of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring</hi> into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ports in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and by unavoidable Conſequence, of trading there, where neither <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> are ever permitted to enter upon any <hi>pretence;</hi> and the <hi>comprehenſive Privilege</hi> of enjoying all Rights which <hi>Britain</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, without any <hi>Exception;</hi> and, by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of interfering with, and hurting, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our <hi>Aſſiento Contract,</hi> but <hi>every Inſtance</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> which we have a Right to by repeated <hi>Treaties.</hi>

            <p>Nor can the Evil ſtop here, but muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity inſinuate it ſelf into many other of the moſt important Branches of our <hi>Trade,</hi> which have a mutual and indoſſolvible Connexion one with another. The convenient Situation of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> between the <hi>North</hi> and the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> for all the Purpoſes of an extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Trade:— The Advantage of the Ports of <hi>Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> which, though none of the <hi>beſt,</hi> yet may vye with thoſe of <hi>Holland;</hi> and will be as convenient Harbours for <hi>Privateers,</hi> as ever <hi>Dunkirk</hi> it ſelf was, when the time ſhall come for an avowed and forcible Interruption to <hi>Our</hi> Trade and that of <hi>Holland:</hi> The Goodneſs of their <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> for communicating all <hi>Merchandizes,</hi> at the moſt eaſy Rates, from Town to Town, and the later Addition of ſeveral large <hi>Canals</hi> &amp; <hi>Cauſeways,</hi> where the Rivers are wanting:— The Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Country, and the eaſy Price of all Proviſions, very advantagious to all Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:— The <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Privileges</hi> of the <hi>Towns,</hi> which ſtill ſubſiſt; very inviting to the ſame <hi>Manufacturers:</hi>— The <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> very well fitted for all the <hi>Improvements</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> and Manufactures:— And, to animate them, the Experience and Hiſtory of paſt Times, which will ſhew them, that they have formerly, with a little Encouragement from their Governours, flouriſhed in <hi>Manufactures</hi> both <hi>Woollen</hi> and <hi>Linen,</hi> beſides thoſe many which they ſtill retain) the <hi>Woollen</hi> now again reviving to a Degree of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at <hi>Limbourg,</hi> ſo as already to under-ſell the <hi>Dutch</hi> themſelves; and the <hi>Linnen</hi> more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived by the Advantage of the great Quantity

Theſe, and many more Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars ſhew, that, as one Branch of <hi>Trade</hi> leads to <hi>another,</hi> and one Trial encourages <hi>another;</hi> and as all <hi>Commerce</hi> is of a ſpreading and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative Nature, where it meets with proper <hi>Materials,</hi> and proper <hi>Encouragement;</hi> ſo this muſt probably be the Caſe, if the <hi>Beginnings</hi> of <hi>Evil</hi> be not looked after: That not only our own <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade, and that of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> will be ruined by the <hi>Oſtend</hi> Company, which will be the immediate <hi>Effect</hi> of it; (or rather is ſo <hi>already</hi> in a great Degree) but alſo, that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion</hi> will ſpread to many other <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade; and convey along with it the <hi>Riches,</hi> the <hi>Strength,</hi> and the <hi>Naval</hi> Power, to the ſame <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But were it ſo, that <hi>Holland</hi> alone would be the Sufferer by the <hi>Oſtend</hi> Trade (which is far from being the Caſe) yet the Ruine of <hi>Holland</hi> muſt carry along with it, in the end, the Ruine of <hi>Britain.</hi> For, as theſe two Nations, remaining United, are indeed the <hi>Turn</hi> of the Ballance of
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:002880_0071_0FE686731B81DEC0"/>
               <hi>Europe,</hi> whenever they join themſelves to any other great Power of <hi>Europe;</hi> and <hi>Both</hi> of them together, but barely ſufficient for this Purpoſe: Whatever ruines the <hi>Trade,</hi> that is, the Riches and Strength of <hi>theſe,</hi> deſtroys at the ſame time the Evenneſs of that Ballance, which alone can keep <hi>Europe</hi> in any tolerable Order. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Ruines any <hi>One</hi> of theſe <hi>Powers,</hi> does as truly deſtroy the ſufficiency of that <hi>Strength,</hi> by which alone that <hi>Ballance</hi> is preſerved.

            </p>
            <p>And I need not add, that the ſame <hi>Popiſh Power,</hi> which will gain all this <hi>Strength,</hi> (for it is in a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Power</hi> that all this muſt Centre,) will have the ſame <hi>Strength,</hi> and a greater <hi>Will,</hi> to extirpate every Appearance of <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> of what Denomination ſoever, out of <hi>Europe;</hi> without Exception to any one Church above another: Only with the fatal <hi>Exception</hi> of a more ſure and quick Blow <hi>to that Church,</hi> a great part of whoſe Revenues, as well as the Riches of a Multitude of its <hi>Members,</hi> ariſe from the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> and the <hi>Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Abbey-Lands;</hi> and whoſe unpardonable <hi>Crime</hi> it will be, to have been the great Support of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the <hi>Bulwark</hi> of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Cauſe againſt <hi>Popery.</hi> For where can that <hi>Church,</hi> or where can the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> hope,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002880_0072_0FE68673886A4FE8"/>I will not ſay, for <hi>Countenance,</hi> but for <hi>Sufferance;</hi> when the whole <hi>Proteſtant Power</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> which in its preſent Condition, is little better than a Creature with Pain and Difficulty ſtruggling for Life, ſhall be broken to Pieces by Acquiſitions, made by other Powers, of Riches and Force: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, which will be a double Strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as they are taken from Thoſe who alone have a Will to protect it, and added to Thoſe who have a Zeal to hurt and oppreſs it. And that <hi>this</hi> muſt be the <hi>End</hi> of ſuch <hi>Beginnings,</hi> ſuffered to proceed with Succeſs, and gathering Strength eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Step they go, is as plain, and as true, as, That <hi>proper Food</hi> will give <hi>Strength</hi> gradually to the <hi>weakeſt Man,</hi> capable of receiving it; too great to be reſiſted at laſt by the <hi>ſtrongeſt Man,</hi> who ſuffers it to be taken from <hi>himſelf;</hi> and who by that Loſs of <hi>Nouriſhment</hi> grows <hi>weaker</hi> and <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> as well as by the Strength added by it to the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will now ſay a Word more peculiarly relating to <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and the <hi>Concern</hi> this Nation has, in its preſent Circumſtances, in the <hi>Fate</hi> of its <hi>Trade,</hi> or of <hi>any</hi> of the Branches of it. The two laſt <hi>Wars</hi> abroad, upon which not only our own Safety, but that of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of all <hi>Europe,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and by which they were preſerved; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the continual Attempts of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſince the general Peace, to load us with the Chains of <hi>Popery</hi> and the <hi>Pretender,</hi> have run <hi>Great Britain</hi> into a vaſt <hi>Expence:</hi> and this Expence has left behind it an immenſe <hi>Debt;</hi> and this <hi>Debt,</hi> ſo juſtly due to the <hi>Creditors</hi> of the <hi>Publick,</hi> muſt be paid, both out of ſtrict Duty, if there be any ſuch
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:002880_0073_0FE6867C9ADEE030"/>thing as <hi>publick Juſtice,</hi> and out of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> if we have a Mind ever again, in any <hi>Extremity,</hi> to be truſted. This lies as a great and heavy Burthen upon the Minds of all true Lovers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: And, I know, that for the ſake of this ſingle Point, and from their earneſt deſire of ſeeing ſo great a Good accompliſhed, without any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, Many of the beſt Friends to the <hi>Publick</hi> are ready to regret any Oppoſition made to the Deſigns of this <hi>New Alliance,</hi> as the firſt Step to a <hi>War;</hi> and to ask, How much better, to bear the Inconveniencies mentioned; to ſubmit to the Loſs of <hi>Gibraltar;</hi> to be contented with all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the <hi>Oſtend Trade;</hi> to connive at all the Deſigns of ſuch Powers united; than to put any Stop to our Proſpect of a gradual Payment of our Debts?—Our main Buſineſs, they argue, is to free our ſelves from that Load. The <hi>ſinking</hi> Fund is a good Beginning; and, if not hindred by Quarrels with Powers abroad, muſt go on to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh our Debt. This Payment of our Debt, we ſhould look after, as our Strength in future Times, and our greateſt Force againſt our <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> and not ſhew our ſelves ſo concerned about the Points juſt now mentioned.</p>
            <p>On the other Side, I cannot help entirely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from all this. Nay, I cannot forbear to urge this very <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>New Alliance,</hi> as the only certain Method of taking any one Step farther towards this great Good; as ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that <hi>without it,</hi> there is an End of all Hope of it. And I contend for the moſt <hi>vigorous Oppoſition</hi> to the Deſigns of this <hi>New Alliance,</hi> for this very Reaſon, becauſe we are in Debt; and
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:002880_0074_0FE6868E8E9CB130"/>muſt be for ever in Debt; and ſhall never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have it in our power to pay any <hi>Part</hi> more of that <hi>Debt,</hi> if thoſe Deſigns go on unoppoſed and unreſiſted.</p>
            <p>For in the firſt Place, They who argue againſt it, from this Conſideration, leave out a <hi>main Point;</hi> and a Point which comprehends all other Evils in it and that is, the <hi>continued Attempts</hi> of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Pretender</hi> upon us: Which muſt ſucceed, unleſs we ſhew our ſelves determined to oppoſe any Power engaged in Support of ſuch Deſigns. And if this <hi>one thing</hi> ſucceeds, it is of ſmall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to our <hi>Debt,</hi> what our Trade will be after this is effected. Every one can ſee that a Debt, contracted in order to keep out <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Family</hi> for ever, will never be paid, but by <hi>one univerſal Blot</hi> ſpread over the Face of the whole Accompt; if <hi>He</hi> ſhould ever be ſettled here, againſt whom this <hi>Debt</hi> has raiſed Armies, and mann'd Fleets, and faught many ſucceſsful Battles. What Good therefore, towards the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Debt, will a ſupine Negligence do? or what Account can the <hi>Creditors</hi> of the <hi>Publick</hi> hope to find, from not oppoſing an Alliance which may otherwiſe too probably end in the eſtabliſhing a <hi>King</hi> here, under whom the leaſt Evil will be this, That the Creditors of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick will be ſure of loſing at once their whole juſt <hi>Debt,</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of it?</p>
            <p>But, putting the <hi>Pretender</hi> wholly out of the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> as a Perſon not in Being; Or, ſuppoſing our ſelves ſecure from every future Attempt in his Favour: yet, the <hi>Caſe</hi> with Reſpect to the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Debt,</hi> muſt very ſoon be the ſame;
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:002880_0075_0FE6866902298338"/>(however it may happily differ <hi>in many</hi> other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars) if the Conditions of theſe <hi>New Treaties</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> both <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Private,</hi> are, through our ſupine Negligence, ſuffer'd to be fulfilled. For, what is the <hi>ſinking Fund</hi> from which we hope for Relief? It is the <hi>Surplus</hi> of the <hi>Produce</hi> of the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Exciſes,</hi> after the Payment of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Liſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>National Debt.</hi> Theſe <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> are the <hi>Appurtenances</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce.</hi> Take away <hi>any</hi> Part of this <hi>Trade,</hi> or diminiſh it in any Branch; juſt ſo much in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion you diminiſh or take away from theſe <hi>Cuſtoms.</hi> The firſt thing therefore, that muſt feel the <hi>Diminution</hi> of our <hi>Trade,</hi> is the Produce of our <hi>Cuſtoms;</hi> and the firſt thing that muſt feel the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of our <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> is the <hi>Sinking Fund:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Civil Liſt</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Debt</hi> muſt firſt be paid, before <hi>any Surplus</hi> at all can be laid apart for the <hi>Payment</hi> of the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal.</hi> Let therefore your Trade decay; permit the <hi>New Company</hi> at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> to make your own <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               </hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade utterly impracticable; and ſuffer your own <hi>Commerce</hi> to be by Degrees tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, and to flouriſh, in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Advantages and Encouragements in thoſe Parts juſt now mentioned; beſides the <hi>Prohibitions</hi> upon your own <hi>Manufactures</hi> every Day increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon you: and this alone will immediately prevent any ſuch <hi>Surpluſage</hi> from remaining. For what Need of Words?

And then, the <hi>longer</hi> the <hi>Oſtend</hi> Company con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; its Commerce, the <hi>ſtronger</hi> and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended muſt it grow; and the more extended that

               </gap> In the <hi>other</hi> Way, the ſame <hi>Diminution,</hi> and Loſs of the Means of paying the <hi>Debt,</hi> and even the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of it, will be the Fate of this Nation and that, with this <hi>unhappy</hi> Aggravation; that if the Loſs comes <hi>this Way,</hi> it is never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd; nor any Hope left of that Payment ſo the future.</p>
            <p>As others therefore are moved by a Regard to this great Good to the Nation, to be averſe to a Methods of <hi>vigorous</hi> Oppoſition; I cannot help being moved by the ſame Regard, the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Way: and what They <hi>fear,</hi> becauſe we have ſuch a <hi>Debt</hi> upon us, which ought to be paid; that I <hi>wiſh,</hi> for the ſame Reaſon, becauſe we are in Debt; and that <hi>Debt</hi> ought to be paid; and that Debt cannot be paid without ſuch an <hi>Opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> as may preſerve our Commerce upon a <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> granted to it by the moſt ſolemn <hi>Treties,</hi> the only <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of the <hi>Toil</hi> and <hi>Expence</hi> of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Foundation,</hi> as alone can enable us to go on in a gradual Juſtice to the <hi>Creditors</hi> of the Publick.</p>

And in ſuch a Method of proceeding, This ought to be our great Support and Confidence, that it is not an arbitrary Contention againſt the Rights of any other Nation in the World; nor a Conteſt of our Trade, merely as our great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or as the Inſtrument of paying the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <hi>Debt,</hi> and ſecuring the National Happineſs; but really and truly a Contention for our ſtrict Right and Due, invaded with an high Hand by other Powers, againſt the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Treaties,</hi> as well as the Force of the higheſt Obligations. Nor can we conceive a more abject Servility of Conduct, than for a <hi>People</hi> ſo long fam'd for <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> and <hi>Bravery,</hi> to ſee their <hi>Darling Good,</hi> and peculiar Glory; the Pledge of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and Life of all their Property, juſt going to be forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and unrighteouſly torn from them; and tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look on without <hi>one Struggle</hi> for ſo great a Bleſſing, or one hearty Effort againſt the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it. What can we become, if we give our Conſent to ſuch Ruine by our own ſupine Indolence and Inſenſibility; and ſuffer our ſelves to be ſtripp'd of our boaſted Strength and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at once; but a Nation, the moſt deſpicable of all Nations under Heaven; expoſed to the Contempt and Inſults of the World about us here <hi>below,</hi> and render'd utterly unworthy, by our own Conduct, of the Care of Providence <hi>above us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. After all this ſaid upon the Conſequence of this <hi>New Alliance,</hi> with a particular Reſpect to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Eſtabliſhment, the <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> and the <hi>Commerce,</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> it will be very proper now to touch upon another <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Secret</hi> Part of it, in which, not only <hi>Britain,</hi> but
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:002880_0079_0FE6867B756B6A40"/>all <hi>Europe</hi> in general, is extremely concern'd: I mean the <hi>Marriages</hi> agreed upon, between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> which, added to the <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive</hi> and <hi>extended Trade</hi> now likely to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> muſt conſtitute a Power in <hi>one Family</hi> beyond all that we have known, Formidable and Irriſiſtible. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages</hi> I ſpeak of, are <hi>thoſe</hi> of the two <hi>Arch Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes, Daughters</hi> to the preſent <hi>Emperor,</hi> with the two <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> Sons to the <hi>King</hi> by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Queen.</hi> And that theſe are agreed upon, as a main and eſſential Point in this <hi>New Alliance,</hi> We have the following Proofs.</p>
            <p n="2">1. Immediately after the Signing the <hi>Publick Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> at <hi>Vienna, Ripperda</hi> very freely talk'd of the <hi>Marriage</hi> of <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> the <hi>eldeſt</hi> Son of the preſent Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> with the <hi>eldeſt Arch Dutcheſs,</hi> as a fixt Matter; and that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Aſturias</hi> was diſregarded in this <hi>Alliance,</hi> becauſe of his ill Health, as he pretended at that Time: and a little while after, he ſpake as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and poſitively about the <hi>Marriages,</hi> both of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and his <hi>Brother.</hi> One of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations was very Remarkable, and full of ſuch <hi>Circumſtances</hi> as will not let Us doubt of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Subject of it.
<q>The King's <hi>Miniſters</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, (<hi>ſays He</hi>) are bitter againſt me: but I laugh at all that. The <hi>Queen</hi> will protect me. I have done <hi>her</hi> ſuch Services that <hi>ſhe</hi> can't abandon me: for thus the Matter ſtands. The <hi>Propoſals</hi> of the <hi>Imperial Court</hi> were of a <hi>Marriage</hi> with the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Aſturias,</hi> and my firſt <hi>Inſtructions</hi> from <hi>Spain</hi> were for the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Aſturias;</hi> but it was I,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:002880_0080_0FE6865DCD7F17E8"/>who got that Deſtination chang'd. I wrote to the <hi>Queen</hi> to engage the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Aſturias,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Delay, to a Daughter of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that he might not ſtand in the Way of <hi>Don Carlos:</hi> And it was I that found the Way of turning all this Affair to the Advantage of her <hi>two Sons.</hi> And do you think I have much to Fear after ſuch Services?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This agrees exactly with the Language of the Court of <hi>Madrid:</hi> Where, after the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> was known to be Sign'd at <hi>Vienna,</hi> this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with the <hi>Emperor</hi> was freely ſpoke of, as the <hi>Queen</hi>'s own <hi>Tranſaction</hi> entirely; enter'd into, and conducted by <hi>herſelf;</hi> and the <hi>Marriage</hi> of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> ſpoke of, at firſt, without reſerve or Appearance of Secrecy, as a Matter agreed upon. Nor did any <hi>one</hi> Perſon, who frequented the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> make the leaſt Doubt of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will help us to Account for other Parts of the <hi>Conduct</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> which, without this, will be wholly unaccountable, and out of the Road of all Policy. For inſtance, Suppoſe only theſe <hi>Marriages,</hi> or That alone of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> with the <hi>eldeſt Arch Dutcheſs;</hi> and this will ſhew us, Why that Court could be brought to diſcard the <hi>Neutral Garriſons,</hi> and all other <hi>Securities</hi> furniſh'd by the <hi>Quadruple</hi> Alliance for the <hi>Eſtabliſhing</hi> her Son, the ſame <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> and to truſt to the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s naked Word in ſo great a Point: <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe by this <hi>Marriage</hi> it would come about, that the <hi>Emperor,</hi> by ſecuring thoſe <hi>Dominions</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> for <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> would ſecure them, at the ſame Time, for the <hi>Iſſue</hi> of his own <hi>Daughter;</hi> and ſo muſt of Neceſſity, for the Sake of his
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:002880_0081_0FE68668DEA63CB8"/>own Intereſt, and the aggrandizing his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, be ſincere and zealous in this Affair. On the other Side, the ſame Suppoſition of this <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> gives a reaſonable Solution, Why the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> has conſented to, what the <hi>Spaniſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> at the <hi>Congreſs</hi> would not hear of, the <hi>Guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> as lately eſtabliſh'd in the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria: viz.</hi> Becauſe it comes about by this Marriage, that being <hi>Guarantee</hi> to the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s <hi>Succeſſion</hi> in his <hi>Auſtrian Dominions,</hi> is no more than being <hi>Guarantee</hi> for the Queen's own Son <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> the future Husband of the <hi>eldeſt Arch Dutcheſs;</hi> and that <hi>Self Intereſt</hi> muſt make <hi>Spain,</hi> under its preſent Adminiſtration, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in this <hi>Guaranty.</hi> And upon any other Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, we may ſafely defy the World to give a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>theſe</hi> and <hi>ſeveral</hi> other Appearances, in this New Alliance.</p>
            <p>I need not go farther, and appeal to any Words that may have been dropp'd in Confidence, at the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> itſelf, upon the Subject of theſe Marriages; and that, with a particular Pleaſure and Satisfaction expreſs'd in them, Since we have ſo much, and ſo ſtrong, Evidence of the Reality of it, from the Mouth of <hi>Ripperda,</hi> who made the Treaty; and from the Language of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> itſelf; as well as from the utter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency and Unaccountableneſs of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that Court, without this Suppoſition.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge indeed, That at <hi>Vienna,</hi> when it began to appear that what had been ſaid upon this Head had allarm'd <hi>Europe;</hi> and when, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the great Aim was to keep the <hi>Dutch</hi> from acceding to the Treaty of <hi>Hanover;</hi> which
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:002880_0082_0FE6865965B76158"/>might be haſten'd by ſo terrible an Appearance: Then, the whole Affair of theſe <hi>Marriages</hi> was utterly diſown'd; nay, in Order to deny theſe <hi>Marriages,</hi> it was abſolutely denied that there was any ſuch Thing in Being, as a <hi>ſecret Treaty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> I am not afraid of relating <hi>this,</hi> after all the Proofs before given of the <hi>Reality</hi> of a <hi>ſecret Treaty,</hi> and of this <hi>Article</hi> in it; nor at all unwilling that it ſhould work as much as it can, and have all the Weight it ought to have: For I am confident, that, as this Conduct convinced not one Perſon at <hi>Vienna;</hi> and made not the leaſt <hi>Impreſſion</hi> upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſter, or his <hi>Maſters;</hi> ſo it will make no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon Any who have read what I have before laid down, unleſs it be this, That they who can act an unjuſtifiable part, can, without Scruple, and with the ſame Eaſe, bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a peremptory and abſolute Denial of it, till the proper Time comes for their open Avowal of it.</p>
            <p>But as this <hi>Article</hi> of theſe <hi>Marriages</hi> muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main undoubted; we cannot help ſpending a few Thoughts upon the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of them, or of the firſt of <hi>them</hi> only. There is but <hi>one</hi> Life, that of the Prince of <hi>Aſturias,</hi> between <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> after the Death of the preſent <hi>King.</hi> There is only the ſame Life between <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> ſhould the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King there dye without <hi>Iſſue Male;</hi> and the <hi>Renunciations</hi> not take place: both which Events may happen.</p>
            <p>And as to the vaſt Hereditary Dominions of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria, Don Carlos</hi> will come to them
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:002880_0083_0FE68653584C2760"/>by Right of his Wife. And as Experience has ſhewn us, for many Ages, that whoever is Maſter of theſe Dominions, and the Power that attends them, has been, and muſt be <hi>Emperor,</hi> notwithſtanding its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Elective Crown: <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> by marrying the <hi>eldeſt Arch Dutcheſs,</hi> cannot ſail of being <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi> So that <hi>Don Carlos</hi> may poſſibly be at once, <hi>Emperor,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and King of <hi>Spain:</hi> and have the vaſt Strength and Riches of all theſe Powers united and center'd in him.</p>
            <p>I have thus ſufficiently ſhewn the many and complicated <hi>Evils</hi> of this <hi>New Alliance</hi> between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and the juſt <hi>Apprehenſions,</hi> and well-grounded <hi>Fears,</hi> which the Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> could not but entertain, from all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances and all Advices, about the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Tendency</hi> of it, with Regard to the preſent <hi>Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> to our <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions;</hi> our <hi>Commerce;</hi> our <hi>Religion;</hi> our <hi>Liberties,</hi> and thoſe of all <hi>Europe;</hi> and, in a Word, to every <hi>Thing</hi> that ought to be Dear to Us. And now, Let any Perſons amongſt us, who know how to prize theſe <hi>ineſtimable Goods,</hi> which alone make <hi>Life</hi> itſelf valuable, ſurvey this <hi>New Alliance</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Part of it: and judge, <q>Whether ever hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto <hi>any one Scheme</hi> has appear'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> of a Deſtruction ſo univerſal, and of a Ruine ſo extended, as <hi>This</hi> (taking the whole together) appears plainly to be.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is time now for us to enquire, What has been the Conduct of the Court of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> upon the View of all theſe Evils.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt ſtep they took was to renew, by a Treaty, the Defenſive Engagements ſubſiſting
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:002880_0084_0FE6866772235B90"/>between <hi>Great Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia.</hi> But this Treaty was not ſet on foot till ſome Months after the <hi>New Alliance</hi> between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and after the beſt Intelligences, and moſt mature Conſideration, of the <hi>Tendency</hi> of that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.</hi> And as this <hi>Treaty,</hi> made at <hi>Hanover,</hi> has long been publick in the World; I need not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that it is a <hi>Treaty</hi> entirely <hi>Defenſive</hi> between <hi>Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> for the mutual ſupport of each other, againſt Injuries; and not at all for the invading, or injuring, any Nation under Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Particular Regard was ſhewn to the <hi>States General,</hi> in the framing of the Treaty of <hi>Hanover:</hi> to which they have ſince acceded. The next care was to invite the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> into this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance; that Kingdom having ſo often and ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully appeared in Defence of the Proteſtant Religion, and of the Liberties of Europe. And the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe-Caſſel,</hi> whoſe Family has done ſuch ſignal Service to the Proteſtant Cauſe, readily offer'd a good Body of Troops, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Alliance.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Steps which the Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> thought fit to take as ſoon as poſſible, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Danger we were in, appeared evident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all contradiction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain</hi> found their Country immediately threatn'd in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Concerns from theſe Treaties of <hi>Vienna;</hi> Both Houſes gave his <hi>Majeſty</hi> all <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of ſupport in whatever He ſhould think fit to do in the preſent critical Conjuncture. And accordingly it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary now to conſider in earneſt, what was moſt proper to be done. The Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:002880_0085_0FE68681861D0870"/>had evident Proof that nothing could influence the Two <hi>New Allies</hi> to Terms of Reaſon, but to ſhew a <hi>vigorous Spirit</hi> againſt every pernicious or ſuſpicious part of ſuch an Alliance. And as all Appearances, in all parts, convinced them, That nothing could ſo effectually guard againſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Evils, as the diſpatching ſufficient <hi>Squadrons</hi> of <hi>Ships</hi> to ſeveral Places; and as they were ſenſible that our <hi>Fleet,</hi> now the beſt in the World, could never be of any Account, either towards our <hi>Glory</hi> or our <hi>Safety,</hi> but upon ſuch an Occaſion; They did, with all poſſible Diligence, fit out <hi>Three Squadrons</hi> of <hi>Men of War:</hi> One for the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> One for the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and One for the <hi>Baltick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will now be ask'd, as it has been indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, What beneficial <hi>Effect</hi> has this <hi>Method</hi> had? What Good have we gain'd, or what Evil have we prevented, by theſe Grand Appearances of our <hi>Fleets</hi> abroad? And if an Anſwer may be reaſonably expected, by Thoſe who ask theſe and the like <hi>Queſtions;</hi> ſo is it alſo a juſt Expectation, That, They ſhould be as ready to receive a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Anſwer to them, as they are to ask them.</p>
            <p>As to the Treaty of <hi>Hanover;</hi> I will ſuppoſe, no <hi>Apology</hi> can be expected for <hi>That,</hi> after ſuch a ſurprizing and formidable Conjunction of the <hi>Two Powers</hi> of the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> the Deſign, and the <hi>Articles</hi> of which <hi>Conjunction</hi> appear'd every Day more and more terrible to their <hi>Neighbours.</hi> The Contracting Parties in the <hi>Hanover</hi> Treaty muſt have been taxed with <hi>Infatuation</hi> and <hi>Inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> beyond the common Pitch of <hi>Thoſe Evils,</hi> if They had not enter'd into a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:002880_0086_0FE6868EACD16768"/>Concert for their own <hi>Self-Defence,</hi> in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, of preſent Invaſion of the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>ſome</hi> of them; and of Forebodings of <hi>future</hi> Evil to them All.</p>
            <p>But as the Queſtion here at home, chiefly, if not ſolely, refers to our Naval <hi>Armaments</hi> from <hi>England;</hi> What have They produced, or, for what Reaſons were they ſent? The Anſwer is very plain. As to the Squadron ſent to the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indies;</hi> I believe there is no one who has an Eſtate in thoſe Parts, or is concern'd in any Trade thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who did not think it highly neceſſary to have a Strong Squadron in thoſe Seas, for ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Commerce; which muſt otherwiſe have been inevitably ruined, by the Depredations and Violences committed by the Spaniards for ſeveral Years paſt without Redreſs. And if the ſending of the ſaid Squadron has prevented the Return of the Galleons: no Man who is in the leaſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the Affairs of Europe, can make any doubt but that this Incident has been the only Thing that has hitherto prevented a War in Europe, by depriving the Courts of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Madrid</hi> of the means of putting in execution the dangerous Schemes they had projected.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Squadron</hi> ſent to the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> was ſent to prevent any Attempt from that Country, to diſturb Us at Home: The Court of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> being aſſured, beyond all doubt, as I have before particularly related, that an <hi>Offenſive Treaty</hi> was concluded at <hi>Vienna;</hi> and that an Attempt was deſign'd from <hi>Spain,</hi> and preparations mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, at that Time, in Favour of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender.</hi>

And the <hi>Squadron</hi> ſent to the <hi>Baltick</hi> was ſent to prevent very great Evils in thoſe Parts; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no room to doubt, that the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s real View was to go with a Fleet directly to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and under a Pretence of demanding the Uſe of the Ports, and the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Sweden</hi> for the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> actually to dethrone the preſent King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and make that Nation abſolutely dependent on <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy.</hi> It was therefore judg'd of the utmoſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to prevent this, by ſending a ſtrong Squadron into the <hi>Baltick;</hi> not only as it was the preſerving a Friendly <hi>Power,</hi> and a <hi>Power</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the <hi>Balance</hi> of the <hi>North:</hi> but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, becauſe <hi>Sweden</hi> could not but be conſider'd in the Nature of a Frontier and Barrier to <hi>Britain</hi> itſelf, to ſuch a Degree, that if that <hi>Ringdom</hi> were once either made ſubject to <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon it, <hi>Britain</hi> itſelf muſt be in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Attempts from the <hi>Ruſſian Ravagers,</hi> coming with their Fleet from <hi>Gottenburg</hi> to our <hi>Northern</hi> Coaſts: an Evil not to be guarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, after the Subjection of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but by the <hi>Expence,</hi> either of a conſtant <hi>Fleet</hi> upon thoſe <hi>Coaſts,</hi> or an <hi>Armed Force</hi> in thoſe Parts of our County, which lie moſt open to ſuch Attempts.</p>
            <p>The Deſigns and Views in ſending out theſe <hi>Squadrons</hi> being ſo unexceptionably Good; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that, through the <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> and the Oppoſition of Winds and Weather, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had not attended upon any <hi>One</hi> of theſe Squadrons; nay, that <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Misfortunes had followed them all: yet, <hi>They</hi> who are not ſo weak as to argue from <hi>Succeſs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:002880_0088_0FE6868FDAF58128"/>They who know the Uncertainty of <hi>Seas,</hi> and <hi>Winds,</hi> and <hi>Weather,</hi> and have too much Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to think the <hi>Event</hi> only to be the true <hi>Criterion</hi> of Judging about the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of any Project; all Perſons, I mean of good Senſe, ſhould, methinks, have been ready, even in ſuch a Caſe, to have applauded what was done upon ſo good Grounds, and with Views ſo much for the Honour and Safety of their Country. But, <hi>God</hi> be thank'd, this is not the Caſe. Every one of the Armaments has had Succeſs equal to the Goodneſs of the Errand they were all ſent upon; and even, beyond Expectation. For, as to the Squadron in the <hi>Weſt Indies;</hi> it has not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the Trade of His Majeſty's Subjects in thoſe Parts from the Depredations of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but alſo the <hi>Galeons</hi> with their Stores of Money, the <hi>Strength</hi> of the <hi>New Alliance,</hi> and the <hi>like</hi> of all the <hi>Projects</hi> concerted in it, are kept back: and thoſe <hi>Attempts</hi> diſappointed which would have been made, and perhaps ſucceeded, had ſuch <hi>Riches</hi> come to their Aid. The Execution of the Schemes laid in <hi>Spain</hi> for an Invaſion of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> in Favour of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> was, at that Time, prevented by the Appearance of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſts: and all the Evils and Diſorders, as well as Expence, avoided, which an Attack of that Sort muſt have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd, even ſuppoſing it repulſed from hence; and the utter Ruin and Deſtructon, that muſt have enſued, had it ſucceeded. And by the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s whole Force of Ships and Galleys was kept in, within the Bounds of Safety to <hi>themſelves</hi> and their <hi>Neighbours;</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:002880_0089_0FE6864A86D38730"/>Her deſtructive Deſigns againſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> with all their ill Conſequences to <hi>Britain</hi> and to other Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> prevented from <hi>Execution</hi> in every Inſtance: and, after all the boaſted Strength of the <hi>Ships</hi> and <hi>Seamen</hi> in the Service of that <hi>Crown, Ruſſia</hi> itſelf, and all <hi>Europe</hi> convinc'd, that <hi>twenty Britiſh</hi> Men of <hi>War</hi> can, upon any Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, make them diſappear as if they were not, and ſhelter themſelves in their own Ports as if they had no Views but thoſe of Quiet und Security.</p>
            <p>But here is the great Advantage to <hi>Thoſe</hi> who make ſuch <hi>Enquiries</hi> as theſe we have been now conſidering, without a Diſpoſition to be ſatisfy'd: That <hi>Evils</hi> prevented, go for no <hi>Evils;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not viſibly perceiv'd by our Eyes, nor ſenſibly felt by our Nerves, before we find them at a greater Diſtance from us, therefore, They who are in the Diſpoſition of <hi>Satyr</hi> (ſo much eaſier than <hi>Praiſe</hi>) will probably think themſelves at <hi>Liberty</hi> to deny this <hi>Freedom</hi> from ſuch <hi>Evils</hi> to be at all the Effect of the Meaſures taken; and to preſiſt in it, that no ſuch Evils would have come, or could have been juſtly fear'd, if theſe Methods had not been taken. And in this Manner, I own, They may talk for ever againſt all poſſible Light; if the whole <hi>Scene</hi> which I have, in the former Part of theſe Papers, laid before them, be not of Force enough to work another Perſwaſion in them. Yet, <hi>one</hi> Thing, I will affirm,
<q>That we, and other Nations are, at preſent, actually free from the <hi>Evils</hi> and <hi>Attempts</hi> I have mention'd, <hi>ſince</hi> theſe <hi>vigorous Meaſures</hi> have ſhew'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the View of <hi>Europe;</hi> and that They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot ſay it was <hi>certain,</hi> (as others will not ſay, it was in the leaſt <hi>probable</hi>) that We
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:002880_0090_0FE686550D5A55C0"/>ſhould have been free from thoſe Evils and thoſe Attempts, had <hi>not</hi> theſe <hi>Meaſures</hi> been taken.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus therefore, ſtands the Affair of theſe <hi>three Squadrons.</hi> They were ſent upon Deſigns of the laſt Conſequence, and exceedingly Honourable, to <hi>Great Britain:</hi> And they have had the Succeſs of fully anſwering the Ends propoſed.</p>
            <p>It was not, we ſee, to aſſert the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of the <hi>Seas,</hi> merely by ſhewing themſelves in ſeveral Parts of the World in a <hi>Form</hi> ſuperior to that of other Nations, that theſe <hi>Armaments</hi> were fitted out. The aſſerting our <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of the <hi>Seas,</hi> as a Point of mere <hi>Speculation,</hi> at a great Expence, and without any other View, may, perhaps, be a Subject fit for Men of Wit to be pleaſant with, and to entertain themſelves and their Friends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But to aſſert the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of the <hi>Seas,</hi> as a <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Action,</hi> upon a juſt Occaſion: — To ſhew this <hi>Sovereignty</hi> in the Sight of thoſe Nations, who are making their own Strength at <hi>Sea</hi> the Inſtrument of Ruine to their Neighbours: — To ſhew it, in Oppoſition to thoſe <hi>Nations</hi> who are contriving to convey Miſchief to ourſelves, and Aſſiſtance to our Enemies, by the Sea itſelf: — If <hi>this</hi> be not the proper Buſineſs, and the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Glory of <hi>Britain,</hi> as the <hi>greateſt Maritime Power</hi> now in <hi>Europe;</hi> then our <hi>Navy</hi> is itſelf a <hi>Ridicule</hi> upon ourſelves; an Oſtentation only, kept up at a vaſt Expence; and a Piece of <hi>Vanity,</hi> unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Wiſe</hi> Nation. But no more upon this Part of the Subject.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Queſtion</hi> will be ask'd, What has been, and muſt be, <hi>our Expence</hi> upon this Occaſion? And it will be added, Are <hi>we</hi> alone to bear ſuch Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:002880_0091_0FE686901EF385E0"/>without a Proportion of <hi>Expence</hi> from thoſe who are our <hi>Allies;</hi> whilſt <hi>Thoſe</hi> whom we are oppoſing, ſeem to be at little, or none at all? To the firſt Branch of this <hi>Queſtion, What is our Expence?</hi> It is certainly enough to anſwer in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, Let it be what it will; if it be neceſſary for <hi>our own</hi> Security, and that of <hi>Europe;</hi> if it be incurred for the Preventing the greateſt <hi>Evils,</hi> and as the <hi>only Means</hi> of procuring a better State of Things: it may juſtly be ſaid, to be not at all comparable to the Neceſſity for it; not to be put in the <hi>Balance</hi> againſt the <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> which might have ariſen from the Want of it; and very much beneath the <hi>Good</hi> which has and will come from it. The whole Point to every <hi>true Briton</hi> is, Whether it was neceſſary, fitting, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: — They that think it <hi>probably</hi> ſo, muſt be pleaſed with it. They that think it a mere Piece of <hi>Gaiety</hi> in Thoſe who preſide; or an haſty Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Dark; will have other Reſentments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: But they muſt firſt <hi>think</hi> them <hi>mere Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> or <hi>mere Idiots,</hi> before they can come to this. In the mean Time, till ſomething of this Sort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, we cannot but think, That, if the attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to guard ourſelves and our Neighbours from very great and comprehenſive <hi>Evils,</hi> be laudable; and if the preventing the Beginnings of thoſe <hi>Evil</hi> can make an <hi>Expence</hi> neceſſary, fitting, and reaſonable; then the <hi>Expence</hi> upon the preſent Occaſion is certainly ſo.</p>
            <p>But as <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in general is Satisfaction enough, of whatever Sort or Degree the Expence is; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided is be a <hi>Leſſer Evil</hi> than what it has hitherto kept off: ſo it will not be diſagreeable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:002880_0092_0FE6865DED7D3BB0"/>That the <hi>Expence</hi> upon theſe <hi>Naval Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> is of ſuch a Nature, and accompanied with ſuch <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> as to make it much the more tolerable in the Eyes of every <hi>Briton.</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is chiefly an Expence amongſt ourſelves; and ſuch as only circulates Money from one Hand to another. The Victualling ſo many Ships is the Advantage of our own <hi>Farmers</hi> and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers.</hi> The Rigging out and equipping them, gives Money to our own Builders and Workmen. The putting them into Motion when they are ſo repair'd, is known to be of Service to the Ships themſelves: which otherwiſe lie ſtill, and often receive ſuch Damage, as at the End it coſts more to rectify. The Employing ſo many Seamen is ſtill employing <hi>our own</hi> Subjects; and giving our Money to our own Country-Men: beſides the great future Benefit ariſing from this Neceſſity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as they are kept in Action by it, and inured to the Service of their <hi>Country,</hi> and the more fit to defend it upon all Occaſions to come. So that the <hi>Expence</hi> of our Naval <hi>Defence,</hi> which is the true and natural <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>Britain;</hi> tho' it, indeed, muſt be a <hi>Burthen</hi> to <hi>thoſe</hi> who pay towards it, as <hi>all Payments are:</hi> yet it is a Burthen with this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the <hi>Publick,</hi> that it ſends not <hi>our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> abroad; it loſes it not to the <hi>Nation;</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves it indeed out of <hi>one</hi> Pocket into <hi>another,</hi> but it is ſtill <hi>our</hi> Money, and remains among <hi>ourſelves.</hi> The <hi>Community</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Subjects</hi> taken together are not the <hi>Poorer</hi> for it; tho' the <hi>Perſons</hi> paying it to others, are ſo: and if it be for their own <hi>neceſſary Defence,</hi> and for the Safety of all the Reſt of their Poſſeſſions, All
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:002880_0093_0FE6865376B8F4F8"/>honeſt Men among them will be glad, They are ſo.</p>
            <p>But then our Expence, tho' great, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. The Diſpoſitions made by <hi>France,</hi> ever ſince the Signing of the Treaty of <hi>Hanover,</hi> have more than kept pace with us, in the largeneſs of the <hi>Expence.</hi> The firſt Step taken by the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> was, to augment his regular Troops with <hi>Twenty five Thouſand Men;</hi> and this in ſuch a Manner, that they were preſently ready for Action upon any Occaſion. At the ſame Time he order'd a Levy of the <hi>Militia,</hi> to the Number of <hi>Sixty Thouſand Men:</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed theſe to be commanded by the <hi>Ancient Officers reform'd</hi> of his old <hi>Troops;</hi> not to mention <hi>Twelve Thouſand Invalids,</hi> put into good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and <hi>double Officer'd,</hi> for the Defence of ſuch of his <hi>Cittadels</hi> and <hi>Forts</hi> as they are proper for. Theſe, and other Diſpoſitions, which have been made to put <hi>France</hi> into a Condition to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a War, if it ſhould be neceſſary, amounted, for this laſt Year, by a certain Calculation, to <hi>fifteen hundred and ſixty thouſand Pounds Sterling;</hi> and if the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould be obliged to march out of their Provinces to the Frontiers, it will amount to a far greater Sum. And by this Method it comes to paſs, That theſe ſixty thouſand <hi>Militia,</hi> and twelve thouſand <hi>Invalids,</hi> remaining in <hi>Garriſons</hi> and fortified Places, as the Service ſhall require; That <hi>King</hi> can ſend into the Field, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, 165000 Men of his <hi>Regular Troops.</hi> Such has been for ſome Time the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> there, in Order to ſhew the <hi>New</hi> Allies, that <hi>France</hi> is not only in earneſt, but in a well diſpoſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:002880_0094_0FE6864AA6796550"/>of diſputing any <hi>Attempts</hi> againſt <hi>itſelf,</hi> or its <hi>Allies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>United Provinces</hi> indeed, came but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the <hi>Alliance,</hi> from the Frame of their <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> naturally begetting <hi>Delays</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing their <hi>Debates;</hi> and not from any Want of the Senſe of their Dangers, and the Neceſſity of their acceding to the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Hanover.</hi> For from the Time of their <hi>Acceſſion</hi> to that <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> they have ſhewn a Warmth and Vigour wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Occaſion. They have agreed unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly upon ſuch Augmentations of their Land Forces, as by next Spring will make them above 50000 effective Men: And the neceſſary Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are taking for their having a Fleet at Sea of Twenty Men of War. Beſides which <hi>Expence,</hi> relating to theſe <hi>Augmentations,</hi> They have been at a very great Charge in providing their Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, and putting their <hi>Barrier</hi> and <hi>Frontier</hi> Places into a good Poſture of <hi>Defence.</hi> But whoever reads the late <hi>Reſolutions</hi> and <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> of the <hi>States General;</hi> and ſees with how deep a Concern, and in how pathetical a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they ſpeak of the <hi>Calamities</hi> now threatning themſelves, and the reſt of <hi>Europe;</hi> declaring their Ruine muſt lye at their own Door, if all <hi>the Provinces</hi> do not, in a Caſe of ſuch Neceſſity, conſent to act the Part of Men in a vigorous Defence of themſelves, and readily concur in
<q>
                  <hi>What,</hi> in the Opinion of their <hi>High Mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> is <hi>indiſpenſably neceſſary</hi> to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Safety and Preſervation; and without which the <hi>Well-being, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>whole Republick,</hi> will be put to the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
               <pb n="96" facs="unknown:002880_0095_0FE68654E7DC8760"/>Whoever reads this, and much more ſaid and inculcated by Them with a particular Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, will not think, that They are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to defend themſelves by all neceſſary Meaſures againſt the Dangers now hanging over their Heads.</p>
            <p>At the ſame Time, thoſe <hi>Powers,</hi> which have raiſed this <hi>Allarm,</hi> and occaſioned this <hi>defenſive Expence</hi> to their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> cannot ſtir one Step in their own <hi>offenſive Deſigns,</hi> without a very conſiderable one to themſelves. His <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſty,</hi> beſides the many Promiſes of another Sort, which He has beſtow'd around Him, has entered into <hi>real Obligations</hi> which cannot be performed but at a very great Expence. To the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Cologne</hi> he has engaged to pay 600,000 <hi>German</hi> Florins a Year, for two Years; to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the ſame; to the <hi>Elector Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin</hi> and of <hi>Treves</hi> the ſame; and to the Duke of <hi>Wolfenbuttle</hi> 200,000 Florins; beſides what is ſtipulated to others. Add to theſe his own great <hi>Expences,</hi> in recruiting and in refitting his whole Army, and preparing every thing of all Sorts, neceſſary for <hi>Action:</hi> An <hi>Expence</hi> in the whole ſo great! that nothing but the vaſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages It is to receive from his new Alliance, and the Expectation of <hi>Remittances</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> could have induced him to think of it. And what then muſt the Expence of <hi>Spain</hi> be; which has not only it's own <hi>Army</hi> to put in Order and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not only it's own Towns and Coaſts to guard; but the Emperor's Demands to anſwer? And what a <hi>State</hi> of things muſt the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, together with the <hi>Demands</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:002880_0096_0FE6865987FB4DF0"/>of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> bring that King, and his <hi>Country</hi> into; even if his <hi>Flota</hi> with it's uſual <hi>Cargo</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> ſhould come Home ſafe: when it is well known, that, <hi>before</hi> theſe <hi>new Expences,</hi> (the Effect of the <hi>New Alliance</hi>) all the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary</hi> Officers belonging to that <hi>Crown,</hi> and their whole Army, were in great <hi>Arrears;</hi> and all the <hi>Royal</hi> Revenues anticipated for a Year and a Half; and that the <hi>whole Nation</hi> was in a State of very great Poverty and Diſtreſs? And if ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe <hi>Expences</hi> can be run into with <hi>Zeal,</hi> for the the Injury and Oppreſſion of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: ſurely, an Expence, much ſmaller in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and directed ſolely to the Defence and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> of <hi>ourſelves</hi> in the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> we are juſtly in Poſſeſſion of, cannot be thought unworthy of the <hi>Britiſh Nation;</hi> nor unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Thoſe who have already begun it, only becauſe they thought it abſolutely <hi>neceſſary.</hi> But ſtill <hi>other Queſtions</hi> ariſe upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>It may be asked, Could not the Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> all this while have tryed <hi>other Methods,</hi> than allarming <hi>Europe</hi> with <hi>Fleets?</hi> The Methods of a friendly <hi>Congreſs,</hi> or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of a more peaceable and amicable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?

In which Way of talking there is ſomething very right, and ſomething very wrong. For certainly it muſt be granted, that we ought to prepare ourſelves with Vigour to oppoſe <hi>Injury;</hi> as well as to be ready to propoſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, any reaſonable Methods of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:002880_0097_0FE68685CBD39E50"/>To do the <hi>firſt,</hi> without a Doſpoſition ſhewn to the <hi>latter,</hi> I acknowledge, would have been unjuſtifiable.

            <p>I anſwer therefore, to <hi>theſe</hi> and the like <hi>Queſtions.</hi> 1.

In the <hi>other</hi> great Caſe, that of the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s new Eſtabliſhment at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> the Court of <hi>Great Britain</hi> never went upon ſuch an arbitrary Maxim as, That <hi>other Nations</hi> ought not to be permitted to begin and extend their <hi>Commerce</hi> wherever they <hi>rightfully</hi> could, as well as <hi>ourſelves;</hi> or that <hi>we</hi> had any Right to oppoſe ſuch Attempts: But upon theſe undoubted Maxims of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi>— That <hi>Treaties</hi> are to be obſerved; — That, when any Country is excluded by Treaties from any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Branch of Commerce, it is not to be authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and ſupported in carrying on the ſaid Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Commerce in violation of the ſaid Treaties; and — That <hi>thoſe Powers</hi> which have, by repeated <hi>Engagements,</hi> obliged themſelves to defend and ſupport the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade, are juſtly to be oppoſed when they themſelves come to be the <hi>Invaders</hi> and <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> of it. Agreeably to all this, 4. As the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> has taken ſuch <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Meaſures</hi> as ſhew the <hi>Reſolution</hi> of <hi>Self-defence:</hi> ſo, has it never been wanting either to propoſe, or to receive, any reaſonable Method for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of this Matter, to the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; if He could be ſatisfied with any thing, but a <hi>Trade</hi> in open Contradiction to all Treaties.</p>
            <p>In particular, It was ſufficiently intimated to the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> that the <hi>Britiſh Court</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to nothing in this Affair, but to defend the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> belonging to <hi>Britain</hi> by <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> far from aſſuming to themſelves any Right of controlling the <hi>Emperor,</hi> or his Subjects, in any Attempts, not contrary to thoſe Treaties: That therefore, if the <hi>Emperor</hi> would remove this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> and the Seat of <hi>Trade,</hi> now at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> to <hi>Trieſte,</hi> or any other Place in his <hi>Dominions,</hi> which
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:002880_0099_0FE686816471F4C0"/>did not heretofore belong to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; <hi>Britain</hi> was ready quietly to acquieſce. And the ſame was offer'd to the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> in the form of a <hi>Propoſal,</hi> when his <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi> had juſt begun to eſpouſe the <hi>Emperor's Intereſt,</hi> in this Affair of <hi>Oſtend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> not only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Reaſonableneſs of the <hi>Propoſal;</hi> but made great Profeſſions of Hope that it would be accepted; yet, at the ſame Time, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That <hi>Spain</hi> was under Engagements to ſtand by the <hi>Emperor,</hi> even ſuppoſing his <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> Refuſal of it. And at <hi>Kienna,</hi> the Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made no <hi>Impreſſion</hi> at all: The Reſolution there, by this appearing plainly to be, The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>Oſtend Company,</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi> from the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> againſt all <hi>Stipulations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however this ended at <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid;</hi> It muſt have this Effect at <hi>London,</hi> to convince all Perſons, that <hi>no one,</hi> either real or pretended, <hi>Provocation</hi> from <hi>Britain,</hi> gave the firſt <hi>Occaſion</hi> for this <hi>new Alliance;</hi> (one End of which was the Eſtabliſhment of the Emperor's new and unwarrantable Deſigns in <hi>Trade:</hi>) So the <hi>Court of Great-Britain,</hi> in the midſt of all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for the <hi>Defence</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi>'s Rights, has not neglected to try <hi>other Methods</hi> of a <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>amicable</hi> Nature; but ſhewn a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to do any thing, even for preſent Peace, except to give up the <hi>Advantages, Rights</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> of more Importance than preſent Peace: and theſe <hi>Advantages</hi> founded upon Treaties; which therefore, They who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide are obliged to guard and defend, as a ſacred <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> not only out of Love to their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:002880_0100_0FE6866754C07830"/>common to Them with all others, but out of <hi>peculiar Duty</hi> and Obligation; as they are intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this <hi>Guardianſhip</hi> and Defence, by the <hi>Publick;</hi> and as an Account of this Truſt may juſtly be demanded of them.</p>
            <p>If then, nothing reaſonable, in the Way of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,</hi> has been wanting on their Part; They will not eaſily be blamed, (it is to be hoped rather, they will be highly commended) for This, that They have not permitted themſelves to be miſled by any ſmooth Words without Meaning; or to be hindred from taking all neceſſary Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by any <hi>Amuſements</hi> of <hi>Congreſſes,</hi> or <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies,</hi> or <hi>Negotiations,</hi> only thrown in their Way to gain <hi>Time</hi> to others, and to loſe it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Since it is evident, that <hi>irreparable</hi> and <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrievable</hi> Evils might have come from the not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe neceſſary and timely Precautions. And were it ſo, that They had ſpent their whole Time in ſending and receiving fruitleſs Meſſages back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards, in ſuch a critical Conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we may venture to ſay, we know the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who would have been the <hi>firſt</hi> to charge, (and very deſervedly too) the Ruine of this <hi>Nation</hi> upon them; and to have demanded Juſtice againſt them for ſuch a Conduct, in ſuch a Time of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to their Country.</p>
            <p>And indeed, ſuppoſing this to have been the Caſe; ſuppoſing the Court of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in ſuch a Situation; with ſuch repeated Advices from all Parts; with ſuch Demonſtrations of Danger from abroad, as put out of all Doubt the true Nature and Deſigns of ſo formidable an <hi>Alliance</hi> as that of the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> I ſay, ſuppoſing this Court, ſurrounded with all theſe
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:002880_0101_0FE6867CC0180C40"/>Evidences, to have entered into <hi>no</hi> Meaſures of Defence with any neighbouring <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> to have taken <hi>no</hi> Steps towards preventing the Miſchief threaten'd; to have ſent out <hi>no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Armaments,</hi> either to preſerve any <hi>friendly</hi> Powers, or to quaſh any Attempts of <hi>others;</hi> Who would not riſe up, and demand an Account of ſuch a Conduct from Thoſe who alone are to anſwer for it? Who would not join in ſaying,
<q>Is this the <hi>Uſage</hi> fit to be given to a <hi>brave</hi> and conſidering People? Is this the watchfulneſs of <hi>Thoſe,</hi> whoſe Duty it is to attend to every diſtant View of Danger? Or, do They think ſo meanly of <hi>us</hi> and the <hi>whole Nation,</hi> that we can <hi>ſee</hi> nothing but what we <hi>feel;</hi> and that we have a Senſe of <hi>no Evil,</hi> but what is <hi>preſent:</hi> Or, that we are ſo made, that a <hi>little Expence</hi> would affright us from preſerving our <hi>all;</hi> or, reduced to ſo <hi>low</hi> a Condition of Poverty, that we can't purchaſe or furniſh out even <hi>Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> to our ſelves? Were not other <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> threatned by the ſame Danger; and ready to unite with us? Muſt our <hi>Fleet,</hi> the Glory (as it is call'd) of this Land, lie ſtill and decay, rather than be made our Bulwark? Our <hi>Fleet,</hi> falſly call'd our <hi>Glory,</hi> but <hi>indeed</hi> our Shame, whilſt it is laid aſide as uſeleſs, at a Time when That alone might make us look too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable in <hi>Europe,</hi> to be inſulted or affronted? Or, does even this <hi>Expence</hi> which circulates chiefly amongſt ourſelves, appear too formidable to a <hi>Nation</hi> which thoſe around it <hi>envy,</hi> as the <hi>Centre</hi> of <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Plenty?</hi> But why do we ſpeak of <hi>Expence?</hi> It is this Method of
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:002880_0102_0FE68698A75A7680"/>
                  <hi>Indolence,</hi> and <hi>Inactivity</hi> upon ſuch an Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which muſt bring after it an <hi>Expence</hi> much <hi>greater</hi> in it ſelf; and much more hazardous in its Effect; as Time ſhall add <hi>Strength</hi> to the <hi>Danger</hi> threaten'd: an <hi>Expence,</hi> which muſt <hi>increaſe</hi> our Debt, and at the ſame Time <hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> the Hope of paying it. What Account can we give of ſuch a <hi>Treatment</hi> of this Nation? As we can find <hi>none</hi> in all the known Meaſures of <hi>Political Prudence;</hi> we muſt ſearch for it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe. — There muſt be <hi>ſecret Reaſons</hi> for ſuch a Conduct; and perhaps <hi>theſe</hi> may lye in the <hi>Riches</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſuffered to come ſafely home, to ſtrengthen and conſolidate the moſt dangerous <hi>Conjunction</hi> that ever yet appeared in <hi>Europe</hi>
               </q>.— This and much more might juſtly be urged, upon the Suppoſition of a <hi>negligent</hi> and <hi>unactive</hi> Conduct in this <hi>Criſis</hi> of <hi>Danger.</hi> And what Reply to make to it, I profeſs I think it utterly impoſſible to tell.</p>
            <p>But this is not the Caſe. The <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> has acted quite another Part; and enter'd into <hi>that</hi> Method of <hi>vigorous Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence,</hi> by which alone, in all human Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, there can be the leaſt Hope of preventing or repulſing any dangerous Attempts againſt all our higheſt Concerns: And a <hi>Method,</hi> to which No other Principle could poſſibly have directed Thoſe who have choſen it, but <hi>That</hi> of an <hi>honeſt Regard</hi> to the <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> the <hi>Trade,</hi> the <hi>Rights,</hi> the <hi>Well-Being,</hi> and the <hi>Being</hi> itſelf, of this now happy and envied Nation.</p>
