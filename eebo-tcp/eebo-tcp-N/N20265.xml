            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT has ever been the misfortune of those who have professed to lay down rules for the attainment of any art or science, to leave them enveloped with difficulties, which, if not utterly insuperable, at least discourage the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from proceeding in a study which he can have little hopes will ever reward his pursuit.</p>
            <p>From hence we may reasonably infer, that the said professors were totally unacquainted, if not with the theory at least with the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part of what they undertook to teach others; and that the instructions they have given were founded rather upon a bare supposition of their efficacy, than upon the surer basis of long and repeated experience, which alone could have insured their success, and from which, with all due deference to the judicious (whose sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we shall at all times be ambitious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,) we may venture to answer for the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticability of our own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:026577_0003_0FD0AC839CC1F810"/>To obviate every objection, and to remove all those difficulties which had so long blocked up the path of science, and retarded, if not wholy impeded the pupil in his progress to the temple of fame, was the chief veiw in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling the subsequent little treatise.</p>
            <p>Over and above the improvements made in illustrating the several arts hitherto so imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and unintelligibly explained we have introduced directions for scraping in mezzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinto, which in this edition, are still further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and which, as they have never been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attempted in any book of this kind we flatter ourselves will be the more acceptable; especially when it shall appear from the rules laid down for the performance of this art, that it is so easy to be attained, that a tolerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in drawing will enable any one to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kertake it with all imaginable prospect of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
            <p>The reader will also find, in this impression, the addition of a very useful problem, in the article of perspective illustrated by a new plate, and one additional plate of flowers and sprigs, for the instruction of young Ladies who have a taste for drawing.</p>
            <p>As this book is chiefly intended for the use of young practitioners, we have purposely avoided all abstruse expressions and obsolete
<pb facs="unknown:026577_0004_0FD0AC848BB60048"/>
terms, contenting ourselves with such a familiar style as we judged most likely to inform those minds we should wish to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>prove: yet as the ideas of an artist are not wholly to be conveyed without some necessary terms peculiar to each branch, we have taken care to explain such as could not be omitted without a manifest injury to the work, by familiar words of a synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tendency, wherever they occur; so that we apprehend we have not left the least stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block for the reader to encounter</p>

               <p>This art recalls to our memory things long since past, and rescues from oblivion the deeds of our illustrious ancestors, at the same time it revives their image in our mind, by preserving their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After giving some general directions for the attainment of that truly polite and rational amusement, which is the basis on which all the rest of the Arts depend, we shall consider it more particularly under the following heads, and lay down the most copious and intelligible rules for each respectively, viz.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>General Rules for DRAWING,</head>
                  <p>EVERY young beginner should edeavour to improve his memory with the beauties of the most excellent paintings and prints, taking notice of the harmony of their different parts, as well as the reasons for the disposition of the lights and shades: by this means the hand will be more ready to execute those objects the mind has so clearly conceived.</p>
                  <p>Having provided the original intended to be drawn from, begin with the outlines of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral features, as the eyes, nose, mouth, ears &amp;c. as they occur in the book. Practise these often over, till you are quite master of them; then proceed to a profile or side-face, after that to an oval or full face; always remembering that each of these must be perfectly attained before you venture to proceed further.</p>
                  <p>When you can copy a face correctly, the next thing is, to draw the several limbs or parts of the body, as the hands, arms, feet, legs, &amp;c. then go on to the body it self; which having done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:026577_0010_0FD0AC90EBCB5D60"/>
you will be able to undertake a whole figure, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving carefully the exact P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of one part with respect to the other.</p>
                  <p>The learner ought to be particularly cautious that he do not attempt a whole figure before he has made himself master of the several parts; for this is beginning the work at the wrong end and is indeed the same thing as if a man should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to climb to the top of a house without the help of the stairs.</p>
                  <p>As for beasts, birds, fruit, plants, &amp;c. we deem it useless to give directions for drawing them, as it is well known, that he who has so far improved his ideas as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e able to draw a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man figure correctly, will find it no difficulty to perform every other branch of this art.</p>
                  <p>Sketch or draw the outlines faintly, with a piece of soft charcoal (which may be known by the pith in the middle) cut to a point like a pencil and when you see any thing amiss, whisk it out with a handkerchief or feather, correct your errors with a black lead pencil, and compare your work with the original, till every part of them perfectly correspond. This done finish your outlines with black lead or Indian ink. This advice properly attended to, will save you an infinite deal of trouble, in drawing over and over again, to your no small discouragement.</p>
                  <p>If you prefer Indian ink, rub it with water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a marble, and with a crow-quill pen perfect your outlines; then rub out the marks of the pencil with bread.— Keep three or four different shades of ink in the hollows of your stone, to distinguish your distances, reserving one of the holes for water.</p>

                  <p>WHEN you would copy a print or drawing exactly of the same size, rub the back of it with the dust of red chalk or black lead; lay this upon your paper, and pin it down at the four corners; then with a blunt point trace the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and breadths of the shadows; which done, having carefully examined it, to see that nothing be omitted, take it off and finish it with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or pen.</p>
                  <p>Another way to make an exact copy, and at the same time to preserve the Original, is to lay a piece of transparent paper upon it, and draw the outlines thereon with a black-lead pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; then between that and the paper you intend to draw upon, place a piece of thin post-paper, reddened or blackened at the back; after which proceed to trace and finish it according to the foregoing rule.</p>
                  <p>There is another way to take off the outlines

from the oiled paper. Lay it on a sheet of white, and prick over the drawing with a pin. Then lay the white paper on the article you would draw on, and dust it over with fine charchoal dust tied loosely in a rag, and it will leave a true copy: where incorrect it may be helped by the pencil or pen. The pricked paper will be more compleat if varnished, and will last longer.</p>
                  <p>If you would reverse the original, you need only turn the transparent paper, with the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you have made upon it, downwards upon the post-paper, and trace it as above directed.</p>

                  <p>When you have sufficiently practised the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts or limbs, you may draw the whole figure, in whatever attitude you may think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to place it; beginning with the easiest, and proceeding by degrees to the more difficult pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as time and experience shall enable you.</p>

                  <head>Of Drapery.</head>
                  <p>DRAPERY is the Art of cloathing your figures with elegance and propriety.</p>
                  <p>When your naked figure is outlined, first draw the outlines of the drapery lightly, then the greater folds, and afterwards the lesser; obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never to let them cross each other.</p>
                  <p>Particular regard is to be had to the quality of the drapery; as the folds of stuff or woollen cloth are more abrupt and harsh, and those of silk more flowing and easy. Linnen, cambrick, gauze, &amp;c. as their substance is lighter than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, require a still greater delicacy in expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the waving of the folds, by the faintness of their shadows.</p>
                  <p>The drapery should not stick too close to the body but must seem to flow round as it were; yet in such a manner, as that the motion of the figure may be free and easy. A great lightness and motion of the drapery should only be used, when the figures are supposed to be in much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, or exposed to the wind; but in a calm place and free from violent action, their drapery should be large and flowing, in order to give them a more graceful appearance.</p>
                  <p>Let the loose parts of the drapery blown by the wind all flow one way; and draw that part which lies closest to the body, before you draw those that fly off.</p>
                  <p>Suit your garments to the body, and make

                     </gap>he garment sticks to the body, the narrower and smaller must be the folds; and if it fits quite close, there will be no folds at all, but must only have a faint shadow to represent the part of the body which lies under it.</p>
                  <p>By observing diligently in what manner the drapery flows upon any person standing or sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before you for that purpose, you will see in what manner to dispose your folds and shadows according to the unerring rule of nature.</p>

                  <p>Shadowing is performed with the pen or pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; in either of which great judgment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>Having made your outlines correct, the first thing is to observe from which side of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal the light comes in; which, if natural, is either from the right hand or left; for when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the light appears in the middle of a picture, and seems to glare more than ordinary, it is cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed by a candle, a lamp, or some other lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous body, and is called an artificial light.</p>
                  <p>Lay on your little tints first, disposing them
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026577_0019_0FD0ACA80AE05128"/>
as you see they are done in the original; and then proceed to the deeper ones, till you come to the darkest parts of all: For you may at any time darken your shadows, when you cannot lighten them.</p>
                  <p>Let all your shadows in the same piece fall on the same side; that is, if the right-side of a man's face be dark, so must be the right-side of his body, arm, leg, thigh, &amp;c. But if the light side be darkened by the opposition of some other body intercepting the light, it must receive a contrary shadow.</p>
                  <p>Make your shadows fainter as they grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the light, breaking them gradually, that they may not appear too sudden or harsh.</p>
                  <p>If you shade with black lead or with cray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you may blend your shadows, and soften them one into another as you require, with a stump made of paper or glove-leather rolled and tied hard, and cut almost to the point, with which you may also weaken your shades where they are too strong.</p>
                  <p>When one part of the body projects over or before another, the part projecting must receive a stronger light: Those parts that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Two equal lights must never be made in the same picture: The strongest light should fall upon the middle of the piece, (where the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal figures ought to stand) diminishing gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally towards the extremities.</p>

To take these outlines off on paper or vellum, lay the tiffany in an horizontal position on the paper or vellum, so as to touch in every part.</p>
                  <p>When well fixed, it must be struck with some flat substance in every part.

Paper may be used for the same purpose as the tiffany, being made transparent by the oil of turpentine or glass, by drawing the out lines with a black colour, mixed with a drying oil. Then lay the paper gently without rubbing on the glass; moisten the paper a little with water before you lay it on.</p>

               <p>PERSPECTIVE is the art of delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting objects (as they-appear in nature upon a plain surface) according to their distance and height perpendicular to the horizon, between the object and the eye.</p>
               <p>This art is of great consequence to those who would excel in drawing, etching, engraving, carving in bas-relief, or painting; for being well understood, the artist will be enabled to know when to adhere to the strict rules, and when to depart from them with propriety.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Explanation of the Terms used in perspective.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BASE or fundamental line, is the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-line of the drawing on which the person is supposed to stand, with his face towards the po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt of sight.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:026577_0024_0FD0ACB202ED4868"/>2. PERPENDICULAR is a line drawn upright with respect to any part of the base.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. PARALLEL LINES are lines equidistant from each other, as the horizon to the base.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. HORIZON is the most distant part of a plain, where the clouds, seeming to touch the earth, limit the sight. The horizontal line gives the height of the eye; for we cannot see any thing above the horizon which does not exceed this height: Yet the summit of a mountain may be above the horizon, though its foot be far beneath it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. POINT of SIGHT is that part of the horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal line where all the visual rays center in a point.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. VISUAL RAYS are beams of light conveying the likeness of any object to the eye or sight, and the knowledge thereof to the mind or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. POINT of DISTANCE are supposed points set off on the horizontal line, at equal distances on each side the point of sight.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. DIAGONAL LINES are those drawn from the points of distance to the extremities of the base line.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Abridgement of the Square is the line where the diagonals intersect or cross the visual rays, and must always run parallel to the base. It is only made where the sight is limited by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, as the farther end of a church, hall, room, &amp;c. And supposing a person to stand thereon, a parallel line drawn through the point
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026577_0025_0FD0ACB430BDA558"/>
of sight will seem to pass through the eyes, and will consequently shew what height that person ought to be.</p>
                  <p>The nine foregoing definitions are illustrated in fig I. of the perspective plate.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. POINT OF DIRECT VIEW. This is nothing more than the front view of a house, church, &amp;c. or in other words, a geometrical elevation raised from a plan or ground plot, and comprehending an equal space on both sides of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> point of sight. See fig. XIV.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. POINT OF OBLIQUE VIEW is when we see the object sideways or aslant. Example: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a person was to draw a view of a canal with some remarkable building he is desirous to shew more distinct, he must place himself (on the base or fundamental line) opposite to that building, that the ray of light may be more oblique; by which means the admired building will be less fore-shortened, and appear to greater advantage, the points of sight being still before him, though not in the middle of the picture. See fig. XV.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. ACCIDENTAL POINTS are those where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects end in the horizontal line, but neither in the points of sight or distance, and serve for streets, houses, chairs, roads, &amp;c. which take different directions. As for example: suppose a street leading to the point of sight, and from it two others branch, the one on the right hand, the other on the left, and take a different direction; these two last streets make what we call acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points, terminating in some part of the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal line, on each side of the point of sight.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026577_0026_0FD0ACB5342E1BC8"/>
See fig. XVI. The same is to be observed in a grove, park, &amp;c. where the walk you are in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects immediately to the point of sight, and the avenues branching out on either side terminate also in different parts of the horizon.</p>
                  <p>ICHNOGRAPHY is the plan or ground-plot of any object that is to be raised in perspective.</p>
                  <p>SCENOGRAPHY is the art of bringing any thing raised in perspective from an ichnographic plan to its due proportion, according to the distance in which it is placed; that all objects may be diminished according to their distance in a picture, in the same degree as they are diminished by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in a natural prospect. A scenographic view may be either direct, as in fig. XIV. or oblique, as in fig. XV.</p>
                  <p>AS the Art of perspective is constructed upon geometrical principles, it will be necessary previous to the rules themselves, to learn the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing introductary operations.</p>

                  <head>Practical Examples in Perspective.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 To draw a square Pavement in Perspective See Fig. X. and XI.</p>
                  <p>SUPPOSE your piece of pavement to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of 64 pieces of marble, each a foot square. Your first business is, to draw an ichnographical plan or ground-plot of it, which is thus perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Having made an exact square of the size you intend your plan, divide the base and horizon into eight equal parts, and from every division in the base to its opposite point in the horizon, rule perpendicular lines; then divide the sides into the same number, ruling parallel lines
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026577_0030_0FD0ACBB713CFB00"/>
across from point to point; so will your pavement be divided into 64 square feet; because the eight feet in length, multiplied by the same in breadth, give the number of square feet or pieces of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contained in the whole: then rule diagonals from corner to corner; and thus will your ground-plot appear as in fig. X.</p>
                  <p>Now, to lay this in perspective, draw another square to your intended size, and divide the base line AB into eight equal parts, as before; then fix your point of sight C, in the middle of the horizon DE, and from the same point rule lines to every division in the base AB; after which, rule diagonal lines from D to B, and from E to A, answerable to those in the ground-plot, and your square will be reduced to the triangle ABC; then from the point F, where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agonal DB intersects the line AC, to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site intersection G, where the diagonal EA cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the line CB, rule a parallel line, which is the abridgement of the square.</p>
                  <p>Then through the points where the diagonals cross the rest of the lines, which go from the base to the point of sight, rule parallel lines, and your square pavement will be laid in perspective, as in fig. XI.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To find the Height and Proportion of any Objects, as they appear above the Horizon, on a supposed Plane. See Fi. XII.</p>
                  <p>First, rule your horizontal line NO, and fix your point of sight, as at M; then mark the place of your nearest pillar, by making a dot for the base or bottom, as at A; and another for the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026577_0031_0FD0ACBCC7969C98"/>
summit or top, as at B: Rule a line from A to the point of sight M, and another from B to M and these two lines will give the height of any number of pillars. As for example: Suppose you would have a pillar at C, fix your dot for the base, and rule from thence a parallel line to meet the diagonal AM at D. then rule the perpendicular DE to the diagonal BM: which perpendicular is the height of your figure required at C. Or, if you would place pillars at F and I, observe the same method, ruling the parallels FG and IK, and the perpendiculars GH and KL will give their heights at the distances required.</p>
                  <p>To find the diameter or thickness of pillars at any particular distances, you are also to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by that nearest the base. For instance: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your nearest pillar AB to be ten feet high, and one foot in diameter; divide it from top to bottom into ten equal parts, and set off one of them upon the base of the pillar: Then rule a line from the point of sight M to the diameter P, and you will have the thickness of all your pillars on their respective parallels or bases.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The same Rule exemplified in Objects below the Horizon. See Fig. XIII.</p>
                  <p>If you would know the heights of a number of figures below the horizon, rule your horizontal line QR, and fix your point of sight, as at P; then place your nearest figure, or mark the dots for the head and feet, by the points of A and B, which answers the same purpose; and rule from these dots to the point of sight the lines AP and BP· And if you would find the height of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026577_0032_0FD0ACBE2CBB89C0"/>
to be drawn at <hi>c,</hi> rule from thence the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel <hi>cd</hi> to the diagonal BP, and the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>de</hi> will give the height required. The same directions will shew the height of a figure at any other distance you have a mind to place it, as at <hi>f, i,</hi> and <hi>m,</hi> by ruling the parallels <hi>fg, ik,</hi> and <hi>mn</hi>; and from each of these their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective perpendiculars <hi>gh, kl,</hi> and <hi>no</hi>; which perpendiculars will shew the height of the figures at <hi>f, i,</hi> and <hi>m.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Draw a direct View. See Fig. XIV.</p>
                  <p>To illustrate this example, suppose you were to draw the inside of a church, as represented in this figure: First, take your station at the point A, in the center of the base line BC; from which you have a front view of the whole body of the church, with all the pillars, &amp;c. on each side: Then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ix your horizon at any height you think proper, as at DE; besect it by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular EA; and where these two lines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect, is the point of sight F. (This perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular will pass through the centers of all the arches in the dome or cupola; which centers may be found by any three given points, as in fig. VII.) Next divide your base line into any given number of feet; and the visual lines ruled from these divisions to the point of sight, will reduce all your objects to their just proportion, by setting off their height upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> perpendicular raised at their respective distances. The base, in the example here given, is divided into twelve equal parts, of five feet each; from which (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing your front column to be 35 feet high) take seven d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>isions from the base line of your draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026577_0033_0FD0ACC35481D120"/>
and set them off upon the perpendicular G H; then (supposing this column to be five feet thick at the base) set off one of those divisions upon the parallel IK, which is the breadth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. So that, by proportioning this scale to any distance by the foregoing directions, you may not only find the dimensions of all your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, but also of every distinct part of them, as well as of all the doors, windows, and other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ccur. For instance: Having found the height and breadth of your first or nearest column G, draw from the top and bottom of the said column to the point of sight the lines HF and KF; after which, rule the line IF from the base of the column to the point of sight, and you have the height and breadth of all the rest of the columns, as has been already shewn in Fig. XII.</p>
                  <p>By ruling lines from the points <hi>a, b, c, d,</hi> &amp;c. to the point of sight, you will see that all the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and bases of your columns, doors, windows, &amp;c. must tend immediately to that point; and by lines drawn from the points 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. on each side, to the correspondent points on the opposite side, may be seen all the part of your building lying under the same parallel.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To draw an Oblique View. See Fig. XV.</p>
                  <p>First, draw your horizontal line AB; then, if your favourite object be on the right hand, as at C, place yourself on the left hand upon the base line, as at D; then from that station erect a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular DE, which will pass through the horizon at the point of sight F; to which rule the diagonals GF and HF, which will shew the

roof and base of your principal building C, and will also, as before directed, serve as a standard for all the rest.</p>
                  <p>Observe also, either in direct or oblique views, whether the prospect before you make a curve; for, if it does, you must be careful to make the same curve in your drawing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To draw a Perspective View, wherein are Accidental points. See Fig. XVI.</p>
                  <p>Rule your horizontal line <hi>ab,</hi> and on one part of it fix your point of sight, as at <hi>c,</hi> from which rule the diagonal <hi>cd</hi> and <hi>ce</hi> on the one side, and <hi>cf</hi> and <hi>cq</hi> on the other; which will shew the roofs and bases of all the houses in the street directly facing you; (supposing yourself placed at A in the center of the base line:) Then fix your accidental points <hi>g</hi> and <hi>h</hi> upon the horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal line, and rule from them to the angles <hi>ik</hi> and <hi>lm,</hi> (where the streets on each side take a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent direction, towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Accidental points seldom intervene where the distance is small, as in noblemen's seats, groves, canals, &amp;c. which may be drawn by the strict rules of perspective: But where the prospect is extensive and varied, including mountains, bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, castles, rivers, precipices, woods, cities, &amp;c. it will require such an infinite number of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental points, that it will be better to do them as nature shall dictate, and your ripened judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment approve.</p>

               <p>The principal materials for this art are, the plate, hard and soft ground (the first for winter and the other for summer), a dabber, turpentine-varnish, lamp-black, soft wax, and aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>The tools are, an oil-rubber, a burnisher, a scraper, a hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>HAVING provided yourself with a plate of the size of the print or drawing you intend

to copy, rub it well with an oil-rubber made of Swan skin flannel, till all the marks of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal used in polishing it, intirely disappear; then, wiping off the dirty oil with a linen rag, dip your finger in some clean oil, and touch it over every part of the plate; after which, with your bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher polish the plate, till you can see your face in it: And in case any sand-holes or flaws ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the scraper will assist you in taking them out. The marks left by the scraper are to be taken out by the burnisher, till nothing appear. Having fixed your hand-vice at one end of the plate, with a rag and whiting clear the plate carefully from grease; then heat it over a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal fire, or lighted paper, till it will melt the ground, which is to be laid on thinly, and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the plate be large, you may bind four penny candles together.</p>

                  <p>THE first thing to be done, (while the plate is cooling, after the ground is laid) is to rub the back of your print or drawing all over with a bit of rag or cotton, dipt in the scrapings of red chalk, and shake off the loose dust, or wipe it off gently with a clean rag. Place the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with a little bit of soft wax. Lay your Etching-board under your hand, to prevent bruising the ground; then with a blunt etching-needle trace lightly the out-lines and breadths of the shadows, till the marks of them appear upon the ground, which you must take care not to penetrate by tracing too hard.</p>
                  <p>As great nicety is required in this part of your work, it will be necessary now and then to lift up one corner of your original, and examine whether every part be traced before you take it off, as it will be extremely difficult to lay it down again in its former position.</p>

                  <p>HAVING carefully traced your original, take it off, and lay a silk or linen handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief next the plate, and over that your etching-board; then proceed to the etching; for which observe the following directions, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to every particular branch, as Landscapes, Shipping, Portraits, History, Architecture, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Distances in landscapes, or the faint parts of any other picture, are the first to be done; and these are to be worked closer, and with a sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-pointed needle: The darker parts must be etched wider, and with a blunter needle; but, to prevent mistakes, the needles may be marked, according to their different degrees, and the uses for which they are intended. As for the very faintest parts of all, they are to be left for the graver, or dry needle; of which hereafter.</p>

                  <p>The needles may, when necessary, be whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon your oil-stone, keeping them turning in your hand, so as to whet them equally all round. The oil-stone will be further useful in whetting the scraper, which is to be rubbed flat upon the stone, and with a steady hand, keeping oil constantly upon the stone.</p>

                  <head>Of Biting, or Eating in the Work with Aqua Fortis.</head>
                  <p>FIRST examine your work carefully, to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e that nothing be omitted; and if any scratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es appear upon the ground, or mistakes be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in the etchings, they are to be stopped out, which is done by covering them with mixture of lamp-black and varnish, laid on thinly with a hair pencil, which when dry, will resist the aqua fortis. But it will be best to stop out these, as they occur to you in the course of your work; for by this means they will be less liable to escape your notice; and when the varnish is dry, you may etch over it again, if required.</p>
                  <p>The next thing is, to inclose the work with a rim or border of soft green, or other coloured wax, about half an inch high, bending the wax in the form of a spout at one corner, to pour off the aqua fortis: And that it may not run out at any other part, take care to lay your wax so close to the plate, that no vacancies be left.</p>
                  <p>Your aqua fortis must be single; and if too
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026577_0041_0FD0ACD4B2B50C70"/>
strong, as will be seen in the biting, take it off, and mix it with a little water, shaking them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a bottle; and when, by often using, it becomes too weak, it may be strengthened by mixing it in a bottle with a little double aqua fortis.

When the ground is taken off, rub the work well with the oil-rubber, and wipe the plate clean; then proceed to finish it with the graver, according to the following directions.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. OF ENGRAVING.</head>
               <p>THE tools necessary for engraving are, the oil-rubber, burnisher, scraper, oil-stone, needles, and ruler, already mentioned to be used in etching; also gravers, compasses, and a sand-bag.</p>
               <p>Gravers are of two sorts, square and lozenge. Three of each sort should be provided. The first is used in cutting the broader strokes, the other for the fainter and more delicate. No graver should exceed the length of five inches and a half, the handle included, excepting for straight lines.</p>
               <p>The sand-bag or cushion, is used to lay the plate on, for the conveniency of turning it about. The oil-stone must be of the Turkey sort.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of whetting and tempering the Graver.</head>
                  <p>AS great pains are required to whet the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nicely, particularly the belly of it, care must be taken to lay the two angles of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which are to be held next the plate, flat upon the stone, and rub them steadily till they are polished like a mirror, and till the belly rises
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:026577_0043_0FD0ACD978242D58"/>
gradually above the plate, so as that, when you lay the graver flat upon it, you may just perceive the light under the point; otherwise it will dig into the copper, and it will be impossible to keep a point, or execute the work with freedom. In order to this, keep your right arm close to your side, and place the forefinger of your left hand upon that part of the graver which lies upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most on the stone. When this is done, in order to whet the face, place the flat part of the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the hollow of your hand, with the belly of the graver upwards, upon a moderate slope, and rub the extremity or face upon the stone, till it has an exceeding sharp point, which you may try upon your thumb-nail. The oil stone, while in use, must never be kept without oil.</p>
                  <p>When the graver is too hard, as is usually the case when first bought, and may be known by the frequent breaking of the point, the method of tempering the steel is as follows:</p>
                  <p>Heat a poker red hot, and hold the graver up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it within half an inch of the point, waving it to and fro till the steel changes to a light straw-colour; then put the point into oil to cool; or hold the graver close to the flame of a candle, till it be of the same colour, and cool it in the tallow: But be careful either way not to hold it too long, for then it will be too soft; and in this case the point, which will then turn blue, must be broken off, and whetted afresh, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered again, if required. But be not too hasty in tempering; for sometimes a little whetting will bring it to a good condition.</p>

                  <head>Of holding the Graver.</head>
                  <p>CUT off that part of the handle which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same line with the belly, or sharp edge of the graver, making that side flat, that it may be no obstruction.</p>
                  <p>Hold the handle in the hollow of your hand; and extending your fore-finger towards the point, let it rest upon the back of the graver, that you may guide it flat, and parallel with the plate.</p>
                  <p>Take care that your fingers do not interpose between the plate and the graver; for they will prevent you from carrying the graver level with the plate, and from cutting your strokes so clean as they ought to be.</p>

                  <head>Directions for Engraving.</head>
                  <p>LET the table or board you work at be firm and steady; upon which place your sand-bag, with the plate upon it; and holding the graver as above directed, proceed to business in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>For strait strokes, hold your plate firm upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the sand-bag with your left hand, moving your right hand forwards; leaning lighter where the stroke should be fine, and harder where you would have it broader.</p>
                  <p>For circular or crooked strokes, hold the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stedfast, moving your hand or the plate, as you see convenient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:026577_0045_0FD07F7D04EF7D20"/>Learn to carry your hand with such a sleight that you may end your stroke as finely as you began it; and, if you have occasion to make one part deeper or blacker than another, do it by degrees: and that you may do it with greater exactness, take care that your strokes be not too close, nor too wide.</p>
                  <p>In the course of your work, scrape off the barb or roughness which arises, with the belly of your graver; but be careful, in doing this, not to scratch the plate: and that you may see your work properly as you go on, rub it with the oil-rubber, and wipe the plate clean, which will take off the glare of the copper, and shew what you have done to the best advantage.</p>
                  <p>Any mistakes or scratches in the plate may be rubbed out with the burnisher, and the part level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the scraper, polishing it again after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards lightly with the burnisher,</p>
                  <p>Having thus attained the use of the graver, according to the foregoing rules, you will be able to finish the piece you had etched, by graving up the several parts to the colour of the original, beginning, as in the etching, with the fainter parts, and advancing gradually with the stronger, till the whole is completed.</p>
                  <p>The dry needle (so called because not used till the ground is taken off the plate) is principally employed in the extreme light parts of water, sky, drapery, architecture, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For your first practice, copy such prints as are openly shaded; the more finished ones being too

                  <p>Great choice of prints of every kind, fit for young beginners, may be had where this book is published.</p>
                  <p>N. B. To prevent any obstruction from too great a degree of light, we would recommend the use of a Sash, made of transparent or fan paper, pasted on a frame, and placed sloping at a convenient distance between your work and the light.

               <head>CHAP. V. OF MEZZOTINTO-SCRAPING.</head>
               <p>THIS art, which is of late date, is recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the practice of the ingenious reader, for the amazing ease with which it is executed, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by those who have any notion of drawing.</p>
               <p>Mezzotinto prints are those which have no hatching or strokes of the graver, but whose lights and shades are blended together, and appear like a drawing of Indian ink.</p>
               <p>The tools used in this art are,</p>
               <p>The copper-plate, oil-stone, grounding-tools, scrapers, burnisher, and needles.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Directions for laying the Mezzotinto-Ground.</head>
                  <p>MARK off upon the bottom of the plate the distance you intend to leave for the writing, coat of arms, &amp;c. then laying your plate, with a piece of swanskin flannel under it, upon your table, hold the grounding-tool in your hand perpendicularly, lean upon it moderately hard, continually rocking your hand in a right line from end to end, till you have wholly cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the plate in one direction: Next cross the strokes from side to side, afterwards from corner
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026577_0048_0FD0ACE9C12BAEC0"/>
to corner, working the tool each time all over the plate, in every direction, almost like the points of a compass; taking all possible care not to let the tool cut (in one direction) twice in a place. This done, the plate will be full, or, in other words, all over rough alike, and would, if it were printed, appear completely black.</p>
                  <p>Having laid the ground, take scrapings of black chalk, and with a piece of rag rub it over the plate: or you may, with two or three candles smoke it, as before directed for etching.</p>
                  <p>Now, take your print or drawing, and having rubbed the back with red-chalk dust, mixed with white lake, proceed to trace it as directed page 34.</p>

                  <head>Directions for whetting the Grounding-Tool.</head>
                  <p>IF a tooth of the tool should break, it may be perceived in the working by a particular streak or gap, which will appear in the ground in a strait line; in which case the tool must be whetted on the back, holding it sloping, and in a circular manner, like the bottom of the tool.</p>

hurt your outlines; and that you may the better see what you do, with the thumb and fore-finger of the left hand hold a piece of transparent paper, sloping, just over your right hand, and you will soon be a judge of the different tints of the work you are doing; scraping off more or less of the ground, as the different strengths of light and tints require.</p>

                  <p>Another method used by mezzotinto-scrapers, is, to etch the outlines of the original, as also of the folds in drapery, marking the breadth of the shadows by dots, which having bit of a proper colour with aqua fortis, according to the directions given page 35 and 36, take off the ground used in etching, and having laid the mezzotinto-ground as in page 44, proceed to scrape the picture as above.</p>
                  <p>Four or five days before you think the plate will be ready for proving, notice must be given to the rolling-press printer to wet some French paper, as no other will do for this work, and as that time is necessary for it to lie in wet. When the proof is dry, touch it with white chalk, where it should be lighter; and with black chalk, where it should be darker: and when the print is retouched, proceed as before for the lights, and for shades use a small grounding-tool, as much as you judge necessary to bring it to the proper colour; and when you have done as much
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026577_0050_0FD0ACECAEBFB278"/>
as you think expedient, prove it again, and so proceed to prove and touch, till it is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>entirely to your mind. When the plate tarnishes in the part where you are at work, a little vinegar and salt kept by you in a phial will take it off, wiping it dry with a clean rag.</p>
                  <p>Avoid as much as possible over-scraping any part before the first proving, as by this caution the work will appear the more elegant.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. OF PAINTING upon GLASS.</head>
               <p>PAINTING upon glass is an art which has generally appeared difficult; yet there is no representation can be more elegant than that of a picture done well in this manner: for it gives all the softness that can be desired in a picture, and is easy to work; as there are no outlines to draw, nor any shade to make, but the colours are put on without the trouble of either.</p>
               <p>The pictures are those done in mezzotinto; for their shades being rubbed down on the glass, the several lines which represent the shady part of any common print, are by this means blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and apear as soft and united as in any draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Indian ink.</p>
               <p>Provide such metzotintos as you like; cut off the margin, then get a piece of fine crown glass, the size of your print (as flat and free from knots or scratches as possible), clean the glass, and lay some venice turpentine, quite thin and smooth, on one side thereof, with a brush of hog's hair. Lay the print flat in the water, and let it remain on the surface till it sinks; 'tis then enough: take it carefully out, and dab it between some papers, that no water may be seen, yet so as to be damp.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:026577_0052_0FD0ACF31B342068"/>Next, lay the damp print, with its face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon a flat table; then, holding the glass over it, without touching the turpentine till it is exactly even with the print, let it fall gently on it. Press the glass down carefully with your fingers in several parts, so that the turpentine may stick to the print; after which, take it up; then, holding the glass towards you, press the print with your fingers, from the center towards the edges, till there be no blisters remaining.</p>
               <p>When this is done, wet the back of your print with a spunge, till the paper will rub off with your fingers; then rub it gently, and the white paper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> roll off, leaving the impression only upon the glass: Then let it dry, and with a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel's-hair pencil, dipt in oil of turpentine, wet it all over, and it will be perfectly transparent, and fit for painting.</p>

               <p>The different colours are white, black, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, orange, red, purple, blue, green, and brown; and each of these have their several shades, excepting the two first.</p>

                  <p>THE paper to be used on this occasion is rough Venice paper, of a whited brown colour, and the stiffer the better. That sort called Cape-paper is found to be the best, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause upon that the colours best distribute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. By this method, figures may be drawn in their proper colours as they appear to the eye, because the colours may be matched with the crayons, and the crayons being dry, will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their colour; but the colours, when wet, appear deeper than when they are dry, which is apt to deceive a young beginner.</p>
                  <p>Another way to make the necessary preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>YOUR pencils must be fast in their quils, and sharp-pointed after you have drawn them through your mouth.</p>
                  <p>Before you begin have all your colours read,

before you, and a pallet for the conveniency of mixing them; a paper to lay under your hand, and to keep your work clean, as well to try your colours upon; also a large brush called a fitch, to wipe off the dust when your colours are dry.</p>
                  <p>Lay your colours on but thinly at first, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and mellowing them by degrees as you see occasion. The quicker you lay them on, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                  <p>Take care to preserve all your colours from dust; and before you use them, wipe your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>lls and pallet every time with a fitch.</p>
                  <p>When you have done your work, or would lay it aside, be careful to wash out your pencils in warm water.</p>
                  <p>For face-painting, mix up a little light carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or flesh colour with gum water in a shell by itself. If it be for a fair complexion, mix ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million and white slake together: and for a swarthy one, add to the former a little masticot or English oker, or both.</p>
                  <p>Let your flesh-colour be always lighter than the complexion you would paint; for, by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, you may bring it to its true colour.</p>
                  <p>In a large shell, or upon your pallet, lay your different shades of flesh-colour at a convenient distance from each other: and always have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a sufficient quantity of white to lighten your shadows.</p>

                  <p>For grey feint shadows, use white, English oker, umber; for darker shadows, lake and pink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which make a good fleshy shadow.</p>
                  <p>In colouring landscapes, at first only lay dead colours smooth all over the piece, leaving no part uncovered; and be not over curious in this part of the performance, but rather use a master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freedom; and the work, though seemingly rough to the eye, will have a good effect when placed at a distance.</p>
                  <p>Let not the roughness of the colour discourage you; for it is easily to be softened by degrees with the other shadows, observing only to sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and heighten them according as the light falls.</p>
                  <p>In some places lay on strong touches, and in those places bring your work up together to an equal roundness and strength; tempering and sweetening your colours with a sharper pencil than the first, that no lumps or harsh edges be left, but that all your shadows may lie dispersed, soft and smooth, gliding gently, as it were, into one another.</p>
                  <p>You are not to finish any part before the others but work up all the parts gradually alike, till you see nothing wanting to complete your pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Having laid your dead colours, begin first with the lightest parts, as the sky, sun-beams, &amp;c. then the yellowish beams (which are to be done with masticot and white); next the blue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the sky, with ultramarine or smalt alone. For purple clouds, only mix lake and white, making your colours deeper as they go upwards from the horizon, except in tempestuous skies.

                  <p>All distant objects are to be made imperfect as they appear to the eye, as has been already observed under the article of light and shade.</p>

                  <p>These rules are adapted to general appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but the learner may deviate from them as nature shall dictate.</p>

               <p>In the foregoing rules we have recommended, for the most part, the leaving the paper for the light parts of a flower, and working with colours mostly transparent; but here the lights are to be made by a small tincture of the intended flower mixt with the flake-white, so much as just make a degree from the colour of the sattin; if white, or of any other colour, to be mixed proportionably to the colour of the flower: For instance, if a blue flower, the bice of verditer, a very small quantity of it with the white, using less of it proportionally as the shades grow darker; and in the most dark, indigo alone may be used, it being by that time rendered opaque enough; but great care must be used not to lay the colours on too thick, otherwise they will crack: A little white sugar-candy will be found necessary, when mixed with gum-water, as preventitive to that inconveniency. If a flower happens to be of so deep a colour as not to admit of any pure white in the lightest of the parts, a sort of priming of white should be laid on; after which, when dry, begin with the ground colour of the flower, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding gradually with the shades, as in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, which, with the selected examples we have annexed, pecurliarly chosen from nature for the purpose, we hope will be sufficient for our ingenious students in this most delightful amusement.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. THE ART of JAPPANNING MADE EASY. &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THE art of japanning, and decorating with various designs, has prevailed so much of late from the superb cabinet, to the smallest arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the toilet; that it is needless to apologize for the publication of a work which seems calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated at once to serve every purpose of composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for this use, it being scarce possible to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest a design, but what may be easily and elegantly accomplished, by a well chosen selecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the foregoing prints. The variety of objects admitted almosts infinite combinations and and being likewise singly agreeable.</p>
               <p>The first intention or subject being mere mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of choice, in this the fancy alone must direct; but when once fixt on, care must be taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a propriety: for instance if the scene be European, in the body of your design place no exotic preposterous object, but carefully observing to keep the small and faintest hills, trees, figures, &amp;c. at the greatest distance, ever placing on the bottom or front ground, some grand or striking feature. Thus will a perspective and due keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be infused thro' your work without the labour of obtaining it by rules of art.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:026577_0070_0FD0AD10116D5590"/>

                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:026577_0071_0FD0AD116CA2F0E0"/>With Indian and Chinese subjects greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties may be taken, because luxuriance of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy recommends their productions more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, for in them is often seen a butterfly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting an elephant, or things equally absurd: yet from their gay colouring and airy disposition seldom fail to please.</p>
               <p>The grotesque is a taste which at present much prevails and seems particularly calculated for this work, which consists in a wild connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of beasts with flowers, and shells with birds, &amp;c. It is easy to succeed in this by being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid a similarity of objects and colours, for contrast in disposition, and opposition in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring is its chief gout, still spreading the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face pretty equal.</p>
               <p>The ornamental or bordering is not the least worth notice in this art, seeing there is scarce any object, whether figure, bird, plant, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect, which may not with propriety, by making partitions, where room will admit with the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and in which pannels and spaces, may be introduced a great and pleasing variety.</p>
               <p>So much for design, in carrying of which into execution, it is necessary to be very particular and careful in each operation; and the following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections well attended to, will not only furnish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>To avoid confusion, I shall distinguish the art of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026577_0072_0FD0AD12EE39F430"/>
japanning under three heeds, viz. ground, figure, and varnish: And first of the ground. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to be ornamented, if wood, must be well season'd, or the heat used in varnishing will shrink the wood, and produce cracks and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Shades in your ground, in the smoothness of which consists its chief excellence, and is effected by first striking over with a large brush your whole surface with melted clear size; into one pint of which has been put a table spoonful of bullock's gall. The size may be bought in most places, or made by boiling shreds of white leather, parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or vellum in water, until two gallons are reduced to one; then strain'd off, and kept in a cool place for use.</p>
               <p>The colours most apt to stand, and appear smooth, are for black, that of Frankfort, lamp, and ivory black; the last is preferable. For white, the flake is generally used, but I would recommend the finest plaister of Paris, mixed in equal quantities with well washed whiting; the other being apt in time to wear black. Verditer is a fine pale blue, and Prussian blue is proper for deep colours. Dutch or English pink are good yellows, which mixt with blue makes green. For reds use lake, vermillion, and red lead, which mix'd with blue makes purple, and with yellow and orange colour: Umber is a good brown; and any of these colours by adding white become paler, and are deepened with black, the colour or ground intended is first to be ground in water, till it is extremely fine, and of the consistance of treacle, to which put an equal quantity of melted size; mix them well, and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026577_0073_0FD0AD1470B24B18"/>
prime your work over with it three or four times, as smooth as possible, letting it dry between each priming. And if when 'tis dry no colour will come off on rubbing with your finger, it is fit for use. The figures are to be first painted in proper colours mixed to a due consistence with water, in which gum-arabic has been dissolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or instead of that, take quince-kernels (which are to be had at the druggists) one ounce, on which pour of boiling water four ounces, letting it stand twelve hours; then filter it through a piece of new flannel, and keep it close stopt for use. This is far preferable to any other gum for painting with water colours. The colours for this purpose ought chiefly to be transparent, and the lights left as much as possible in the paper; because white laid on, will not long retain its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The principal colours are ultramarine, Prussian blue, indigo, carmine, lake, gumboge, sapgreen, verdigrease, bisti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, umber, gall-stone, Indian-ink, &amp;c. Use your colours of such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, by tempering them with water, that they may flow free from the pencil.—The seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral objects you intend for use must be neatly cut round with scissars, or the small point of a knife; those figures must be brushed over on the back with strong gum-water, or thin paste, made by boiling flour in water: then take objects singly, and with a pair of small pliars, fix them on the place intended, being careful to let no figure seem tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and let the buildings preserve an exact up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, for which purpose some perpendicular lines may be drawn, gently with black lead on the ground; and when properly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a piece of clean bread; then proceed to varnish as follows—The room where this is to be done must be kept constantly warm; then take of the best white or seedlac varnish, which must be a little warm, kept in a glaz'd vessel, and with a large fine camel's-hair brush, go with a light, swift, and steady hand carefully over the whole work, give if possible a sufficient quantity of varnish the first stroke to cover equally, because on a repetition it is apt to become streaky and uneven, which done, the work must have time to harden, and it is enough, when by laying on your finger, it does not adhere; then varnish again, repeating this operation at least seven times, though if you varnish it twelve it will be still better. It must then stand for hardening several days, in a constant warmth; then take a flat piece of cork and tripoli mixed with water, and rub the work till it comes to a flat surface, after which let it stand three days, and repeat your polishing with fine tripoli; lastly, take some rottenstone, which by rubbing well over with the palm of your hand, the whole will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a most excellent polish. Every material for this purpose may be had ready prepared, at the colour-shops in Philadelphia and elsewhere; yet, for the satisfaction of those who chuse to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it, is subjoined the following process for making varnish.</p>
