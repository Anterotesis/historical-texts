            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE LIFE OF VOLTAIRE.</head>
                  <p>THE life of Voltaire ſhould neceſſarily be the hiſtory of the progreſs of the arts as promoted by his genius, of the power which he exerciſed over the opinions of his age, and of the long war which in his youth he declared againſt prejudice, and which he maintained to the day of his death.</p>
                  <p>When the influence of a philoſopher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends itſelf to the multitude, when it is ſudden and felt at each inſtant of his life, he is indebted for this influence to his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to his mode of obſervation, and to his conduct, as much as to his works. Every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance relating to ſuch a man promotes the ſtudy of the human mind; with which we cannot hope to become acquainted, if we do not obſerve its properties as they exiſt
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024210_0003_0FC55B0C71312F78"/>
in thoſe to whom Nature has been prodigal of her riches and her power, and if we do not ſeek in ſuch minds what they poſſeſs in common with others, and in what they are diſtinguiſhed. Man is in general indebted for his opinions, and even for his paſſions, and his character, to thoſe by whom he is ſurrounded; he derives them from the laws, the prejudices of his country, as the plant receives nutriment from the ſoil and the elements. When we contemplate the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar mind, we diſcover the power to which we are ſubject by nature, (or habit;) but not the ſecret of internal ſtrength, nor the laws of the human underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>François Marie Arouet, who by aſſuming the name of Voltaire has rendered it ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, was born at Chatenay, on the 20th of February, 1694, and was baptized at Paris, in the church of St. Andre-des-Ares, on the 22d of November in the ſame year. His exceſſive weakneſs was the cauſe of this delay, which, during life, occaſioned doubts concerning the place and time of his birth. Fontenelle, in like manner, was obliged to be privately baptized, becauſe his life was deſpaired of, from the feebleneſs of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. It is ſomewhat ſingular that theſe two men, both ſo famous in this age, whoſe lives and underſtandings were each of ſuch
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024210_0004_0FC55B1BB12C2A50"/>
long duration, ſhould mutually be born languid and feeble.</p>
                  <p>The father of M. de Voltaire exerciſed the office of treaſurer to the chamber of accounts; his mother, Marguerite d'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mart, was of a noble family of Poitou. Their ſon has been reproached for having taken the name of Voltaire: that is, for having followed a cuſtom at that time gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally practiſed by the rich citizens and young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſons, who, leaving the family name to the heir, aſſumed that of a fieif, or perhaps of a country houſe. His birth was queſtioned in numerous libels. His enemies, among men of literature, ſeemed to fear that the faſhionable world would too readily ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice its prejudices to the pleaſure found in his ſociety, and the admiration his talents inſpired, and that a man of letters ſhould be treated with too much equality. Such reproaches did him honour; malignity does not attack the birth of a man of literature, but from a ſecret conſciouſneſs, which it cannot ſtifle, that it is wholly unable to diminiſh his perſonal fame.</p>
                  <p>The fortune which M. Arouet the father enjoyed was doubly advantageous to his ſon; it procured him the advantages of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which genius never attains thoſe heights to which it might otherwiſe
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024210_0005_0FC55B1D8490F5E8"/>
arive. If we examine modern hiſtory, we ſhall find that all men of the firſt order, all thoſe whoſe works have approached per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, had not to repair the defects of education.</p>
                  <p>Nor was the advantage of being born to an independent fortune leſs ineſtimable. M. de Voltaire never felt the miſery of being obliged to abandon his liberty that he might procure ſubſiſtence; to ſubject his genius to labour, which the neceſſity of living en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced; nor to flatter the prejudices, or the paſſions, of a patron. His mind was not enſlaved by ſuch habitual fears, which not only impede invention, but impreſs the character of incertitude and feebleneſs on every effort of the imagination. His youth, undiſturbed by the doubts and fears of pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, did not expoſe him to the danger of contracting that ſervile timidity which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires the weak mind with habitual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; or that acrid, reſtleſs, and ſuſpicious irritability which is an infallible conſequence to the man of genius, when contending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that dependence to which he is by neceſſity ſubjected, and that freedom which the ſublime thoughts by which he is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied demand.</p>
                  <p>The young Arouet was ſent to the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts' college, where the ſons of the firſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024210_0006_0FC55B1F0D5A84A0"/>
nobility, except thoſe of the Janſeniſts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their education. The Janſeniſts, who were hated at court, were ſeldom ſeen among men who, being at that time oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by cuſtom to chooſe a religion which they did not underſtand, naturally adopted that which beſt could promote their temporal intereſt. The profeſſors of rhetoric, under whom he was placed, were Father Porée and Father Jay: the firſt, being a man of underſtanding, and of a good heart, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſeeds of a future greatneſs in his ſcholar; and the latter, ſtruck with the boldneſs of his opinions and the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his mind, predicted that he would become the apoſtle of deiſm in France; both of which prophecies were verified by time.</p>
                  <p>When he left college, he again found the Abbé de Châteauneuf, his god-father and the friend of his mother, an intimate at home. The Abbé was one of thoſe men who, having entered into the eccleſiaſtic eſtate from complaiſance, or from momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ambition not native to their mind, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſacrifice fortune and ſacerdotal digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the love of living at large, being unable continually to wear the muſk of hypocriſy.</p>
                  <p>The Abbé de Châteauneuf was intimate
<pb n="8"
                         facs="unknown:024210_0007_0FC55B269786B098"

with Ninon de l'Enclos, whom, for her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, her underſtanding, and her freedom of thought, he long had pardoned in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight of the ſomewhat notorious adventures her youth. The faſhionable world were pleaſed that ſhe had refuſed the invitation of her former friend, Madame de Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, who had offered to invite her to court, on condition that ſhe would become a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votee. The Abbé de Châteauneuf had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Voltaire to Ninon. Though but a boy, he already was a poet; already began to teize his Janſeniſt brother by his trifling epigrams, and to pleaſe himſelf with reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Moïſade of Rouſſeau.</p>
                  <p>Ninon had taken delight in the pupil of her friend, and had left him by will 2000 livres (about 80 guineas) to purchaſe books. Thus was he taught, by fortunate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, even in infancy and before his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was formed, to regard ſtudy and labours of the mind as pleaſing and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable employments; thus did he learn, by the ſociety of people ſuperior to vulgar opinions, that the mind of man is born free, and that he has a right to judge whatever he can comprehend; while, by a cowardly condeſcenſion to prejudice, the common courſe of education preſents nothing to childhood but the diſgraceful marks of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:024210_0008_0FC55B2D63ECDA88"/>Hypocriſy and intolerance were predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at the court of Louis the XIVth. which was much more ſeriouſly occupied in affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ruin of Janſeniſm than in relieving the ſufferings of the people. The report of his incredulity had occaſioned Catinat to loſe the confidence which was due to his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and his abilities for war. De Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dôme was reproached with occaſionally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting maſs; and the ſucceſs of the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Marlborough, and the infidel Eugene, was attributed to his want of devotion. This hypocriſy had diſguſted thoſe whom it could not corrupt; and, in averſion to the auſterities of Verſailles, the moſt faſhionable ſocieties of Paris affected to carry their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and the love of pleaſure even to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Abbé de Châteauneuf introduced the young Voltaire to theſe ſocieties, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the company of the Duke de Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Marquis de la Fare, the Abbé Servien, the Abbé de Chaulieu, and the Abbé Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; who were often joined by the Prince de Conti, and the grand Prior de Vendôme.</p>
                  <p>M. Arouet imagined his ſon was ruined, when he was told that he wrote poetry and frequented the ſociety of people of faſhion. He wiſhed to make him a judge, and ſaw him employed on a tragedy. This family
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024210_0009_0FC55B349B451FF8"/>
quarrel ended by ſending the young Voltaire to the Marquis de Châuteauneuf, the French ambaſſador in Holland.</p>
                  <p>His exile was not of long duration. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame du Noyer, who had fled thither with her two daughters rather to avoid her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band than from zeal for the proteſtant reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, was then at the Hague, where ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by intrigues and libels, and proved from her conduct that ſhe did not go thither in ſearch of liberty of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>M. de Voltaire became enamoured of one of her daughters; and the mother, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the only advantage ſhe could gain from his attachment was that of making it public, carried her complaints to the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, who forbade his young dependent to continue his viſits to Mademoiſelle du Noyer; and ſent him back to his family for having diſobeyed his orders.</p>
                  <p>Madame du Noyer failed not to print this ſtory with the Letters of the young Arouet to her daughter, hoping that this already well known name would promote the ſale of her book; and vaunted of her maternal ſeverity and delicacy in the very libel in which ſhe proclaimed her daughter's diſhonour.</p>
                  <p>The fine feelings of the author of Zaïre and Tancrede are not diſcoverable in theſe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024210_0010_0FC55B37944095E8"/>
letters. The ſenſations of impaſſioned youth are ſtrong, but their gradations it is unable to diſtinguiſh; it neither can ſelect thoſe ſtrong and rapid traits which characterize paſſion, nor find terms which paint its feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the imagination, and infuſe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul of the reader; while devoured by love, the moſt ſincere and the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it is apparently dull, cold, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant. The talent of painting the paſſions for the theatre appears to be one of the laſt which diſcovers itſelf in poets. Racine had given no tokens of it either in Les Frère<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not only, muſt the paſſions have been felt before they can be deſcribed, but their emotions and effects muſt have been remarked when they have ceaſed to lord it over the mind, and when they exiſt only in the recollection. The heart is ſufficient to make us ſenſible of their exiſtence; but, to expreſs them with energy and truth, the ſoul muſt hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The youth, when returned to Paris, ſoon forgot his love; but he did not forget to uſe every effortt hat he might wreſt a young and eſtimable woman, who was natively virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, from a corrupt and intriguing mother.

He employed the zeal of Proſelytiſm<note n="*" place="bottom">Il employa le zèle du Proſélitiſme; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

The project failed, but Voltaire had afterward the good fortune to be of ſervice to Mademoiſelle du Noyer, when ſhe had married the Baron de Vinterfeld.</p>
                  <p>His father, however, finding him perſiſt in writing poetry, and living at large, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade him his houſe. The moſt ſubmiſſive letters made no impreſſion on him; the ſon even aſked permiſſion to go to America, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that before his departure he might but be permitted to kneel at his feet; but there was no choice, he muſt determine not to depart for America, but to bind himſelf to an attorney. He did not here remain long; M. de Caumartin, the friend of M. Arouet, pitied the fate of his ſon, and requeſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to take him to St. Ange; where, removed from thoſe ſocieties which alarmed paternal affection, he might reflect on, and make choice of a profeſſion. Here he met with Caumartin, the elder, a reſpectable old man, who was paſſionately fond of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the IVth, and Sully, at that time too much forgotten by the nation. Caumartin
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024210_0012_0FC55B3AFA3CBCB8"/>
had been intimate with the beſt informed men of the reign of Louis the XIVth, and was acquainted with the moſt ſecret anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, ſuch as they really happened. Theſe he took a pleaſure to recount, and Voltaire returned from St. Ange, occupied by the project of writing an epic poem, of which Henry the IVth, ſhould be the hero, and ardently deſirous of ſtudying the Hiſtory of France. To this journey are we indebted for the Henriade, and the age of Louis XIV.</p>
                  <p>The death of this monarch was recent; the people, of whom he long had been the idol, the very people who had pardoned his profuſion, his wars, and his deſpotiſm, and had applauded his perſecution of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, inſulted his memory by teſtifying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent joy. A bull, obtained from Rome againſt a book of devotion, had occaſioned the Pariſians to forget that glory of which they ſo long had been enamoured. Satires on the memory of Louis the Great were as numerous as eulogies had been during his life. Voltaire being accuſed of having written one of theſe ſatires, was ſent to the baſtile. The poem ended with the following line:
<q>J'ai vu c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Voltaire was then upwards of two and twen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024210_0013_0FC55B4234958858"/>
and the police took his conformity of age to be proof ſufficient to deprive him of his liberty.</p>
                  <p>It was in the baſtile that the young poet ſketched his poem of the League, corrected his tragedy of Oedipus, which he had begun long before, and wrote ſome merry verſes on the misfortune of being there a priſoner. The regent Duke of Orleans, being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his innocence, reſtored him to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and granted him a recompenſe.</p>
                  <p>"I thank your royal highneſs," ſaid Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, "for having provided me with food; but I hope you will not, hereafter, trouble yourſelf concerning my lodging."</p>
                  <p>The tragedy of Oedipus was performed in 1718. The author had hitherto been known only by his fugitive pieces, by ſome epiſtles which breathed the ſpirit of Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu, but written more correctly, and by an ode which had vainly contended for the prize beſtowed by the French academy; to this a ridiculous piece written by the Abbé du Jarri had been preferred. The theme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the academy was the decoration of the altar of Notre Dame; for Louis the XIVth, after having reigned ſeventy years, recollected it was time to perform the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Louis the XIIIth. Thus was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the firſt ſerious poem, written by Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024210_0014_0FC55B4AF79FA790"/>
devotion. Poſſeſſed of native and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring taſte, he would not mingle the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love with a tale ſo horrid as that of Oedipus; and had been daring enough to preſent his piece to the theatre without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paid this tribute to cuſtom. But it was rejected. The aſſembled comedians took it amiſs that the author ſhould dare to diſpute their judgment. "The young man well deſerves," ſaid Dufreſne, "as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for his pride, that his tragedy ſhould be played with the long vile ſcene which he has tranſlated from Sophocles."</p>
                  <p>Voltaire was obliged to cede, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert a whole epiſode of love. The piece was applauded, though in deſpight of the epiſode; and the long vile ſcene from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles inſured its ſucceſs. La Motto, who was at that time the firſt among men of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſaid in his approbation that his tragedy gave promiſe of a worthy ſuceſſor to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille and Racine; and the homage thus rendered by a rival, whoſe fame was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and who had reaſon to fear he might ſee himſelf ſurpaſſed, muſt forever do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the character of La Motte.</p>
                  <p>But Voltaire, proclaimed a man of genius and a philoſopher to a croud of inferior au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and fanatics of all ſects, even then gained a combination of enemies, whom the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024210_0015_0FC55B4BF92E9C60"/>
riſing generations of ſixty years have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to ſupply, and who often have moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his long and glorious career. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing celebrated lines—
<q>
                        <l>Nos Prêtres ne ſont pas ce qu'un vain peuple penſe;</l>

                     </q>
were the firſt ſignal of a war, which not even the death of Voltaire could extinguiſh.</p>
                  <p>At one of the repreſentations of Oedipus, Voltaire appeared on the ſtage, bearing up the train of the high prieſt. The Marchioneſs de Villars aſked who was that young man who wiſhed the piece might be condemned; ſhe was told it was the author. This thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs act, which ſpoke a man ſo ſuperior to the trifling anxieties of ſelf-love, made the marchioneſs deſirous of his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Voltaire, being admitted her viſitor, conceived a paſſion for her, the firſt, and the moſt ſerious he ever felt, He was unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; and was for a conſiderable time diverted from ſtudy, which had already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary to his exiſtence. He never, afterwards, mentioned this ſubject but with a ſenſation of regret, and almoſt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:024210_0016_0FC55B4D7AB25E00"/>Having freed himſelf from his paſſion, he continued the Henriade; and wrote the tragedy of Artémire. An actreſs, whom he had formed, and who was at once his miſtreſs and his pupil, played the principal character. The public, who had done juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to Oedipus, was (to ſay the leaſt) ſevere to Artémire. This is a common conſequence of ſucceſs; nor is ſecret averſion for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſuperiority the only cauſe, tho' this averſion has the art to profit by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural feeling which renders us more difficult to be pleaſed in proportion as we have more to hope.</p>
                  <p>This tragedy was of no other value to Voltaire than that of obtaining permiſſion for him to return to Paris, whence he had been baniſhed by his intimacy with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies of the regent, and among others with the Duke de Richelieu and the famous Baron de Gortz. Thus did this ambitious man, whoſe vaſt projects included all Europe, and threatened to overturn its governments, chooſe a young poet for his friend and almoſt for his confident. Men of genius ſeek for, and at once know each other; they have a common language, which they alone can ſpeak and underſtand.</p>
                  <p>In 1722, Voltaire accompanied Madame de Rupelmonde into Holland. He was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024210_0017_0FC55B55E52C9DE8"/>
at Bruſſels, of being acquainted with Rouſſeau, whoſe misfortunes he pitied, and whoſe poetic talent he eſteemed. The love of his art was too powerful for that juſt contempt which he ought to have conceived for the character of Rouſſeau. Voltaire conſulted him on his Poem on the League; and read his Epiſtle to Urania to him, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for Madame de Rupelmonde. This poem was the firſt monument of his freedom of thinking, and of his talent of treating on moral and metaphyſical ſubjects in verſe, and of rendering them popular.</p>
                  <p>Rouſſeau, on his part, read an Ode ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to Poſterity, which Voltaire, as it is pretended, then told him would never arrive at the place to which it was addreſſed. He likewiſe read the Judgment of Pluto, which was as quickly forgotten as the ode. The two poets parted irreconcileable foes. Rouſſeau violently attacked Voltaire, who continued patiently to ſuffer during fifteen years. It is aſtoniſhing to think that the author of ſo many licentious epigrams, in which the clergy were continually made the ſubject of ridicule and opprobium, ſhould ſeriouſly aſſign the thoughtleſs behaviour of Voltaire during maſs and his Epiſtle to Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia as the cauſe of his hatred. But Rouſſeau had aſſumed the maſk of devotion, which
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024210_0018_0FC55B60C6D1BA40"/>
was then an honourable aſylum for ſuch as had ſuffered in the world's opinion: a ſafe and commodious aſylum which philoſophy, among the other evils of which it is accuſed, has unfortunately, for hypocrites, eternally cloſed.</p>
                  <p>In 1724, Voltaire preſented the world with Mariamne, which was but Artémire under new names, but with a leſs compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and leſs romantic fable. It was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the very ſtyle of Racine, and was forty times performed. In his preface, the author oppoſed the opinion of La Motte, who, poſſeſſed of much underſtanding and reaſon, but little ſenſible of the charms of harmony, diſcovered no other merit in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification than that of difficulties overcome; nor any thing more than a formal cuſtom, in poetry, invented to eaſe the memory, and to which habit alone had attributed charms. In his letters, printed at the end of Oedipus, he had before combated the opinions of the ſame poet, who regarded the obſervance of the three Unities as another prejudice.</p>
                  <p>We ought to think ourſelves obliged to thoſe who, like La Motte, dare to oppoſe common and received opinions. In order to defend ancient rules, they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be examined; and if received opinions, on examination, be found true, we enjoy
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024210_0019_0FC55B628D1A62A8"/>
the advantage of believing that from reaſon to which we had previouſly given our aſſent from habit; if falſe, the world is then freed from an error.</p>
                  <p>It is no uncommon thing, however, for men to be angry at thoſe who oblige them to ſcrutinize what had been admitted upon truſt. The minds, which like that of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne, quietly ſlumber on the pillow of ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, are not common; and ſtill leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are thoſe who are tormented by the deſire of diſcovering truth. The vulgar love to believe without proof; and to cheriſh their ſecurity in blind faith, as a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to their eaſe and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time, the Henriade ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared under the name of the League: an imperfect copy, ſtolen from the author, was clandeſtinely printed, in which there were not only parts omitted, but ſome vacancies were ſupplied.</p>
                  <p>Thus France was at laſt poſſeſſed of an Epic Poem. It muſt be regretted, no doubt, that Voltaire, the fables of whoſe tragedies are ſo full of action, who has made the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſpeak a language ſo natural and ſo true, and who could paint them ſo effectually as well by analizing their ſentiments as by their ſudden ebullitions, ſhould not have diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Henriade thoſe talents which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024210_0020_0FC55B6426439BC8"/>
before were combined in the ſame man to ſo great a degree. Yet, a ſubject ſo well known and ſo recent gave but little room for the imagination of the poet. The gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and perſecuting ſpirit of fanaticiſm, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing itſelf on ſubaltern characters, could excite little more than horror. The chiefs of the league were animated by an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hypocriſy debaſed. The hero of the poem, gallant, brave, and humane, but continually ſubject to misfortune which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted on him alone, could intereſt only by his courage and his clemency. Nor was it poſſible that the unnatural converſion of Henry the IVth ſhould form an heroic ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe.</p>
                  <p>But though the Henriade in pathos, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and action, be inferior to thoſe epic poems which were then in poſſeſſion of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal admiration, yet by how many new beauties was this inferiority compenſated? Never was philoſophy, ſo profound and ſo true, embelliſhed by verſes more ſublime or more affecting. What other poem pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to us characters drawn with greater ſtrength and dignity, and without offence to hiſtorical facts? What other contains mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality more pure, humanity more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, or is more free from the errors of prejudice and vulgar paſſion? Whether the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024210_0021_0FC55B72A9F53DD0"/>
poet cauſes his characters to act or ſpeak, whether he paints the crimes of fanaticiſm, or the charms and the dangers of love, whether he tranſports his hearer to the field of battle, or into that heaven which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf created, he is every where a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and is every where deeply intent on promoting the true intereſts of the human race. In the very palace of fiction, we behold truth ſublimely riſe, and always painted in the moſt ſplendid and pureſt colours.</p>
                  <p>Of all epic poems the Henriade alone has a moral purport; not that it can be ſaid to be the devellopement of one ſingle truth, which is a pedantic idea and to which a poet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubject himſelf, but becauſe it breathes throughout a deteſtation of war and fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, and a ſpirit of toleration and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Each poem neceſſarily wears the complexion of the age in which it took birth; and the birth of the Henriade was in the age of reaſon. Hence, the greater the progreſs of reaſon among mankind the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will be their admiration of this poem.</p>
                  <p>The Henriade may be compared to the Aeneid: both bear the ſtamp of genius in whatever depended on the poet, and the defects of both are in the choice of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which was mutually dictated by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſpirit. Virgil, however, intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024210_0022_0FC55B76B7862C20"/>
to flatter Roman pride; but Voltaire had the more noble motive of preſerving the French from fanaticiſm, by a recapitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the crimes into which their anceſtors had been hurried.</p>
                  <p>The Henriade, Oedipus, and Mariamne had placed Voltaire much above his cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries; and ſeemed to ſecure a life of fame, when his repoſe was troubled by a fatal accident. He had returned a ſatyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal anſwer to ſome contemptuous words which had been ſpoken by a courtier, who revenged himſelf by cauſing Voltaire to be inſulted by his ſervants without endangering his perſonal ſafety. The outrage was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at the gate of the Hotel de Sully, where he had dined; nor did the Duke de Sully deign to ſhow any reſentment; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no doubt, perſuaded that the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the Franks had preſerved the right of life and death over the Gauls. Juſtice remained mute; the parliament of Paris, which had cauſed far leſs miſdemeanours to be puniſhed when committed againſt one of its own ſubalterns, imagined nothing was due to an undignified citizen, although the greateſt man of literature the nation poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and kept ſilence.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire was deſirous of taking thoſe means to revenge offended honour which
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024210_0023_0FC55B7834E1AC88"/>
the manners of modern nations have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed, but which their laws have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. The Baſtile, and, at the end of ſix months, an order to quit Paris were the puniſhment of his firſt ſtep. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal de Fleury had not ſo much policy as even to denote the ſlighteſt mark of diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction againſt the aggreſſor. Thus when men are unprotected by the laws they are puniſhed by arbitrary power for ſeeking that revenge, which the want of protection ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders legal, and which is preſcribed as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the principles of honour. We venture to believe that the rights of man will be more reſpected in our times, that the laws will not remain impotent from any ridiculous prejudice of birth, and that when any quarrel ſhall happen between two citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens no miniſter will deprive him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the firſt offence of his freedom.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire made a ſecret journey to Paris, but to no effect. He there met with more than one adverſary, who diſpoſed at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of judicial power and miniſterial au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and who could ſafely effect his ruin. He buried himſelf in retirement, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained longer to ſeek revenge; or, rather, revenged himſelf by overwhelming his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy with the weight of his increaſing fame, and forcing him to hear the name which he
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024210_0024_0FC55B79BADFC318"/>
wiſhed to degrade inceſſantly repeated with acclamation throughout all Europe.</p>
                  <p>England was his place of refuge. Newton was no more; but his ſpirit was infuſed into his countrymen, whom he had taught to truſt to experiment, and calculation only in the ſtudy of nature. Locke, whoſe death was likewiſe recent, had been the firſt to give the theory of the human underſtanding founded on expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to ſhow the path which may ſafely be followed in metaphyſical purſuits. The philoſophy of Shafteſbury, commented on by Bolingbroke, and embelliſhed by the verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pope, had given birth in England to that deiſm which announced morality, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on motives ſuch as might affect great minds without offence to reaſon.</p>
                  <p>In France, mean time, the men of moſt underſtanding were labouring to ſubſtitute in our ſchools the hypotheſis of Des Cartes, for the abſurdities of ſcholaſtic philoſophy. Any theſis, in which either the ſyſtem of Copernicus or that of the Vortices was maintained, was a victory over prejudice. Innate ideas, in the eyes of the devout, were become almoſt an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith; though they had at firſt been ſuppoſed heretical. Malebranche, whom men imagined they underſtood, was the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in faſhion. He was ſuppoſed a free-think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who allowed himſelf to regard the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the five propoſitions, in the unintelligible book of Janſenius, as a thing in which the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024210_0025_0FC55B89FA249CF0"/>
of the human race was not concerned, or who had the temerity to read Bayle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the permiſſion of a doctor in divinity.</p>
                  <p>This contraſt could not but excite the enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm of a man, who, like Voltaire, had from his infancy ſhaken off prejudice. The example of England ſhowed him that truth was not formed to remain in ſecret among a few phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and men of the world, the pupils of theſe philoſophers; who laughed with them at thoſe errors of which the people are the victims, but became themſelves the defenders of error, when their office or their rank made it their intereſt, ſuppoſed or real, and were ready to proſcribe or even to perſecute their preceptors, ſhould they venture to ſpeak what they themſelves privately believed.</p>
                  <p>From this moment, Voltaire felt himſelf called to be the deſtroyer of prejudice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind, of which his country was the ſlave. He felt the poſſibility of ſucceeding by a happy mixture of boldneſs and pliabilty, by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when to recede and when to advance, by artfully and alternately employing reaſon, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule, the charms of poetry, and theatrical ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and by ſimplifying truth ſo as to render it popular, amiable, and faſhionable, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to frivolity. This good project, of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelf, by the force of his own genius, the benefactor of a whole nation, whence he meant to baniſh error, ſired the mind of Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, and inſpired him with fortitude. He ſwore to this to conſecrate his life; and he
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024210_0026_0FC55B8DC165F0D0"/>
kept his vow. The tragedy of Brutus was the firſt fruits of his journey to England.</p>
                  <p>The French theatre had not, ſince Cinna, breathed the haughty accents of freedom; and they had, there, been ſmothered by thoſe of revenge. In Brutus, the ſtrength of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille was diſcovered with additional pomp and ſplendor, combined with that ſimplicity which Corneille wanted, and the uniform elegance of Racine. Never were the rights of an oppreſſed people diſplayed with greater power, eloquence and even preciſion, than in the ſecond ſcene of Brutus. The fifth act is equally remarkable for its pathos. The poet has been reproached for having made love a part of a ſubject ſo awful and terrible, and particularly love, which is deficient in intereſt; but, had the motive of Titus been any other than love, he would have been debaſed, the ſeverity of Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus would not then have rent the hearts of the ſpectators; and, had love been rendered too pathetic, it would have been to be feared that love would have deſtroyed the cauſe of liberty. It was after this piece had been acted that Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenelle told Voltaire "He did not think his genius proper for tragedy, and that his ſtyle was too bold, pompous, and ſplendid."—"If ſo," replied Voltaire, "I will go and read your paſtorals."</p>
                  <p>He ſuppoſed, at this time, he might aſpire to a place in the French academy; and he might well have been thought modeſt to have
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024210_0027_0FC55B8F78D91DA8"/>
waited ſo long. But he had not ſo much as the honour of dividing the votes of the acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micians. The fat De Boſe pronounced in a dictatorial tone, that Voltaire ſhould never be one of their dignified members.</p>
                  <p>This De Boſe, whoſe name is now forgotten, was one of theſe men, who, with little mind, and not too much knowledge, obtain admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among men of rank and power, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed preciſely becauſe they have neither the wit to inſpire fear, nor to humble the ſelf-love of thoſe who ſeek the reputation of patroniſing men of letters. De Boſe was become a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of importance. He exerciſed the office of inſpector of new publications; which is an uſurpation on the part of the magiſtrate, over men of letters, to whom the avidity of the rich and the powerful have left no employments but thoſe whoſe execution requires the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowledge and talents.</p>
                  <p>After Brutus, Voltaire wrote the Death of Caeſar; a ſubject which had previouſly been choſen by Shakſpere, ſome ſcenes of whom he imitated and embelliſhed. The tragedy was not played till ſeveral years had elapſed, and then in a college; he durſt not riſk a piece on the ſtage, deſtitute of love and of women, and which was likewiſe a tragedy in three acts: for it is not the moſt trifling innovations which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the leaſt clamour among the enemies of novelty; little things neceſſarily impreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on little minds. Still, however, a bold,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024210_0028_0FC55B912571C8F0"/>
noble, and figurative, yet natural, ſtyle, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments worthy of the conqueror of the freeſt people on earth, and that force and grandeur of character, and deep thought which pervade the language of theſe laſt Romans, could not but be felt by ſpectators capable of diſcovering ſuch merit, and men whoſe hearts and minds were related to theſe great perſonages, as well as by thoſe who might love hiſtory, and ſuch young minds as, in the courſe of education, had lately been occupied by ſimilar objects.</p>
                  <p>Hiſtorical tragedies, ſuch as Cinna, the death of Pompey, Brutus, Rome Preſerved, and the Triumvirate, of Voltaire, cannot be equally intereſting with the Cid, Iphigene, Zaïre, or Merope. The mild and tender paſſions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſplay themſelves in conformity with hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical fact; incidents cannot be ſo ſelected and diſpoſed as to produce theatrical effect with equal ſucceſs; the poet has not the ſame power over the characters; the general inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which is that of a people, or of a ſtate rather than of an individual, is rendered leſs forcible, becauſe it is dependent on ſentiments leſs energetic.</p>
                  <p>But, far from ſtigmatiſing this ſpecies of writing, as the coldeſt and moſt unfavourable to dramatic genius, it ought to be encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; becauſe it opens a vaſt field for the poet, in which he may unfold all the ſublime truths of politics; becauſe it diſplays grand hiſtorical pictures; and becauſe, by theſe means, the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024210_0029_0FC55B993AB3B9A8"/>
ſoul may moſt effectually be formed and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. We, doubtleſs, ought to place theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the firſt of poems, which, like Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met and Alzire, are at once extenſive, and abounding with pathos and terror. But theſe are uncommon ſubjects, and require the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of talents, which no poet but Voltaire has hitherto poſſeſſed.</p>
                  <p>The Death of Caeſar was not allowed to be printed: the republican ſentiments it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were attributed as crimes to the author. This was a ridiculous imputation; each cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſpoke its own language; and Brutus was not more the hero than Caeſar; the poet, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hiſtorical ſubject, drew his portraits af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hiſtory, with ſtrict impartiality. But, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of the Cardinal de Fleury, which was at once tyrannical and puſillanimous, the language of ſlavery alone could appear to be innocent.</p>
                  <p>Who could, at preſent, ſuppoſe that the eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy on the death of Mademoiſelle le Couvreur could have been made a ſubject of ſerious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and have obliged Voltaire to quit the metropolis, where he knew that abſence would fortunately cauſe all things to be forgotten, and even the frenzy of perſecution?</p>
                  <p>The theatre is truly a uſeful inſtitution, at which even indolent and frivolous youth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſomething of the habit of feeling and of thinking, while moral ideas are not totally loſt to their minds, and the pleaſures of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024210_0030_0FC55BA34F033F18"/>
are ſtill felt to exiſt. The ſenſations which the repreſentation of a tragedy excite, purify the ſoul, and raiſe it from that apathy and egotiſm which are the maladies to which the diſſipated are, in the nature of things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Such exhibitions form a kind of connexion between the two claſſes of men who do, and men who do not, think. They ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the auſterity of the one; and, in the other, temper that want of feeling which is the child of thoughtleſſneſs and pride. It is a ſingular fatality that in a country, in which the drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic art has been carried to the higheſt degree of perfection, the actors, to whom the public are indebted for the nobleſt of their pleaſures, ſhould be condemned by religion, and ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the moſt ridiculous of prejudices.</p>
                  <p>Theſe prejudices Voltaire hardily oppoſed. Indignant to behold an actreſs, who had long been the object of enthuſiaſtic applauſe, after being carried off by a ſudden and cruel death deprived of the rites of burial, becauſe in a ſtate of excommunication, he loudly reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a frivolous nation which with cowardice bent the neck under ſo ſhameful a yoke, and the puſillanimity of thoſe people in power who peaceably ſuffered the memory of her whom they had ſo much admired to be thus inſulted. Though nations are ſlow to correct themſelves, they ſtill ſuffer themſelves to be told of their faults with patience. But the prieſts, whom the parliaments would ſuffer to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024210_0031_0FC55BA54B73F9F0"/>
none but wizards and players, were irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to ſee a poet dare to diſpute the half of their empire, and the people in power could not pardon him for having proclaimed their unworthy cowardice.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire felt that ſome great theatrical ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs could alone ſecure him the hearts of the public, and ſhield him from the attacks of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nataciſm. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a country, in which no popular power exiſts, each claſs has ſome point at which to rally and form itſelf into a ſpecies of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. A dramatic author is under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe ſocieties who reſort to the theatre for amuſement. The public, by applauding alluſions, flatter or offend the vanity of men in office, diſcourage or re-animate their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, and cannot for this reaſon be openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Voltaire, therefore, preſented his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphile, which did not effect his purpoſe; but, far from being diſcouraged by want of ſucceſs, and delighted with the ſubject of Zaïre, he fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that tragedy in eighteen days, and it made its appearance on the ſtage four months after Euriphile.</p>
                  <p>Its ſucceſs ſurpaſſed his hopes. This was the firſt piece in which, forſaking the tract of Corneille and Racine, he diſcovered art, ſtyle, and talents entirely his own. Never did love more true or more impaſſioned draw tears more ſweet; never did poet before ſo depict the fury of jealouſy in a mind ſo ſimple, ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate, and ſo generous. We love Oroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024210_0032_0FC55BA71E8AFC28"/>
at the very moment he makes us ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He ſacrifices Zaïre, the affecting, the lovely, the virtuous Zaïre, yet we cannot hate him. And even, were it poſſible to forget Oroſmanes and Zaïre, how awful is irreligion in the perſon of the aged Luſignan? How no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the ſpirit of fanaticiſm, which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Nareſtam breathe? With what art has the poet painted the Chriſtians whoſe interference diſturb ſo ſweet an union, a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pious woman who has ſacrificed her life and her love to her God, while the man who believes not in Chriſtianity weeps for Zaïre, whoſe mind is diſtracted by filial affection, and who is the willing victim of a ſuperſtitious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, which forbids her to love a man of a different ſect. This is a maſter-piece of art. Whoever does not believe in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſcovers in Athalia nothing but the ſchool of bigotry, falſehood, and murder; but to all ſects, and in all countries, Zaïre is the tragedy of the feeling and the innocent heart.</p>
                  <p>This tragedy was followed by that of Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laide de Gueſclin, which had likewiſe love for its ſubject, and in which, as in Zaïre, French heroes and French hiſtory were recited in beautiful poetry: ſo as to increaſe the intereſt. But it was the patriotiſm of a citizen who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the recollection of reſpected names and great events, and not the patriotiſm of the anti-chamber, which has ſince been ſo applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the French theatre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="unknown:024210_0033_0FC55BAE2B81B200"/>Adelaide failed of ſucceſs. A wit, when Mariamne was acting, prevented it being heard to the end, by calling from the pit, The queen drinks. Another occaſioned Adelaide to be condemned by anſwering Couſſi, couſſi<note n="*" place="bottom">So, ſo.</note>, to the noble and affecting queſtion of Vendôme, Es tu content Couci<note n="†" place="bottom">Art thou ſatisfied, Couci?</note>?</p>
                  <p>This ſame piece was again acted under the title of the Duke de Foix, after having been corrected, not in conformity to the judgment of the author but of his critics, and was more ſucceſsful. But when, long after, the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher's three blows of the hammer had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowingly taught the audience not to hiſs when the cannon was fired<note n="‡" place="bottom">The text is, "Lorſque les trois coups de marteau du philoſophe, ſans le ſavoir, eurent appris qu'on ne ſifflerait plus le coup de canon d' Adelaide. <hi>&amp;c."</hi> The tranſlator imagines there is an illuſion here to ſome (perhaps well known) paſſage or incident, of which he thinks it his duty ingenuouſly to confeſs his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> in Adelaide, at a time when the play was again acted in deſpight of Voltaire, who had leſs recollection of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his piece than of the wounds which criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm had inflicted, it met with the moſt unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed applauſe. The character of Vendôme, as amorous as that of Oroſmanes, was then felt in all its force. The one, jealous in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of an imperious temper, the other, from an exceſs of love; the firſt, tyrannical from native impetuoſity and pride, and the ſecond,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024210_0034_0FC55BB36B731F88"/>
from the unfortunate habits attending on deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic power. Tender and diſintereſted in his affection, Oroſmanes renders himſelf guilty during that momentary frenzy into which he is hurried by excuſable error, and puniſhes by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing himſelf. Vendôme, more perſonal and rather the ſlave of his paſſion than of his miſtreſs, protects his crime with a more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil fury, but expiates it by his remorſe and the ſacrifice of his love. The one exhibits thoſe exceſſes and ſufferings into which the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of deſpair plunges the generous ſoul; and the other, the power of repentant virtue over the ſtrong mind, which had previouſly abandoned itſelf to paſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid that the ſucceſs of Adelaide was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by the Temple of Taſte, in which charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work Voltaire had paſſed ſentence on the writers of the paſt age, and even on ſome of his cotemporaries. Time has confirmed all his deciſions, which each then appeared ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In obſerving ſuch literary intolerance, the neceſſity, under which every writer labours who wiſhes to live in peace, of reſpecting opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions already formed of the merit of an orator or a poet, and the fury with which the public purſues thoſe who dare, even on the moſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubjects, to think differently from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we ſhould be tempted to imagine that man is intolerant by Nature. Wit, reaſon, and genius cannot always guard us againſt this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. There are few men who have not ſome ſecret idols, the worſhip of which they cannot calmly ſee deſtroyed.</p>

                     <pb n="36" facs="unknown:024210_0035_0FC55BBB1C5D5658"/>Pride and envy is frequently the origin of this ſenſation. The writer who, criticiſing thoſe whom we admire, aſſumes an air of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over them and conſequently over our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we regard as one that affects an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pre-eminence. We fear, while pulling down the ſtatue of the man who is no more, he means to ſubſtitute that of a living favourite, whoſe fame fails not to afflict mediocrity. But when ſtrong minds yield to this kind of into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerance, this temporary and excuſable weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the offspring of indolence and habit, they ſoon again cede to the force of truth, and are neither guilty of injuſtice nor perſecution.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire had, in his retirement, conceived the happy plan of bringing his nation acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the philoſophy, the literature, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the ſects of England; to effect which, he wrote his Letters on the Engliſh Nation. Newton, whoſe philoſophic opinions, whoſe ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of the earth, and whoſe optical experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſcarcely known in France; Locke whoſe Eſſay on the Human Underſtanding, tranſlated into French, had only been read by a few philoſophers; Bacon, the extent of whoſe fame was that he had been lord chancellor; Shakſpere whoſe genius and groſs errors form a phenomenon in the hiſtory of literature; Congreve, Wicherly, Addiſon, and Pope, whoſe names were almoſt unknown even by our men of letters; the bigoted Quakers, who, without being perſecutors, were fanatics in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024210_0036_0FC55BBC8207C680"/>
yet the moſt rational of Chriſtians in their creed and in their morals, ridiculous in the eyes of the world, for having carried two virtues to exceſs, the love of peace and the love of equality; the other ſects by which En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland was divided; the influence which a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſpirit of freedom had there obtained over literature, philoſophy, arts, opinions, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and the practice of inoculation which had been examined without prejudice, and met with few impediments, notwithſtanding the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and the innovation of the practice: ſuch were the principal ſubjects of his work.</p>
                  <p>Fontenelle was the firſt who made reaſon and philoſophy ſpeak an agreeable and inviting language: he had the art to mingle reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſage, delicate, and frequently profound, with the ſciences. In the Letters of Voltaire we diſcover the merit of Fontenelle, with more taſte, ſimplicity, boldneſs, and gaiety. No rooted attachment to the errors of Des Cartes interfered, to ſpread a ſhadow over, and to disfigure, truth. He poſſeſſed the logic and pleaſantry of the Lettres Provinciales<note n="*" place="bottom">By Paſcal.</note>, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed them on greater ſubjects; nor were they injured by a varniſh of monkiſh devotion.</p>
                  <p>This work was the aera of a revolution in France; it gave riſe to a taſte for philoſophy, and Engliſh literature; it intereſted us in the manners, policy, and commercial knowledge of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024210_0037_0FC55BBE608AC3C8"/>
that nation; and it brought us acquainted with the Engliſh language. A puerile partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity afterward took place of former indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and, by a remarkable ſingularity, Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire had the glory of combating it, and of diminiſhing its influence. He had taught us to feel the merit of Shakſpere, and to regard his works as a mine, whence treaſures might be dug by our poets; and, when a ridiculous enthuſiaſm preſented this eloquent, but wild and capricious poet, as a model to a nation poſſeſſed of Racine and Voltaire, and wiſhed us to conſider his canvaſs, overcharged with abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and groſs caricature, as the energetic and true pictures of nature, Voltaire defended the cauſe of taſte and reaſon. He had firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt the too great timitidy of our theatre, and was afterward obliged to exclaim againſt our inclination to imitate the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous barbarity of the Engliſh ſtage.</p>
                  <p>The publication of theſe letters excited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, the bitterneſs of which, to read them at preſent, could ſcarcely be conceived: but innate ideas were oppoſed in them, and our doctors of that day believed, if there were no innate ideas, there would be no ſufficiently marked characters to diſtinguiſh between the ſouls of men and of brutes. Beſides, it was there maintained, after Locke, that there was no ſtrict proof that God had not the power, if he had the will, to impart to matter the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of thinking. This was to infringe on the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024210_0038_0FC55BCCC3A65768"/>
privilege of the divines, who pretended to know accurately and exactly, they and they alone, all that God has thought, and all that he could do, or has done, ſince, and even before, the beginning of the world.</p>
                  <p>In fine, Voltaire criticiſed ſome paſſages of the thoughts of Paſcal: a work which the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, in their own deſpite, were obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as much as the works of St. Auguſtin. It gave ſcandalous offence to ſee a poet, nay more, a layman, dare to ſit in judgment on Paſcal. It appeared to be an attack on the only defender of the Chriſtian religion, who, among the faſhionable world, had the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being a great man. It was to attack religion itſelf: and how much would the proofs of religion be weakened, ſhould the mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, Paſcal, who had openly devoted himſelf to its defence, be convicted of having often reaſoned ill.</p>
                  <p>The clergy demanded that the Letters on the Engliſh Nation ſhould be ſuppreſſed; and they were ſo, by an arret of council. Theſe arrets were given, without examination, as a kind of retribution, for the ſubſidy which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment obtained from the aſſemblies of the clergy; and as a reward for the facility with which they were granted. Miniſters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that the intereſt of the ſecular power was not to ſupport, but to ſuffer the progreſs of reaſon to deſtroy, that empire of the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood which has been ſo long and ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024210_0039_0FC55BD096A0FFD0"/>
abuſed; and that it is not good poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to purchaſe peace of an enemy, by ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our defenders.</p>
                  <p>The parliament burnt the book, according to a cuſtom formerly invented by Tiberius, and rendered ridiculous ſince the invention of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But there are certain people for whom the experience of three ages are neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can begin to perceive abſurdity.</p>
                  <p>So much perſecution, exerciſed at the very time when the miracles of the Abbé Paris and thoſe of Father Girard were acting, loaded the two perſecuting parties with ridicule and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrium. It was natural that they ſhould unite againſt a man who daringly preached reaſon; and they went ſo far as to order informations to be iſſued againſt the author of the Letters. The keeper of the ſeals baniſhed Voltaire, who, being at that time abſent, received early infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and avoided the people ſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to the place of his exile; rather chooſing to combat at a diſtance, and where he could be in ſafety. His friends proved that he had not forfeited his promiſe, not to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his Letters in France; and that they had made their appearance from the treachery of a book-binder. Fortunately, the keeper of the ſeals had more zeal for his authority than for religion, and was much more of a miniſter than of a devotee. The ſtorm was huſhed, and Voltaire had permiſſion to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This calm was but of momentary duration.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024210_0040_0FC55BD177CD6298"/>
The epiſtle to Urania, which, till then, had been kept in ſecret, was printed; and Voltaire, to eſcape a new perſecution, was obliged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow and attribute it to the Abbé de Chaulieu, who had been dead ſeveral years. The impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation did the abbé honour as a poet, without injuring his fame as a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>The neceſſity of falſehood, in diſavowing a work, is an act of extremity, alike repugnant to conſcience and to dignity of character; but the crime is in the injuſtice of thoſe men who render ſuch a diſavowal neceſſary for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the author. If that which is in itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent be made a crime, if abſurd or arbitrary laws have infringed on the natural right, which all men poſſeſs, of not only having but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing their opinions, we then deſervedly loſe the other right of always hearing the truth, which is ſolely founded on freedom. We are forbidden to deceive, becauſe to deceive any man is to commit an injury on him, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to commit one himſelf. But injury ſuppoſes a right; and no one has the right to ſeek for and ſecure to himſelf the means of doing injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>We do not diſculpate Voltaire, for having attributed his work to the Abbé de Chaulieu, but ſuch an imputation is in itſelf indifferent, and a mere act of pleaſantry; it is affording an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to people in power, who are diſpoſed to be indulgent, without daring to confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo, by the aid of which they may repel
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024210_0041_0FC55BD32D127B90"/>
ſuch perſecutors as are over ſerious in their zeal.</p>
                  <p>The indiſcretion, with which ſome of the friends of Voltaire, repeated fragments from his Maid of Orleans, was the cauſe of a new perſecution. The keeper of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>It was in theſe tempeſtuous times that the lieutenant, of the police, Hernalt, one day ſaid to Voltaire:—"Write what you will, you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can overturn the Chriſtian religion."— "We ſhall ſee that"—replied the poet<note n="*" place="bottom">See, in the general correſpondence of D' Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, the letter of the 20th of June, 1760.</note>.</p>
                  <p>At a time when there was much converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning a man who had been arreſted by a ſuppoſed forged lettre de cachet, Voltaire
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024210_0042_0FC55BE527096498"/>
aſked the, ſame magiſtrate what puniſhment would be inflicted on thoſe who ſhould fabricate falſe lettres de cachet.—"They will be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."—"That will be but doing right: let us hope the time will come when thoſe who ſign the true, will be ſerved in the ſame way."</p>
                  <p>Wearied by ſo much perſecution, Voltaire thought it neceſſary to change his mode of life, to effect which, fortune ſecured him the means. Ancient philoſophers have vaunted of poverty as the ſafe-guard of independence: Voltaire, that he might be independent, wiſhed to become rich; and he was equally to be commended. The ancients were unacquainted with that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wealth which may at once be diſperſed and ſecured, in various countries, beyond the reach of power. Confiſcation and its abuſes, amongſt them, rendered wealth as dangerous as fame, or popular favour. The extent of the Roman empire, and the ſmallneſs of the Grecian republics, alike prevented men from the concealment of their riches, or their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The difference of manners among neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring nations, the almoſt general ignorance of foreign languages, and a leſs degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe throughout the world, were then ſo many impediments to a change of country.</p>
                  <p>The ancients likewiſe knew leſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of life, which among us are become neceſſary to all who are not born in poverty. Their climate ſubjected them to leſs nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous real wants; and the wealthy were more
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024210_0043_0FC55BE741BFD870"/>
addicted to magnificence, refinement in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, exceſs, and caprice, than to habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and daily convenience. Thus, as it was more eaſy for them to be poor, and more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be rich without danger, riches were not among them, as among us, the means of eſcaping from unjuſt oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Let us not blame a philoſopher for having, in order to ſecure his independence, preferred ſuch reſources as the manners of his age ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to thoſe which belong to other manners and to other times.</p>
                  <p>The fortune which deſcended to Voltaire from his father and his brother was ample, and had been increaſed by the London edition of the Henriade, and fortunate ſpeculations in the public funds. Thus, to the advantage of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing wealth, which aſcertained independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he added that of being indebted for it to himſelf. The uſe he made of riches might prevail on envy itſelf to pardon him their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement.</p>
                  <p>Much of his wealth was expended in aiding men of letters, and in encouraging ſuch youth as he thought diſcovered the ſeeds of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. This, in particular, was the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he made of the trifling profits he derived from his works and his theatrical productions, when he did not make a free gift of the latter to the comedians. Yet never was author more cruelly accuſed of injuries done to his bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; but the whole ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

were at their command, and were themſelves anxious to decry the conduct of a man whoſe works they were conſcious they could not bring into diſrepute. The pride of mediocrity, the vanity of men, even of merit, wounded by a too inconteſtible ſuperiority, the buſy world ever anxious to degrade knowledge and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents which are the objects of their ſecret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and fanatics who were intereſted to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate Voltaire, that they might have the leſs to fear, all conſpired to increaſe the detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bookſellers and hyper-critics. But proofs of the falſehood of theſe imputations, as well as the favours heaped by Voltaire on ſome of his detractors, ſtill ſubſiſt; nor can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member theſe proofs without a ſigh, at the misfortune of genius thus condemned to ſuffer, and at that ſhameful facility men have to credit whatever can relieve them from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſity of admiring. Such ſighs are the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy retribution of ſame.</p>
                  <p>Having no more need, for the ſecurity of his fortune, to court patronage, ſolicit places, or to traffic with bookſellers, Voltaire renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all reſidence at the capital. Previous to the adminiſtration of Cardinal de Fleury, and his journey to England, his intercourſe had been among people of the firſt faſhion. Princes and nobles, thoſe who were at the head of affairs, people of faſhion and women moſt in vogue, were courted by him and were equally deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of his company. He was every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024210_0045_0FC55BF2B13BBAB0"/>
with pleaſure and welcome, but he eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where inſpired envy and fear. Superior, in genius, he was even more ſo, in the wit of converſation, into which he infuſed whatever can render frivolity amiable, and at the ſame time interſperſed traits of a more elevated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Born with the talent of humour, his repartees were often repeated; nor was there any want of an application of the word ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, to what was no more than the deciſion of the underſtanding, rendered acute by native wit.</p>
                  <p>On his return from England, he felt that in ſociety, where men aſſemble from motives of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſelf-love, he ſhould meet but with few friends. He therefore, though he did not quarrel with ſuch ſocieties, frequented them leſs. The taſte he had acquired for magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, grandeur, and whatever is uncommon and ſplendid, had become habitual, and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it even in retirement. By this taſte, his works were often embelliſhed, and it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally influenced his judgment. On his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his country, he confined himſelf to live familiarly with only a few friends. He had loſt M. de Génonville and M. de Maiſons, whoſe death he lamented in ſuch affecting verſe, which remains a monument of that true and deep ſenſibility which nature had beſtowed, and genius diſſeminated through his works, and which was the fortunate origin of his ardent zeal for the happineſs of mankind, which was
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024210_0046_0FC55BFB34EEFAC8"/>
the ſublime and continued paſſion of his old age. He ſtill poſſeſſed M. d'Argental, who, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his long life, preſerved ſenſations of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and admiration for Voltaire, and who was rewarded by his friendſhip and his confidence. Madame Forment and Madame Cideville were likewiſe his friends, and the conſidants of his works and his projects.</p>
                  <p>But about the time when he ſuffered ſuch various perſecution, friendſhip, ſtill more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, afforded him conſolation and increaſed his love of retirement. The Marchioneſs du Chatelet was, like him, paſſionately enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſtudy and fame, as well as of philoſophy; but it was of that kind of philoſophy which ſprings up in the ſtrong and free mind. She had ſtudied metaphyſics and geometry ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to analize Leibnitz, and tranſlate Newton. She cultivated the arts; but not undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, nor ſo as to prefer them to the knowledge of nature and man. Superior to prejudice, as well from ſtrength of character as from reaſon, ſhe had not the weakneſs to conceal how much prejudice was deſpiſed by her. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging in the trifling amuſements of her ſex, rank, and age, ſhe yet could contemn and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them without regret in favour of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, labour, and friendſhip. Her ſuperior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity excited the jealouſy of women and even of moſt of the men, with whom ſhe neceſſarily aſſociated. Yet ſhe could pardon their envy without an effort. Such was the friend that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024210_0047_0FC55BFC4168D318"/>
Voltaire ſelected with whom to paſs his days; days which were ever conſecrated to works of genius, and embelliſhed by mutual friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>Weary of literary diſputes, diſguſted to ſee the league which inferior writers had formed againſt him, and who were ſecretly ſupported by men, whoſe merit ſhould have preſerved them from ſuch unworthy aſſociates; finding likewiſe, that ſince he had dared to ſpeak truth, his accuſers were as numerous as his critics, and perceiving that they inceſſantly armed religion and government againſt him, becauſe he was a good poet, he ſought employment more peaceful in the ſtudy of the ſciences.</p>
                  <p>He determined to publiſh an elementary Treatiſe of the Diſcoveries of Newton, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the ſyſtem of the earth and of light, that he might render them f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>miliar to all who had the ſlighteſt knowledge of mathematics; and that he might make known, at the ſame time, the philoſophic opinions of Newton, and his ideas of ancient chronology.</p>
                  <p>At the time that theſe Elements appeared, the Carteſian ſyſtem prevailed even in the Academy of Sciences, at Paris. A few young geometricians only had the courage to forſake it; nor did any work exiſt in the French lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage from which an idea could be formed of the grand diſcoveries which had, for half a century, been rendered public in England.</p>
                  <p>The author, however, was refuſed a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege for publication. The Chancellor d'Agu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſeau

                     </gap> his political and religious ſentiments againſt Newton. He diſcovered that a chancellor of France ought not to ſuffer an Engliſh philoſopher, who ſcarcely was a Chriſtian, to riſe victorious over a ſuppoſed orthodox Frenchman. D'Ageuſſeau had a prodigious memory, and continued ſtudy had rendered him deeply learned in various ſpecies of erudition; but his mind, wearied by being made the receptacle of the opinions of others, had neither ſtrength ſufficient to combine his own ideas, nor to form fixt and definite prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. His ſuperſtition, his timidity, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for ancient cuſtoms, and his want of reſolution, narrowed his views relative to a reformation of the laws and impeded his activ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. He died, after having been long a miniſter, and left France to regret that his great virtues had ſlumbered in inutility, and that his rare qualities had been loſt to the world.</p>
                  <p>His ſeverity reſpecting the Elements of the Newtonian Philoſophy was not the only mark of littleneſs he ſhowed during his cenſorſhip of the preſs. He would not give privileges for the printing of novels; nor would he ſuffer the novel of Cleveland to be publiſhed, but on condition that the hero ſhould change his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                  <p>He was a candidate for the prize, given by the Academy of Sciences, on the nature and propagation of fire; and aſſumed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motto, which, for preciſion and energy, is not unworthy of the author of the Henriade:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Ignis ubique latet naturam amplectitur omnem,</l>
                     <l>Cuncta parit, renovat, dividit, unit, alit.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The prize was given to the illuſtrious Eular, by whom, in ſcientific conteſt, no man need bluſh at being vanquiſhed. Madame du Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelet, as well as her friend, was likewiſe a candidate, and both pieces were mentioned in very honourable terms.</p>
                  <p>The diſpute on the meaſure of forces at that time occupied mathematicians. Voltaire, in a memorial preſented to and approved by the Academy, took the part of Des Cartes and Newton againſt Leibnitz and the two Bernou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illi's; nay even againſt Madame du Chatelet, who was become the partiſan of Leibnitz.</p>
                  <p>We are far from pretending that theſe works are any addition to the ſame of Voltaire, or even that they deſerve a place among the learned, but the merit of having made the French, who are not mathematicians, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Newton, the true ſyſtem of the earth, and the principal phenomena of optics, deſerves notice in the life of a philoſopher.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="unknown:024210_0050_0FC55C11505EA898"/>It is good to diſſeminate truth relative to objects of ſcience, whether it relate to the great laws of nature and the order of the world, or to thoſe common facts which fall under every man's obſervation. Abſolute ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is ever accompanied by error; and error in phyſics often is the ſupport of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of a more dangerous kind. The philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic knowledge of Voltaire was further uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him as a poet; we do not, here, entirely refer to thoſe pieces in which he had the rare merit of expreſſing truth in verſe with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion without disfiguring it, or ceaſing to be a poet, or of addreſſing the imagination while he delighted the ear. The ſtudy of the scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces enlarges the ſphere of poetic ideas, and enriches verſe with new images. Without this reſource, poetry, neceſſarily limitted by too confined a circle, would be no more than the art of re-producing, in harmonious language, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thoughts and exhauſted pictures.</p>
                  <p>Be the ſubject what it may, he who poſſeſſes extenſive and profound knowledge will ever poſſeſſes an immenſe advantage. The poetic ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of Voltaire would have been the ſame, but he would not have been ſo great a poet, had he not ſtudied philoſophy and hiſtory. Nor is it ſolely in augmenting the number of our ideas that ſuch extraneous ſtudies are uſeful; they add to the perfection of the mind, by exerciſing its various faculties in a more equal manner.</p>
                  <p>After having applied ſome years to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024210_0051_0FC55C12B658B458"/>
philoſophy, Voltaire conſulted Clair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aut relative to his progreſs, who had the frankneſs to anſwer that after obſtinate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour he would never ariſe above mediocrity in the ſciences, and that he would vainly looſe that time which ſame required he ſhould dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to poetry and ethics. Voltaire liſtened pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently and yielded to that natural inclination which inceſſantly led him to the Belles Letrres and to the wiſhes of his friends, who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to accompany him in his new career.</p>
                  <p>He was not therefore entirely abſorbed in the ſciences during his reſidence at Cirey. He there wrote Alzire, Zulime, Mahomet, the Hiſtory of Charles XII. finiſhed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on Man, prepared the age of Louis XIV. and collected materials for his Eſſay on the Manners and Spirit of Nations, from Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne to the preſent age.</p>
                  <p>Alzire and Mahomet are immortal monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the height to which the human geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, poetry and philoſophy can raiſe the tragic art. This art is not in theſe pieces confined to the pourtraying the paſſions, awakening their power over the ſoul, and making the ſweet tears of love and of pity flow; it becomes the tutor of mankind, whom it inclines to virtue; indolent citizens, who bring with them to the theatre the wearineſs of having ſpent an uſeleſs day, are there called on to diſcuſs the firſt grand intereſt of the human race.</p>
                  <p>In Alzire, we behold the noble but wild and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:024210_0052_0FC55C16AF4D0628"/>
impetuous virtues of the man of nature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batting the vices of ſociety corrupted by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here, we at once are taught how ſociety corrupts man by making prejudice the ſubſtitute of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and how it improves him when error is baniſhed by truth.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt fatal of prejudices is that of fanaticiſm. Voltaire was determined the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould become the victim of the ſtage; and that he might expel it from every heart, he employed theſe terrible effects which trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alone can afford. It, no doubt, was eaſy to render a fanatic odious, but that this fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſhould be a great man, and that while ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring, we ſhould of neceſſity admire him, that he ſhould deſcend to mean artifice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out degradation, that, while occupied in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating a religion and raiſing an empire, he ſhould be in love without being ridiculous, that while committing every crime he ſhould not inſpire that painful horror which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the acts of villains, that in the tone of a prophet he ſhould ſpeak the language of genius, that he ſhould be ſuperior to the bigotry with which he intoxicated his ignorant and intrepid diſciples yet be above the baſeneſs of hypocriſy, that his crimes ſhould be ſucceſsful, that he ſhould triumph, yet ſhould appear ſufficiently puniſhed by remorſe, all this could only be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024210_0053_0FC55C1E35E2A998"/>
by the dramatic art, when employed by the true poet.</p>
                  <p>Mahomet was firſt acted at Liſle, in l741. During the repreſentation, a letter from the king of Pruſſia was delivered to Voltaire, which informed him of the victory of Molwitz. He ſtopped the piece to read the letter to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. You will ſee, ſaid he, to his ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends, this tragedy of Molwitz will make mine ſucceſsful. They ventured to play it at Paris; but the bigots by their exclamations, availing themſelves of the weakneſs of the Cardinal de Fleury, prevailed on him to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the repreſentation. Voltaire thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſend it to Benedict XIV. with two Latin verſes for his portrait. The Pontiff Lamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini, a tolerant and eaſy prince, but a man of much underſtanding, ſent him a kind anſwer, accompanied by ſome medals.</p>
                  <p>Crébillon was more ſcrupulous than the pope. He never would conſent that a piece ſhould be played, which, by proving that tragic terror may be increaſed to the utmoſt exceſs without ſacrificing the pathos or revolting the mind, was a ſatire on that ſpecies of writing, of which he proudly believed himſelf to be the creator and the model. It was not till the year 1751 that M. D'Alembert, being appointed by M. D'Argenſon to examine Mahomet, had the courage to approve it, and thus to expoſe himſelf to the mutual hatred of the men of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters leauged againſt Voltaire, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votees.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024210_0054_0FC55C264BC71F18"/>
His fortitude was the more deſerving of reſpect, becauſe the approver of a work docs not participate in its fame, and becauſe he could find no recompence for the danger to which he expoſed himſelf, except the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of having ſerved his friend, and aided the triumph of reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Zulima failed of ſucceſs; nor were the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the author to correct and palliate its faults effectual. A tragedy is an experiment on the human heart, and an experiment which does not always ſucceed, even in the moſt able hands. Zulima, however, is the firſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man preſented on the ſtage, who, hurried by paſſion into criminal acts, ſtill preſerved all the generoſity and diſintereſtedneſs of love. This character, ſo natural, ſo violent, and ſo tender, might perhaps have deſerved indulgence from the audience, and the critics of the theatre, in favour of the new beauties of this part, might have pardoned the weakneſs of the 'others, which the author himſelf condemned with equal frankneſs and ſeverity.</p>
                  <p>The Diſcourſes on Man are one of the fineſt monuments of French poetry. The plan of them may not be ſo regular as that of the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Pope, but they poſſeſs the advantage of philoſophy more true, mild, and general. All the variety of harmony, a kind of careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſoothing ſenſibility, an enthuſiaſm ever noble and ever real, impart a charm to them, which alternately delights the mind, the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024210_0055_0FC55C27081507E0"/>
and the heart; a charm, the uſe of which was known only to Voltaire, and which was that of pleaſing, moving, and inſtructing, without ever fatiguing the reader, and of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to all underſtandings and to all ages. Flaſhes of true philoſophy frequently break forth, and are generally addreſſed ſo to the feelings or to the fancy as to appear natural, and to become popular. This talent is as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial and as rare as that of giving a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found appearance to falſe and trivial ideas is common and dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Quitting the company of Pope, we admire his genius, and the addreſs with which he defends his ſyſtem, but the ſoul is unmoved, and the mind preſently finds that its objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have rather been eluded than anſwered. But we cannot leave Voltaire without encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement or conſolation; and, while we have a melancholy proſpect of the evils to which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has condemned man, we are likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their antidotes.</p>
                  <p>The life of Charles XII. was the firſt of the hiſtorical publications of Voltaire. The ſtyle, as rapid as the exploits of the hero, hurries on the reader to an uninterrupted train of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did expeditions, ſingular anecdotes, and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic events, which give curioſity and feeling no repoſe. The narrative is rarely interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reflexions. The author forgot himſelf that he might give place to his characters. He ſeems to relate what he has juſt heard concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hero. The ſingle ſubject is battles and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:024210_0056_0FC55C2882D69000"/>
military enterprize; yet, the ſpirit of a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher and the ſoul of a defender of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race are preſent every where.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire wrote from original memorials, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by thoſe who were witneſſes of the events; and his hiſtorical truth is warranted by the reſpectable teſtimony of Staniſlaus, the friend, the companion, and the victim of Charles XII.</p>
                  <p>The hiſtory was, notwithſtanding, accuſed of being a novel, becauſe it had all the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of one. Though no man, perhaps, ever excited ſo much enthuſiaſm, neither was any man ever treated with leſs indulgence than Voltaire. As a reputation for wit is in France the thing moſt envied, and as it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his ſuperiority in wit to remain unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, he was moſt vehemently denied every other merit; and, the pretended claims to wit being as reſtleſs in every claſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as in that of men of letters, the number of thoſe who envied him was almoſt equal to that of his readers.</p>
                  <p>In vain had Voltaire imagined that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of Cirey would hide him from hatred; he had concealed his perſon only, his fame ſtill offended his enemies. A libel, which was a malignant attack on his whole life, appeared to the diſturbance of his repoſe. He was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a prince, or a miniſter, becauſe he exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted equal envy. The Abbé Desfontaines, who was indebted to Voltaire for liberty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:024210_0057_0FC55C323368C828"/>
for life, was the author of this lible.

                  <p>Voltaire, being informed of the misfortune of the Abbé Desfontaines, who was perſonally unknown to him, and whoſe only recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was that he was a man of letters, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to Fontainbleau in ſearch of Madame de Prie, then all puiſſant, from whom he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the priſoner's liberty, on condition that be ſhould not appear at Paris. Voltaire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther procured him a place of retirement at the ſeat of a lady of his acquaintance. Here Desfontaines wrote a libel againſt his benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; this he was obliged to throw into the fire, but he never could pardon Voltaire the act of ſaving his life. He eagerly took every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity the periodical publications afforded, of attacking him; and it was he who, by the mouth of a prieſt<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:024210_0058_0FC55C3354FAAAA0"/>He was thus expoſed to the danger of new baniſhment, becauſe, to the reproach of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preached up pleaſure, a great one in the eyes of thoſe who need the cloak of auſterity to conceal vice more real, was added the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional crime of having ridiculed the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our firſt parents.</p>
                  <p>In ſine, the journaliſts publiſhed the Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tairomanie; and then it was that Voltaire, who ſo long had ſilently ſuffered under the ſlanders of Desfontaines and Rouſſeau, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned himſelf to emotions of anger, of which his enemies were little worthy.</p>
                  <p>Not ſatisfied with avenging himſelf by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up his adverſaries to public contempt, and imprinting on them marks which no time can efface, he proſecuted Desfontaines who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped by diſavowing the libel, and who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately wrote others to conſole himſelf for the misfortune. Thus, at the age of forty-four, after having been patient during twenty years, Voltaire, for the firſt time, forgot that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which it were highly to be wiſhed men of letters never ſhould forget. Though they have received from nature the formidable gift of devoting their foes to ridicule and ſhame, they ought to diſdain the uſe of this dangerous weapon in avenging their own quarrels, and employ it only againſt the performers of truth, and the enemies of the rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>The friendſhip, which, about the ſame time
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:024210_0059_0FC55C39C0AC8BE0"/>
was formed between Voltaire and the prince royal of Pruſſia, was one of the firſt cauſes of the exceſſive anger of his enemies. The young Frederic had received from his father the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſoldier only, but nature formed him for a man of an amiable, extenſive, and elevated mind, as well as for a great generall. He was ſent to Rhineſberg by his father, who, having conceived the project of beheading him as a deſerter, becauſe he had attempted to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel without permiſſion, yielded to the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of the imperial ambaſſador, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf with cauſing the prince to be preſent at the execution of one of his travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing companions.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate of retirement, Frederic, who was enamoured with the French language, poetry, and philoſophy, choſe Voltaire for his confident and guide. They mutually ſent each other their works; the prince conſulted the philoſopher concerning his ſtudies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted leſſons and advice. They diſcuſſed the moſt curious as the moſt difficult metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical queſtions. The prince, at that time, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the works of Wolf, whoſe ſyſtems and unintelligible language he ſoon abjured for philoſophy more ſimple and more true. He alſo employed himſelf in a refutation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel: that is, in proving that the moſt certain policy of a ſovereign is to make moral rules his guide, and that his perſonal intereſt does not neceſſarily render him the enemy of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024210_0060_0FC55C3B39B85630"/>
his ſubject and his neighbours, as Machiavel had ſuppoſed, either from a love of hypotheſis or to diſguſt his countrymen with a monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal government, toward which they ſeemed to be inclined by their wearineſs of a republican ſyſtem ever tempeſtuous and often cruel.</p>
                  <p>In the preceding century, Tycho-Brahe, Des Cartes, and Leibnitz, had enjoyed the ſociety of monarchs, by whom they had been loaded with marks of eſteem? but confidence and freedom did not preſide in this too unequal intercourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of theſe Frederic gave the firſt example, in which, unfortunately for his fame, he forgot to perſiſt. He ſent his friend, the Baron de Keyſerling, to viſit the Deities of Cirey, and to bear his protrait and manuſcripts to Voltaire. The philoſopher was moved, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps flattered, by this homage; but his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pleaſure was the proſpect of a prince deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to reign, who loved literature, and was the friend of philoſophy and the foe of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. He hoped the author of the Anti-Machiavel would be a pacific monarch, and he took ſerious delight in ſecretly printing the book which he believed muſt bind the prince to virtue from the fear of betraying his own principles, and of reading his condemnation in the work he himſelf had written.</p>
                  <p>When Frederic aſcended the throne, he teſtified no change, but remained the friend of Voltaire. The cares of government did not enfeeble his love of poetry, nor his avid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024210_0061_0FC55C3FDB570218"/>
to poſſeſs the unpubliſhed writings of Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, which were read by ſcarcely any except himſelf and Madame du Chatelet. Yet, one of his firſt ſteps was to ſuſpend the publication of the Anti-Machiavel. Voltaire obeyed, and the corrections which he had made with regret were rendered fruitleſs.</p>
                  <p>His deſire that his diſciple, now a king, ſhould enter into a public engagement, which ſhould ſecure his adherence to philoſophic maxims, was increaſed. He went to meet him at Wezel, and was aſtoniſhed to ſee a young monarch in a uniform, on a camp-bed, ſhivering with a fever. But his fever did not prevent him from profiting by his neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to the principality of Liege, and enforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the payment of a forgotten debt, from the biſhop. Voltaire wrote the memorial, which was ſupported by the bayonet, and he returned to Paris well ſatisfied to have found his hero an amiable man. But he refuſed the offers of the king, who wiſhed to draw him to Pruſſia, and preferred the friendſhip of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame du Chatelet to the favour of a monarch whom he admired.</p>
                  <p>The king of Pruſſia declared war againſt the daughter of Charles VI. and took advantage of her weakneſs to render ſome old preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on Sileſia valid. Two battles ſecured him the poſſeſſion of the province. Cardinal de Fleury, who had undertaken the war in his own deſpite, continued his ſecret negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024210_0062_0FC55C470D8D9AC0"/>
The empreſs perceived her intereſt was not to treat with France, againſt whom ſhe hoped for uſeful allies, who would themſelves ſupport the burden of the war; whereas, if ſhe had none but the Pruſſian monarch to combat, ſhe muſt be left to herſelf, and muſt behold the wiſhes and ſecret aid of thoſe very powers on the ſide of her foe. She rather choſe therefore to ſtifle her reſentment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Frederic of the propoſitions of the cardinal, induced him to make peace by this confidence, and purchaſe by the ſacrifice of Sileſia, the neutrality of the enemy whom ſhe had moſt to fear.</p>
                  <p>The war had not interrupted the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between the king and Voltaire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric ſent poety from the field, while prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for battle, or amid the tumult of victory; and Voltaire, continuing to praiſe his military fame, never ceaſed to preach humanity and peace.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal de Fleury died. Voltaire had been intimate with him, because he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of learning the anecdotes of the reign of Louis XIV; and Fleury, who loved to relate them, dwelt on thoſe which regarded himſelf, not doubting that Voltaire would eagerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert them in his hiſtory. But the hatred of Fleury, and of all feeble men, for one who roſe superior to common powers, was greater than his love of taſte, and eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſpeech, and even of thought, in France, that he might govern with the greater eaſe. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his whole life, he had maintained a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of opinions in the kingdom, by his very endeavours to ſmother thoſe opinions, and prevent them from troubling the public repoſe. He was terrified by the daringneſs of Voltaire; equally afraid of expoſing himſelf, ſhould he defend the poet, or his trifling claims to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, ſhould he abandon him with too much cowardice, Voltaire found him rather a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine perſecutor than a patron; but one who was retained by his reſpect for public opinion and his own fame.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire was deſigned to be his ſucceſſor in the French academy: he had lately acquired new claims which muſt have ſilenced envy, had ſhe been capable of a bluſh. He had enriched the ſtage by another maſter-piece: by Merope, the only tragedy in which tears freely and ſweetly flow, without the aid of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of love. The author of Zaïre had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oppoſed the maxim of Boileau,
<q>
                        <l>De cette paſſion la ſenſible peinture</l>
                        <l>Eſt, pour aller au coeur, la route, la plus ſure.<note n="*" place="bottom">A pathetic picture of love, is the ſureſt road to the heart.</note>
                        </l>
                     </q>
He had affirmed that nature was capable of producing more feeling and more heart-rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effects on the ſtage; and in Merope, he proved his aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="unknown:024210_0064_0FC55C4ED0096090"/>If however Boileau, by ſureſt, underſtood the leaſt difficult, facts are in his favour. Various poets have written affecting tragedies founded on love; Merope ſtands alone.</p>
                  <p>Hurried on by the intereſt of the ſituations, a rapidity of dialogue till then unknown to the ſtage, and by the talent of an actreſs who had caught the empaſſioned tones of nature, the pit was agitated with unexampled enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm. Voltaire, who was concealed in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the houſe, was obliged to appear before the ſpectators. He came into the box of the lady of Marſhal de Villars. The houſe called on the young ducheſs of Villars to kiſs the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Merope; and ſhe was under the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of obeying the imperious will of the public, intoxicated with admiration and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>This was the firſt time that the pit called for the author of a piece; but what was then no more than homage, rendered to genius, degenerated afterward into cuſtom, and is now a ridiculous and humiliating ceremony, to which authors, who reſpect themſelves, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>To this new claim, which even devotion was obliged to reſpect, was added the ſupport of Madame de Châteauroux, then governed by the Duke de Richelieu; an extraordinary man, who at the age of twenty, had twice been in the Baſtile, for the raſhneſs of his gallantries; who, by the rumour and the number of his adventures, had made himſelf
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:024210_0065_0FC55C5048F81CB0"/>
ſo faſhionable, among women, as for it to be almoſt regarded as an honour to be diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him; and who, among his imitators, had formed a kind of gallantry in which love was no longer the inclination to pleaſure, but the vanity of ſeduction. This ſame man after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contributed to the fame of the victory of Fontenoy, ſupported the revolution of Genoa, took port Mahon, and obliged an Engliſh army to lay down its arms; and when that army had broken the treaty, when it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his diſperſed and feeble quarters, he ſtopped its progreſs by his activity and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. After which he ſunk into the intrigues of the court, and loſt, in the maneuvres of a tyrannical and corrupt adminiſtration, that fame which might have obliterated his early errors.</p>
                  <p>The Duke de Richelieu had from his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy been the friend of Voltaire; and, though Voltaire had often cauſe of complaint againſt him, yet he preſerved that remembrance of youthful affection which time cannot eradicate, and a kind of confidence which was rather maintained by habit than by conviction. The duke continued faithful to his old friend, as much as the levity of his character, his caprice, his petty deſpotiſm at the theatres, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for every man who was not a courtier, his weakneſs toward people in power, and his inſenſibility for all that was noble, or uſeful, would permit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:024210_0066_0FC55C51B8920288"/>At this period he promoted the intereſt of Voltaire with Madame de Châteauroux. But M. de Maurepas did not love Voltaire. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bé de Chaulieu had written an epigram againſt Oedipus, becauſe he was offended to ſee a young man, who had become his rival in ſugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive poetry, into which philoſophy and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs were infuſed, acquire the additional fame of ſucceeding at the theatre; and M. de Maurepas, whoſe vanity was to be the man of moſt wit at table, could not pardon Voltaire for ſo evidently robbing him of this advantage, with which it was not too ridiculous, at that time, for a miniſter of ſtate to be flattered.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire attempted to diſarm his anger by an epiſtle, in which he beſtowed ſuch praiſe as might appear moſt natural to the mind and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of M. de Maurepas. This epiſtle, which contained as much inſtruction as eulogium, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected no change in the ſentiments of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; who, that he might prevent Voltaire from gaining a place in the academy, combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the prieſt Boyer, whom Fleury had preferred, as the tutor of the dauphin, to Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillon, whoſe talents and virtue he ſcared; and which Boyer he, on his death-bead, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the king to the charge of beſtowing eccleſiaſtical benefices, apparently from the hope that his memory might be regretted by the Janſeniſts, M. de Maurepas was likewiſe glad to have an opportunity of ſecretly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracting Madame de Châteauroux, with whoſe
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:024210_0067_0FC55C55A95E35C0"/>
hatred for him he was well acquainted. Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, being informed of his intention, went to to him and aſked, if Madame de Châteauroux ſhould ſupport him in the election, whether he would oppoſe him. I will, anſwered the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and will cruſh you<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>In order to be juſt, it is here neceſſary to relate that having, after the death of Voltaire, mentioned this anecdote to the count de Maurepas, to whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſuch an anſwer does not ſeem natural, he, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, anſwered that it was the king himſelf who would not ſuffer Voltaire to ſucceed the Cardinal de Fleury, in his place of academician. His majeſty thought there was too marked a diſtance, between the men, to put the eulogium of the one, in the mouth of the other, and afford laughter to the public by ſuch an aſſociation.</p>
                        <p>M. de Maurepas further added, that he had long known Voltaire had written the anecdote of "I will cruſh you." But this trifling act of injuſtice, from a man ſo celebrated, had not prevented him from ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing and obtaining leave, from the preſent king, that the poet, who had been ſo great an honour to his age and nation, might return to Paris, at the cloſe of his life, there to enjoy the fruits of his fame.</p>
                        <p>This is the note of the general correſpondent of the literary typographical ſociety.</p>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>He knew how eaſy this would be to a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and that, under a feeble government, the influence of a miſtreſs muſt yield to that of intriguing fanatic prieſts, who were more deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable than a proſtitute, in the eyes of reaſon, tho' more reſpected by the populace. Boyer was triumphant.</p>
                  <p>The miniſter ſoon after perceived how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:024210_0068_0FC55C5D24343810"/>
the alliance of the king of Pruſſia was to France. But this monarch feared to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage anew with a power whoſe timid and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering policy could not inſpire confidence. Voltaire, it was ſuppoſed, might induce him to change his opinion, and was ſecretly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this negociation. It was agreed that the perſecution of Boyer ſhould be the pretext of his journey into Pruſſia. He thus obtained the liberty to ridicule the poor prieſt, who went to complain to the king that Voltaire made him appear a fool in foreign courts. The king anſwered—"It was a ſettled point."</p>
                  <p>Voltaire departed, and Piron, at the head of his enemies, wrote abundance of epigrams and ſongs on his pretended diſgrace. Piron was in the habit of inſulting all celebrated men who underwent perſecution. His works abound with proofs of this mean malice; yet he had the character of a good natured man, becauſe he was indolent; and, not having any native dignity of mind, he did not offend the vanity of others.</p>
                  <p>After having paſſed ſome time with the King of Pruſſia, who conſtantly refuſed all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation with France, Voltaire had the addreſs to divine the true motive of his refuſal. It was the weakneſs that France had perſiſted in not to declare war againſt the Engliſh, and by this conduct to appear to entreat for peace, when ſhe had a right to dictate its conditions.</p>
                  <p>He returned to Paris and gave an account
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:024210_0069_0FC55C63C6AB7948"/>
of his journey. The following ſpring the King of Pruſſia again declared war againſt the Queen of Hungary, by which uſeful diverſion he obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her troops to evacuate Alſatia. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervice, with that of having penetrated, as he paſſed through the Hague, into the views of the Dutch who apparently were in a ſtate of uncertainty, did not procure Voltaire any of thoſe marks of reſpect from which he wiſhed to raiſe a rampart againſt his literary enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis D'Argenſon was called to the miniſtry. He was a man who deſerves to be ranked among thoſe few people in power who have really loved philoſophy, and the public good. His taſte for literature had connected him with Voltaire, whom he more than once employed to write manifeſtos, declarations, and diſpatches, the ſtyle of which was required to be correct, dignified, and well adapted.</p>
                  <p>Such was the manifeſto which was to have been publiſhed by the Pretender, on his deſcent into Scotland with a ſin all French army, which the Duke de Richelieu was to have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Voltaire had then an opportunity of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in conjunction with Count Lally, a zealous Jacobite, and the determined enemy of the Engliſh; whoſe memory Voltaire after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards defended with ſo much fortitude when an unjuſt ſentence, executed with barbarity, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed him to the reſentment of ſome of the ſervants of the Eaſt India Company.</p>
                  <p>But he had, at the ſame time, a ſupport
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:024210_0070_0FC55C6536927968"/>
more potent in the Marchioneſs de Pompadour, with whom he had been intimate while her name was d'Etiole. She committed the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a piece to him, for the firſt marriage of the Dauphin. The place of gentleman of the chamber, the title of hiſtoriographer of France, and in fine the protection of the court, which was neceſſary to oppoſe the faction of devotees who excluded him the French academy, were the recompenſe he received. It was on this occaſion that he wrote the following verſes:
<q>
                        <l>Mon Henri quatre et ma Zaïre,</l>
                        <l>Et mon Américaine Alzire,</l>
                        <l>Ne m'ont valu jamais un ſeul regard du Roi;</l>
                        <l>J'eus beaucoup d'ennemis, avee très-peu de gloire;</l>
                        <l>Les honneurs et les biens pleuvent enfin ſur moi,</l>
                        <l>Pour une farce de la foire.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Henriade, Zaïre, and my American Alzire, never obtained me a look from majeſty: I had many enemies and little fame; but honours at length are ſhowered on me, for having written a farce.</note>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was paſſing rather too ſevere a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Princeſs of Navarre, which is a work full of noble and affecting gallantry.</p>
                  <p>The favour of the court however was inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to open the doors of the academy. He was obliged, in order to diſarm the devotees, to write a letter to Father la Tour, in which he made proteſtation of his reſpect for religion, and, which was more neceſſary, of his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Jeſuits. In deſpight of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs with which he manages his language in
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:024210_0071_0FC55C66E21D0840"/>
that letter, it were better he had renounced the academy than have had the weakneſs to write it. This weakneſs would have been inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble had it been the ſacrifice of vanity, in order to obtain a title which had long been incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of adding honour to the name of Voltaire. But he ſuppoſed it his ſhield; he imagined he ſhould find ſupport againſt perſecution from the academy. He preſumed too favourably of the fortitude and juſtice of his aſſociates.</p>
                  <p>In his diſcourſe to the academy, he firſt threw off the yoke of cuſtom, by which theſe diſcourſes ſeemed rather condemned to be a ſtring of compliments than of true praiſe. Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire boldly ſpoke of literature and of taſte, and his example is in ſome manner become a law, againſt which the academicians, who are man of letters, rarely venture to err. But he did not go ſo far as to ſuppreſs their reiterated praiſe of Richelieu, Séguier, and Louis XIV. which has hitherto been done only by two or three of the boldeſt academicians. He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Crébillon, in his diſcourſes, with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble generoſity of a man who fears not to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the talents of a rival, or to afford arms to his own antagoniſts.</p>
                  <p>A new torrent of libels was poured upon him, which he had not the fortitude to deſpiſe. The police was, at that time, committed to a man who had paſſed ſome months in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with Madame de Pompadour. A wretched muſician, of the opera band, was arreſted,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:024210_0072_0FC55C779C2594E8"/>
wnoſe name was Travenol, and who, with the advocate Rigoley de Juvigny, privately ſold theſe libels. The father of Travenol, an old man of eighty, went to Voltaire, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pardon for his guilty ſon; and the anger of the poet was huſhed by the firſt cry of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. He wept with, embraced, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoled the old man; and haſtened away with him, to obtain the liberty of his ſon.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire was not long in favour. Madame de Pompadour cauſed thoſe honours to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on Crébillon, which he had been refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Voltaire had conſtantly done juſtice to the author of Rhadamiſtus, but he could not be ſo humble as to ſuppoſe him ſuperior to the author of Alzire, Mahomet, and Merope. In ſuch exaggerated enthuſiaſm for Crébillon, he diſcovered nothing but a ſecret deſire that he himſelf ſhould be humbled: nor was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>The wit and the poet might have preſerved powerful friends; but theſe titles in Voltaire concealed a philoſopher, a man more earneſt for the progreſs of reaſon, the acquirement of perſonal fame.</p>
                  <p>His character, naturally proud and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yielded to ingenuous adulation; he was prodigal of praiſe, but he preſerved his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and his opinions, and the freedom of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them. Strong or affecting leſſons roſe out of panegyric: that manner of praiſing, which might ſucceed at the court of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:024210_0073_0FC55C7A360DA968"/>
Frederic, could not but offend at any other court.</p>
                  <p>He therefore returned to Cirey, and ſoon afterwards to the court of Staniſlaus. This prince, twice elected king of Poland, once by the will of Charles XII. and once by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the nation, never poſſeſſed more than the title of ſovereign. Having retired into Lorraine with this title, he there repaired, by his beneficent acts, the ills which the French adminſtration had committed: the paternal government of Leopold corrected an age of devaſtation and misfortune. His devotion had neither deprived him of the love of pleaſure nor of an affection for men of wit. His houſe was that of a wealthy private perſon: his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners thoſe of native candour; of a man who had never been unhappy, except becauſe others had determined to make him a king; nor ever dazzled by a title, from which he had derived nothing but danger. He wiſhed to ſee Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame du Chatelet and Voltaire at his court, or rather living as his inmates. The author of the Seaſons<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Lambert.</note>, the only French poet, who, like Voltaire, has united philoſophy and wit, then lived at Luneville, where he was only known as an amiable young officer; but his firſt poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical productions, full of reaſon, wit, and taſte, even then beſpoke a man born to be an honour to his age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="unknown:024210_0074_0FC55C7BC7075100"/>At Luneville, where Voltaire lived a life of occupation and mild tranquillity, he had the misfortune to loſe his friend. Madame du Charelet died, at the moment when ſhe had finiſhed her tranſlation of Newton; the labour of which had ſhortened her days. King Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſlaus went to conſole and weep with Voltaire in his chamber.</p>
                  <p>Having returned to Paris, the poet betook himſelf to his labours, a means of diſſipating grief, which nature has imparted but to few. Such a power over our thoughts, and ſuch force of mind, which affliction cannot vanquiſh, are precious gifts, which muſt not be depreciated by confounding them with want of feeling. Senſibility is not weakneſs; it is a capability of grief, without being overwhelmed by it: the ſoul is not the leſs affectionate, nor has ſorrow been leſs ſincere, becauſe oppoſed with fortitude; or becauſe conquered by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary powers.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire was weary of hearing the faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world, and moſt men of letters, prefer Crébillon to himſelf; which they did leſs from opinion than to puniſh him for the univerſality of his talents. Men are ever more indulgent to circumſcribed genius, which exerted on one object appears to be a kind of inſtinct, becauſe it offends not ſo many ſpecies of ſelf-love, and humbles their pride leſs.</p>
                  <p>This opinion of the ſuperiority of Crébillon was maintained with ſo much paſſion, that, in
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:024210_0075_0FC55C7D352BD4E8"/>
the preliminary diſcourſe to the Encyclopedia, M. D'Alembert had need of fortitude to grant equality to the author of Alzire and Merope, and durſt not extend juſtice further. Voltaire at length determined to avenge himſelf, and oblige the public to give him his true rank, by writing Semiramis, Oreſtes, and Rome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; which three ſubjects had before been treated by Crébillon. Every cabal that had been formed againſt Voltaire had united, to obtain momentary ſucceſs for the Cataline of his rival; a piece, the conduct of which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and the ſtyle barbarous; in which Cicero propoſes that his daughter ſhould ſeduce Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and a high prieſt appoints a rendezvous for the lovers in a temple, where he introduces a courtezan in men's clothes, and afterward treats the ſenate as impious, becauſe it there diſcuſſed on ſtate affairs.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, Rome Preſerved is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece of ſtyle and of reaſon, in which Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero appears with all his dignity and eloquence; in which Ceſar ſpeaks and acts like a man born to reduce Rome to ſubjection, to overwhelm his opponents by his glory, and obtain pardon for tyranny by the force of his talents and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and in which Cataline is a villain, but one who endeavours to excuſe his vices from example, and his crimes from neceſſity. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican energy and Roman feelings entirely poſſeſs the poet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:024210_0076_0FC55C84BAB99990"/>Voltaire had a ſmall theatre on which he acted his pieces, and where he often played the part of Cicero. Never, it is ſaid, was illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more complete: while he recited he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to create his character; and when, in the fifth act, Cicero again appeared before the ſenate, when he excuſed his love of fame by reciting the following beautiful lines.

the character and the poet were one, and the auditor imagined he heard Cicero, or Voltaire, avow and excuſe this weakneſs of great minds.</p>
                  <p>There is only one good part in the Electra of Crébillon, and this is a ſubaltern character. Oreſtes, who knows not that he is Oreſtes, is in love with the daughter Aegyſthus, who has the misfortune to be called Iphianaſſa. The implacable Electra is enamoured with the ſon of Aegyſthus, and theſe inſipid amours occupy the ſcene, while the furies are leading a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered ſon to the commiſſion of parricide; being condemned by the gods to take this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible revenge.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire felt that Clytemneſtra ſhould be rendered intereſting by her remorſe, by being
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024210_0077_0FC55C928F44BCB8"/>
characteriſed as rather feeble than guilty, and overawed by the cruel Aegyſthus, but a ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of having loved him, and ſenſible of the weight of her chains and of her crimes. If we compare this with the other tragedies of Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, we ſhall, no doubt, find it much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to his beſt works; but if we contraſt it with Sophocles, whom he meant to follow, that he might teach the French the character and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic conceptions of that poet, we ſhall perceive he had the art to preſerve his beauties, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his ſtyle, correct his defects, and render Clytemneſtra more pathetic, and Electra leſs barbarous. For which reaſon, when, in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite of cabal, the permanent beauties of the Greek poet were tranſmitted to the French ſtage, by a man worthy of becoming the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the moſt eloquent of the ancient tragic writers, and there enforce applauſe, Voltaire, more ardent in the intereſt of good taſte than in behalf of his own fame, could not forbear calling from the pit, in a momentary effuſion of rapture, "Go on Athenians, it is Sophocles."</p>
                  <p>The Semiramis of Crébillon was no ſooner produced than forgotten, That of Voltaire is the ſame ſubject which, fifteen years before, he had treated under the name of Eryphile, and which he withdrew from the ſtage, though the piece was highly applauded. During its repreſentations, he more perfectly felt all the difficulties of the fable. He perceived that,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024210_0078_0FC55C93C6AAB5F8"/>
to render a woman who had deſtroyed her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that ſhe might reign herſelf, intereſting, it was neceſſary that the ſplendour of her reign, her conqueſts, her virtues, and the extent of her empire ſhould force reſpect, and ſeize on the mind of the ſpectators; that the criminal queen ſhould be the miſtreſs of the world, and poſſeſs the virtues of a great monarch. He felt that, while exhibiting the prodigies of a foreign religion on the ſtage, it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, by magnificence and an elevated and religious ſtyle, not to ſuffer the imagination to cool, to make the gods interfere on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and to conceal the abſurdity of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle by inceſſantly preſenting the conſolatory idea of a Divine Power, exerciſing a ſlow but inevitable vengeance on the ſecret crimes of kings.</p>
                  <p>Love, offenſive in Oreſtes, was neceſſary in Semiramis. Ninyas muſt have a miſtreſs, that he might feel a tenderneſs for Semiramis, be ſenſible of her kindneſs, and that ſhe might facinate him by her charms before he knew her to be his mother; otherwiſe the horror which inceſt inſpires would have been injurious to that character which was to intereſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The ſtyle of Semiramis, the majeſty of the ſubject, the pomp of the exhibition, and the peculiar pathos of ſome of the ſcenes, were triumphant over envy and faction. But it was long before equal juſtice, was rendered to Oreſtes, and Rome Preſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="unknown:024210_0079_0FC55C95722A58A0"/>Complete juſtice, perhaps, has not yet been done; nor can we be ſurpriſed at this, when we recollect that all colleges and all the houſes in which the teachers of youth are themſelves educated are devoted to fanaticiſm, and that children in general are educated in prejudices againſt Voltaire.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three pieces he wrote at Sceaux, the ſeat of the Ducheſs du Maine, who delighted in poetry, gallantry, and the arts; and who, in her palace, preſented a picture of thoſe inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and ſplendid pleaſures which had embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the court of Lewis the XIVth, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his follies. She delighted in Cicero, and prevailed on Voltaire to write his Rome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to avenge the outrage committed on the orator by Crébillon. Mahomet was ſent to the pope, and Semiramis dedicated to a cardinal. He took a ſecret pleaſure in convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the French fanatics that the eccleſiaſtical princes knew how to combine the love of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius with religious zeal, and that they did not think they promoted Chriſtianity by treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe men as its enemies who by their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of mind were the formidable rulers of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic opinion.</p>
                  <p>It was at this period that he, at length, yielded to the invitations of the king of Pruſſia, and accepted the title of Chamberlain, the the grand croſs of the order of merit, and a penſion of 20,000 livres. In his own country, he ſaw himſelf the object of envy and hatred
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:024210_0080_0FC55CA1242FA430"/>
to men of letters, although he never had been their opponent in ſoliciting for places and penſions, never had humbled them by his cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms, nor ever had interfered in literary cabals, but had obliged all who needed his ſervices, had endeavoured to gain their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by praiſing them and taking every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of winning the friendſhip of thoſe whom ſelf-love had rendered unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>The prieſts, who forgot not the Letters on the Engliſh Nation and Mahomet, while they were waiting occaſion to perſecute him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to decry him and his works, and employed their whole aſcendancy over youth againſt him, eſpecially that which, as ſpíritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al directors, they preſerved over private fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and the devotees of the court. Abſolute ſilence only could preſerve him from calumny. He could publiſh no work without being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that malignity would endeavour thence to accuſe him of being impious, or to render him ſuſpected by government. Madame de Pompadour, elevated to a ſituation in which ſhe wiſhed to be ſurrounded by none but ſlaves, forgot their former intimacy. She could not pardon his not having ſuffered with ſufficient patience the preference granted to Crébillon. Louis the XVth had a kind of diſlike to Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, although he had flattered that prince to the injury of his own fame: but kings are, by habit, rendered almoſt inſenſible to public adulation; the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

who, ſeizing every trifling occaſion, repeat their panegyric continually and at the luckieſt moments, is alone ſeducing. This flattery conſiſts leſs in direct praiſe, than in an adroit approbation of the paſſions, inclinations, acts, and ſentiments of the monarch; half a word, a motion, a general maxim which excuſes their follies or their faults, produce greater effects than poetry which is worthy of poſterity. The eulogies of genius ſoothe only thoſe kings who have an actual love of fame.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid that Voltaire, approaching Louis XV. after the repreſentation of the Temple of Fame, in which Trajan after his victories accords peace to the world, and receives the crown which had been refuſed to conquerors and reſerved for the man who was the friend of humanity, thus addreſſed the monarch— Trajan eſt-il content<note n="*" place="bottom">Is Trajan ſatisfied?</note>? and that the king was leſs flattered by the compariſon than offended by the familiarity.</p>
                  <p>M. d'Argenſon refuſed to ſupport Voltaire as a candidate for the title of Free Aſſociate of the Academy of Sciences, and for obtaining a ſeat in the Academy of Belles Lettres, of which place he was at that time ambitious, as a refuge againſt the army of periodical critics who were obliged by the police to treat liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary bodies with reſpect, except when other bodies or powerful individuals thought it their
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:024210_0082_0FC55CA436095408"/>
intereſt to humble them by abandoning them to the attacks of theſe contemptible ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire, therefore, went to Berlin, and the very monarch, who had diſdained him, and the court, in which he had been treated with diſreſpect, were offended at his departure. The loſs of a man who honoured France, and the diſgrace of having obliged him to ſeek an aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in another country, were then only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered. In the palace of the king of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, he found peace and even the ſemblance of freedom; feeling at firſt no kind of ſubjection, except that of paſſing ſome hours with the king to correct his works, and to teach him the art of writing. He uſually ſupped with his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and theſe ſuppers, at which there was free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in exceſs, where every queſtion of meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſics and morals was diſcuſſed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, where the moſt unbounded pleaſantry enlivened, or cut ſerious argument ſhort, and where the king generally diſappeared to give place to the man of wit, were moments of agreeable relaxation to Voltaire. The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his time was conſecrated to ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>Here he improved ſome of his tragedies, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his Age of Louis the XIVth, corrected his poem of the Maid of Orleans, wrote part of his Eſſay on the Manners and Spirit of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and compoſed a poem on Natural Law; while Frederic governed his ſtates without a miniſter, inſpected and improved his army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:024210_0083_0FC55CA5BA5643E0"/>
poetry and muſic, and wrote philoſophy and hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>The royal family encouraged Voltaire in his purſuits; he addreſſed verſes to the princeſſes, acted tragedy with the brothers and ſiſters of the king, and while he taught then to declaim, led them to feel the beauties of French poetry: for poetry ought to be ſpoken aloud; nor can it be underſtood, in a foreign tongue, by thoſe who are not in the habit of hearing it recited by ſpeakers, who can give it that accent and force which are its characteriſtics.</p>
                  <p>This Voltaire called the palace of Alcina; but the enchantment was of too ſhort duration. The men of literature, who had been longer at Berlin than himſelf, were jealous of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which was too conſpicuous, eſpecially of that kind of independence which he preſerved, that familiarity which the charms and brillian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his wit gave him, and that art of ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling truth with panegyric and of imparting to flattery the tone of jocular eaſe.</p>
                  <p>La Métrie told Voltaire that the king, to whom he was one day mentioning thoſe marks of kindneſs he diſcovered for his chamberlain, replied, "I want him at preſent to reviſe my works; but having ſucked the orange, we throw away the rind." When Voltaire heard this, the encantation was over; and his mind felt that kind of ſuſpicion which never ſuffered him to loſe ſight of his project for eſcaping.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the king was informed
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:024210_0084_0FC55CA9917B7E90"/>
that Voltaire, being preſſed by general Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein to reviſe his memoirs, had anſwered, "The king has ſent me his dirty linen to waſh, yours muſt wait;" and that, another time, he had ſaid, in a fit of ill humour, pointing to ſome poetical papers of the king, lying on the table, "That man is Ceſar and the Abbé Cottin."</p>
                  <p>Mutual inclination, however, acted on the monarch and the philoſopher. Frederic ſaid, long after their ſeparation, that he had never met with ſo amiable a man as Voltaire; and Voltaire, notwithſtanding his reſentment, which never was entirely effaced, confeſſed, that when Frederic thought proper, he was the moſt pleaſing of mankind. They likewiſe united in their open contempt for prejudice and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; the pleaſure they look in making them the eternal objects of their jeſts, their common love for that philoſophy which is cheerful and inviting, and their mutual diſpoſition to ſearch and to ſeize on the ridiculous in whatever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſuperior gravity, wire the ſame. Hence it ſhould have ſeemed that the ſtorm muſt have ended in a calm, and that intereſt and pleaſure muſt have continued them in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: but the jealouſy of Maupertuis rendered them irreconcilable.</p>
                  <p>Maupertuis, a man of much wit, but not of too much learning, and of ſtill leſs philoſophy, was tormented by that deſire of fame which makes us chooſe trifling means when the great are wanting, utter paradoxes when we are
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:024210_0085_0FC55CB3FB810840"/>
unable to diſcover truths, generaliſe formula when we cannot invent them, and accumulate incongruities when we are deficient in new ideas. In Paris, he had been ſeen to leave the company, or hide himſelf behind a ſcreen, when he could not continue the principal ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and in like manner at Berlin, whether at the academy of ſciences or the table of the king, he would be the firſt. He was indebted to Voltaire for a great part of his reputation, as well as for the honour of being perpetual preſident of the academy of Berlin, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing authority there in his majeſty's name.</p>
                  <p>Some jeſts which Voltaire had indulged in, when Maupertuis, following the king to the army, was taken priſoner at the battle of Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witz, had angered him, and he vented his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints with ill humour. Voltaire returned a friendly anſwer, and appeaſed him by writing four lines for his portrait. Maupertuis, ſome years afterward, took it much amiſs that Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire had not mentioned him in his diſcourſe, when elected to the French academy; and the arrival of Voltaire at Berlin compleated his diſguſt. He ſaw him the friend of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, in whoſe preſence he himſelf was but a courtier; and beheld him giving leſſons to the man from whom he received orders.</p>
                  <p>Surrounded by enemies, and diffident of the continuance of royal friendſhip, Voltaire ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly regretted, and endeavoured to recover, his loſt independence. He thought proper to
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:024210_0086_0FC55CB5848ACFB0"/>
employ a Jew to transfer a part of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out of Pruſſia. The Jew betrayed his truſt; and, to revenge himſelf on Voltaire, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing detected him, would not ſuffer himſelf to be robbed, he brought an abſurd action, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hatred is not difficult in admitting evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The king, to puniſh his friend for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attempted to preſerve his liberty and property, pretended to believe him guilty, to deliver him up to juſtice, and even to exclude him his preſence till the cauſe ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire addreſſed himſelf to Maupertuis, who had not yet openly teſtified his ſentiments, and requeſted his interference with the chief judge. Maupertuis returned a haughty refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and Voltaire perceived he had another ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. This ridiculous ſuit, at length, ended as it ſhould do; the Jew was condemned, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by Voltaire. The king then admitted Voltaire once more, and added new marks of reſpect to former kindneſs, by beſtowing on him a houſe near Potſdam.</p>
                  <p>The eyes of hatred, however, are always open and watchful of opportunity. La Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melle, a proteſtant, and native of Languedoc, firſt an apprentice to a goſpel miniſter at Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, and afterwards acting the French wit in Denmark, being ſoon diſmiſſed from Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen, came to ſeek his fortune at Berlin; having no other title to fame than that of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lately publiſhed a libel. He went to Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:024210_0087_0FC55CB91DB8EAD0"/>
and preſented the book to him, in which Voltaire himſelf was ill treated, and in which the men of wit, who had been invited into Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, among whom he was come to ſolicit a place, was compared to apes or thoſe dwarfs who had formerly been maintained at certain courts. Such a ridiculous overſight was the momentary object of pleaſantry at the king's ſupper; but the jeſts were reported to La Beaumelle by Maupertuis, who, charging them all to the account of Voltaire, made La Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melle his irreconcilable foe, and ſecured to himſelf a tool, who aided his malice by ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful libels, without bringing the character of the preſident of the academy in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Maupertuis wanted aſſiſtance; he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced the leaſt poſſible action, as a new mechanical principle, which was much contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, though the illuſtrious Euler did it the honour of defending it, and at the ſame time inſtructed its author in its full extent and true uſe. Koënig not only oppoſed it, but aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was not new, and quoted the fragment of a letter from Leibnitz, in which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Maupertuis, having learnt from Koënig himſelf that he had only a copy of the letter from Leibnitz, thought proper formally to ſummons him before the academy of Berlin, to produce the original. Koënig anſwered that he obtained his copy from the unfortunate Hienzi, who had long ſince been beheaded, for having attempted to deliver the people of the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:024210_0088_0FC55CC3CF791AF8"/>
Canton of Bern from the tyranny of the ſenate. The original was not to be found among the remaining papers of Hienzi, and the academy, from motives partly of fear and partly of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, declared Koënig unworthy of the title of academician, and ſtruck him from their liſt. Maupertuis ſeemed not to have known that the general voice of the learned only could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, or take from him, the honour of making a diſcovery, that this opinion muſt be free and voluntary, and that any formal act, by render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſuſpicious, would but diminiſh its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire had been acquainted with Koënig at Cirey, where he came to give leſſons in the doctrines of Leibnitz to Madame du Chatelet. He had preſerved a degree of friendſhip for him, though he had ſometimes indulged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in jeſts to his diſadvantage, during his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in France. He did not love Mauper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis, and hated perſecution, whatever form it might aſſume to torment mankind; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore openly took the the part of Koënig, and publiſhed ſome writings, in which reaſon and juſtice were ſeaſoned by delicate and poignant wit. Maupertuis engaged the vanity of the king in behalf of the honour of his academy, and prevailed on him to exact a promiſe from Voltaire to ridicule neither it nor its preſident. The promiſe was given, but unfortunately the king, who had commanded ſilence, imagined he himſelf might ſpeak. He wrote ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral humourous pieces, which, but with ſome
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:024210_0089_0FC55CC5426A9B48"/>
little inequality, were partly againſt Mauper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis, and partly againſt Voltaire. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imagined that the king, by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, had releaſed him from his promiſe, and that the privilege of being the only one who ſhould laugh was not included in the royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. He, therefore, profited by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral permiſſion which he had formerly obtained, and ſent his Akakia to the preſs, in which Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis was devoted to eternal ridicule.</p>
                  <p>The king laughed. He had little affection, and leſs eſteem for Maupertuis; yet, jealous of his own authority, he cauſed this piece of humour to be burnt by the hangman. This is a mode of vengeance which it is rather ſingular that a philoſophic king ſhould borrow from the inquiſition.</p>
                  <p>The inſulted Voltaire ſent the monarch his croſs, his key, and the patent for his penſion, with the four following lines—</p>

depart. The king, who wiſhed to humble but not to loſe him, ſent him ſome bark, but no permiſſion. He again wrote that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he ſhould go and drink the waters of Plombiers; he was anſwered, thoſe of Sileſia were equally ſalutary.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire, at length, thought proper to aſk to ſee his majeſty, flattering himſelf that by his preſence he could awaken ſentiments which were rather wounded than extinct.</p>
                  <p>The baubles that he had formerly poſſeſſed were returned to him. He haſtened to Potſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaw the king, and a few moments produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a total change. Familiarity revived, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cheerfulneſs was recovered even at the expence of Maupertuis, and Voltaire obtained permiſſion to go to Plombiers, on giving his promiſe to return. This promiſe was not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, very ſincere, but it was leſs obligatory than one given between equals; the hundred and fifty thouſand men, who guarded the Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian frontiers would not ſuffer it to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as given with entire freedom.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire haſtened to Leipſic, where he made ſome ſtay, to recover his ſtrength, which had been exhauſted by this long perſecution. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis ſent him a ridiculous challenge, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effect of which was, that it opened a new ſource to his inexhauſtible pleaſantry. From Leipſic he went to viſit the Ducheſs of Saxe-Gotha, a princeſs, who cultivated letters, loved philoſophy, and was ſuperior to prejudice. At

her requeſt he there began his Annals of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>From Gotha, he departed for Plombiers; and took the road to Frankfort. Maupertuis was determined on revenge; his challenge had been unſucceſsful, and the libels of La Beaumelle he thought inſufficient. This his contemptible ſecond had been obliged to quit Berlin, after a ridiculous adventure and ſome weeks impriſonment. He had fled to Gotha with a chamber-maid, who had robbed the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſhe had left; his libels had driven him from Frankfort; and he had ſcarcely arrived at Paris before he was thrown into the Baſtile. The preſident of the academy at Berlin had therefore to ſeek another avenger. He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered the ill humour of the king.

                  <p>A fear was excited in Frederic's mind that a ſpecies of vengeance, terrible even to a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al poet, would be taken. It was poſſible, at leaſt, that Voltaire should imagine he had a right to reclaim the verſes he had given, and to ſpecify thoſe he had corrected.

Theſe volumes had unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately been left at Leipſic, and Voltaire was kept in cloſe confinement for three weeks. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Dennis his niece, who had come to meet him, was treated with like rigour. Guards were placed at the door, and ſoldier continued in each of their chambers who never ſuffered them to leave his ſight, ſuch fears were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leſt the work of Poeſhys ſhould eſcape. This precious pledge was at length reſtored to Freitag, and Voltaire was releaſed; but not however till he had been obliged to beſtow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on certain adventurers who took that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to commence litigious ſuits: having eſcaped from Frankfort he went to Colmar.</p>
                  <p>The king of Pruſſia, aſhamed of his ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous anger, diſavowed the proceedings of Frei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag, but he had ſo much morality as not to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh him for having obeyed. It is ſtrange that a city, calling itſelf free, ſhould ſuffer a foreign power to commit ſuch vexations within its walls; but freedom and independence are to the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mere words. During the period of his friendſhip for Voltaire, Frederic, in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of enthuſiaſm, has often kiſſed his hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Voltaire, after his impriſonment, compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The only work he publiſhed at Berlin was the age of Louis XIV. which is the ſole hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that reign, which can be read. On the authority of the the old courtiers of Louis XIV. or of thoſe who had lived in intimacy with them, he there relates a ſmall number of anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes ſelected with diſcernment, and ſuch as ſerve to paint the ſpirit and character of the perſons of the age. Political and military events are given in a rapid, intereſting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the picture abounds with bold ſtrokes. In ſome chapters, he recounts the attempts which Louis XIV. made for the improvement of the laws and finances, and for the encouragement of trade and induſtry; and we ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Voltaire for having, on this occaſion, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the opinions of the moſt enlighted men of his own times, inſtead of that knowledge which did not then exiſt.</p>
                  <p>His chapters on Calviniſm, Janſeniſm, Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, and the diſpute on the Chineſe ceremonies, are models of the manner in which a prudent friend of truth ought to treat theſe maladies ſo diſgraceful to man, when the number or the power of the diſeaſed is ſuch as to make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary gently to raiſe the veil which conceals their deformity. We have only to reproach him with too much ſeverity againſt the Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, whoſe enormities proceeded from ſelf-defence, and whoſe crimes were but a kind of
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:024210_0094_0FC55CD678105738"/>
repriſal of juridical murders committed on them in certain provinces.</p>
                  <p>The diſcoveries made in the ſciences, and the progreſs of the arts, Voltaire related with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, preciſion, and impartiality; and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions continually appeared dictated by a free and ſound mind, and a mild indulgent philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</p>
                  <p>The catalogue of the writers of the age of Louis XIV. was an original thought. It had never before entered the imagination, thus, by a trait or a few lines, to paint men of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, philoſophers and poets, without dryneſs or affectation, with taſte ſeldom miſtaken, and accuracy ever poignant.</p>
                  <p>The work brought foreign nations aquainted with Louis XIV. among whom he had been disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by a multitude of libels, and taught them to reſpect a people whom they had previouſly viewed through the falſe medium of prejudice, jealouſy, and hatred. The countrymen of Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire were leſs indulgent. Such as were ſlaves from condition or character were highly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a Frenchman ſhould dare to diſcover follies in Louis XIV. Prejudiced people were angry at the freedom with which he treated the miſtakes of generals, and the defects of great writers; and others, who in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects were more juſt, reproached him with too much indulgence or enthuſiaſm. But hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is never impartially judged in the country to which it relates, the deciſions of whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:024210_0095_0FC55CDA0628F720"/>
are continually perverted by jarring intereſts and pre-conceived falſe ideas.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire paſſed near two years in Alſatia, during which he publiſhed his Annals of the Empire, the only chronologic abridgment which can be read without wearineſs, becauſe it is written in a rapid ſtyle and abounds with philoſophic deductions, expreſſed with energy. Thus Voltaire has given a model of that kind of writing, the merit and utility of which his friendſhip for the Preſident Hénault induced him to exaggerate.</p>
                  <p>He thought, at firſt, of ſettling in Alſatia; but, unfortunately, the Jeſuits attempted to convert him, and, not ſucceeding, began to diſſeminate calumniating rumours which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke perſecution. Voltaire endeavoured to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not permiſſion to return to Paris, for this he had never been forbidden, but an aſſurance that he ſhould not be diſagreeable to the court. He knew Fance too well not to be ſenſible that, odious as he was by his love of truth to all powerful bodies, he muſt ſoon become the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their perſecution, would the court ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to be oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer was not to his ſatisfaction. Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire found himſelf unprotected in his own country, though his name ſupported its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, at that time degraded throughout Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope by ridiculous quarrels concerning Billets of Confeſſion; and at the very moment when, by his publication of the Age of Louis XV.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:024210_0096_0FC55CE40456FA28"/>
he had erected a monument to its glory. He determined to go and drink the waters of Aix, in Savoy. Paſſing through Lyons, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal de Tencin, famous for the converſion of Laſs and the council of Embrun, informed him he could not invite him to dinner, becauſe Voltaire was out of favour at court. But the inhabitants of that opulent city, in which the ſpirit of trade has not effaced the love of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, recompenſed him for the politic incivility of their archbiſhop. He there received thoſe honours which public enthuſiaſm pays to genius. His pieces were played before him, amid the loud acclamations of a people, inebriated with the joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of poſſeſſing the man to whom they were indebted for ſuch dignified pleaſures. But he durſt not fix his abode at Lyons; the conduct of the Cardinal informed him he was not far enough from his enemies.</p>
                  <p>Paſſing through Geneva, to conſult with Tronchin, the beauty of the country, the equality which appeared to prevail there, the advantage of being out of France, and in a city where French was the language of the people, the freedom of thought which was greater than in a monarchical or catholic coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the liberty of the preſs, founded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed leſs on the laws than on the intereſts of trade, all determined him to fix his retreat in that place.</p>
                  <p>But he ſoon perceived that a city in which the pedantic and auſtere ſpirit of Calvin had
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:024210_0097_0FC55CE57A2E8FD0"/>
taken deep root, where the vanity of imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ancient republics, and the jealouſy of the poor againſt the rich had eſtabliſhed ſumptuary laws, where theatrical exhibitions offended both Calviniſtic fanaticiſm, and republican rigour, would to him neither be a ſafe nor an agreeable reſidence. He determined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a place of refuge in the territories of Geneva againſt Catholic perſecution, and a retreat in France againſt puritanical gloom, and accordingly to live alternately at Tourney, ſince called Ferney, in France, and the Delices at the gates of Geneva.</p>
                  <p>Here he fixed his abode with Madame Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis his niece; who, being a widow without children, was free to indulge her friendſhip for her uncle, and to acknowledge the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which he had rendered her circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances eaſy. She took on herſelf the charge of his domeſtic affairs; and, to increaſe his tranquillity, by relieving him from ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing trifles. This was the only aid he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; labour was to him an inexhauſtible ſource of enjoyment; and freedom was all he wanted to render his moments happy.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto, we have written the tempeſtuous life of a philoſophic poet, whoſe lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

been guided by the ſenſations of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the reſult of any plan which reaſon had formed.</p>
                  <p>In his preſent retirement, removed from illuſion and whatever could excite momentary or perſonal paſſion, we ſhall ſee him yield en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to his prevailing and inceſſant love of fame, to the ſtill more potent neceſſity his mind felt of being productive, and to his zeal for the deſtruction of prejudice, which was indeed the moſt powerful and active of all the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he felt. This peaceful life, ſeldom diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, and then by the threats of perſecution, rather than perſecution itſelf, we ſhall ſee adorned not only, like his youth, by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of private benevolence, a quality common to all men whoſe hearts have hot been harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and minds corrupted by misfortune or van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, but by thoſe acts of enlightened and bold benevolence, which, while they relieve the ſufferings of certain individuals, are of ſervice to the whole human race.</p>

of the moſt barbarous times, which England dared to give in this age of humanity and knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The firſt work he ſent from his retreat was the Orphan of China, a tragedy written dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reſidence in Alſatia, at a time when he hoped he might have been allowed to live at Paris, and was deſirous of theatrical ſucceſs to ſecure his friends and impoſe ſilence on his foes.</p>
                  <p>In the commencement of the tragic art, poets were certain of aſtoniſhing the mind by giving to the characters ſentiments contrary to nature, and by ſacrificing the true feelings of the heart to the more uncommon love of fame, exaggerated patriotiſm, and devoted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to princes.</p>

The audience heſitated, and the voice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture needed the aid of reflexion in order to be heard. Thus can a great poet ſometimes decide the mind between ancient errors and truths, which to vanquiſh wavering yet ſtill oppoſing prejudice, is obliged ſo wait for new ſupport. Men often dare not confeſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that ſlow progreſs which reaſon makes in their minds; but they are ready to follow her when, appearing in a ſtrong and effective manner, they are obliged to acknowledge her preſence. Thus, theſe ſame verſes have ſince been continually heard with tranſport, and Voltaire enjoyed the pleaſure of having aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged nature.</p>
                  <p>This play is the triumph of virtue over power, and of the laws over arms. Till then, Mahomet excepted, no poet had ſucceſsfully made one of theſe men, whoſe fame appears awful, and whoſe characters preſent the picture of extraordinary ſtrength of ſoul, in love without degradation. Voltaire, a ſecond time conquered this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the love of Gengis Khan is intereſting in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:024210_0101_0FC56A5D44C9D868"/>
of the violence and ferocity of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe it is true and impaſſioned, becauſe it wreſts from him a confeſſion of the vacancy his heart felt amid all his power, and becauſe he at laſt ſacrificed his love to fame, and his thirſt of conqueſt to the charms, before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, of pacific virtues.</p>
                  <p>The repoſe of Voltaire was ſoon diſturbed by the publication of the Maid of Orleans. This poem, in which licentiouſneſs and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy are combined, and truth aſſumes the maſk of ſatiric and voluptuous humour, was begun about the year 1730, but had never been finiſhed. The author had intruſted what he had written of it only to a few of his friends, and to ſome princes. The rumour of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence had brought down menace on him; and, by not finiſhing it, he took the ſureſt means to avoid the dangerous temptation of making it public. Copies unfortunately got abroad, one of which fell into inimical and ſelfiſh hands, and the work appeared not only with ſuch defects as the author had left; but with lines added by the editors full of groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ill taſte, and with ſatiric traits which might endanger the ſafety of Voltaire. The deſire of gain, the pleaſure of attributing their own wretched verſes to a great poet, and the more malignant pleaſure of expoſing him to perſecution, were the motives of this act of infidelity, the honour of which was divided between la Beaumelle and the Ex Capuchin Maubert.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="unknown:024210_0102_0FC56A6166C39198"/>They ſucceeded only ſo far as to trouble that repoſe for a moment which they wiſhed to deſtroy. His friends evaded the perſecution, by proving the work to be ſpurious, and the hatred of the editors ſerved him whom it meant to wound.</p>
                  <p>This, however, obliged Voltaire to finiſh the poem, and preſent a work to the world, at which the author of Mahomet and the age of Louis XIV. need not bluſh. The work ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited lively feelings of enthuſiaſm in a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous claſs of readers, while the foes of Voltaire affected to decry it as unworthy of a philoſopher, and almoſt as a blemiſh on the writings and the life of a poet.</p>
                  <p>But, if it be uſeful to render ſuperſtition ridiculous in the eyes of men addicted to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs, and by the very weakneſs which hurries them into diſſipation deſtined ſome time to become the unfortunate victims or the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tools of this vile tyrant of men, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of auſterity in manners, if the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive value attached to their purity, be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only to hypocrites who, wearing the maſk of chaſtity, may neglect every other virtue, and caſt a ſacred veil over the moſt pernicious vices of ſociety, ſuch as intolerance and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, if accuſtoming the world to regard thoſe errors from which men of honour and conſcience are not exempt as crimes, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that dangerous ſect, who govern and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the world be extended over the pureſt

minds by their having excluſively rendered themſelves the interpreters of celeſtial juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, we ſhall then only behold in the author of the Maid of Orleans the foe of hypocriſy and ſuperſtition.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire himſelf, when ſpeaking of la Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine, has well remarked that works, in which voluptuouſneſs and humour are mingled, amuſe without heating or ſeducing the imagination. And if ſuch works be ſources of pleaſure to the fancy, which lighten the uneaſy moments of life, diminiſh the misfortunes of privation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend a mind fatigued by labour, and fill up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in which the weary and ſunken ſoul can neither act nor meditate with effect, wherefore rob men of an aid which nature preſents? What will be the effect of ſuch reading? No other than that of diſpoſing men to more mildneſs and indulgence. It was not ſuch books that Gérard or Clement read; or that the ſcouts of Cromwell carried in the pommels of their ſaddles.</p>
                  <p>Two works very different in themſelves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the ſame epoch: the poem on Natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law, and the poem of the Deſtruction of Liſbon. To diſplay morals, the principles of which reaſon teaches all men which are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by their hearts, and which remorſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms them it is their duty to practice; to ſhow that theſe are the principles which God, the common father of men, alone could impart, ſince they alone are uniform; to prove that the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:024210_0104_0FC56A6570904BF8"/>
duty of individuals is mutually to pardon their miſtakes, and that of ſovereigns to prevent the pernicious tendency of thoſe vain opinions which fanaticiſm and hypocriſy ſupport, by wiſely treating them all with indifference; ſuch is the purport of the poem on Natural Law.</p>
                  <p>This work, the fineſt which man ever conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the Deity, excited the anger of the devotees, who called it the poem of Natural Religion; though Religion is only mentioned in order to oppoſe intolerance, and though there is no ſuch a thing as natural religion. It was burnt by the parliament of Paris, which began to be terrified as well at the progreſs of reaſon as at that of Moliniſm. Under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, at this period, of men who were either blinded by pride or falſe policy, it imagined it would be more eaſy to impede the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of knowledge than to merit the applauſe of the enlightened. It felt not the want itſelf had of the good opinion of the public; it miſconſtrued thoſe who were to be its guides, and declared itſelf the enemy of men of letters, at that preciſe moment when the ſuffrage of theſe men in France, and even over all Europe, began to acquire influence.</p>
                  <p>However the poem of Voltaire, which has ſince been commented on in various celebrated books, is ſtill that in which the connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween morality and the being of a God is moſt clearly demonſtrated. Thirty years later and the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:024210_0105_0FC56A68861F3708"/>
book which was burnt as impious, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt have appeared a work of religion.</p>
                  <p>In the poem on the Deſtruction of Liſbon, Voltaire indulged thoſe ſentiments of terror and melancholy which this dreadful accident inſpired. He led the tranquil ſect of Optimiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid theſe fearful ruins, combated their cold and puerile doctrine with the indignation of a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher deeply ſenſible of the ſufferings of mankind, expoſed the difficulties on the origin of evil in their full force, and avowed it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to be ſolved by man.</p>
                  <p>This poem, in which at the age of more than ſixty the mind of Voltaire, warmed by a love of humanity, diſplays all the ſtrength and fire of youth, was not the only work in which he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Optimiſm. He publiſhed Candide, the firſt of philoſophic romances; which ſpecies of writing he brought from England, and added to its perfection. It is a kind of compoſition which appears eaſy of execution, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an uncommon talent; that of expreſſing by a jeſt, a flight of the fancy, or by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of the romance, the reſult of profound philoſophy, without ceaſing to be natural, pleaſing, and accurate. Hence it is neceſſary to ſelect ſuch effects as need neither develope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor proof, and at once to avoid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place unworthy of repetition, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction which is too deep or too new, and which is not adapted to the multitude: that is, it is neceſſary to be, without appearing to be, a philoſopher.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="unknown:024210_0106_0FC56A6B7707A968"/>We may add, few books of philoſophy are more uſeful. Such romances are read by frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous men, whom the very name of philoſopher diſguſts or renders gloomy, and who, however, it is requiſite ſhould be freed from prejudice, and made the opponents of the herd who are intereſted in its defence. The human race would be condemned to eternal error if, to free them from it, it were neceſſary to ſtudy and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the proofs of truth. Fortunately the native intelligence of the mind is ſufficient for the comprehending of thoſe ſimple truths which are the moſt eſſential. It is therefore ſufficient to diſcover ſome means of fixing the attention of the indolent, and of engraving theſe truths in their memory; and this is the great uſe of philoſophic romances, and the merit of thoſe in which Voltaire has alike ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed his imitators and his models.</p>
                  <p>Candide was ſoon followed by a free tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the book of Eccleſiaſtes, and a part of the ſong of Solomon.</p>
                  <p>Madame de Pompadour had been perſuaded that it would be profoundly politic for her to aſſume the maſk of devotion, by which ſhe might ſhield herſelf from the ſcruples and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of the king, and at the ſame time calm the hatred of the people. She wiſhed to make Voltaire an actor in this farce. The duke de la Valiere propoſed to him to tranſlate the Pſalms, the book of Proverbs, Solomon's ſong, and the Eccleſiaſtes. The edition was to have
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024210_0107_0FC56A71D3113DA8"/>
been printed at the Louvre, and the author to have returned to Paris under the protection of the religious favorite. But Voltaire could not act the hypocrite, not even to be made a cardinal, ſome hopes of which were given him about this time. Such propoſals generally come too late; and were they made in time, the policy of them would not be very certain. He who muſt be a dangerous enemy might become a ſtill more dangerous ally. Let us ſuppoſe Calvin or Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called to the purple, when they might have accepted the dignity without diſgrace, and let us imagine what would have been the conſequence. The baubles of vanity do not ſatiate ſouls impelled by the ambition of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the minds of men; they do but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply new arms.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire, however, was tempted to make eſſays in tranſlation; not to recover his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repute, but to exerciſe himſelf in another ſpecies of compoſition. When they appeared, the devout imagined he only had intended to parody that which he had tranſlated, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it was ſhameful. They did not imagine that Voltaire had ſoftened and purified the text; that his Eccleſiaſtes had leſs of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of materialiſm than the original; and that his ſong of ſongs was leſs indecent than the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred text. Theſe works were therefore once more burnt, for which Voltaire avenged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a ſatiric and humuorous letter, in which he mocked at the hypocriſy of morals, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:024210_0108_0FC56A757708F188"/>
vice of the modern nations of Europe, which has contributed more than is imagined to deſtroy that energy of character by which the ancients were diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>In 1757, the firſt edition of his works, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually made under his own inſpection, was print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He reviſed it with rigorous attention, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſome of his numerous fugitive pieces with ſeverity, but with judgment, and added his immortal Eſſay on the Manners and Spirit of Nations.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire had long complained that among the moderns eſpecially, the hiſtory of a country was that of its kings, or its chiefs; that it ſpoke only of wars, treaties, and civil commotions; and that the hiſtory of morals, arts, ſciences, legiſlation, and political government, had been almoſt forgotten. Thoſe very ancients in whoſe writings we find moſt of morals, and internal politics, have only in general added, to the hiſtory of wars, that of popular factions. We imagine, while we read ſuch hiſtorians, that the human race was created only to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the political or military talents of a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals; and that the object of ſociety is not the happineſs of the ſpecies, but the pleaſure of having revolutions to read, or to relate.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire formed the plan of a hiſtory which ſhould contain all that was moſt important for men to know: ſuch as the effects produced on the peace and happineſs of nations, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, knowledge, virtues, and vices, and the cuſtoms and the arts of different ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="unknown:024210_0109_0FC56A76DC744958"/>He choſe the period from Charlemagne to the preſent century; but, not confining himſelf ſolely to European nations, he intereſted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the reader by an abridged retroſpect of the ſtate of the other parts of the globe; the revolutions they had undergone, and the opinions by which they had been governed.</p>
                  <p>It was to reconcile Madame du Chatelet to the ſtudy of hiſtory, that he had undertaken this immenſe labour, which obliged him to read books of erudition, ſuch as would have been ſuppoſed incompatible with the livelineſs of his fancy, and the activity of his mind. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that he ſhould ſerve the human race ſupported him, and erudition was not dull to a man who, having the ſagacity to detect and amuſe himſelf with the ridiculous, found an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible ſource of this in the ſpeculative or practical doctrines of our anceſtors; and in the follies of thoſe who have tranſmitted or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented on them, while admiring them either with ſincerity or hypocriſy equally laughable.</p>
                  <p>Such a work could pleaſe none but philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. It was accuſed of being frivolous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was clear, and read without labour; and of being inaccurate, becauſe there are ſome errors of names and dates diſcoverable in it, which in themſelves are things abſolutely indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Yet it has been proved, by the very reproaches of his bittereſt critics, that, in a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory ſo extenſive, no writer was ever more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act.
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:024210_0110_0FC56A784C4FFE28"/>
He was often taxed with partiality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he exclaimed againſt thoſe prejudices which puſillanimity or meanneſs had too long reſpected; and it is eaſy to ſhow that, far from exaggerating the crimes of ſacerdotal deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, he has rather diminiſhed their number, and ſoftened their atrocity. In fine, it was taken amiſs that, in a picture of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly of man, he has ſometimes indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in ſtrokes of pleaſantry; and that he has not always ſpoken ſeriouſly of human extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; as if that which is often dangerous ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore to be abſurd.</p>
                  <p>Theſe prejudices, which it was the intereſt of powerful bodies to diſſeminate, are not yet eradicated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The habit of generally ſeeing dulneſs and preciſion combined, and, by the ſide of critical diciſion of finding the inſipid ſcaffolding on which it was reared, has given birth to the other habit of thinking nothing accurate which is not pedantic. We are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſee gloomy ſtupidity accompany hiſtorical preciſion; as we ſee men of certain profeſſions always cloathed in black. But men of genius derive no ſatisfaction from a merit which fools can claim as eaſily as themſelves; and this merit they are ſuppoſed not to poſſeſs, becauſe they alone forbear to vaunt of it. The Travels of the young Anacharſis will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps efface this too commonly received opinion.</p>
                  <p>But the eſſay of Voltaire will ever remain,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:024210_0111_0FC56A7A17BF50B0"/>
to men of reaſon, a work delightful by the choice of its materials, by the rapidity of its ſtyle, by that love of truth and humanity which is conſpicuous in every page, and by the art of preſenting contraſted pictures, and unexpected ſimilarities, without ceaſing to be eaſy and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; as well as by deducing, in language ever ſimple, grand conſequences, and making profound reflexions The author has not given the hiſtory of ages, but that which we wiſh to remember of hiſtory; that which the mind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to recollect.</p>
                  <p>Few books would be more uſeful, in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional plan of education. While we read the the facts, we here are taught the art of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them truly, of exerciſing the native inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the mind, without which man is but the ſervile inſtrument of prejudice, and of contemning ſuperſtition, fearing fanaticiſm, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting intolerance, and hating tyranny, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing to love peace, and that mildneſs of manners which is as neceſſary to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mankind as is the wiſdom of legiſlation itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto, in private or public education, which alike are guided by prejudice, youth have ſtudied hiſtory as disfigured by vile or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious compilers; and though, ſince the publication of the eſſay of Voltaire, two men, the Abbé de Condillac and the Abbé Millot, have merited not to be numbered in this claſs, yet, reſtrained by their ſituation, they have
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024210_0112_0FC56A7D84D2B9D8"/>
left the reader too much to divine: in order to underſtand them, we ought not to have any need of their inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>This work placed Voltaire in the claſs of original hiſtorians; and he has the honour of having effected a revolution in the manner of writing hiſtory, by which England indeed has hitherto only profited. Hume, Robertſon, Gibbon, and Watſon, may, in ſome reſpects, be conſidered as his ſcholars. The hiſtory of Voltaire has another advantage: which is, that it may be taught in England as well as in Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and in Virginia as conſiſtently as at Bern or Venice. He has inſerted none but ſuch truths as every ſpecies of government may adopt. He only requires that human reaſon ſhould have the right of improving itſelf; that the citizen ſhould enjoy his natural freedom; and that the laws ſhould be mild and the religion tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. He addreſſes himſelf to all mankind, and ſays nothing which nay not enlighten them all, without offence to any of thoſe opinions which are ſo connected with the conſtitution and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual intereſt of a country as not to yield to reaſon, till ſuch, time as the deſtruction of more general error ſhall have rendered the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of truth leſs difficult.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="unknown:024210_0113_0FC56A7F17008CC0"/>
had accuſed him of being the enemy of liberty. In theſe pieces, in which refined gaiety, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate feeling, and gallantry ſucceſſively appear, Voltaire ſought not to be a poet; yet every ſpecies of poetic beauty flowed from his pen when he thought not of them; he did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſplay philoſophy, yet throughout the whole is to be found whatever is ſuited to the ſubject, to the ſituation, and the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In ſuch poetic effuſions, as in romances, the philoſophy of the work ſhould appear leſs extenſive than the philoſophy of the author. It is with theſe writings as with elementary books which cannot be well written if the author's knowledge does not embrace more than that which they contain; and therefore, although theſe works are regarded as frivolous, thoſe of them which ſtand in the firſt rank are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced only by men of ſuperior minds.</p>
                  <p>This ſame year was the epoch of a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation between Voltaire and his royal diſciple; the Auſtrians, already in the heart of Sileſia, were on the point of completing the conqueſt of it; a French army was on the frontiers of Brandenbourgh: the Ruſſians, maſters of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, threatened to overrun Pomerania and the Marches. The Pruſſian monarchy ſeemed to be annihilated; and the prince, who had been the author of its ſplendour, appeared to have no other reſource than to inter himſelf beneath its ruins, and to preſerve his glory by periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the moment of a victory.</p>

The aged politician, who would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly invite Voltaire to his table in deference to the court, could not baniſh his chagrin when he found that he had offended the court by his complaiſance to Voltaire; and it ſhortened his
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:024210_0115_0FC56A8453666A58"/>
days. In his youth, more perilous adventures had only ſerved to animate his talent for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, becauſe then hope ſuſtained him, and he was among the number of men who find in power and rank a conſolation for ſhame; but, in this affair, he beheld the laſt thread deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which connected him with royal power.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire commenced another negociation, through the medium of the Marechal de Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu, but it was equally fruitleſs. A third, ſome years later, was ſo far ſucceſsful as to obtain the conſent of M. de Choiſeul to receive a ſecret envoy from the King of Pruſſia. This envoy was diſcovered by the agents of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs queen, and either through the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the French miniſter, or that M. de Choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeul had acted without conſulting Madame de Pompadour, he was arreſted and his papers ſearched: a violation of the law of nations which is forgotten in the multitude of inferior crimes which politicians commit without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.</p>
                  <p>During this period, ſo dangerous and ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the King of Pruſſia, Voltaire appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at one time to reaſſume his former influence over the monarch, at another to preſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the remembrance of the affair of Frankfort; and it was then that he wrote thoſe remarkable memoirs <note n="*" place="bottom">We have added them as an appendix to this life.</note> in which neither good humour nor juſtice are loſt in the lively recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:024210_0116_0FC56A86AD103588"/>
of a juſt reſentment. Voltaire had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly condemned them to oblivion: chance preſerved them to avenge genius for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of power.</p>
                  <p>The Margraveſs of Bareith died in the midſt of the war. The King of Pruſſia wrote to Voltaire, and requeſted him to confer an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality on the name of his ſiſter, of which her mild and amiable virtues, her ſoul equally ſuperior to prejudices, to grandeur, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, had rendered her worthy. The ode, which Voltaire conſecrated to her memory, breathes a ſoft ſenſibility, and a ſimple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting philoſophy. This ſpecies of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is one of thoſe in which he was the leaſt ſucceſsful, becauſe it requires a degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he could never reſolve to aim at in trifling works, and becauſe his reaſon could not yield at pleaſure to that enthuſiaſm which is ſaid to be the characteriſtic of the ode. The odes of Voltaire are only fugitive pieces, in which we find the great and philoſophic poet, but in which we perceive him embaraſſed and conſtrained by a form which ill agreed with the fire of his genius. However, it muſt be owned that his verſes addreſſed to a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>France, ſo ſuperior to other nations in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy and comedy, has not been equally happy in lyric poets. The odes of Rouſſeau ſcarcely preſent us with any thing more than a ſeductive and harmonious poetry, which is void of idea or filled with falſe thoughts. La Motte, more ingenious, was yet a ſtranger to the harmony and the graces of ſtyle; and we ſcarcely cite the verſes of any other poet.</p>

have recourſe for the ideas of the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and celebrated writers; in which, in ſhort, the errors, that are reſpected by prejudice, would either be betrayed by the weakneſs of their proofs, or ſhaken by the near neighbourhood of truths which ſap their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire, having retired to Ferney, gave a ſmall number of literary articles to the Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopedia; he prepared ſome of thoſe on philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic ſubjects, but with leſs zeal, becauſe he felt that the editors had leſs need of his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance there, and becauſe that, in general, though his great works in verſe had been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſtitute his glory, he had ſcarcely ever written in proſe but with views of univerſal utility. Mean while, the ſame reaſons which intereſted Voltaire for the progreſs of the Encyclopedia raiſed that work innumerable enemies. Compoſed or applauded by the greateſt men of the nation, it became a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of line which ſeparated the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed literati, and thoſe who had the honour of being their diſciples or their friends, from that crowd of obſcure and jealous writers, who, in the ſorrowful incapacity of giving either new truths or new pleaſures to the world, hate and calumniate men to whom nature has been more bountiful.</p>
                  <p>A work in which it was neceſſary to treat freely and boldly of divinity, of morality, of juriſprudence, of legiſlation, and of public
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:024210_0119_0FC56A91F12705E8"/>
economy, could not but terrify all religious or political parties, and all the ſubordinate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which feared to ſee their pretenſions and utility diſcuſſed. The inſurrection was general, The journal of Trévoux, the eccleſiaſtic ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, the ſatiric journals, the Jeſuiſts and Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſts, the clergy, the parliaments, all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing to hate or oppoſe each other, united againſt the Encyclopedia, and it fell. The editors were obliged to finiſh and to print, in ſecret this work, to whoſe perfection liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and publicity were ſo eſſential; and one of the nobleſt undertakings which the human mind has ever conceived, would have remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiſhed but for the courage of Diderot, and the zeal of a great number of men of diſtinguiſhed learning, whom perſecution could not deter.</p>
                  <p>Happily, the honour of having given the Encyclopedia to Europe, compenſated France for the ſhame of having oppoſed its progreſs. It was, with juſtice, regarded as the work of the nation, and its perſecution as that of a policy and jealouſy equally deſpicable.</p>
                  <p>But the conteſts which the Encyclopedia had occaſioned did not ceaſe with the proſcription of that work. Its principal authors and their friends, marked by the name of philoſophers and Encyclopediſts, which was deſigned as an opprobrium by the enemies of reaſon, were compelled to unite even by this very perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Voltaire naturally became their lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by his age, his celebrity, his zeal, and his
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:024210_0120_0FC56A95EA3023F0"/>
genius. He had long before enjoyed ſome friends and a great number of admirers; at that period, he had a party. The perſecution rallied, under his ſtandard all the men of merit, whom, perhaps, his ſuperiority would have kept at a diſtance from him, as it had baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their predeceſſors; and enthuſiaſm took the place of former injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>It was in the year 1760 that this literary war was moſt violent. Le Franc de Pompig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, an eſtimable man of letters but an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent poet, of whoſe works there remain a fine ſtanza, and a feeble tragedy in which the combined genius of Virgil and Metaſtaſio could not yield him ſufficient ſupport, was elected one of the French academy. Cloathed with the honours of magiſtracy, he thought that his dignity, as well as his works, exempted him from all gratitude; in the diſcourſe, which he delivered at his admiſſion, he permitted himſelf to inſult the men whoſe names did the greateſt honour to the ſociety that condeſcended to receive him; and, clearly pointing out Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire accuſed him of infidelity and falſehood. Soon after, Paliſſot, the venal inſtrument of the rancour of a woman, exhibited the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers on the ſtage. The laws, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the ridiculing individuals at the theatre, were ſilent. The magiſtrates betrayed their duty, and ſaw, with a malignant joy, men, whoſe knowledge and influence on public opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion they dreaded, immolated in the ſcene,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:024210_0121_0FC56A996B0D9F28"/>
without recollecting that while they opened the way to ſatire they expoſed themſelves to its ſhafts. Crébillon diſgraced his old age, by approving the piece. The Duke de Choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeul, then the favourite miniſter, countenanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this indignity, through a weak complaiſance to the ſame woman, of whoſe reſentment Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſot was the inſtrument. The journals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the inſults of the theatre. Still Voltaire combated all. The Poor Devil, the Ruſſian at Paris, Vanity, a croud of humourous pieces in proſe ſucceeded each other with aſtoniſhing rapidity.</p>
                  <p>Le Franc de Pompignan complained to the king, and to the academy, and beheld, with an impotent grief, that his own name was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the ſplendour of that of Voltaire. Each ſtep he took did but increaſe the ſatire, which every tongue repeated, and the verſes in which he is conſigned to eternal ridicule. He made a formal propoſal to an auguſt patron, to break a promiſe which he had made to this patron himſelf, by returning to the academy, to vote for a man. in whoſe behalf the prince was intereſted. He received, in return for this ſacrifice, a polite refuſal, and had the mortification to hear his patron himſelf repeat, as he withdrew, the lines ſo terrible to him:
<q>Et I' ami Pompignan penſe être quelque choſe!<note n="*" place="bottom">What, does friend Pompignan think himſelf ſomebody!</note>:</q>
                     <pb n="123" facs="unknown:024210_0122_0FC56A9B3580CAE8"/>
and he retired to bury his humbled pride and deceived ambition in the country: a fearful, but ſalutary, example of the power of genius and the dangers of literary hypocriſy.</p>
                  <p>Fréron, an ex-jeſuit as well as Desfontains, had ſucceeded the latter in the trade of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, by periodical ſatires, the jealouſy of the enemies of virtue, of reaſon, and of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. He diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the war againſt the philoſophers. Voltaire, who had long ſupported his outrages, at length did ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and avenged his friends. In the comedy of l' Ecoſſaiſe (the Scotch-woman) he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a depraved journaliſt, whoſe character was formed of venality and rancour. The pit, in the character, recognized Fréron, who, delivered over to public diſdain in a piece which could not fail to be preſerved to the theatre by intereſting ſcenes, and the original and forcible character of the worthy blunt Freeport, was condemned to bear, during the remainder of his life, a ridiculous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced name. Fréron, in applauding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult offered to the philoſophers, had forfeited his right of complaining; and his protectors choſe rather to abandon him than to avow a partiality which might have involved their own diſcredit.</p>
                  <p>Other enemies, leſs virulent, had been either corrected or puniſhed; and Voltaire, triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midſt of theſe victims ſacrificed to reaſon and to his glory, ſent to the theatre,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:024210_0123_0FC56A9E8AB06788"/>
at the age of ſixty-ſix, the chef-d'oeuvre of Tancred. That tragedy was dedicated to the Marchioneſs de Pompadour. It was the fruit of the addreſs with which Voltaire could, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding the Duke de Choiſeul, ſupport the cauſe of the philoſophers, whoſe adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had obtained a flight protection from that miniſter. This dedication taught his enemies that their calumnies were not more injurious to his ſecurity than their criticiſms to his fame: it completed his vengeance.</p>
                  <p>In this ſame year he learned that a young niece of Corneille languiſhed in a condition unworthy of his name; "It is the duty of a ſoldier" he cried, "to ſuccour the niece of his general." Mademoiſelle Corneille was invited to Ferney; and ſhe there received an education ſuitable to the rank that her birth had marked for her in ſociety. Voltaire even carried his delicacy ſo far as not to ſuffer the eſtabliſhment of Mademoiſelle Corneille to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as his benefaction. He wiſhed that ſhe ſhould owe that to the works of her uncle, and he undertook to publiſh an edition of them with notes. The creator of the French Theatre commented on by the writer who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted that theatre to it's perfection, a man of genius, born at a time when taſte was not yet formed, judged by a rival who joined to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius the gift, almoſt as rare, of a taſte that was penetrating without ſeverity, delicate without timidity, and enlightened by a long
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:024210_0124_0FC56AA0308090A0"/>
and happy experience of the art, theſe are the beauties preſented in that work. Voltaire ſpeaks in it of Corneille's defects with frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of his beauties with enthuſiaſm. Never has Corneille been examined with ſuch rigour, never has he been praiſed with a feeling more profound and true. Reſolved to inſtruct both the French youth and the youth of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries who cultivate the French literature, he did not pardon the vices of language, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, nor the offences committed againſt delicacy and good taſte, which are found in Corneille; but, at the ſame time, he taught them to know the progreſs which the art owes to that writer, the uncommon elevation of his mind, the almoſt inimitable beauty of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry in the morſels dictated by his genius, and thoſe vaſt, ſublime, words which ſpring ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly from the neceſſity of the occaſion, and paint great characters with a ſingle ſtroke.</p>
                  <p>The herd of writers reproached him, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, with a deſign of degrading Corneille, from motives of mean jealouſy; whereas, throughout the whole of his commentary, he ſeizes, he even ſeems to ſeek, occaſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his admiration of Racine; a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rival, whom he has ſurpaſſed only in ſome parts of the tragic art, and whoſe prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious excellence he might well envy in the height of his glory.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire, tranquil in his retreat, employed in continuing the happy war which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:024210_0125_0FC56AA18F9BB270"/>
againſt prejudice, ſaw the arrival of an unfortunate family, the father of which had been conducted to the wheel by fanatic judges; the inſtruments of the ferocious paſſions of a ſuperſtitious people. He learnt that Calas, an infirm old man, had been accuſed of having hanged his young and vigorous ſon, in the midſt of his family, and in the preſence of a catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervant; that he had been urged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this crime by the fear of ſeeing this ſon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the catholic religion, this ſon who ſpent his life in diſſipation, and of whom no one in the midſt of the univerſal efferveſcence could ever cite a ſingle word, or point to a ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which announced ſuch a deſign, while ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſon of Calas, already converted to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic faith, enjoyed a penſion from the bounty this father, who was far from poſſeſſing afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Never, in an event of ſuch a nature, had circumſtances ſo concurred to baniſh the ſuſpicion of a crime in the father, or to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the reaſons to aſcribe ſuicide to the ſon. The young man's conduct, his character, the kind of reading in which he indulged, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this idea. Yet a magiſtrate, whoſe weak mind was intoxicated with ſuperſtition, and whoſe hatred to the proteſtants did not heſitate to impute crimes to them, cauſed the whole family to be impriſoned. The catholic populace became enflamed, and the young man was declared a martyr. The fraternity of the penitents, which, to the diſgrace of the nation,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:024210_0126_0FC56AA3201F30B8"/>
ſtill exiſts at Thoulouſe, performed a ſolemn maſs for him, during which they bore his effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, holding the palm of martyrdom in one hand, and in the other the pen with which he was to have ſigned his abjuration.</p>
                  <p>It was ſoon reported that the proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion commanded fathers to aſſaſſinate their children, when they deſigned to abjure it; and that, for greater ſecurity, they elected, in their ſecret aſſemblies the butcher of the ſect. The inferior tribunal, led by the furious M. David, pronounced the unfortunate Calas guilty; and the parliament confirmed the ſentence by that very ſmall majority which is unhappily regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſufficient by our abſurd juriſprudence. Condemned to the torture and the wheel, this miſerable father died proteſting his innocence; and the judges abſolved his family, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary accomplices of the guilt, or the innocence of its head.</p>
                  <p>This family, ruined and ſtained by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, went to ſeek, among men of their own perſuaſion, a retreat, aſſiſtance, but, above all, conſolation. They took up their reſidence near Geneva. Voltaire, whoſe compaſſion was mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whoſe indignation was rouſed, informed himſelf of the horrible particulars; and, aſſured of the innocence of the unfortunate Calas, he dared to conceive the hope of obtaining juſtice. The zeal of the advocates was excited, and their courage ſuſtained by his letters. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, in the cauſe of humanity, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:024210_0127_0FC56AA5F8270FA0"/>
ſuſceptible mind of the Duke de Choiſeul. The reputation of Tronchin had brought to Geneva the Ducheſs d' Enville, the great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter of the author of the Maxims. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to ſuperſtition, both by her native feelings and by her acquired knowledge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how to produce the welfare of mankind by equal activity and courage, and embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a genuine modeſty the energy of her virtues, her hatred of fanaticiſm and oppreſſion inſured to Calas a protectreſs, whoſe zeal could not be abated by obſtacles or delays. The proceſs was commenced. To the memorials of the advocates, too profuſe and declamatory, Voltaire added more nervous writings, the ſtyle of which was ſeductive, and calculated in ſome places to excite pity, and in others to awaken the public indignation, ſo prone to ſleep among a people, at that time, too much a ſtranger to their own intereſts. Pleading for Calas, he ſupported the cauſe of toleration; which word it was then daring to pronounce, and which is even now rejected with contempt by men who recognize the right of enſlaving thought and conſcience. Letters, abounding with that ſubtle praiſe which he could diſtribute with ſuch delicacy, animated the zeal of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the cauſe, of its protectors, and of the judges. It was, while he promiſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, that he demanded juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The ſentence of Thoulouſe was annulled. The Duke de Choiſeul had the wiſdom and the
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:024210_0128_0FC56AA8DC330A38"/>
courage to order a tribunal of Maſters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to reviſe this cauſe, in defending which the parliaments were all intereſted, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and ſpirit of mutual defence left little hope of an equitable deciſion. In fine, Calas was declared innocent; diſhonour was remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his memory; and a generous miniſter cauſed the public treaſury to repair the wrongs that the injuſtice of the judges had done to the fortune of this family, which was as reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it was unhappy. But he did not proceed ſo far as to compel the parliament of Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc to acknowledge the arret which overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an act of its injuſtice. That tribunal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the miſerable vanity of perſevering in its error, to the honour of lamenting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, the injury.</p>
                  <p>Mean while, the applauſes of France and of Europe were heard at Thoulouſe, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy M. David, ſinking beneath the weight of remorſe and of ſhame, ſoon loſt his reaſon and his life. This affair, ſo great in itſelf, ſo important in its conſequences, ſince it turned the attention not only of France but of other nations to the crimes of intolerance and the neceſſity of preventing them, this affair occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the ſoul of Voltaire, during more than three years.— "In all this time," ſaid he, "a ſmile has not eſcaped me, for which I have not reproached myſelf, as for a crime." His name, which had long been dear to the enlightened friends of humanity as that of its moſt zealous,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:024210_0129_0FC56AAC067770F8"/>
moſt indefatigable defender, this name was then bleſt by that multitude of citizens who, devoted to perſecution during eighty years, at length heard a voice raiſed in their defence. Having returned to Paris in 1778, one day that the people ſurrounded him on the Pont Royal, a poor woman was aſked who that man was who thus drew the crowd after him—"Know you not," ſaid ſhe, "that he is the ſaviour of Calas?" He was informed of this anſwer, and, ſurrounded as he was by the marks of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which were laviſhed on him, it was this by which he was moſt ſenſibly affected.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after the unfortunate death of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, a young woman of the ſame province, who, according to a barbarous cuſtom, had been taken from her parents and ſhut up in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent with a deſign of aiding ſaying grace by human means, wearied of the ill treatment that ſhe endured, eſcaped, and her body was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in a well. The prieſt who had ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Lettre de Cachet, the ſiſterhood who had uſed with barbarity the power which it gave them over this unfortunate young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, doubtleſs merited puniſhment; but it was on the family of this victim that fanaticiſm wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed puniſhment to fall. The injurious reproach which had conducted Calas to the wheel was revived with a new fury. Sirven, fortunately, had time to fly; and, condemned to death for contumacy, he ſought an aſſylum with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of Calas. But his wife, who accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:024210_0130_0FC56AB05684C928"/>
him, fell a prey to her grief and to the fatigue of a journey, undertaken on foot, over tracts of ſnow.</p>
                  <p>Judicial forms required Sirven to preſent himſelf before the ſame parliament who had ſhed the blood of Calas. Voltaire endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obtain other judges. The Duke de Choiſeul at that time thought it neceſſary to reſpect the opinion of the parliaments who, after the decay of his influence over the Marchioneſs de Pompadour, and again after her death, were become uſeful to him, at times to free him from an enemy, and at others to afford the means of rendering himſelf neceſſary by the art with which he could appeaſe their commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he himſelf frequently excited.</p>
                  <p>Sirven, then, was compelled to yield to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and to appear before the tribunal of Thoulouſe; but Voltaire knew how to provide for his ſecurity, and to prepare for his ſucceſs. He had diſciples in the parliament; ſome able advocates of Thoulouſe wiſhed to partake of the glory which thoſe of Paris had acquired by defending Calas; the friends of toleration were become powerful even in this very city: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few years Voltaire's works had changed the minds of men; they had only pitied Calas with a ſilent horror, Sirven found declared pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, for which he was indebted to the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Voltaire, to the talent of opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infuſing truth, mingled with approbation, into the feelings of thoſe whom he deſigned to
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:024210_0131_0FC56AB34C0FD078"/>
work his purpoſes. The friends of truth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over the abettors of the penitents, and Sirven was ſaved.</p>
                  <p>The Jeſuits had uſurped the poſſeſſions of a well deſcended family, who, by their poverty, were prevented from recovering their rights. Voltaire gave them the means of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that; and oppreſſors of every kind, who, long had feared his writings, now learnt to dread his activity, his generoſity, and his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
                  <p>This laſt event almoſt immediately preceded the deſtruction of the Jeſuits. Voltaire, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated among them, had maintained a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with his former maſters. While they were living they reſtrained the fury of the fraternity from any open attack, and Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire was reſpectful to the Jeſuits, both in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the connexions of his youth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to preſerve allies in the party which at that time governed the devotees, But, after the death of theſe friends, wearied by the clamours of the Journal de Trévoux, which, by unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſations of impiety ſeemed to call down perſecutions on his head, he no longer preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame reſpect for the Jeſuits, nor did his zeal for the defence of the oppreſſed extend to them, when they, in their turn, became op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                  <p>He exulted in the deſtruction of an order, the friend of letters but the enemy of reaſon, which was deſirous of deſtroying all talents or
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:024210_0132_0FC56AB4F54A41F8"/>
of drawing them into its boſom, to corrupt them, by employing them to ſerve its deſigns, and to hold the human race in infancy, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to govern them. Yet he pitied individuals treated with barbarity by the hatred of the Janſeniſts; and he gave an aſſylum, in his own houſe, to a Jeſuit, to point out to the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees that true humanity knows only misfortune and forgets opinions. Father Adam, to whom a ſort of celebrity was given by his abode at Ferney, was not abſolutely uſeleſs to his hoſt. He played with him at cheſs, and he played the game with ſufficient addreſs ſometimes to conceal his ſuperiority. He alſo ſpared Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire labour in his learned reſearches; he even ſerved him as an almoner, for Voltaire wiſhed to oppoſe his fidelity in fulfilling the exterior duties of the Romiſh religion to the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which were brought againſt him, of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>
                  <p>At this period a great revolution was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendering in the human mind. Since the revival of philoſophy, religion, excluſively eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed throughout Europe, had been attacked only in England. Leibnitz, Fontenelle, and other leſs celebrated philoſophers, accuſed of free thinking, had reſpected religion in their writings. Bayle, himſelf, by a precaution that was neceſſary to his ſafety, while he indulged himſelf in all objections, aſſumed the air of wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove that revelation alone could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them, and of having formed the project
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:024210_0133_0FC56AB99F7D10D0"/>
of exalting faith by humiliating reaſon. In England, theſe attacks had little ſucceſs or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The moſt powerful party in that nation judged it uſeful to themſelves to leave the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in darkneſs, probably becauſe the habit of adoring the myſteries of the Bible ſtrengthened their faith in thoſe of the conſtitution; and they honoured the eſtabliſhed religion as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of ſocial advantage. Beſides, in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where the Houſe of Commons alone led to fortune, and where the members of that houſe were tumultuouſly elected by the people, an apparent reſpect for their opinions muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be erected into a virtue by all the ambitious.</p>
                  <p>In France, there had appeared ſome bold writers, but the blows which they aimed were ſtill indirect. Even the work of Helvetius de l' Eſprit (on the underſtanding) was only an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack on religious principles in general; it queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the foundations of all religions, and left the reader to draw conſequences and make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. Emilius appeared; the Savoyard vicar's Profeſſion of Faith contained nothing relative to the utility, toward morals, of the belief of a God, and the inutility of revelation, which is not to be found in the poem of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law; but the attack was open and the perſons attacked were brought upon the ſtage under their proper name and character, and not under that of the prieſts of India or of Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet. This boldneſs aſtoniſhed Voltaire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited his emulation. The ſucceſs of Emilius
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:024210_0134_0FC56ABAF9D8BF10"/>
encouraged him, nor was he terrified by the fear of perſecution. Rouſſeau had not been perſecuted at Paris had he not put his name to the work, nor at Geneva had he not maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in another part of Emilius that the people poſſeſſed not the power of renouncing the right of reforming a depraved government. This doctrine authoriſed the citizens of that repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic to overthrow the ariſtocracy which its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates had eſtabliſhed, and which ſecured an hereditary authority to certain rich families.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire believed that he could ſecurely ſhun perſecution by concealing his name; and, by a deference to government while he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his force againſt religion, could intereſt even the civil power to weaken its empire. A multiplicity of works, in which he ſucceſſively employed argument and humour, were diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed throughout Europe, under the various forms which could be invented by the neceſſity of veiling truth, or of rendering it engaging. His zeal againſt religion, which he viewed as the cauſe of the fanataciſm that had deſolated Europe from the moment of its birth, the cauſe of the ſuperſtition that had degraded it, and as the ſource of the evils, which the enemies of men ſtill continued to inflict on them, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to increaſe his activity and his powers. "I am wearied," ſaid he one day, "of hearing it repeated that twelve men were ſufficient to eſtabliſh Chriſtianity, and I wiſh to prove there needs but one to deſtroy it."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="136" facs="unknown:024210_0135_0FC56ABC845BEBC8"/>An examination of works, which Chriſtians regarded as proceeding from inſpiration, the analyzation of dogmas, which have been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively introduced ſince the origin of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the hiſtory of the ridiculous or bloody quarrels which have been excited by thoſe, the miracles, prophecies, tales ſcattered through legends and eccleſiaſtical hiſtories, the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wars, the maſſacres ordained in the name of God, the butchers and ſcaffolds which, at the voice of prieſts covered Europe, the blood of kings flowing from the ſteel of aſſaſſins, and the fanaticiſm which unpeopled America, all theſe were inceſſantly repeated in his works under a thouſand varied forms. He excited indignation, he wrung tears from the heart, he exhauſted the ſprings of ridicule. Men trembled at an attrocious action, they laughed at an abſurdity. Voltaire did not fear fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to place the ſame objects before his readers, to urge the ſame reaſonings to them. "They tell me that I repeat the ſame things," he ſaid in one of his writings, "true: I ſhall repeat them till I ſee men reformed."</p>
                  <p>Theſe works, rigorouſly prohibited in France, in Italy, at Vienna, in Portugal, and in Spain, could not be ſpeedily circulated; all of them could not reach every reader; but there was not an obſcure corner in the provinces, there was not any nation in foreign countries, ſuffering under the yoke of intolerance, which
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:024210_0136_0FC56AC01812C7E0"/>
did not feel the influence of ſome of theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                  <p>Men of liberal minds, who exiſted before only in ſome cities where ſcience was cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or among the learned and the great, were, by his voice, multiplied in all claſſes of ſociety as well as in all countries. Soon perceiving their number and their ſtrength they ventured to ſhow themſelves, and Europe was aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find itſelf a country of Deiſts.</p>
                  <p>The zeal of Voltaire created him enemies in all thoſe who had obtained, and all who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to obtain, affluence or even ſubſiſtence from religion. Yet that party no longer poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch men as Boſſuet, Arnaud, and Nicole; thoſe who replaced them by their talents and their acquaintance with philoſophy and letters had ranged themſelves with the contrary party; and the members of the clergy who approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neareſt to them in ability, yielding to the deſire of not debaſing themſelves in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of enlightened men, ſtood aloof, or content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with maintaining the politcal uſe of a belief which they would have bluſhed to have partaken with the people, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the credulous ſuperſtition of their predeceſſors a ſpecies of religious Machiavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.</p>
                  <p>Defamatory writings and attacks ſprung up profuſely; but Voltaire, by anſwering alone, preſerved the name of theſe works, which were read by none but thoſe to whom they were uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:024210_0137_0FC56AC1188AFD50"/>
and who were unwilling or unable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand either the objections or the anſwers.</p>
                  <p>To the clamours of fanaticiſm, Voltaire op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the protection of monarchs. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of Ruſſia, the Kings of Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Pruſſia, intereſted themſelves in his labours, peruſed his works, ſought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his approbation, and ſometimes ſeconded his zeal for the welfare of mankind. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry country the powerful, and ſuch miniſters as ſought reputation and were intent on ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fame through Europe, were ambitious to enjoy the ſuffrage of the philoſopher of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, confided to him their hopes and fears for the progreſs of reaſon, and their projects for the increaſe of knowledge and the ruin of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm. He had formed a league which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all the great men of Europe, of which he was the ſoul, and whoſe cry was, "Reaſon and toleration." Did any ſtriking injuſtice ariſe in a nation, did Voltaire hear of any act of bigotry, any inſult offered to human nature, his pen expoſed the guilty to Europe: and who knows how often the fear of this ſure and terrible vengeance has withheld the oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's arm?</p>
                  <p>But it was in France, more eſpecially, that he exerciſed this dominion of reaſon. Since the affair of Calas, every victim, unjuſtly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed or purſued by the ſword of the law, found in him a protector, or an avenger.</p>
                  <p>The execution of the Count de Lally excited
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:024210_0138_0FC56AC2751ACD88"/>
his indignation. The lawyers of Paris, ſitting in judgment on the conduct of a general in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, a ſentence of death paſſed without proof of a ſingle determinate crime, nay mere ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on produced as the gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet, Voltaire during a long time ſpoke ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly againſt this enormity. The vaſt number of perſons employed by the Eaſt-India compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who were intereſted in throwing the fatal conſequences of their conduct on a man who no longer exiſted, the powerful tribunal which had condemned the general, all thoſe whom that body included in its ſuite whoſe voice was ſold to it, the other corps, who, united with that by the ſame name, by common functions and like intereſts, regarded its cauſe as their own, in fine, the adminiſtration, aſhamed of
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:024210_0139_0FC56AC3F94C9FF8"/>
the weakneſs or the cruel policy which ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Count de Lally to the hope of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his tomb the faults which had loſt India, all ſeemed to oppoſe a tardy juſtice. But Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, by reiterated attacks on the ſame object, triumphed over prejudice and the intereſts of ſuch as are attentive to preſerve and extend its empire. Juſt minds needed only to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the circumſtances; others, he hurried along with him; and when the ſon of the Count de Lally, ſince ſo celebrated by his eloquence and courage, had attained an age at which he could demand juſtice, the minds of men were prepared to applaud the attempt and to ſolicit its execution. Voltaire was dying, when, twelve years afterward, this unjuſt ſentence was reverſed; he heard the intelligence; his powers ſprang back to life, and he wrote—"I die content; I ſee the king loves juſtice." The laſt words which were traced by that hand which had ſo long maintained the cauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and juſtice.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame year, 1766, another arret aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Europe; which, while it read the works of our philoſophers, concluded that knowledge was diſſeminated throug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The biſhop of Amiens, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in his old age by fanatics, and no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er capable of foreſeeing the conſequences of this religions farce, added to its ſolemnity by his preſence. Mean time, the malice of a townſman of Abbeville directed the ſuſpicions of the people to the Chevalier de la Barré, a young officer whoſe relations were of the long robe and members of the chief magiſtracy, and who at that time lived with his kinſwoman the Abbeſs de Villancourt, near the gates of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beville. A proceſs was commenced, and the judges of Abbeville condemned to tortures, whoſe horror would diſmay the imagination of a canibal, the Chevalier de la Barré and d' Etal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>londe his friend, who had taken the precaution to fly. The Chevalier de la Barré had awaited the iſſue of the trial; he had more to loſe than the other by quitting France; and relied on the protection of his relations who filled the firſt employments in the parliaments and in the council.

de la Barré had been accuſed; thus the judges had exceeded even the penalties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by laws, which no enlightened man can ſtill ſee ſullying our criminal code without horror. There was no father of a family who had not reaſon to tremble, ſince there are few young men who eſcape ſuch like indiſcretions; and the judges had condemned the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate victim to a cruel death for language, in which the greateſt part of them had indulged, in their youth, in which, perhaps, they ſtill indulged, and whoſe children were as culpable as he whom they had condemned.</p>
                  <p>While Voltaire's indignation was reuſed, his apprehenſions were ſtrongly excited. The Philoſophical Dictionary had been artfully pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among the number of books before which it was ſaid the Chevalier de la Barré had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated himſelf. His enemies wiſhed it to be underſtood that the reading of Voltaire's works had been the cauſe of theſe indiſcretions, which had been conſtrued into acts of impiety. Still the danger did not prevent Voltaire from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the defence of theſe victims of fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. D'Ettallonde, then a refugee at Wezel, obtained, through his recommendation, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in a Pruſſian regiment. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the affair of Abbeville were unfolded to Europe in ſeveral publications; and the judges trembled, on their very ſeats, at the terrible judgment which they had paſſed, and which dragged them from their obſcurity to devote them to a diſgraceful immortality.</p>

                     <pb n="144" facs="unknown:024210_0143_0FC56AD05D5C6738"/>The reporting judge of Count de Lally's trial, accuſed of having contributed to the death of the Chevalier de la Barré, compelled to acknowledge the influence of that power which is independent of rank or ſituation, and which nature has given to genius for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and defence of the human race, wrote a letter in which, actuated alternately by ſhame and pride, he attempted to excuſe himſelf and ſuffer menaces to eſcape him. Voltaire repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the following hiſtorical trait:—"I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid you," ſaid an Emperor of China to the chief mandarin of the hiſtorians, "to mention me, henceforward, in your works."

the deference paid them by certain bodies of men, rarely capable of gratitude, and part of whoſe authority over the vulgar mind it would be more politic to take away by theſe great examples than to augment, by proving, in the reſpect which they themſelves pay to them, the fears which ſuch bodies inſpire.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire did not, meantime, neglect the means of avoiding the ſtorm; he diminiſhed his domeſtic eſtabliſhment; and ſecured ſome property which he could diſpoſe of at pleaſure, with which he might procure a new place of refuge. Such had ever been his ſecret deſign, in all the arrangements which he had made of his fortune, and it would have required a league among the powers of Europe, to have deprived him of independence, and to have reduced him to want. Princes and nobles were among his debtors, who do not indeed pay with much punctuality, but he had calculated the degrees of human corruption, and he knew that theſe ſame men, though they act with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle delicacy in ſuch affairs, would find means to reimburſe him during the moment of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, when their negligence would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe render them the objects of the horror and diſdain of Europe, indignant to behold ſuch a man oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>This perſecution appeared for a time ready to burſt forth. Ferney is ſituated in the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Geneva, the titular biſhop of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in the ſmall town of Annecy. François

de Salles, who has been raiſed to the rank of Saints, having formerly been the biſhop, in order that the heretics might not find cauſe of ſcandal in their own metropolis, it had been thought moſt proper to confide this ſee to none but a man who would not incur the reproach of pride, luxury, and effeminacy, of which the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic prelates are accuſed by the proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>But it had long been difficult to diſcover ſaints, who, poſſeſſing underſtanding or birth, would condeſcend to accept ſo ſmall a dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe. He who filled the ſee of Annecy, in 1767, was a man of low extraction, educated in a ſeminary at Paris, where he was no otherwiſe diſtinguiſhed than by auſtere manners, trifling devotion, and ignorant fanaticiſm. He wrote to the Count de St. Florentine, to induce him to baniſh Voltaire out of his dioceſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently out of the kingdom, though the poet had then built a church at his own expence, and ſpread abundance through a country which the perſecutions againſt the proteſtants had laid waſte. But the biſhop pretended that the Lord of Ferney had given a moral exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation againſt theft in the church after maſs, and that the workmen who were employed by him in erecting this church had not removed an old croſs with ſufficient veneration; theſe indeed were grave inducements to drive from his country an old man who was the glory of that country, and to rob him of an aſylum to which the kingdoms of Europe haſtened to
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:024210_0146_0FC56AD9E4FA2FC0"/>
bear him the tribute of admiration. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, had it been only from motives of policy, could not be tempted to gratify the biſhop; he therefore adviſed Voltaire to guard againſt theſe accuſations, which the union of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Annecy with the French prelates who poſſeſſed more influence might render dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>It was at this time that he conceived the idea of ſolemnly receiving the ſacrament, which was followed by a public declaration of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the church, and his diſdain of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors; a fruitleſs ſtep, which ſpoke weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than policy, and which the pleaſure of compelling his paſtor to adminiſter the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion through fear of the ſecular judges, and of legally inſulting the biſhop of Annecy, could not excuſe in the eyes of the free and intrepid man who appreciates coolly the rights of truth, and perceives that which prudence requires when laws contrary to natural juſtice render truth dangerous and prudence neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
                  <p>The prieſt ſuffered the ſmall advantage to eſcape which they might have drawn from this ſingular ſcene, by falſifying the declaration which Voltaire had made.</p>
                  <p>He had no longer a retreat near Geneva. He had connected himſelf, on his arrival there, with the families whoſe education, opinions, inclinations, and fortune, were moſt congenial to his own; and theſe families had at that time
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:024210_0147_0FC56ADB4A229EA8"/>
formed the deſign of eſtabliſhing a ſpecies of ariſtocracy. In a city which poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ſſed no ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, where the ſtrength of the citizens could be united with as much facility and prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as that of the government, ſuch a project would have been abſurd had not the rich citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens entertained the hope of engaging a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign influence in their favour.</p>
                  <p>The cabinets of Verſailles and Turin were eaſily ſeduced. The ſenate of Berne, whoſe intereſt it was to baniſh the picture of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican equality from the eyes of their ſubjects, made it their conſtant policy to protect every enterprizing ariſtocracy around them: and, throughout the whole of Switzerland, ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates as became tyrants were ſure of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at Bern, an ardent and faithful protector. Thus the wretched pride of obtaining an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous authority in a ſmall city, and of being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without being reſpected, deprived the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Geneva of their liberty, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of its independence. The chiefs of the popular party employed the weapons of fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, for they had read enough to know the influence which religion had formerly obtained in political diſſenſions, but they did not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently underſtand the ſpirit of their own age to feel how much reaſon, aided by ridicule, had weakened this formerly ſo dangerous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.</p>
                  <p>It was propoſed, therefore, to put in force the laws which prohibited catholics from poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:024210_0148_0FC56AE2D47EEED8"/>
property in the territory of Geneva. The magiſtrates were cenſured for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections with Voltaire, who had dared to raiſe his voice againſt the barbarous aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Servet, which had been commanded by Calvin in the name of God to the cowardly and ſuperſtitious ſenators of Geneva. Voltaire was obliged to renounce his houſe of the Delices.</p>
                  <p>Soon after, Rouſſeau advanced, in his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, principles which developed to the citizens of Geneva all the extent of their rights, and which founded theſe rights on ſimple truths that all men could feel and all muſt adopt. The ariſtocracy wiſhed to puniſh him for the publication, but it was neceſſary they ſhould have a pretext; they took that of religion, and united themſelves with the prieſts, who, in every country, indifferent to the form of its conſtitution and the liberty of man, promiſe the aſſiſtance of Heaven to the party which moſt favours intolerance, and who become, as their intereſt directs, ſometimes the ſupport of the tyranny of a bigotted prince or of a ſuperſtitious ſenate, ſometimes the defenders of the liberty of a fanatic people.</p>
                  <p>Alternately expoſed to the attacks of the two parties, Voltaire obſerved a neutrality, but he remained faithful to his deteſtation of oppreſſors. He favoured the cauſe of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens againſt the magiſtrates, and that of the common people who poſſeſſed no privileges
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:024210_0149_0FC56AE44CA9A748"/>
againſt the citizens; for theſe people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Voltaire, therefore, wrote a poem, every part of which was impregnated with ſatire, and on which was no reproach can be laid, except that of containing ſome verſes againſt Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau, which were dictated by a degree of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whoſe exceſs and expreſſions could not be excuſed by the juſtice of the motives which inſpired them. But when, in a tumult, the citizens had ſlain ſome of the people, he was eager to receive at Ferney the families which theſe troubles compelled to abandon Geneva; and, in the very inſtant in which the bankruptcy of the Abbé Terrai, which had not even the excuſe of neceſſity, but was occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by ſhameful expences, had deprived him of part of his fortune, he was ſeen to give aſſiſtance to thoſe who had no property left; and to build houſes which he ſold to others at a low price to be paid him in annuities; while he ſolicited the good offices of the government in
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:024210_0150_0FC56AE5F203C988"/>
their behalf, and employed his influence with ſovereigns, miniſters, and the leading men of all nations, to procure a ſale for the clocks and watches of this infant manufactory, which ſoon became famous throughout Europe.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the government was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in opening an aſylum for the Geneveſe at Verſoy, on the borders of the lake. There it was deſigned to have eſtabliſhed a city, in which induſtry and commerce would have been free, and in which a proteſtant temple would have riſen by the ſide of a catholic church. Voltaire had cauſed this plan to be adopted, but the miniſter did not poſſeſs ſufficient credit to obtain a law for the protection of religious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, a ſecret toleration, limited to the time of his own adminiſtration, was all that he could offer, and with that Verſoy could not exiſt.</p>
                  <p>The year 1771 was one of the moſt embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing periods of Voltaire's life. The chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor Maupeou and the Duke d'Aiguillon ſaw themſelves obliged to attack the parliaments, to whom they both were objects of hatred; that they might not become their victims. The one could not obtain a part in the adminiſtration, nor the other preſerve himſelf in the office which he held there, without procuring the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the Duke de Choiſeul. Acting in concert with Madame du Barry, whom that miniſter had been imprudent enough to make his irreconcilable enemy, they perſuaded the king that his contemned authority could never
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:024210_0151_0FC56AE9885EF990"/>
be reſtored to its vigour, that the ſtate, inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly agitated ſince the peace by parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary contentions, could not regain its tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, if he did not by an act of vigour place limits to the pretenſions of the judicial bodies, which they would not venture to infringe, and if a term was not fixed beyond which they would not dare longer to oppoſe reſiſtance to the royal will.</p>
                  <p>The Duke de Choiſeul could not adopt this project without offending the public opinion, which had a long time been inimicable to him, but which was then his ſole ſupport; while his forced ſubmiſſion to the will of the people had removed him ſtill further from the confidence of the monarch, whoſe affections were alienat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him. It was probable, then, that his connexions with the parliaments would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete his diſgrace, and that it would be eaſy to perſuade the monarch either that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in power would be the greateſt obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to the ſucceſs of the new meaſures of the government, or that he would endeavour to involve the nation in war, to preſerve his ſituation in deſpight of the kings pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The attack made on the parliaments was directed with equal addreſs. Whatever could alarm the nation was carefully avoided. The king appeared only to vindicate the plenitude of the legiſlative power, a power which would be transferred not to the nation but to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, by admitting the doctrine that the
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:024210_0152_0FC56AEE05A1B238"/>
parliaments had the right of regiſtering edicts according to their pleaſure. It was eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that this power, united to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive judicial authority, which was divided among the twelve perpetual tribunals, would tend to eſtabliſh a tyranic ariſtocracy in France, more dangerous, than monarchy, to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the liberty, and the property of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. The enemies of thoſe tribunals might therefore rely on the ſuffrages of enlightened minds, and on that of men of letters, whom the parliament of Paris had wounded by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence and perſecution, by its attachment to prejudices, and by its pertinacity in rejecting every improvement calculated for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men.</p>
                  <p>But is leſs difficult to form a political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>h addreſs, than to execute with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a plan of reform. The more alarming to liberty are the principles which the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power would eſtabliſh, the more neceſſary is it to diſplay gentleneſs and indulgence to individuals. Yet, at that time, rigour was, in the minuteſt circumſtances, carried to a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erile refinement. A monarch appears cruel, who, in the puniſhments which he inflicts, does not ſcrupulouſly reſpect, conſiſtently with that puniſhment, whatever can be injurious to the health, the convenience, or even the natural feelings of thoſe whom he puniſhes, or thoſe who are connected with them; but, on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, all theſe conſiderations were diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:024210_0153_0FC56AF1E77FA608"/>
They refuſed permiſſion to a ſon to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his dying father; they confined a man in an unhealthful place, where his family could not approach him without being expoſed to partake of his dangers, and a ſick perſon could ſcarcely obtain leave to ſeek in the capital the aſſiſtance which that alone could give him. When an abſolute government betrays fear, it proclaims either diſtruſt of its ſtrength, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deciſion of the monarch, or the inſtability of the adminiſtration, and this gives encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reſiſtance; but this fear was diſplayed in making the recal of ſome exiles depend on a conſent uſeleſs even in the opinion of thoſe who demanded that conſent.</p>
                  <p>A ſalutary operation does not change its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture though it be executed with wanton ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but then the feeling and enlightened man who approves, does not defend it, ſhould he think his duty calls on him to give the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his ſupport, without regret; his diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind no longer acts with either zeal or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for a cauſe which is diſhonoured by its leaders.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe whoſe minds are uninformed paſs from a hatred of the miniſter to averſion to meaſures which he maintains by oppreſſion; and the public voice condemns that which, left to itſelf, it had perhaps approved.</p>
                  <p>The great number of magiſtrates who were by this revolution deprived of their offices, the merit and virtues of ſome of them, the crowd
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:024210_0154_0FC56AF33B99C448"/>
of ſubordinate miniſters of juſtice who were connected with their fate by honour and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that natural propenſity which leads men to join the cauſe of thoſe who ſuffer, the hatred of power not leſs natural, all neceſſarily co-operated to render the meaſures of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter odious, and to place obſtacles in his way when, compelled to replace the tribunals which he wiſhed to deſtroy, force became uſeleſs and confidence neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>However, the barbarity of the criminal law, the diſguſting defects of the civil juriſprudence, preſented to the authors of the revolution ſure means to regain the public opinion, and to give thoſe who ſhould conſent to replace the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parliaments an excuſe which honour and patriotiſm might have been proud to avow. Miniſters diſdained theſe means. The parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had rendered itſelf obnoxious to all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened men by the obſtacles which it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the liberty of the preſs, and by its fanaticiſm, of which the recent execution of the Chevalier de la Barré had give an example to all Europe. Yet, irritated by libels pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt himſelf, alarmed by works in which his principles had been attacked, and, in ſhort, deſirous of gaining a ſupport in the clergy, the chancellor thought proper to lay new reſtrictions on the preſs. The ſtain was not removed from the memory of the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier de la Barré, nor could Voltaire obtain a reviſion of the ſentence which would have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all Europe would have applauded the reform; the diſplaced magiſtrates would alone have been the enemies of theſe ſalutary inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; and their fall the epoch, in which the ſovereign had recovered the liberty of yielding to his juſt and humane purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>In truth the ſale of judicial offices was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; yet, the judges being ſtill named by the court, nothing was ſeen in this change but the facility of placing on the ſeat of juſtice men without fortune and more eaſy to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                  <p>The bounds of the moſt extenſive juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:024210_0156_0FC56AFC6262B430"/>
were circumſcribed, but the new courts were not erected into parliaments; they were not permitted to regiſter atrets, and this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between thoſe and the former tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals was the ſure preſage of their deſtruction. In fine, the fees of the judges were aboliſhed and replaced by ſtated ſalaries; and this regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, among all that were adopted, was the only one which reaſon could entirely approve.</p>
                  <p>The authors of this revolution at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held its accompliſhment, notwithſtanding an almoſt univerſal diſcontent. The Duke de Choiſeul, accuſed of ſecretly fomenting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, unſteady as it was, of the parliament of Paris, and of having retarded the concluſion of peace between England and Spain, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled to his eſtates. The parliament, whoſe gratitude obliged them to aſſume firmneſs, was ſoon diſperſed. The Duke d'Aiguillon became miniſter, and the parliament was ſucceeded by a new tribunal. In ſome of the provinces the parliaments experienced the fate of that of Paris, while others conſented to remain and ſacrifice ſeveral of their members. All was ſilent before authority; and nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſucceſs of the miniſters but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the public whom they ſcorned, and who, ſome years after, wrought their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire deſpiſed the parliament of Paris, and loved the Duke de Choiſeul; he beheld in one an ancient perſecutor who had not been
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:024210_0157_0FC56AFDB5767660"/>
diſarmed but further incenſed by his fame, in the other a friend and a protector. He was conſtant in his gratitude and immoveable in his principles. All his letters expreſſed his regard for the Duke de Choiſeul with freedom and energy, and he was not ignorant that his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in conſequence of the infamous cuſtom of violating public faith, were read by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the exiled miniſter. A pleaſant tale, entitled Barmécide<note n="*" place="bottom">The letter of Benaldaki to Caramuſti. Volume of Letters.</note>, which he wrote, is the only durable monument of the concern which this diſgrace had excited. The injuſtice with which the friends and partizans of the Duke de Choiſeul accuſed Voltaire of ingratitude was, therefore, one of the ſevereſt afflictions which he had ever endured; and it was the more poignant as the Duke himſelf partook of the injuſtice. Ineffectually did Voltaire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to undeceive him, ineffectually did he appeal to the proofs he had given of his attachment and his ſorrow:
<q>Je l'ai dit à la terre, au ciel, à Guſman même<note n="†" place="bottom">To earth, to heaven, to Guſman's ſelf the tale I told.</note>:</q>
he wrote in his grief, but he was not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                  <p>The great and people in office have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, but rarely opinions. To oppoſe thoſe who agree with their preſent deſigns is, in
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:024210_0158_0FC56B015C9BC2D0"/>
their eyes, to declare themſelves. That at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of truth which is one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt paſſions of exalted and independent minds, appears romantic to them. They ſuppoſe that a philoſopher has, like themſelves, no opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions but thoſe of the moment, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he muſt change his profeſſions accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the temporary intereſts of their friends or patrons. They conſider him as a man made to defend the cauſe which they have embraced and not to ſupport his own principles; to ſerve under them and not to examine the juſtice of the war. Thus the Duke de Choiſeul appeared to imagine that Voltaire, in deference to him, ought either to have betrayed or concealed his opinions on queſtions of public right. An important anecdote, which proves how eaſily the pride of power and birth deſtroys the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of the natural independence of the human ſoul, and which diſplays the inequality of men's minds, which is much more real than that of their rank or ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire beheld, with pleaſure, the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſelling judicial offices aboliſhed, the fees of the judges ſuppreſſed, and the immenſe juriſdiction of the parliament of Paris con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted within narrower limits: abuſes which he had combated, for more than forty years, with the weapons of reaſon and ridicule. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a ſingle maſter to many; a ſovereign whoſe prejudices are alone to be feared to a troop of deſpots whoſe prejudices are greater
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:024210_0159_0FC56B0266413298"/>
but whoſe partial intereſts and little paſſions are more fatal to mankind, and who, more formidable to the unprotected, are eſpecially ſo to men whoſe knowledge alarms them and whoſe glory irritates them. He was wont to ſay: "I have a ſtubborn back; I can make a ſingle how well enough, but a hundred bows in ſucceſſion are too fatiguing."</p>
                  <p>He therefore applauded the regulations which had been adopted, and, among men of congenial minds, he expreſſed his approbation. Doubtleſs, he perceived with what contracted views this happy opportunity of reforming the legiſlation, of unſhackling the mind and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring to man the rights of men, of at once proſcribing intolerance and barbarity, and, in fine, of dating from this moment, the epoch of a revolution propitious to the nation, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the prince and his miniſters, had been neglected and loſt. But Voltaire had alſo too much penetration not to feel that though the laws were the ſame the magiſtrates were chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that if even theſe ſhould inherit the ſpirit of their predeceſſors neither their credit not their inſolence could deſcend to them, that the innovation, by depriving them of the blind reſpect which the vulgar entertained for all that bears the ruſt of antiquity, had deprived them of much of their power, that the public voice could alone reſtore their influence, and to obtain its ſuffrage there remained no other means than that of liſtening to reaſon and of

uniting themſelves to the enemies of prejudice, and to the friends of the human race.</p>
                  <p>The approbation which Voltaire gave to the meaſures of the Chancellor Maupeou, was at leaſt ſerviceable to the oppreſſed. Though he could not procure juſtice to be done to the memory of the unfortunate la Barré, though he could not reſtore the young d'Etallonde to his country, though the miniſters puſillanimous reſpect for the clergy concealed from him the true intereſt of his glory, ſtill Voltaire had the happineſs to ſave the wife of Mountbailli. This unhappy man, accuſed of parricide, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed on the wheel; his wife was alſo condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death; but ſhe was ſuppoſed to be preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and was fortunate enough to obtain a reſpite.</p>
                  <p>The tribunals had juſt rejected a provident law which, placing an interval between judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and execution in which the truth might be diſcovered and innocence diſplayed, would have prevented almoſt all their unjuſt deciſions; and they had refuſed it with an intemperance which ſufficed to prove its neceſſity.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is but juſtice to obſerve that all the magiſtrates did not entertain this high idea of their rights, and this love of power. One of them has merited the eſteem and veneration of every citizen, by ſpeaking, in the parliament of Paris, theſe remarkable words: "The citizens alone have right; the magiſtrates, as magiſtrates, have only duties."</note> Women alone, by declaring themſelves pregnant, could
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:024210_0161_0FC56B083B416348"/>
eſcape the danger of theſe precipitate execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In the ſpace of leſs than twenty years the lives of three innocent perſons, who had attracted the public curioſity by ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumſtances, had been ſaved by this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege; another proof of the utility of that law which was oppoſed only by a barbarous pride, and which ought to exiſt till experience ſhall have proved that the new legiſlation (which doubtleſs will ſoon replace the old code) no longer expoſes innocence to any danger.</p>
                  <p>The trial of the wife of Mountbailli was reviſed; the council of Artois, by which ſhe had been condemned, declared her innocence; and, more noble or leſs preſumptuous than the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Thoulouſe, they lamented the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable misfortune of having cauſed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon to periſh, and they impoſed on themſelves the duty of providing for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining days of the unfortunate woman whoſe happineſs they had deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Had Voltaire expreſſed his zeal againſt ſuch acts of injuſtice only as were connected with public events or the cauſe of toleration, he might have been accuſed of vanity; but this zeal was equally ardent in that obſcure cauſe, to which his name alone has given celebrity.</p>
                  <p>We have ſince ſeen, in like manner, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate<note n="*" place="bottom">M. Dupati.</note>, too ſoon ſnatched away from his friends and the unfortunate, intereſt Europe

in the cauſe of three peaſants of Champagne; and obtained, by his eloquence and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, a ſplendid and laſting fame, the reward of zeal which humanity and the love of juſtice alone had inſpired. Men incapable of theſe actions never fail to attribute them to a deſire of renown; they know not what anguiſh the ſpectacle of an unjuſt act inflicts on a noble and feeling mind, to what degree it torments memory and thought, and how greatly it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the imperious deſire of preventing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing a crime to be felt; they are ignorant of that emotion, that involuntary horror, which is excited in all the ſenſes by the ſight, even by the mere idea, of an oppreſſor eſcaping with triumph or impunity; and we muſt pity thoſe who could think that the author of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier and Brutus needed the glory attendant on a good action, to incite him to defend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and to riſe up againſt tyranny.</p>
                  <p>A new occaſion of avenging inſulted human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity was preſented to Voltaire. Vaſſalage ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity aboliſhed in France by Louis Hutin (the boiſterous,) again exiſted under Louis XV. in many provinces. In vain had a project of aboliſhing it been more than once formed. Avarice and pride had ſilenced juſtice, by a reſiſtance which had fatigued the indolence of government; and the ſuperior tribunals, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of nobles, had favoured the pretenſions of the proprietors of theſe ſeignories.</p>
                  <p>This enormity tyranniſed over Franche

Comté, and particularly over the territories of St. Claude, the ſecular monks of which, in 1742, owned the greateſt part of their lands, held in Mort-Main, to nothing better than falſe titles; and exerciſed their rights with a rigour which reduced to miſery an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed but good and induſtrious people. At the death of each poſſeſſor, if his children had not conſtantly inhabited the paternal houſe, the fruit of his labours appertained to the monks; the widow and her offspring, without furniture, without cloaths, and without dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, paſſed from the competence procured by labour, to all the horrors of want. Should a ſtranger die after having dwelt a year on this ſpecies of land, ſtrucken with the feudal ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, his property alſo became that of the monks; nor did a ſon ſucceed to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his father, if it could be proved that he paſſed the night of his nuptials out of the paternal houſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe people ſuffer without daring to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and beheld, with mute grief, the fruits of their economy, which ſhould have furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uſeful capitals to induſtry and the culture of the land, become the prey of the monks. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, the conſtruction of a great road opened a communication between them and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring cantons. They learnt that, at the foot of mount Jura, there exiſted a man whoſe intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid voice had more than once cauſed the very palaces of kings to reſound with the complaints
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:024210_0164_0FC56B11388F5EC0"/>
of the oppreſſed, and at whoſe name ſacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal tyranny turned pale. To him they related their griefs, and in him they found a protector.</p>
                  <p>Theſe uſurpations, this inexhorable cruelty of hypocritical prieſts, who dared to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the diſciples of an humble maſter yet wiſhed to hold men in ſlavery, were proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only to France but to all Europe. Yet, after ſoliciting relief for many years, nothing could be obtained from the timid ſucceſſor of M. de Maupeau, except an arret of council, which forbade this baſe violation of the rights of mankind. His fear of diſobliging the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Beſançon would not permit him to withdraw, from its juriſdiction, a cauſe which could not be regarded as an ordinary ſuit without ſhamefully acknowledging the legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the feudal ſlavery. The vaſſals of St. Claude were ſent back to a tribunal, whoſe members, the lords of the lands ſubject to this tyranny, took a barbarous pleaſure in riveting the chains of thoſe poor people; who ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue enſlaved.</p>
                  <p>All they have obtained was the liberty, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in 1778, of abandoning their home and their country to eſcape from the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the monks; but another article of that ſame law more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Who that reads theſe details would ſuppoſe that he reads the life of a great poet, of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſic and indefatigable writer? We forget his literary fame, as he himſelf loſt ſight of it. He ſeemed no longer to purſue any object of fame, but that of avenging the human race, and of ſnatching victims from oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>His genius, however, incapable of inactivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cultivated every ſpecies of literature on which it had ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="168" facs="unknown:024210_0166_0FC56B1437A986E8"/>
like the apologue, a ſchool of morality and reaſon, he wrote epiſtles, which if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his firſt works, will be found leſs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, leſs uniformly animated, and leſs poetical; but, in return, poſſeſſed of more ſimplicity and variety, a more general and free ſpirit of philoſophy, and a greater number of thoſe accute and deep remarks whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>New romances, works ſometimes ſerious and ſometimes humorous, and dictated by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, did not add to his reputation, but they continued to render it ever preſent with the public, to ſuſtain the intereſt of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans, and to humiliate that herd of ſecret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies, who aſſumed the maſk of auſterity, that the might withhold that admiration which the example of Europe commanded them to give.</p>

In this collection, modeſtly entitled, Queſtions to the Lovers of Science reſpecting the Encyclopedia, he treats ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively of theology, grammar, natural philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and literature. At one time, he diſcuſſes the ſubjects of antiquity; at others, queſtions of policy, legiſlation, and public economy. His ſtyle ever animated and ſeductive, clothed theſe various objects with a charm hitherto known to himſelf only; and which chiefly ſprings from the licence with which, yielding to his ſucceſſive emotions, adapting his ſtyle leſs to his ſubject than to the momentary diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mind, ſometimes he ſpreads ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule on objects which ſeem capable of inſpiring only horror, and, almoſt inſtantaneouſly hurried away by the energy and ſenſibility of his ſoul, he vehemently and eloquently exclaims againſt abuſes which he has juſt before treated with mockery.

                  <p>The conſtant intereſt which Voltaire took in the ſucceſs of Ruſſia againſt the Turks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be noticed. Highly diſtinguiſhed by the favours of the empreſs, doubtleſs gratitude animated his zeal; but we ſhould be deceived did we imagine his zeal had no other cauſe. Superior to thoſe politics of the counting-houſe, which take the intereſt of merchants known to financiers for the intereſts of commerce, and the intereſts of commerce for that of the human race, not leſs ſuperior to thoſe vain ideas of the balance of Europe ſo valuable to political compilers, he beheld, in the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ottoman empire, millions of men at leaſt aſſured of ſhunning under the deſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm of a ſovereign the intolerable deſpotiſm of a whole people; he hoped to ſee the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manners of the Eaſt which condemned women to a diſgraceful ſlavery baniſhed into the unhappy climates that gave them birth. Immence countries ſituated under a propitious heaven, deſtined by nature to be clothed with all the productions moſt uſeful to mankind, would have been reſtored to the induſtry of their inhabitants; theſe countries, the firſt in which man diſcovered genius, would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, again ſpringing up in their boſom, the arts of which they gave the moſt perfect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and the ſciences, whoſe foundations were laid by them.</p>

                     <pb n="170" facs="unknown:024210_0169_0FC56B1D499A7F00"/>The uſual ſpeculations of ſome merchants would without doubt have been deranged, and their profits diminiſhed; but the real welfare of all people would have been augmented, becauſe it is not poſſible to extend the ſpace on the globe in which agriculture flouriſhes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is ſecure, and induſtry active, without increaſing for the uſe of all men the maſs of enjoyments and reſourſes. Can it be deſirable that a philoſopher ſhould prefer the riches of ſome nations to the liberty of an entire peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the commerce of a few cities to the progreſs of agriculture and of the arts in a great empire? Far from us be thoſe deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſoners who would ſtill hold Greece in in Turkiſh chains, in order that they may ſeize on the perſons of men, ſell them as herds of cattle, compel them, by the dread of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to furniſh food for their inſatiable ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice; and who gravely calculate the pretended wealth which it produced, by theſe outrages on nature.</p>
                  <p>That men ſhould every where be free, and that each country ſhould enjoy the advantages given it by nature, would be the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of all people, as well of thoſe who have reaſſumed their rights as of thoſe in which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain individuals, and not the community, have been benefited by the diſtreſs of others.

                  <p>Thus thought M. Turgot; and thus Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire could not but think.</p>
                  <p>Men have declaimed againſt the injuſtice of a war againſt the Turks: can we be unjuſt toward a hoard of robbers, who hold a people in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and whoſe avidious ferocity overwhelms theſe people with outrages? Let them return to thoſe deſerts which the imbecility of Europe permitted them to quit, ſince, in their brutal pride, they have continued to produce a race of tyrants! At length, let the country of thoſe to whom we owe our knowledge, our arts, and even our virtues, ceaſe to be diſhonoured by the preſence of a people who unite the deſpicable vices of effeminacy to the ferocity of ſavages!</p>
                  <p>Fears are entertained for the balance of Europe, as though ſuch conqueſts would not diminiſh, inſtead of increaſing the power of the conquerors; as though Aſia muſt not long offer an eaſy prey to the ambitious, which would give them a diſtaſte for the hazardous conqueſts which might be obtained in Europe. It is not the policy of princes, it is the wiſdom of a civiliſed people, which muſt forever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the peace of Europe; and the more civilization ſhall extend over the earth, the more ſhall we behold war and conqueſts, as well as ſlavery and miſery, diſappear.</p>

This prince, who had long in his conduct contemned the precepts of the moral chriſtian, was not, however, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to ſuperſtitious terrors. The menaces of religion aſſumed new vigour to terrify him on the appearance of the leaſt danger; but he imagined that a promiſe of continence ſo eaſily made on a death-bed, and certain words from the mouth of a prieſt, could expiate the errors of a reign of ſixty years. Even more ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid than ſuperſtitious, accuſtomed by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal de Fleury to conſider liberty of thought as a cauſe of diſorder in ſtates, or at leaſt of embarraſſment to governments, it was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs in deſpight of himſelf that under his reign human reaſon made a rapid progreſs in France. He who laboured for its advancement with moſt ſucceſs and ſplendour was become the object of his hatred. Yet he reſpected in Voltaire the glory of France; and could not view, without pride, the admiration of Europe place one of his ſubjects in the firſt rank of illuſtrious characters.</p>
                  <p>His death made no change in Voltaire's ſituation. To the prejudices of Cardinal de Fleury, M. Maurepas joined a ſtill more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable hatred of all thoſe who roſe ſuperior to the ordinary claſs of men.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire had been profuſe of his exaggerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed praiſe of Louis XV. till the time of his viſit to the court of Pruſſia, but without being able to diſarm the king's unjuſt diſlike of him. He
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:024210_0172_0FC56B24C0377F08"/>
had obſerved an almoſt abſolute ſilence from the period in which the errors and misfortunes of this reign would have rendered eulogy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But after the death of that monarch he dared to be juſt to his memory, at the inſtant in which nearly the whole nation ſeemed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in wounding his name. It has been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the philoſophers, whom Louis XV. did not patronize, were at that time the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who obſerved ſome impartiality; while the prieſts, laden with his benefactions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted his weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>The new reign ſoon preſented to Voltaire hopes which he had not dared to form. M. Turgot was called to the adminiſtration. Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire knew him to be a man of profound ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, who, in every ſpecies of ſcience, had created ſure and determinate principles on which he had founded all his opinions, and according to which he directed the whole of his conduct; a glory that no other ſtateſman has been worthy of partaking with him. He knew that, to a ſoul zealous for the truth and for the happineſs of man, M. Turgot united fortitude that was above all fear, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of character ſuperior to all diſſimulation; that in his eyes the moſt important ſituation was but the means of executing his ſalutary views; and appeared to him no more than a vile ſlavery when that hope ſhould be loſt. In fine, Voltaire knew that, free from all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and deteſting, in thoſe prejudices, the
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:024210_0173_0FC56B276553C558"/>
moſt dangerous enemies of the human race, M. Turgot regarded the liberty of thought and of the preſs as the right of each citizen, and the right of entire nations, whoſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the progreſs of reaſon alone can eſtabliſh on an immoveable baſis.</p>
                  <p>In the nomination of M. Turgot, Voltaire ſaw the dawn of the reign of reaſon; ſo long diſavowed and much longer perſecuted; he dared to look for the rapid fall of prejudices, and for the deſtruction of that cowardly and tyrannic policy which, to flatter the pride or indolence of men in place, had condemned the people to humiliation and miſery.</p>
                  <p>Yet his attempts in favour of the vaſſals of Mount Jura were ineffectual; and in vain he endeavoured to obtain for d'Etallonde, and for the memory of the Chevalier de la Barré, that diſtinguiſhed juſtice which humanity and the national honour equally required. Theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were foreign to the department of the finances; and that ſuperiority of information, of character, and of virtue, which M. Turgot could not conceal, had created him, in the other miniſters and in the intriguing ſubalterns of office, too many enemies; who, finding neither ambition nor perſonal projects to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in him, bent themſelves againſt all that they believed conſonant with his juſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent deſigns</p>
                  <p>Beſide, liberty could not be reſtored to the vaſſals of mount Jura without offending the
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:024210_0174_0FC56B2CC51C5980"/>
parliament of Befançon; the reviſion of the proceſs of Abbeville had humiliated that of Paris; and an unwiſe policy had re-eſtabliſhed the parliaments without taking advantage of their temporary overthrow, and the little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of thoſe who had replaced them, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into the laws and tribunals an entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, the neceſſity of which was felt by all enlightened men. But an adminiſtration which was feeble, and the enemy of reformation, did not dare or did not wiſh to ſeize this occaſion, in which the public good had found ſtill leſs obſtacles than in the inſtance which was ſo ſhamefully neglected by the Chancellor Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peou.</p>
                  <p>Thus alſo, through complaiſance to the prejudices of the parliaments, miniſters ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the advantages for the reform of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be loſt, which was offered to them by the deſtruction of the Jeſuits. They did not even, in 1774, take any precaution to prevent the renewal of the contentions which, in 1770, had led to the ruin of the magiſtracy. They had purſued but a ſingle object, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſecuring a perſonal gratitude, which gave to the authors of the change a means of employing a credit of the corps, whoſe re-eſtabliſhment was their work, with ſucceſs againſt the rivals of their power.</p>
                  <p>Hence the only advantage which Voltaire could obtain, from the adminiſtration of M. Turgot, was to withdraw the little country of

Gex from the tyranny of the farms. Separat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from France by mountains, having an eaſy communication with Geneva and Switzerland, this unfortunate country could not be ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the revenue laws without becoming the theatre of perpetual war between the ſervants of the revenue and the inhabitants, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying expences for the collection ſtill more burdenſome than the impoſts themſelves. The little importance of this regulation ſhould have rendered it eaſy; yet, it was long ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, in vain, by M. de Voltaire.</p>
                  <p>Part of the provinces of France have, through various cauſes eſcaped the yoke of the Farm-general, or have only borne half of its weight; but the farmers-general have inceſſantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their limits, and envelloped in their chains detached cantons which had long been protected by feudal privileges. They believed that their God Terminus, like that of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, ought never to recede; and that the firſt ſtep he ſhould retreat would be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of deſtruction to the empire. Their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, however, could not induce M. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to abandon a juſt and beneficent operation, which without injury to the revenue, would leſſen the burden of the inhabitants, diminiſh the burden of crimes and oppreſſions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore proſperity and peace to a diſtrict pillag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by deſpotiſm.</p>
                  <p>The country of Gex, then, was delivered from the yoke, on condition of raiſing thirty

thouſand livres; and Voltaire had the pleaſure of writing to his friends, in a parody of a verſe of Mithridates;

                  </p>
                  <p>Voltaire's reſpect for M. Turgot would have been augmented by the edicts of 1776 had not he already known that miniſter's genius, and comprehended his views. This great ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had perceived that, placed at the head of the finances at a moment in which he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed by the maſs of the public debt, and by obſtacles which the courtiers and the firſt miniſter oppoſed to every great reform in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration and to all important economy, he could not diminiſh the impoſts; but he wiſhed, at leaſt, to give ſome conſolation to the people, and ſome indemnity to the proprietors of lands by reſtoring to them rights of which they had been deprived by oppreſſive regulations.</p>
                  <p>The remains of feudal ſlavery which ſpread deſolation through the country, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the poor to labour without hire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived agriculture of the huſbandmen's cattle, were changed into an impoſt, paid only by the proprietors of land. Through all the cities, ridiculous corporations obliged a part of the inhabitants to purchaſe the right of labouring; thoſe who ſubſiſted by commerce or their own induſtry were compelled to live under the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalage
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:024210_0177_0FC56B33D8EDBAA8"/>
of a certain number of privileged peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or to pay a tribute to theſe bodies; this abſurd inſtitution diſappeared, and the right of freely employing their time and ſtrength was reſtored to the citizens.</p>
                  <p>The proprietors of grain and of wine, the firſt harraſſed by popular prejudices, the other by deſpotic privileges, which had been extorted by particular cities, were relieved from thoſe oppreſſions; and theſe wiſe laws could not fall to accelerate the progreſs of agriculture, and multiply the national wealth, by inſuring the ſubſiſtence of the people.</p>
                  <p>But theſe beneficent edicts were the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of that miniſter's fall who had the boldneſs to conceive them. They excited the oppoſition of the parliaments who were intereſted in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Jurandes<note n="*" place="bottom">The wardenſhip of the different companies of tradeſmen.</note> the fertile ſource of lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative law ſuits, who were not leſs attached to the old regulations which furniſhed them with the means of acting on the minds of the people, who were irritated to ſee the burthen of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing roads laid on the oppulent owners of land, and were without any hope that an unworthy condeſcenſion would continue to lighten the weight of their individual taxes, but who were more particularly alarmed at the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which ſeemed to be acquired by a miniſter whoſe benevolent ſpirit menaced the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of their power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="unknown:024210_0178_0FC56B37D2CCD5F0"/>The intrigues of the enemies of M. Turgot were ſtrengthened by this league of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and it was then perceived how ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their ſecret and pernicious deſigns was the manner in which the tribunals had been re-eſtabliſhed; it was then ſeen how dangerous it is to a miniſter to deſign the welfare of the people; and, perhaps, were we to mount up to the cauſe of events, we ſhould find that the fall even of vicious miniſters has originated in the good which they wiſhed to do, and not in the evil which they have produced.</p>
                  <p>In the calamities of France, Voltaire beheld the deſtruction of hopes which he had entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the advancement of the human mind. He had imagined that intolerance, ſuperſtition, and the monſterous prejudices which infected every branch of legiſlation, every department of power, and all conditions of ſociety, would have fled before a miniſter who was the friend of juſtice, of liberty and reaſon. Such as have accuſed Voltaire of baſe adulation, ſuch as have bitterly reproached him with the uſe which he made of praiſe, perhaps too fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>quent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to influence the minds of powered men and to compel them to be juſt and humane, may compare thoſe praiſes to his eulogy of M. Turgot, and to his Epiſtle to a Man which he addreſſed to that miniſter at the moment of his diſgrace. They will then diſtinguiſh the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration which is the reſult of feeling, from a compliment; and the eſteem which ariſes in
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:024210_0179_0FC56B3B5AAED368"/>
the ſoul, from the play of imagination; and they will perceive that Voltaire committed no other crime than that of treating courtiers as women: nearly the ſame proteſtations are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the whole ſex, and it is the tone alone that diſtinguiſhes the praiſe which is felt from that which is given to politeneſs.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire, offering incenſe to the kings and miniſters to engage them on the ſide of truth, and Voltaire, celebrating genious and virtue, ſpeaks not the ſame language. Did he wiſh only to flatter, he was prodigal of the charms of his brilliant imagination, he multiplied theſe ingenious ideas which were ever ready at his call; but did he wiſh to render an homage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by his heart, it was his ſoul which eſcaped him, it was his reaſon which ſpoke. During his viſit to Paris his admiration of M. Turgot was infuſed through all his diſcourſe. M. Turgot was the man whom he oppoſed to all who complained of the depravity of our age; and to him his mind gave his intire approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I have ſeen him take his hands, bathe them with his tears, kiſs them in deſpight of M. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got's reſiſtance, and cry with a voice interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſobs: "Let me kiſs the hand which would ſeal the happineſs of the people."</p>
                  <p>Voltaire had long deſired to reviſit his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to enjoy his reputation in the midſt of the ſame people who had been the witneſs of his firſt ſucceſs and too often the accomplice of his enemies. M. de Villette had lately, at
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:024210_0180_0FC56B3CC2D4B370"/>
Ferne, eſpouſed Mademoiſelle de Varicour, a lady deſcended from a noble family in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Gex, whom her relations had confided to the care of Madame Denis. Voltaire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied them to Paris, partly led by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſeeing the repreſentation of the trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Irene, which he had ſhortly before finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It had been kept a profound ſecret; and malice had not time to prepare her poiſon, nor would the public enthuſiaſm have permitted its operation. A croud of men and women of every rank and condition, from whom his verſes had drawn the tears of humanity, who had ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently admired his genius at the theatre and in reading his works, who were indebted to him for their improvement, whole prejudices he had deſtroyed, and to whom he had impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſpark of that zeal againſt fanaticiſm by whoſe flame he was devoured, were eager to behold him. Jealouſy was ſilent before a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which it was impoſſible to extinguiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the benefit which he had conferred on mankind. Miniſters, and proud prelates, were obliged to reſpect the idol of the nation. This enthuſiaſm was even ſpread through the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ranks of the people; they crowded round his windows, and paſſed whole hours there with the hope of ſeeing him for one moment. His carriage, which could ſcarcely proceed along the ſtreets, was ſurrounded by a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous multitude, who bleſſed him and celebrated his works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="unknown:024210_0181_0FC56B4049B3AC50"/>The French academy, which had not adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him till the age of fifty-two, laviſhed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours on him, and received him rather as ſovereign of the empire of letters than as an equal. The children of thoſe haughty cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, whoſe pride had been wounded to ſee him live in their ſociety without meanneſs, and who had wiſhed to humiliate in his perſon the ſuperiority of genius and talents, contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the honour of being preſented to him, and of an opportunity to boaſt that they had ſeen Voltaire.</p>
                  <p>But it was at the theatre, where he had ſo long reigned, that he had the greateſt honours to expect. He went to the third repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Irene; which was, indeed, but a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tragedy; which, however, poſſeſſed many beauties, and in which the wrinkles of age could not conceal the ſacred impreſſion of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. He alone drew the attention of a people, eager to diſtinguiſh his features, to obſerve his geſtures, to purſue the direction of his eyes. His buſt was crowned on the ſtage in the midſt of applauſe, cries of joy, and tears of enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm. To quit the theatre he muſt paſs through the multitude that crouded round him; feeble, ſcarce able to ſupport himſelf, the guards, which were deſigned to protect him from the eagerneſs of zeal, became uſeleſſ at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, each retired with a reſpectful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or diſputed the honour of ſupporting him a moment on the ſtares; each ſtep offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:024210_0182_0FC56B43B21A8DA8"/>
him new aid, nor was any one permitted to arrogate too long the right of giving him aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>The ſpectators followed him to his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the air was filled with the cries of "Long live Voltaire! Long live the Henriade! Long live Mahomet!" numbers fell at his feet, and numbers kiſſed his garment. Never has man been received with more intereſting marks of admiration and of public affection, nor ever has genius been honoured by a more flattering homage; and this homage was addreſſed, not to his power, but to the happineſs which he had conferred on man. An illuſtrious poet would have been received only with plaudits: tears flowed before the philosopher, who had deſtroyed the fetters of reaſon, and avenged the cauſe of humanity.</p>
                  <p>The ſublime and impaſſioned ſoul of Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire was moved with theſe tributes of reſpect and zeal: "They wiſhed me to die with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure," he ſaid; but it was the voice of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and not the artifice of ſelf-love. In the midſt of the honours paid him by the French academy, he was particularly ſtruck by the poſſibility of introducing into that place a more daring philoſophy: "They treat me with more attention than I merit," he ſaid to me, one day; "do you know that I do not deſpair of cauſing the eulogium of Coligny to be ſpoken there?"</p>
                  <p>During the run of Irene, he was employed
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:024210_0183_0FC56B450CA175A0"/>
in reviſing his eſſay on the Manners and the ſpirit of Nations; and to give, in that world ſome new wounds to fanaticiſm. He had with ſecret pleaſure obſerved, at the theatre, that the lines which were received with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt acclamations were thoſe in which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked ſuperſtition and the names the had long rendered ſacred; and it was to this object to aſcribed all the glory he had acquired. He beheld, in that general admiration, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire which he had exerciſed over the mind, and the deſtruction of prejudices which he had accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>At this ſame time, Paris boaſted, alſo, the preſence of the celebrated Franklin, who, in another hemiſphere, had been the apoſtle of philoſophy and toleration. Like Voltaire, he had often employed the weapon of humour which corrects the abſurdities of men, and had diſplayed their perverſeneſs as a folly more fatal, but alſo worthy of pity. He had joined to the ſcience of metaphyſics the genius of practical philoſophy; as Voltaire, that of poetry. Franklin had delivered the vaſt countries of America from the yoke of Europe; and Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire had freed Europe from the yoke of the ancient theocracy of Aſia. Franklin was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſee a man whoſe reputation had long been ſpread over both worlds; Voltaire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had loſt the habit of ſpeaking En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, endeavoured to ſupport the converſation in that language; and, afterwards reaſſuming
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:024210_0184_0FC56B46852CB500"/>
the French, he ſaid: "Je n'ai pu réſiſter au deſit de parler un moment la langue de M. Franklin<note n="*" place="bottom">I could not reſiſt the deſire of ſpeaking the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Mr. Franklin for a moment.</note>."</p>
                  <p>The American philoſopher preſented his grandſon to Voltaire, with a requeſt that he would give him his benediction. "God and liberty!" ſaid Voltaire: "it is the only bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which can be given to the grandſon of Franklin." They went together to a public aſſembly of the academy of ſciences, and the public at the ſame time beheld with emotion theſe two men, born in different quarters of the globe, reſpectable by their years, their glory, the employment of their lives, and both enjoyed the influence which they had exerciſed over the age in which they lived. They em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced each other in the midſt of public accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and it was ſaid to be Solon who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Sophocles. But the French Sophocles had trampled on error and advanced the reign of reaſon; and the Solon of Philadelphia, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed the conſtitution of his country on the immoveable foundation of the rights of men, had no fear of ſeeing his uncertain laws, even during his own life, open the way to tyranny and prepare fetters for his country.</p>
                  <p>Age had not enfeebled the activity of Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, and the tranſports with which he was received by his fellow citizens ſeemed to renew his vigour. He formed the deſign of
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:024210_0185_0FC56B4B604BCAB0"/>
refuting whatever the Duke de St. Simon, in his memoirs, then unpubliſhed, had written under the influence of hatred and prejudice, leſt theſe memoirs, which might derive ſome authority from the known probity of the author and from his rank and title of cotemporary, ſhould appear at a time in which men would be too far removed from the events of which he ſpeaks, to detect error and defend the truth.</p>
                  <p>He had alſo induced the French academy to adopt the deſign of forming its dictionary on a new plan. They were to have deduced the hiſtory of each word from the period in which it had appeared in the language, to give the various meanings which it aſſumed in different ages, and the various acceptations it had received, and to employ, in order to diſplay theſe varied ſhades, not capricious phraſes, but examples ſelected from authors of the greateſt authority. Then would have been ſeen the true literary and grammatical dictionary of the language, and not only fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners but even Frenchmen might, in that work, have acquired a knowledge of all its delicacy.</p>
                  <p>This dictionary would have preſented in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive pages to men of letters, would have contributed to form the national taſte, and arreſted the progreſs of corruption. Each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ademician was to have explained a letter of the alphabet. Voltaire undertook the letter A; and, to excite the induſtry of his brethren,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:024210_0186_0FC56B4EF10E0778"/>
and to baniſh the difficulty of executing this plan, he was deſirous to finiſh, within a few months, that part of the work which he had aſſumed.</p>
                  <p>His ſtrength was waſted by ſuch exceſſive application; and he had been much reduced by a ſpitting of blood, cauſed by his efforts during the repreſentation of Irene. Yet, the activity of his mind ſubdued all; and conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him the real weakneſs of his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At length, deprived of ſleep by an irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation produced by too intenſe labour, he wiſhed to procure ſome hours repoſe, that he might be in a condition to lead the academy irrevocably to engage in the new dictionary, againſt which ſome objections had ariſen; and he reſolved to take opium. His imagination poſſeſſed all its vivacity, his ſoul was equally reſtleſs and impetuous, his character abated not of its gaiety and vigour, when he took the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate which he judged to be neceſſary. During the ſame evening, his friends had heard him expreſs his deteſtation of prejudices with his uſual eloquence; and ſoon after beheld him viewing them only on the ridiculous ſide, and deriding them with that peculiar grace and aptneſs which characteriſed his ſallies of wit. But he took the opiate at ſeveral doſes, and was deceived as to the quantity, probably in the ſpecies of intoxication which the firſt had produced. The ſame accident happened to him about thirty before, and then placed his
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:024210_0187_0FC56B5037B06C88"/>
life in danger. Unhappily, this time, his waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed powers were unable to contend with the poiſon. He had long been ſubject to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in the bladder, and in the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of his organs, that ſoon contracted an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely could he, during the long interval between this fatal accident and his death, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his recollection for a few ſucceſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or diſengage himſelf from the lethargy in which he was plunged. To the young Count de Lalli, however, who was even then celebrated for his courage, and who has ſince deſerved celebrity by his eloquence and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm, he wrote, in one of theſe intervals, thoſe lines, the laſt which were traced by his hand, in which he applauds the royal authority whoſe juſtice had lately annulled one of the attroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acts of parliamentary deſpotiſm. At length he expired on the 30th of May, 1778.</p>
                  <p>The arrival of Voltaire at Paris had re-kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled the fury of the fanatics, and wounded the pride of the chiefs of the hierarchy; but it had alſo inſpired ſome prieſts with an idea of building their reputation and their fortune on the converſion of this illuſtrious enemy. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, they could not flatter themſelves with the hope of ſubduing him, but they did not des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of inducing him to diſſemble. Voltaire, who wiſhed to remain at Paris without being tormented by ſacerdotal accuſations, and who, from a habit acquired in his youth, thought it
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:024210_0188_0FC56B51B8AD8198"/>
beneficial to the intereſts even of the friends of reaſon, that certain ſcenes of intolerance ſhould not ſucceed his laſt moments, had ſent in the beginning of his malady for an almoner of the incurables, and who had boaſted of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the boſom of the church the Abbé de L'Attaignant, known by offences of another kind.</p>
                  <p>The Abbé Gauthier confeſſed Voltaire, and received a profeſſion of faith from him, by which he declared that he died in the catholic religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which he was born.</p>
                  <p>When this circumſtance was known, which offended enlightened men rather more than it edified the devotees, the curate of Saint Sulpice ran to his pariſhoner, who received him with politeneſs, and gave him according to uſage a handſome offering for his poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But, mortified that the Abbé Gauthier had anticipated him, he diſcovered that the almoner of the incurables had been too eaſily ſatiſfied with his penitent, and that he ought to have required a more particular profeſſion faith, and an expreſs diſavowal of all the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, contrary to orthodoxy, which Voltaire tad been accuſed of maitaining. The Abbé Gauthiers pretended that, by requiring every thing, all would have been loſt. During this diſpute, Voltaire recovered, Irene was play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the converſion was forgotten. But, in the moment of the relapſe, the curate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Voltaire, abſolutely reſolved not to
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:024210_0189_0FC56B59EADC84D8"/>
inter him, if he could not obtain the deſired recantation of his errors.</p>
                  <p>This curate was among thoſe men who are a mixture of hypocriſy and imbecility; he ſpoke with the obſtinate perſuaſion of a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac, and acted with the flexibility of a jeſuit; he was humble in his manners even to baſeneſs, arrogant in his ſacerdotal pretenſions, fawning with the great, and charitable to the populace who are governed by the prieſts that diſtribute alms to them, and, in fine, he harraſſed the ſimple citizens, by his imperious fanaticiſm. He earneſtly wiſhed to compel Voltaire at leaſt to acknowledge the divine nature of Jeſus Chriſt; to which he was more attached than any other dogma. He, one day, drew Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire from his lethargy, by ſhouting in his ear: "Do you believe the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt?" "In the name of God, ſir," replied Voltaire, "ſpeak to me no more of that man; but let me die in peace."</p>
                  <p>The prieſt then declared he was compelled to refuſe him burial; but he was not authoriſed in this refuſal; for, according to the laws, it ought to have been preceded by a ſentence of excommunication, or a ſecular judgment; and even an appeal might have been made againſt an excommunication, as a matter of abuſe. Voltaire's family, by complaining to the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would have obtained juſtice; but they feared the fanaticiſm of that body and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of its members to Voltaire, who had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:024210_0190_0FC56B5AB56EA278"/>
combated its pretenſions and exerted his powers againſt its injuſtice. They did not perceive that the parliament could not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſgrace to itſelf, depart from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on which it had acted in favour of the Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt; they did not know that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the young magiſtrates waited only for an occaſion of effacing, by ſome ſplendid act, the reproach of fanaticiſm by which they were degraded, of dignifying themſelves, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining a mark of reſpect to the memory of a man of genius whom they had been unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate enough to number among their enemies, and of ſhewing that they choſe rather to atone for their injuſtice, than to yield to any incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vengeance. The friends of Voltaire did not obſerve how much power they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by that enthuſiaſm which his name had excited; an enthuſiaſm which had gained eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry claſs in the nation, and which no authority would venture openly to inſult.</p>
                  <p>They choſe rather to negociate with go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Daring neither to offend public opinion by gratifying the vengeance of the clergy, nor to diſpleaſe the prieſts by compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to obey the laws, fearing to mortify ſacerdotal pride, ſhould they erect a public monument to a great man whoſe aſhes were baſely diſturbed by prieſts, or ſhould they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnify his memory for the loſs of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic honours, to which he had ſo little claim, by civic honours due to his genius and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:024210_0191_0FC56B5EE33C2440"/>
be had done the nation, miniſters appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a propoſal which was made of removing Voltaire's body to the church of a monaſtery, of which his, nephew was abbé. It was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly conducted to Scellières, and the prieſts agreed not to interrupt the execution of this deſign. However, two ladies, of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rank and very great devotees, wrote to the biſhop of Troyes to engage him, in quality, of diocean biſhop, to oppoſe the burial. But, fortunately for the honour of the biſhop, theſe letters arrived too late, and Voltaire was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred.</p>
                  <p>The French academy had obſerved a cuſtom of ſaying maſs at the church of the Cordeliers for each of their deceaſed members. The archbiſhop of Paris, Beaumont, ſo well known by his ignorance and fanaticiſm, prohibited the performance of the ceremony. The Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers obeyed with regret; but they knew that the confeſſors of the archbiſhop would pardon his ſpirit of revenge, and would forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend juſtice to him. The academy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, reſolved to ſuſpend the practice of this ceremony till the inſult offered to the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious of its members ſhould be repaired.

                  <p>Mean while the King of Pruſſia commanded a ſolemn maſs to be ſaid for Voltaire in the catholic church of Berlins and the academy of
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:024210_0192_0FC56B5F32C80FA0"/>
Pruſſia was invited to attend. But that which was more glorious to Voltaire, was, that the king in the field of battle, where, at the head of an hundred and fifty thouſand men, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the rights of the princes of the empire, and impoſed laws on the Auſtrian power, wrote the eulogium of that illuſtrious man, whoſe diſciple and friend he had been, and who, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, had never pardoned him the unworthy and diſgraceful violence which he had endured at Franckfort, but towards whom the monarch was inceſſantly and involuntarily led by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural taſte and his admiration of genius. This eulogium nobly compenſated for the mean ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the prieſts.</p>
                  <p>Of all the enormities which, in the times of ignorance and ſuperſtition, the prieſts have obtained the power of committing againſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature with impunity, that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed on the bodies of the deceaſed is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably the leaſt prejudicial; and, in the eyes of enlightened men, thoſe outrages can appear no other than a title of renown. Yet, reſpect for the remains of men who have been dear to us is no prejudice; it is an affection inſpired by nature herſelf, who has placed, in the receſſes of our hearts, a veneration for ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing that can recal to our remembrance beings whom friendſhip or gratitude have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſacred to our feelings. The liberty of offering a ſorrowful homage to their aſhes is
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:024210_0193_0FC56B64636756D8"/>
then a precious right to delicate minds, and the power of chooſing that which their ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall dictate, cannot, without injuſtice, be taken away; ſtill leſs may this conſolation be forbidden at the will of an intolerant ſect, who have uſurped, with an audacity too long endured, the right of controuling the thoughts of men, or of inflicting puniſhment for them.</p>
                  <p>Beſide, the empire of prejudice over the minds of the populace is not yet deſtroyed; a Chriſtian deprived of burial, is ſtill in the eyes of inferior people, the object of horror and diſdain; and this injuſtice is extended even to his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If, indeed, the hatred of prieſts would purſue none but men who are immortalized by their works and whoſe glory embraces all ages, we might pardon their deſpicable efforts; but their hatred may be attached to victims leſs il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious; and all men have the ſame rights.</p>
                  <p>Government, in ſome degree aſhamed of its feeble conduct, hoped to eſcape public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by prohibiting the name of Voltaire in any writings, or in thoſe places where the police was accuſtomed to violate the freedom of ſpeech, under the pretence of preſerving or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which it too often confounded with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect paid to eſtabliſhed and protected follies.</p>
                  <p>The public papers were forbidden to ſpeak of his death; and the comedians had orders to perform none of his pieces. Miniſters did not diſcover that means like theſe, of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the anger of the nation againſt their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:024210_0194_0FC56B68F35EFC58"/>
would only ſerve more fully to provoke it; and to demonſtrate that they had neither courage to merit the approbation nor to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the blame of the public.</p>
                  <p>This ſimple recital of the incidents of the life of Voltaire has ſufficiently developed his character and his mind; the principal features of which were benevolence, indulgence for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man foibles, and a hatred of injuſtice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. He may be numbered among the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few men in whom the love of humanity was a real paſſion; which the nobleſt of all paſſions, was known only to modern times, and took riſe from the progeſs of knowledge. Its very exiſtence is ſufficient to confound the blind partiſans of antiquity, and thoſe who calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>But the happy qualities of Voltaire were oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en perverted by his natural reſtleſſneſs, which the writing of tragedy had but increaſed. In an inſtant he would change from anger to affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from indignation to a jeſt. Born with violent paſſions, they often hurried him too far; and his reſtleſſneſs deprived him of the advantages which uſually accompany ſuch minds; particularly of that fortitude to which fear is no obſticle, when action becomes a duty, and which is not ſhaken by the preſence of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger foreſeen. Often would Voltaire expoſe himſelf to the ſtorm with raſhneſs, but rarely did he brave it with conſtancy; and theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, of temerity and weakneſs, have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:024210_0195_0FC56B6A7866B0B0"/>
afflicted his friends, and afforded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy cauſe of triumph to his cowardly foes.</p>
                  <p>His affections were permanent, and his friendship for Génonville, the preſident de Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Formont, Cideville, the Marchioneſs du Chalelet, d'Argental, and d'Alembert, ſeldom obſcured by paſſing clouds, ended only with his life. From his works we diſcover that few men of feeling have ſo long preſerved the remembrance of friends loſt in early youth.</p>
                  <p>He has been reproached with his numerous diſputes, but in none of theſe he was the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor. His enemies, thoſe at leaſt to whom he was irreconcileable, and whom he devoted to the world's contempt, did not confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to perſonal attacks; they were his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers to the fanatics, and wiſhed to bring down the ſword of perſecution on his head. It is no doubt afflicting to be obliged to place in this liſt men of real merit; men like the poet Roſſeau the two Pompignans<note n="*" place="bottom">One of them has lately, by his noble and patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic conduct, effaced the ſpots which his epiſcopal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations had fixed upon his reputation. He is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeen to adopt the ſame principles of freedom, with fortitude, for which in his works he bitterly reproached philoſophers, and againſt which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the vengeance of deſpotiſm. It would be wrong to accuſe him of wilful tergiverſation: nothing is more common that men who, to a worthy mind and integrity of underſtanding, join timidity; and dare not examine certain principles, nor think for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on certain ſubjects, till firſt ſupported by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic opinion.</note>, Larcher, and even Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau

of Geneva. But it is not more excuſable to carry vengeance too far, in ſelf-defence, and to be unjuſt in the indulgence of anger, the firſt motive of which is founded in rectitude, than to violate the rights of man, by endangering the freedom and ſafety of a citizen, to gratify pride, the aims of hypocriſy, or an obſtinate attachment to opinion?</p>
                  <p>Voltaire has been cenſured, for his attacks on Maupertuis; but were not theſe attacks confined to the mere act of rendering a man eternally ridiculous, who, by baſe intrigues, had endeavoured to diſhonour and ruin him; and who, to revenge ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ſts, had called the power of a king, irritated by his inſidious arts, to his aid?</p>
                  <p>Voltaire, it is ſaid, was envious; which has been anſwered by the following line, from Tancred:
<q>De qui dans l'univers peut-il etre jalouſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Does the world contain a man whom he might envy</note>?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes, he was envious of Buffon. What! could the man whoſe mighty arm had ſhaken the antique pillars of the temple of ſuperſtition, and who aſpired to metamorphoſe the vile herd which ſo long had groaned under the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal rod into men, could be envious of the lucky and ſplendid deſcription of the manners of a few animals or the more or leſs fortunate combination of ſome ſyſtems, the falſity of which is proved by facts?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="unknown:024210_0197_0FC56B74888A4398"/>He was envious of J. J. Rouſſeau. The bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Rouſſeau did indeed excite that of Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire: but was the philoſopher who beheld the progreſs of knowledge, poliſhing, eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating, and perfecting the human ſpecies, and who enjoyed the revolution as his proper work, was he jealous of the eloquent writer who wiſhed to condemn the mind of man to eternal ignorance; Could the enemy of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry be jealous of him who, not finding ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fame in the deſtruction of its altars, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavoured to rebuild them?</p>
                  <p>Voltaire did not do juſtice to the genius of Rouſſeau, becauſe his mind being equitable, and void of affectation, felt an involuntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance, to exaggeration; becauſe a tone of auſterity preſented to his fancy a tincture of hypocriſy, the ſmalleſt ſhade of which could not but diſguſt his frank and independent ſoul; and becauſe, being accuſtomed himſelf to treat all ſubjects with humour, gravity in the little details of paſſion, or of human life, always appeared to him to partake of the ridiculous. He was unjuſt, becauſe Rouſſeau had angered him, by returning injury to offers of ſervice; had accuſed him of perſecution, when he was employed in his defence, and had himſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the hand of perſecution toward Voltaire.</p>
                  <p>He was jealous of Monteſquieu. He had cauſe to complain of the author of the ſpirit of laws, who affected to treat him with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and almoſt with contempt; partly
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:024210_0198_0FC56B75F811F160"/>
from fooliſh pride, and partly from timid poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Yet the celebrated ſaying of Voltaire, that, "Humanity had loſt its charms, and that Monteſquieu found and reſtored them," is the beſt eulogium ever pronounced on the ſpirit of laws, and even exceeds the limits of juſtice. It is only true relatively to France; ſince, without mentioning the works of Althuſius<note n="*" place="bottom">A German lawyer, of the XVI. century, who maintained at that time that all power originated in the people.</note> and ſome others, the rights of man were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed with more energy and candour in the works of Locke and Sidney, than in thoſe of Monteſquieu.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire often criticiſed the ſpirit of laws, but uſually with juſtice. The proof that he was right, in attacking Monteſquieu, is that we now perceive the moſt abſurd and fatal prejudices finding ſupport by quoting works of that celebrated man; which, had not the progreſs of knowledge at length broken the fetters forged by the dogmas of authority, concerning queſtions which ought only to be ſubmitted to the teſt of reaſon, would in the preſent day have done more miſchief to France, than they had done good to Europe. The enthuſiaſtic partiſans of Monteſquieu have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that Voltaire was incapable either of judging or of underſtanding his works. Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by ſuch aſſertions, he well might mingle
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:024210_0199_0FC56961386F0D50"/>
a little ill humour with juſt remark; in which he would be ſanctioned by haughtineſs ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
                  <p>The faſhion of taxing Voltaire with envy was ſo prevalent, that to this paſſion have been attributed his ſage obſervations on the work of Helvetius; which, from reſpect to a perſecuted philoſopher, he had the delicacy not to publiſh during the life of that writer. Nay, his very anger at the ſhort lived ſucceſs of ſome ill wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ten tragedies was called envy; as if anger could not be felt, except relatively to ſelf, at ſeeing fame uſurped, which is ſo often fatal to the progreſs of philoſophy and the arts. How much has the praiſe ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally beſtowed on Richelieu, Colbert, and other miniſters, impeded the advancement of reaſon, in the ſcience of politics!</p>
                  <p>While we read the works of Voltaire, we perceive no man perhaps ever poſſeſſed accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of underſtanding in a Superior degree. This he preſerved in the enthuſiaſm of poetry, as well as in the exuberance of humour; this was ever the guide of his taſte and of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and is one of the principal reaſons of the inexpreſſible charms which are diſcovered, in the peruſal of his works. No mind perhaps ever combined more ideas at a time, decided with more rapid ſagacity, or diſplayed more depth, in what ever required a laborious analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis or continued meditation. The ſtrength of his eagle-eye often has aſtoniſhed even thoſe
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:024210_0200_0FC56962F4D01C70"/>
who were indebted to ſimilar means for ideas the moſt profound, and combinations the moſt extenſive and preciſe. In converſation he has often been known to ſelect the beſt of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ideas, to arrange them in the moſt perſpicacious and effectual manner, and to clothe them in the moſt happy and brilliant language.</p>
                  <p>Hence the ineſtimable advantage of being ever clear and unaffected without inſipidity and of being read with equal pleaſure by the moſt ignorant, as well as by the moſt enlightened. Reading his works with reflexion, we find in them a multitude of profoundly philoſophic and true maxims; which eſcaped ſuperficial readers, becauſe they do not enforce atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor require any effort to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider him as a poet, we ſhall find that, of the various ſpecies which he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ode and comedy were the only ones in which he did not deſerve the higheſt rank. He failed in comedy becauſe, as it has previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly been remarked, he had the gift of ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ridiculous of opinion, but not of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſuch as could be put in action, and which alone is proper for comedy. Not that, in a country where the mind of man ſhould have freed itſelf from all its bonds, and in which philoſophy ſhould have become popular, abſurd and dangerous opinions might not be ſucceſsfully exhibited on the ſtage: but this kind of freedom is at preſent no where to be found.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="unknown:024210_0201_0FC569643868A0C8"/>To him poetry is indebted for the liberty of exerciſing itſelf in a field more vaſt. He has ſhewn how it may be united with philoſophy; ſo that poetry, without being deprived of any of its charms, riſes to new beauties; and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, without being dry or inflated, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves its accuracy and depth.</p>
                  <p>We cannot read his theatrical writings, without obſerving that to him the tragic art is indebted, for the whole progreſs which it has made ſince Racine: nor can ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n thoſe who refuſe him ſuperiority, or equality, of poetical talents, without ſtupidiy or injuſtice, deny this progreſs. His latter tragedies prove, that he was far from ſuppoſing he had carried this ſo difficult art to its utmoſt extent; he was ſenſible that tragedy might ſtill approach more nearly to nature, without being deprived of its pomp and dignity; that it ſtill addicted itſelf too much to local manners; that the love of women was a too frequent ſubject; that their paſſions ought to be repreſented on the ſtage as they exiſt in life, and their affection firſt diſcovered only by the efforts made to conceal it, and not publicly avowed, unleſs in thoſe moments when exceſs of danger, or of misfortune, no longer admit of diſguiſe. He thought too that characters void of affectation, great by nature, and ſtrangers to intereſt and ambition, might afford a ſource of new beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and impart to tragedy more variety and truth. But he became too feeble to execute
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:024210_0202_0FC56965CAAD7D70"/>
his own conception<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If, therefore, eſpecially in the arts, the man of genius be he who by enriching them has moſt extended their limits, who has me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited this title more than Voltaire? yet has it been refuſed him by writers, moſt of whom were, indeed, too deſtitute of genius them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to feel its true characteriſtics.</p>
                  <p>To Voltaire we are indebted for having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a more extenſive and uſeful view of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than the ancients. It has in his writings become, not a narrative of events, not the picture of the revolutions of a nation, but that of human nature, painted from the life, and the philoſophic reſult of the experience of all people, and of all ages. He firſt introduced true criticiſm into hiſtory; firſt ſhewed that the natural probability of accidents ought to be admitted, as proofs for or againſt hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal authenticity; and that the philoſophic hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian ought, not only to reject miracles, but ſcrupulouſly to examine the motives for cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting thoſe facts which depart from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon order of nature.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps he may occaſionally have forgotten the ſage rule which he himſelf invented, and which, rigorouſly adhered to, may demonſtate truth. Still to him we are indebted for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed hiſtory from that croud of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary incidents, adopted without proof, which,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:024210_0203_0FC5696738F953C0"/>
making the greateſt impreſſion on the mind, blinded men to the moſt natural and the beſt demonſtrated facts. Before his time men knew little of hiſtory, except the fables by which it was disfigured. He ſhewed that the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of politheiſm had never been the religion of any but the vulgar, among the greateſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that the belief of one God, common to all people, had no need of being revealed by ſupernatural means. He proved that all nations have practiſed the grand principles of morality, and with encreaſing purity in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as they were more civilized, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed. He taught us that the influence of religion has often corrupted, but never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved morality.</p>
                  <p>As a philoſopher, he was the firſt to afford an example of a private citizen, who, by his wiſhes and endeavours, embraced the general hiſtory of man in every country and in every age, oppoſing error and oppreſſion of every kind, and defending and promulgating every uſeful truth.</p>
                  <p>The hiſtory of whatever has been done in Europe, in favour of reaſon and humanity, is the hiſtory of his labours and beneficient acts. If the abſurd and dangerous cuſtom of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the dead within the walls of cities, and even in churches, has been aboliſhed in ſome countries: if, on the continent of Europe, men, by means of innoculation, have, in part, eſcaped a diſeaſe which threatened life, and
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:024210_0204_0FC56968B9C73E98"/>

reaſon for the firſt time has begun to ſhed its clear and uniform light over all Europe; we ſhall every where diſcover, in the hiſtory of the changes that have been effected, the name of Voltaire; and ſhall every where find him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the battle or deciding the victory.</p>
                  <p>But generally obliged to conceal his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and maſk his attacks, though his works are in every hand, the principles of his philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy are but little known.</p>
                  <p>Ignorance and error are the ſole cauſe of the miſery of man; and the errors of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition are the moſt fatal, becauſe they corrupt every ſource of reaſon; and their deſtructive enthuſiaſm teaches their adherents to commit crimes without remorſe. That mildneſs of manners which is compatible with every form of government diminiſhes evils, the cure of which reaſon muſt one day effect, and impedes their progreſs. Oppreſſion itſelf, in a humane nation, aſſumes the character of the people; and is rarely guilty of great barbarity, in a country where arts, and eſpecially literature, are beloved. Freedom of thinking is tolerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of reſpect to them, though men want the fortitude to love it for its own ſake.</p>
                  <p>Our endeavours, therefore, ſhould be to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the mild and conſolatory virtues, which lead to reaſon, which all men may practice, which agree with every poliſhed age, and which may teach hypocriſy itſelf ſome good.

                  <p>By informing mankind, and by rendering them more humane, we beſt may hope to lead them the ſureſt and eaſieſt road to freedom. But we neither can hope to ſpread kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The more men are enlightened the more they will be free, and the leſs difficult will be the attainment of freedom. But let us not teach oppreſſors to form a league againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; let us conceal from them the neceſſary and firm union which exiſts between know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and liberty; and let us not too ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them that a nation without prejudice muſt inſtantly be free.</p>
                  <p>If we except theocracies, it is the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate intereſt of all governments that the people ſhould be humane and enlightened. Let us not teach them that their moſt diſtant intereſt
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:024210_0207_0FC5697040A21048"/>
is to leave men in a ſtate of ignorance. Let us not oblige them to chooſe between the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of pride and that of repoſe and fame. To induce them to love reaſon, ſhe muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appear in a gentle and peaceful form; and, far from terrifying them by imprudent threats, while ſhe aſks their ſupport muſt offer her own. If we attack oppreſſors before we have taught the oppreſſed, we ſhall riſk the loſs of liberty and the death of reaſon. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affords proofs of this truth. How often, in deſpite of the generous efforts of the friends of freedom, has a ſingle battle reduced nations to the ſlavery of ages!</p>
                  <p>And what is the kind of liberty enjoyed by thoſe nations which have recovered it by force of arms, and not by the force of reaſon? It has been temporary freedom, and ſo diſturbed by ſtorms that it remained doubtful whether it were or were not an advantage. Have not moſt of them confounded the forms of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm with the enjoyment of right, and the deſpotiſm of numbers with freedom. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unjuſt laws, contrary to the rights of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have diſhonoured the code of all nations which have recovered their liberty, during thoſe ages in which reaſon was ſtill in its child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood!</p>
                  <p>Why not profit by this fatal experience, and wiſely wait the progreſs of knowledge, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtain freedom more effectual more ſubſtantial, and more peaceful? Why purchaſe

it by torrents of blood, and inevitable confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and give that to chance which time muſt certainly and without bloodſhed beſtow? In order to be more free and to be ever ſo, we ſhould wait the time when men, releaſed from their prejudices and guided by reaſon, will be worthy of freedom, becauſe they will know what are its true claims.</p>
                  <p>What therefore is the duty of a philoſopher? To attack ſuperſtition; to point out peace, wealth, and power to governments, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rewards of thoſe laws which ſecure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberty; and to teach them how much they have to fear from prieſts, whoſe ſecret influence will ever m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The philoſopher will ſhew that, without freedom of thought, the ſpirit of the clergy muſt again produce aſſaſſination, tortures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and civil wars; and that, by enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the people only can nations, and kings, be ſecured from ſuch ſacred crimes. He will prove that men who wiſh for abſolute power over the mind, will employ force inſtead of reaſon, will oblige conſcience to cede to their

dogmas, and far from affording morality a more ſolid baſis by combining it with religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous notions, will corrupt and deſtroy it; while they ſeek not to promulgate virtue, but, to make their adherents the blind inſtruments of their ambition and avarice. Should he be aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what is to be the ſuſtitute of the prejudices thus deſtroyed, he would anſwer—"I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered you from a wild beaſt, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring you, and you aſk for a ſubſtitute."</p>
                  <p>Were he to be reproached with repeating the ſame theme too often, and with too obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately attacking errors in themſelves beneath contempt, he will reply—They are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible while credited by the vulgar. And, though it be leſs glorious to combat vulgar error than to teach new truths to ſages, it is neceſſary, in order to break the bonds of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and to open a free road to truth, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer utility to fame.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of proving that ſuperſtition is the ſupport of deſpotiſm, if he write to people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an arbitrary government, he will prove that it is the enemy of kings; and of theſe two truths he will purpoſely dwell upon that which may aid the cauſe of humanity; and not on that by which it may be injured; becauſe lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be miſunderſtood.</p>

what freedom is, he will enumerate to them and their governors the various oppreſſions which are common to them all, and which it is as well the intereſt of thoſe who command as thoſe who obey to root out. To ſimplify and humanize the laws, to counteract the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſubordinate tyranny, to break off the ſhackles with which falſe policy may have encumbered the induſtry and liberty of trade, in order that freedom may be the only happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wanting to mankind, and that nations worthy of freedom may be preſented to her, ſuch will be his efforts, ſuch his theme.</p>
                  <p>Such is the reſult of the philoſophy of Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, and ſuch the ſpirit which pervades his works.</p>
                  <p>Let men, who, if he had not written, would ſtill have been the ſlaves of prejudice, or would have trembled to confeſs they had ſhaken off its yoke, accuſe Voltaire of having betrayed the intereſts of freedom, becauſe he defended it without fanaticiſm and imprudence; let them judge him by thoſe enlightened principles which were ten years poſterior to his death and half a century to his philoſophy, and which, but for him, had ever remained the ſecret opinions of ſages; let them condemn him for having diſtinguiſhed between the good, which may exiſt without liberty, and the happineſs to which liberty only gives birth; let them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to perceive that had Voltaire infuſed into his firſt writings the principles of freedom of

the elder Brutus, or in other words of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican independence, neither Monteſquieu nor Rouſſeau would have written as they have done; that if, like the author of the Syſtême de la Nature, he had invited the kings of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope to ſupport the power of the prieſts<note n="*" place="bottom">The tranſlator ſpeaks from memory, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves himself juſtified in ſaying that this accuſation of the author of the Syſtême de la Nature is falſe, whoſe doctrine, if he does not groſsly miſtake, was, that the deſpotic power of the kings and prieſts was founded in reciprocal ſupport, and that deſpotiſm of every kind was equally hateful and deſtructive.</note>, Europe would ſtill have been ſuperſtitious, and would long have remained in bondages; and let them forget that in books, as in beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, we ought to diſplay the courage only which the occaſion requires; their injuſtice will but little injure the glory of Voltaire. Men of genius muſt be his judges, men who can diſcover, in a ſucceſſion of various works, as well from their form and ſtyle as from their principles, the ſecret plan of a philoſopher, who in waging continual but bold and artful war on prejudice; rather intent on conqueſt than renown; too great to be vain of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and too much the friend of the human race not to make their utility the grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his purſuits.</p>
                  <p>Voltaire has been accuſed of partiality to monarchical government, but this accuſation only can impoſe on ſuch as have not read his
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:024210_0212_0FC5697996BA8EC8"/>
works. It is true he hated, beyond even mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical power, ariſtocratic deſpotiſm, which unites rigour to hypocriſy and tyranny more auſtere to morals more perverſe; nor was he ever the dupe of the parliaments of France, or the nobles of Sweden and Poland, who give the name of freedom to the chains with which they would load their vaſſals. In this opinion, Voltaire has been joined by all philoſophers who have ſought the definition of a free ſtate in the nature and mind of man, and not, like the pedant Mably, in examples, drawn from the tyrannical anarchies of Italy and Greece.</p>
                  <p>He has been blamed for having beſtowed too much praiſe on the pomp of the court of Louis XIV. and accuſation was in this inſtance well founded; it was the only prejudice of his youth which he never ſhook off, and there are few men who can hope they have vanquiſhed all their errors. It has been aſſerted, that he ſuppoſed celebrated artiſts, orators, and poets, were all that were neceſſary to render a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happy, but never could he entertain ſuch a thought. He ſuppoſed indeed, that arts and literature poliſhed the manners of men, and made the road of reaſon ſmooth and ſafe, and that the love of them rendered thoſe who governed beneficent of heart, often prevented them from committing acts of violence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and that, under equal circumſtances, the moſt ingenious and poliſhed people would always be the leaſt wretched.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="unknown:024210_0213_0FC5697D313EDF60"/>His pious enemies have taxed him with hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſaulted, by wilful miſquotation, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of his country, and extending incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity even to atheiſm; both of which charges are equally falſe. Among a multitude of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, founded on proofs and on paſſages cited from books, ſuppoſed to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by God himſelf, a very ſmall number of errors only can be diſcovered; and thoſe cannot be imputed to him as wilful miſtakes, becauſe, comparing them to the numerous accurate quotations and facts related with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, it is evident that nothing could have been of leſs uſe to his cauſe. When contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his adverſaries, his maxim continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was, nothing ought to be credited which is not proved, and every thing ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected which is offenſive to reaſon and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and the anſwer he has continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived was, whatever cannot be demonſtrated an impoſſibility ought to be adopted and adored.</p>
                  <p>He conſtantly appeared to be perſuaded of the exiſtance of a Supreme Being, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remaining blind to the ſtrength of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections oppoſed to that opinion. While he thought he beheld the regular order of nature, he could not but perceive thoſe ſtriking irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities which he was unable to explain.</p>
                  <p>This was his perſuaſion, though it was far from that abſolute certainty in the preſence of which all difficulties vaniſh: the work en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled,

                  <p>He believed as much of free will as a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man can believe; that is, he believed man has the power to reſiſt inclination, and to weigh the motives of action.</p>
                  <p>His incertitude reſpecting ſpirit was almoſt abſolute, and even concerning the exiſtence of the ſoul after the deceaſe of the body; but as he imagined this opinion, as well as that of the exiſtance of a God, was beneficial, he rarely allowed himſelf to mention his doubts, and generally dwelt rather on the proofs than on the objections.</p>
                  <p>Such was the philoſophy of Voltaire; and we, perhaps, ſhall find, while we read his life, that he has been more admired than known; that though gaul abounds in ſome few of his polemical writings, his predominant ſenſation was active benevolence; that his affection for the unfortunate exceeded his hatred of his enemies; and that the paſſion of fame in him was ever ſubordinate to the more noble love of humanity. Superior to the oſtentation of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or to the concealment of his foibles, which he would ſometimes candidly confeſs, though not proudly proclaim, few men ever exiſted whoſe lives have been more honoured by acts

of great worth or leſs ſullied by hypocriſy. In fine, let it be remembered that when, on the pinnacle of fame, after having rendered the French ſtage illuſtrious by his genius, and while throughout Europe he exerciſed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of power over the minds of men hitherto unparalleled, the following pathetic line,

was the unaffected expreſſion of that habitual benevolence, which had taken poſſeſſion of his ſoul.</p>

                  <p>WE have here ſubjoined ſeveral Letters, which will better ſerve to diſplay the character of M. de Voltaire, and that of hit enemies.</p>
                  <p>A tribute of admiration paid, by a prince of the blood, to a young man whoſe rank in life placed him at a diſtance from that perſonage, and whoſe ſame had not then leſſened the diſtance between them, has appeared to us to merit preſervation.</p>
                  <p>The Note ſent by the celebrated Le Kain cannot fail to intereſt men of letters; in it, that great actor ingenuouſly paints Voltaire's enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm for the dramatic art, and for the talent of acting; and, at the ſame time, the zeal with which he endeavoured, notwithſtanding his love of the art, and his deſire to find actors worthy of his pieces, to diſſuade that young man from the purſuit of a profeſſion too much degraded by prejudice, while he added to his advice the means of entering into ſome other ſituation. This anecdote is one of thoſe which prove that benevolence was the ruling paſſion of Voltaire's ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Thus, with ſtill greater intereſtedneſs, he prevailed on Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle Clairon, in 1765, to renounce the ſtage; although the powers of this ſublime actreſs were in all their vigour, and became daily more neceſſary to the poet, whoſe dramatic genius began to decline by age and intenſe application.</p>
                  <p>His counſels to D'Alembert and Diderot, when they were perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for publiſhing the Encyclopedia, and many circumſtances of the ſame nature, will further prove that the love of juſtice roſe, in his mind, ſuperior to every other conſideration.</p>

                     <l>PLUTON<note n="†" place="bottom">Pluto having choſen a youthful virgin, being deſirous to afford the beauty a proof of his love, gave commands that a magnificent and gallant feſtival ſhould diſſipate the horrors of his gloomy abode. For this purpoſe, he invited to his court all thoſe whoſe good taſte and delicacy could contribute to the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ſpectacle, which he was preparing for his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. From among theſe ſo famous men he ſelected all whoſe genius had been any where ſignaliſed in the ſublime art of poetry. Each did his beſt to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Corneille and Racine united their talents di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine to bear away the prize; each in vain contended, and wiſhed to gain the ſuffrage of the God, who had iſſued his commands; for though victorious over all competitors no one yet knew which of them might claim precedence. The day at length arrived, when the whole aſſembly of wits hoped to obtain the high renown which public applauſe had to beſtow While all were thus buſied in contention, Racine and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille ſat tranquilly in the Elyſian groves, recalling to mind the hiſtory of times paſt, when they were the living ornaments of France. From ghoſts newly arrived they had heard of the fatal decay of poetry, in France; and that the auditors of Melpomene, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to pleaſe, had, ſince their deceaſe, found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of the ſtage. Their grief at this intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence was extreme; they knew how much their countrymen were delighted with the pleaſures the theatre can beſtow; and that, forſaken by the muſe poets no longer poſſeſſed thoſe noble flights which ſo much grace the ſcene. Since their deſcent to theſe abodes, they had become acquainted with a ſpirit, inexperienced, but whoſe active and graceful wit sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the moſt aged in genius and in ſcience. To repair the wrongs of the ſuffering ſtage, they choſe this ſpirit, prevailed on him to aſſume a human form, and, having inſtructed him perfectly in their art, ſent him to the banks of the Seine, where he took the name of Arouet. Having drunken of the waters of Aganippe, the firſt ſubject he choſe was Oedipus; and, old though the ſable was, its new and youthful beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ſo numerous that it was imagined Racine had returned from the ſhades, or that Corneille had corrected the defects of his verſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe lines do as much honour to the Prince of Conti as the approbation of Oedipus did to la Motte. The prince and la Motte mutually announced a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſucceſſor of Corneille and Racine; and never was prophecy more fully accompliſhed.</note>.</note> ayant fait choix d'une jeune pucelle,</l>

                     <p>I SHALL never forget, ſir, the infinite obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations I owe to you. The goodneſs of your heart is ſuperior even to your underſtanding; and you are the trueſt of friends. The zeal with which you have ſerved me does me, indeed, more honour, than malice and baſeneſs of my enemies does me injuſtice, by the unworthy treatment which they have brought upon me. It is neceſſary that I ſhould not publicly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for ſome time. Fallax infamia terret.</p>
                     <p>I have received a letter de cachet which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles me to the diſtance of thirty leagues from Paris. I depart with pleaſure in ſearch of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; but I am much mortified that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat ſhould be enjoined me. It is ſome degree of triumph for the wretched authors of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. I am exceedingly willing to go into the country; but endeavour, ſir, to procure the king's order to be ſuperceded by another letter de cachet, in this form:</p>
                     <p>The King, informed of the falſehood of the accuſation brought againſt the Sieur Abbé Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fotaines, conſents that he ſhould remain at Paris.</p>
                     <p>Should you obtain this order from M. de Maurepas, it would be an eſſential point;
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:024210_0223_0FC5699146D148F8"/>
and I promiſe M. de Maurepas, on my honour, to depart immediately, and not to return to Paris, till I ſhall have demanded ſecret permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him.</p>
                     <p>This, my dear friend, is what, at preſent, I have to beg you to obtain for me. You will confer yet another infinite obligation on me, by this new ſervice. It is, in my mind, the ſimpleſt means that can be taken to repair the ſcandal and injuſtice which I have endured, till I can do better, and can procure the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary information to diſcover the hidden ſprings of the horrible intrigue of my enemies. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the atrocious nature of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and the readineſs of the public to believe the accuſed guilty, I have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing thoſe who are even unknown to me take my part. Such men as Nadal, Danchet, de Pons, and Fréret, are the only perſons, I am told, who treat my name as, through my life, I ſhall treat their infamous work and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy characters. Genus irritabile vatum.</p>
                     <p>I have formed a plan for my defence, which will be excellent and curious, and I ſhall finiſh it in the country. I am too publicly known to remain ſilent after ſuch an execrable inſult, and I ſhall compoſe my apology in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that I ſhall have the honour of preſenting it to M. de Maurepas, and ſhall beſeech him to permit its publication. In this, will be ſeen all the misfortunes which have be fallen me, and theſe misfortunes ever cauſed by men of
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:024210_0224_0FC56992D069FB08"/>
letters; but it will particularly contain the hiſtory of my quitting the Jeſuits.</p>
                     <p>Adieu, my dear friend; let me beg of you to think of me.</p>

                     <p>WE thank you moſt humbly for all your goodneſs, and for the indulgence you have granted to enable us to repay you. We ſhall ever preſerve a faithful remembrance of it, and, on every occaſion, ſhall expreſs our live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gratitude. Your ſecurity is perfectly good; and we beg you to be perſuaded we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the debt as ſpeedily as we poſſibly can. I am in advance for ſeveral good ſpeculations; and our zeal to ſerve others has added to our embarraſſment.</p>
                     <p>You do me juſtice, ſir, in believing me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any ill deſign; I venture even to declare to you that I never have entertained any, and that never had a lover a more tender attachment to his miſtreſs than I to you, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that has happened. I have inconſiderate moments, it is true; you have

often reproved me for them, with reaſon; but I will yield to no one in integrity of mind, purity of intentions, or zealous activity, when there ariſes an opportunity of doing good.</p>
                     <p>I know that I have been greatly calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and I know alſo that thoſe who exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt againſt me, quitted you to come to me with a deſign of exaſperating my mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you. Since that time, I have rendered ſome conſiderable ſervices to one of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and ſhould occaſions preſent themſelves of obliging the others, I ſhall willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them. It is the only vengeance which I profeſs to take.</p>
                     <p>If you think I can be uſeful to you in any way, and indeed in affairs that may require diſcretion, honour me with your commands; and I beſeech you to be aſſured of an active and ſecret ſervice.</p>

me; for you have the generoſity to pardon the fault I have committed in liſtening to bad counſel. I aſſure you I repented even in the moment in which I was ſo unhappy as to act againſt you. I, at length, perfectly perceive how I was led into the error. The jealouſy of men of letters is not unknown to you, and, in this, you ſee to what exceſs it has been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. They have inflamed my mind, and have made me the means of injuring you; which has ſo diſpleaſed me that I promiſe you never again to ſee thoſe who induced me to forget my duty to you in this inſtance, and I will atone for the extreme injuſtice of it, by the conſtant attachment which I vow to preſerve through life to your intereſts.</p>
                        <p>I beſeech you, ſir, to reſtore your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to me, and believe that my heart never took any part in the malice of your enemies, and that it is my heart alone which leads me to make this declaration.</p>

I told you of my remorſe and the horror which I felt at my cruel attack of him who was my benefactor; I informed you that I had diſcovered the error into which I had been led; and I begged you, ſir, to believe that my affliction is equal to my fault. Deign, ſir, to extend your generoſity to the granting me the pardon I venture to demand. I retract the unjuſt and calumnious factum which was made in my name, and which I had the unhappineſs to ſign. I was blind, and your enemies ſeduced me. Again, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat to you that I am in the deepeſt affliction, and my remorſe has brought ſickneſs upon me. There is nothing I would not do, during the remainder of my life, to atone for my fault. In ſhort, ſir, were you a witneſs to the diſtreſs I feel at being deceived by ill counſel, you would pity my condition.

                        <p>THE penſion you have the goodneſs to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, and ſome ſcholars whom I aſſiſted in perfecting themſelves in the French language, but who, unfortunately for me, are quitting this city to travel, have enabled me to ſubſiſt at Milan. Great God! in what a ſituation ſhall I be placed, deprived of theſe ſuccours! I have been formerly uſeful to you in being your amanuenſis; can I no longer be of any ſervice to you? If Milan were a place in which works were publiſhed in French, I could em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy myſelf in correcting the preſs, and thus avoid the wretchedneſs which threatens me, and from which you, ſir, can relieve me, by giving me an aſylum in your houſe, where I am perſuaded you muſt have ſome-one who is leſs uſeful to you than I might be.</p>

                        <p>When M. de Cideville procured me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being known to you, he, as well as myſelf regarded that honour as the means of

                        <p>ON my return from the iles of Bormio, where his excellency Count Frederic was ſo good as to keep me three weeks for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the air, and to reinſtate my health after the ſickneſs I have had, Meſſieurs Origoni and Parraviccini remitted me from Florence, by your order, five and twenty ſequins, for which I have given them a receipt in the name of Meſſieurs Francis and Louis Bontemps of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</p>

Although your generoſity extended the order to remit me what I ſhould have occaſion for without limiting the ſum, I thought it my duty not to abuſe your kindneſs; and without delay I employed the twenty five ſequins in the purchaſe of ſome clothes which fortunately fitted me, and in four ſhirts which I have ordered to be made; and theſe will at leaſt place me in a condition to appear decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the houſes of ſuch people of rank as have the goodneſs to admit me. In theſe families I have ſpoken of your goodneſs, and I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for having requeſted no more than this ſum, although your liberality had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted me.</p>
                        <p>With what tranquility ſhall I paſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my life, ſhould I have the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſurvive you, were you to ſettle on me the means of ſupporting the diſtreſſing ſituation of my affairs, a ſituation which I have ſo little merited. I venture, ſir, to hope this from your goodneſs. I ſhall then have nothing further to deſire than an opportunity of expreſſing the greatneſs of my gratitude to you. I look for that happy day with impatience; and beg you to be perſuaded of the reſpectful attachment with which I have the honour to be,</p>

                        <p>STRONGLY penetrated with gratitude and tranſported with joy, I thank you for your conſoling promiſe of extricating me from my diſtreſs, and for the eight Louis d'ors which you ſent me. They could not have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived more fortunately to relieve me from the greateſt embarraſſment. Fearing I ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, I forbear to ſay all that paſſes in my mind.

                     <p>I RETURN you, ſir, the manuſcript which you did me the honour to confide to me. You

will probably imagine that I have read it with pleaſure, and you are not miſtaken; but ſhould you conclude that I felt myſelf ſatisfied when I had finiſhed, you will be deceived. Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what I have already ſeen, I have but the more ſenſibly felt the abſence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder; and to the pleaſure of peruſing the work has ſucceeded conſiderable anger againſt the author.</p>
                     <p>Your indifference, ſir, or to ſpeak more frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, your indolence, muſt make all thoſe who know of what you are capable, as angry as myſelf. If you are ſo indifferent to ſame as to contemn the reputation which muſt reſult from the perfection of this work, the juſtice the public have done you with reſpect to what you have already imparted to them, calls on you to give them the remainder, which they expect with impatience. No one has aſcended with more truth, or more penetration to the fountain head, nor has any one treated this ſubject with greater delicacy and preciſion. I ſhall excite all your friends to importune you have made the work complete. At the head of theſe I ſhall place the Counteſs, to whoſe lips the Graces have imparted a gift of perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; after which it will be ſeen whether we ſhall leave you indolent, and at your eaſe, for ſome time to come.</p>
                     <p>You did me juſtice, ſir, when you aſſerted that I had no connexion with the author of the Voltairomanic, whoever he may be; and I
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:024210_0235_0FC569B2B10CC728"/>
further now declare to you that I have never read the piece entirely through. I merely glanced over it, becauſe I was informed the author had cited are relative to M. de Voltaire; a circumſtance which I could not hear without indignation. I would gladly know by what authority M. de Voltaire's name and mine are brought in queſtion, ſince neither the one nor the other are to be found in the work of mine which is quoted by them. They go further: would you ſuppoſe it, ſir? They have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted what I meant to ſay. The deification, of which they ſpeak, is merely a work of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, a chain of fictions, the links of which are connexed to form a whole. The deſign in this was to point out in general the defects into which the learned fall, in various ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and various nations. The author has, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this work, been obliged to imagine circumſtances, which, although related as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtically perſonal, ſhould be regarded merely as general ſatire, applicable to all the learned who may be guilty of ſimilar errors. It is not poſſible to write an allegory, or draw a character, which the imagination of the reader cannot apply to ſome one; whom perhaps the author has not even known. Thus, he who, in a work of invention, ſhall have had only a general object, ſhall be made to allude to an individual, by the malignity of falſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. If this be permitted, we muſt no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er think of writing; at leaſt till the publick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming

more reſerved, judge of the intention of the author in conformity with the general deſign of his work; and till they forbear to cauſe the malignity of interpretation to recoil upon the writer whom they interpret.</p>
                     <p>When I ſaw in what manner the writer of the Voltairomaine had decided on my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I own to you, ſir, that I was extremely ſurpriſed how he, who is ſaid to be the author of it, can be thus totally unmindful of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum. My ſurpriſe equalled my indignation and his temerity, not to uſe a harſher term. It is true that from the nature of the work, there is nothing which we might not be led to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
                     <p>I am informed that M. de Voltaire ſo much deſpiſed this book as not to aſwer it. He did perfectly right. Abortion is the deſtiny of ſuch writings; which can only exiſt by being the ſubject of converſation. M. de Voltaire has more valuable employment. Cultivating at preſent the Muſas ſeveriores, they have taught him to riſe into thoſe tranquil regions to which the vapours of the earth do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: Sapientum templa ſerena.</p>

                     <p>THIS Abbé Desfontains is a vile man, ſir; his ingratitude certainly ſurpaſſes the crimes by which he gave you an opportunity of obliging

him. Fear not but that the people in power will be your partizans. I one day happened, at the table of the cardinal, to affirm that he was the rector of a good living in Normandy, by which I offended all preſent. His eminence made me repeat three times what I had ſaid, and I ſhould have loſt the eſteem of the world, and have ruined my fortune, had not the Pré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vôt des Marchands bore witneſs to the fact. The chancellor thinks as I do relative to this *** of the police; and M. Herault ought to be of the ſame opinion, or he will render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf accountable to thoſe whom he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. The chancellor thinks well of your works, which he has often mentioned to me during our walks at Freſne. But of all your knights, my brother is moſt angry with your enemy. I went to him after the receipt of your letter, and he told me that, in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the chancellor's orders, the Abbé Desfon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains would be ſummoned to declare, whether the libels in queſtion were written by him; and, if not freely, would be obliged to ſign the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative or the negative. Be aſſured the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs will be properly conducted. I will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolicit the chancellor in perſon.</p>
                     <p>I embrace your cauſe with adour and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which is but juſt. I have continually known you the enemy of ſcandal; you are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with knaves, and laugh at fools. I mean to imitate your example to the beſt of my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and yet I think myſelf an honeſt man.

This is no more than having an opinion; to impart ſuch an opinion to our friends is detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which religion, good ſenſe, and even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct forbid.

Continue to write without fear for five and twenty years longer; but write poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, notwithſtanding your oath in the preface to Newton.

and was informed that you were at court. You would, without doubt, have been ſurpriſed at my viſit, but the motive by which it was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned would have ſurpriſed you ſtill more. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I aſſumed courage from the reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions which naturally ariſe in a mind of the firſt order, and I ſaid to myſelf: It is true that, ſince the year 1725, I have ſcarce ever had the honour of ſeeing M. de Voltaire, but he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that he walks in a ſphere which does not permit every one to approach him; and he cannot be ignorant of the admiration of him which I have ever avowed, nor can he doubt the avowal without doing injuſtice to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. No one at preſent has it more in his power to render him juſtice than myſelf, from the opportunity which I had during a year of obſerving him in thoſe ſocieties in which the mind and the heart may diſcover their true feelings without danger; and thence I have formed an opinion of him, which perſuades me that it is a pleaſure to him to confer obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſentiments, ſir, led me to your houſe to beg the favour of you to lend me ten piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toles, for which I have an immediate occaſion; and to offer you, for payment, an authority to receive the ſum from the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to a magiſtrate who is his friend, and who is diſtinguiſhed by his virtue and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. I have long wiſhed to bring my buſineſs into repute by the works of a man whom I then knew only by the powers of his mind, and who has ſince ſo ſtrongly attached me to him by the qualities of his heart. My youth, my good diſpoſition, and my ſincerity, titles to his favour which are ever ſucceſsful, completed that recommendation had commenced. Since that time, his confidence has rendered me the inſtrument of ſo many acts of generoſity, that, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The following is the hiſtory of M. de Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire's works ſince I knew him, and which I am enable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I began by printing the Henriade with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable corrections, the profits of which M. de Voltaire preſented to a young man whoſe talents had made him his friend; and to whom he alſo gave his tragedy of the Death of Ceſar. At the ſame time he gave the liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing Za<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Prodigal Son; the perſon who was charged to treat with me for it demanded ſo reaſonable a price, that, far from having any diſagreement. I gave him a hundred fran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s more than the price he had demanded. Some days after M. de Voltaire informed me in a letter that he never required money for his productions<note n="*" place="bottom">That is to ſay, for himſelf.</note>, but books only. In fine, he made a preſent of his Element of Newton to his Dutch bookſellers. Shortly after an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was printed which was called the London edition, and I knew that the bookſeller, who began it unknown to Voltaire, thought, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, that it was an attention due to M. de Voltaire to communicate the deſign to him and to ſubmit it to his corrections before it was publiſhed. The edition being ready to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, M. de Voltaire bought a hundred and fifty copies to preſent to his friends at Paris, which coſt him, including the binding, nearly a hundred piſtoles.</p>
                     <p>This, madam, is the account of the profit which M. de Voltaire has drawn from his works; or rather it is the means of confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his calumniator; and you will perceive what credit ought to be given to the impoſtures of which his works is an entire tiſſue.</p>

                     <p>YOU muſt no longer write to M. de Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire at Cirey, my ſon; he is lately gone to Bruſſels with the Marquis and Marchioneſs du Chatelet. You will eaſily conceive how much we are afflicted at his abſence; never was there

a more tender or more reſpectable friend. We feelingly regret the four years which he paſſed in Champaign. Thoſe happy days, during which we lived with him, cannot but recal to your memory the numerous marks of friendſhip he beſtowed on us; which were ſo effectual that, had I the power, I could not do more even for you who are my ſon. How great then ought your gratitude toward him be? He was under no obligation of affording you ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular marks of attachment, and I hope you will never forget the exceſs of his kindneſs. It is not enough that you ſhould partake of the favours he has done us; it is neceſſary that you ſhould even ſurpaſs us in gratitude. Love him like your father; every feeling of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is due from you to him; and will give me ſtill greater ſatisfaction than the ſame affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion felt for me.</p>
                     <p>The regret of your mother equals mine; you know our friendſhip for him, and we both lament the loſs of thoſe proofs of conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial tenderneſs, which he was ſo ready to return.</p>
                     <p>The Count and Counteſs de la Neuville, concerning whom you make enquiry, like us, infinitely regret the loſs of M. de Voltaire. He departed beloved by the whole country, and we all bewail his abſence. The Marquis and Marchioneſs du Chatelet give us to hope that they will return to Cirey as ſoon as they ſhall have completed their buſineſs.</p>

                     <p>I AM extremely deſirous, ſir, of becoming ſome way uſeful to you; this is an old ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I have often expreſſed in my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, which I have communicated to M. Thiriot on more than one occaſion, and which I feel very forcibly renewed ſince the affair of Prault. I cannot endure that a multitude of inſignificant people, embittering their minds againſt ſuch a character, ſhould, ſome of them from pure malignity, others from a falſe air of probity and juſtice, exert themſelves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the poiſon of their heart to more worthy people.</p>
                     <p>It has occurred to me that the public taſte, which has been hitherto ſufficiently uniform in its partiality to my writings, would render me more likely than any other man to do you ſome ſervice. My admiration of your talents, and the particular attachment I profeſs to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:024210_0247_0FC569D368DEC4C0"/>
would alone urge me to this object with much zeal: but my own intereſt is connected with my wiſhes, and if I may in ſome meaſure add to your reputation you may at the ſame time be ſerviceable to my fortune.</p>
                     <p>Here follow two points, ſir, which demand a little explanation; but it ſhall be ſhort; for I have only to lay the propoſition before you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt I have thought that A defence of M. de Voltaire and his works, written with care, energy, and ſimplicity, &amp;c. might be a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work, and might perhaps once for all ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence malignity. I ſhould divide it into two parts; one of which would reſpect his perſon, and the other his productions. Thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which the habit of writing may have added to ſuch abilities as I poſſeſs I will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy. The work ſhould be publiſhed before the end of winter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. The derangement of my affairs is ſuch that if Heaven or ſome one inſpired by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, does not enable me to ſettle them, I ſhall ſoon depart for England. I ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of my ſituation, had it originated in my ill conduct; but, though I have been five years in France, with as many friends as there are worthy people in Paris, and with the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a prince of the blood<note n="*" place="bottom">The Prince de Conti.</note> who entertains me in his own houſe, I am yet without a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:024210_0248_0FC569D51C873130"/>
of five ſons. I owe about a hundred and fifty louis d'ors; for which my creditors, uniting together, have made me give my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſecurity; and ſo urgent is my neceſſity, that, having agreed to diſcharge my debts at a time which expires on the firſt of the enſuing month, I am threatened with an arreſt if I am not punctual. Of a thouſand opulent perſons with whom I paſs my life, I know not one of whom I can venture to demand this ſum, or who I think would advance it for me.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion is, would M. de Voltaire, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged by his generoſity and by his zeal for men of letters, partly by my deſign to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy myſelf in his ſervice, be willing to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from the moſt cruel embarraſſment which I have ever experienced?

                        </gap>im; beſide that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty alone of ſettling the affairs of a man to whom the protection of a prince of the blood, and I may add the friendſhip of all Paris, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, appears to me a ſingular induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>I have two ways of repaying the obligation. The firſt, by a grateful ſenſe of the favour; and I ſhall be reduced to that if death ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes me, for I do not poſſeſs a revenue of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſon<note n="*" place="bottom">One Penny.</note>; but I am not advanced in years, and I enjoy a ſtate of health which promiſes me long life.

on my books; that would be ſufficient for my creditors if they would liſten to reaſon, but my upholſterers and taylors, who have waited ſome time for their debts, did not think the ſecurity ſufficient. A man of letters will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtand the value of this fund.</p>
                     <p>I conclude, ſir; for indeed here is a very extraordinary letter. I flatter myſelf that, as I ſhall find much pleaſure in boaſting of your kindneſs ſhould you grant me the favour, you will alſo be careful to bury my requeſt in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion if any reaſon, which I ſhall feel no wiſh to diſcover, ſhould prevent you giving it the reception which I hope.

                     <head>REPORT, Made to the Academy of Sciences by Meſſrs. Pitot and Clairaut, April 26, 1741, relative to the memorial of M. de Voltaire, concerning Living Force.</head>
                     <p>WE have examined by order of the aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy, the memorial of M. de Voltaire, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, Doubts on the meaſure and the nature of
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:024210_0250_0FC569DB05FFB888"/>
moving Forces. The memorial contains two parts. The firſt part is an abridged recital of the principal reaſons which have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, to prove that the forces of bodies in motion are as the quantities of motion, that is, as the maſs multiplied by the ſimple velocity, and not by the ſquare of the velocity; as thoſe pretend who adopt the theory of Vis viva, or living force. The reaſons ſtated by M. de Voltaire are not given as demonſtrations, but propoſed as doubts: they, however, are the doubts of a well informed man, and greatly reſemble deciſion.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall not enter into the examination of this firſt part, becauſe the intention of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſeems only to have been to recite the ſtrongeſt reaſons which have been given againſt living forces, in a manner ſufficiently brief and clear, ſo as to be recollected by the read<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er with facility.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond part, M de Voltaire conſiders the nature of force. As he has concluded that moving force is only the produce of the maſs multiplied by the velocity, he admits of no diſtinction between the vis mortua, or dead force, and the vis viva, or living force. When it is ſaid that the force of a body in motion differs infinitely from that of a body at reſt, this, according to him, is equal to ſaying that liquid is infinitely more liquid when it runs than when it does not.</p>
                     <p>He next ſtates that, if force be nothing
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:024210_0251_0FC569DC369BBC80"/>
more than the produce of the maſs multiplied by the velocity, it is nothing more than the body itſelf acting, or ready to act. Thus he rejects the opinion of the philoſphers, who have imagined that force was a diſtinct being, a ſubſtance animating and ſeparate from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; that force ought to be ſought for in the ſimple beings called monades, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>M. de Voltaire having remarked, as many other perſons have previouſly done, that in various caſes the quantity of motion augments, and remaining convinced that force is merely the quantity of motion, he aſks whether thoſe philoſophers who have maintained the ſyſtem of the preſervation of an equal quantity of force, in nature, are not as far from the truth as thoſe who ſhould maintain the preſervation of an equal quantity of ſpecies, individuals, forms, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He next aſks, by referring to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that an elaſtic body ſtriking on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more large, does then communicate a greater quantity of motion, and conſequently according to him more force than it previouſly poſſeſſed, whether it be not evidently deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that bodies do not communicate force; ſo that, the maſs and the motion being inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the communication of motion, the vis inertia would be likewiſe neceſſary, without which matter would make no reſiſtance, and there would be no action.</p>
                     <p>M. de Voltaire further ſuppoſes, that the vis inertia, the maſs, and the motion, are not
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:024210_0252_0FC569E0622B5C38"/>
ſufficient. He thinks there muſt be a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which keeps all bodies in motion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly communicates to them an acting force, or a force ready to act; which principle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, ſhould be gravity; whether gravity have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r have not a mechanical cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Neither ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> gravity, continues he, account for all the effects of nature. It is very far from explaining the force of organized bodies, which muſt have an internal principle, like that of elaſticity.</p>
                     <p>M. de Voltaire concludes his memorial by ſaying, that ſince the active force of elaſticity produces the ſame effects as force of any other kind, it may be concluded that nature, which often attains different ends by the ſame means; may alſo attain one end by various means; and that therefore true philoſophy conſiſts in recording the operations of nature, previous to ſubjecting the whole to any general law.</p>
                     <p>Of the various queſtions, difficult to reſolve, which the two parts of this memorial contain, it appears that M. de Voltaire is well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what relates to experimental philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and that he has himſelf well conſidered ſuch ſubjects.</p>

                     <p>IT is, ſir, a long while ſince you heard from me; and it is very mortifying that I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to call your attention to me by a hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my misfortunes. Yet I too well know the ſentiments of your heart to yield to my fears. My father is ſtill living; he is eighty years old, and is extremely feeble. At his death I ſhall poſſeſs more than a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand francs; but I have not received a crown. My profeſſion abounds with difficulties; and, to purſue it, aſſiſtance is required, on which I have relied, and which has failed me. I have been afflicted with long and ſevere ſickneſs, and though at length I regained my health, my practice had declined. I afterwards formed an acquaintance with a rich devotee; and, having incurred much expence in dreſs to enable me to appear ſuitably at her table, ſhe barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbade me the houſe. At laſt, ſir, the poor M. de Fimarçon applied to me for aſſiſtance and counſel, and as I thought his affairs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing I dedicated my whole time and labour to the proſecution of his ſuit. My illneſs had deprived me of half my buſineſs, and I loſt the
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:024210_0254_0FC569E6075BED28"/>
remainder by giving my whole time to M. de Firmarçon.</p>
                     <p>I flatter myſelf that I ſhould acquire honour by extricating him from that affair, and that his gratitude would ſufficiently indemnify me. Every thing has been unſucceſsful, ſir. Mean while I was three months in ſearch of a houſe; on the twenty-third of December I hired one, and ſince that time the workmen have been employed in preparing it for my reception; ſo that ſix months have paſſed in which I have been without a houſe, without chambers, and conſequently without employment.</p>
                     <p>Judge, ſir, of my ſituation. I could not procure a crown from my father. He who has been inflexible during his whole life, does not become feeling at the age of eighty. M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun, the old receiver-general, of whom I have hired my houſe in the Iſle<note n="*" place="bottom">A part of Paris.</note>, has made me wait, but he has expended four thouſand francs to make the houſe commodious for me, which will be to my advantage. I have ſome furniture which, were they on the ſpot, would ſerve my purpoſe. I have not therefore, ſir, any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion for more money than will enable me to remove my furniture to the place which of courſe is an object of importance, to pay ſome trifling debts which I have contracted in the courſe of ſix months, and to leave me a ſmall ſum with which I may open my chambers,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:024210_0255_0FC569E9E66F7270"/>
and ſubſiſt till I ſhall fall into practice, which I cannot fail to do.</p>
                     <p>I have frequently heard, ſir, that the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate are permitted to boaſt a little. Claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this privilege, to which my ſituation has given me too clear a title, I may declare that I do not fear any advocate who is at preſent at the bar. If I find aſſiſtance I ſhall ſoon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my loſſes, and my chambers will have their uſe; in the courſe of a year my practice will probably be conſiderable; and my father muſt, in the end, leave me the property which he cannot carry away with him. But ſhould I not procure any aid, my houſe will become uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; I ſhall be no longer able to appear at the courts; and I ſhall be inevitably ruined; for I have no talents for any other employment. I will give you all the ſecurity in my power; my wife and I will engage jointly and ſeparately for the debt; or I will even give bills of exchange for it, provided ſufficient time is granted me for the payment.</p>
                     <p>Will you abandon me, ſir, and forget your long friendſhip for me? I am one of your oldeſt partiſans; and the defender of Oedipus ought not to periſh for want in the midſt of the faireſt hopes; nor does he aſk for more than a little aſſiſtance. You will have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of patroniſing an advocate; and, if he become celebrated, the work will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of you! Though you have hitherto done ſo much and in various ways, this may
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:024210_0256_0FC569EB38B10020"/>
perhaps be wanting to your fame. My whole reliance is on you, ſir; for the times are fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſince nobody is intereſted in behalf of talents. You alone know all who poſſeſs them; and you are their protector; and, ſhould you think that I am among the number you will not ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſake me. My fortune then depends on the judgment which you ſhall entertain of my capacity, and I expect your deciſion with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. I lodge with M. Dubois, at the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais Royal, Rue de la Comédie Françaiſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you enable me to remove to my houſe, I ſhall look for the honour of your anſwer. I am, with the profoundeſt reſpect,</p>

                     <p>I HAVE endeavoured during fifteen years to render myſelf worthy of your eſteem and your zeal for the intereſt of youthful poets in whom you diſcover talents. But having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the muſic of an opera, I find myſelf, I know not how, metamorphoſed into a muſician. In this quality the Duke de Richelieu commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my care the alteration of the Divertiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which you have introduced into the Princeſs of Navarre, and he even required me to make ſuch changes in the original plan as were neceſſary to adapt it to your new ſubject. I made reſpectful remonſtrances, the duke inſiſted, and I obeyed; it is the only thing which can be done by a man in my ſituation. M. Ballot is charged to communicate the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations to you; which I have endeavoured to execute in the feweſt words poſſible, and that is the only merit I can give them. Do me the favour, ſir, to examine them, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſubſtitute others more worthy of the place which they were deſigned to occupy.</p>
                     <p>I alſo hope, ſir, that you will pleaſe to give

                     <p>ONE Rouſſeau<note n="*" place="bottom">Jean Baptiſte. We do not know the other Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau; it was not the Rouſſeau of Thoulouſe, author of the Journal Encyclopédique, nor the Rouſſeau of Gotha.</note> formerly declared himſelf your enemy leaſt he ſhould be compelled to acknowledge himſelf your inferior. Another Rouſſeau, without the genius of the former, thought proper to imitate his malicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. I am diſtinguiſhed by the ſame name as
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:024210_0260_0FC569F5F5070AF0"/>
thoſe, but poſſeſs neither the talents of the one nor the preſumption of the other, and am ſtill leſs capable of their injuſtice to you. I am very willing to live unknown but not diſhonoured; and ſuch I ſhould deem myſelf had I failed in the reſpect which all men of letters owe to you, and which all thoſe entertain who merit reſpect themſelves.</p>
                     <p>I will not dwell on this ſubject, nor violate, even when you are the object, the law I have reſolved to obſerve never to addreſs the praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of any one to himſelf, But, ſir, I will take the liberty to ſay that you formed an unworthy judgment of an honeſt man when you believed him capable of returning ingratitude and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance for your kindneſs and politeneſs to him in the affair of the Fêtes de Ramire<note n="*" place="bottom">La Princeſſe de Navarre, which was afterwards called, Les Fêtes de Ramire.</note>. I have not forgotten the letter with which you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured me on that occaſion, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me that, notwithſtanding baſe calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, you are the true patron of riſing talents which need protection. You deigned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe your friendſhip to the firſt efforts of my mind; they were unſucceſsful, and that was what I ought to have expected. A ſolitary being who knew not how to ſpeak, a timid, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted man did not dare to preſent himſelf to you: and what would have been my title?
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:024210_0261_0FC569FA47711EF0"/>
But it was confidence and not zeal that I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; fearing to intrude on your obſervation, I expected from time a favourable occaſion to teſtify to you my reſpect and gratitude.</p>
                     <p>From that day I renounced letters and the deluſive hope of acquiring fame; deſpairing to obtain that object by the aid of genius, I have diſdained to owe it, like ordinary men, to indirect means. But I never ſhall renounce my admiration of your works. You have paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friendſhip and every virtue as a man who underſtands and loves them. I have heard en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy murmur but have rejected its clamours, and have ſaid without fear of deceiving myſelf: "Theſe writings which elevate the mind and excite fortitude are not the productions of a man indifferent to virtue."</p>
                     <p>Nor did you form juſter notions of a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, ſince I was known to you as ſuch. I adore liberty, and equally deteſt deſpotiſm and ſervitude, and would not impoſe either on any man. Such principles illy ſympathizs with inſolence; which is often the ſentiment of ſlaves, or of men ſtill more vile than thoſe, little authors who are jealous of great talents.</p>
                     <p>I declare to you then, ſir, that not only Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau of Geneva never held the diſcourſe you have attributed to him, but alſo that he is incapable of ſuch language. I do not flatter myſelf that I ſhall deſerve the honour of being known to you; but if ever I enjoy that happineſs it will
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:024210_0262_0FC569FBD5ED1D08"/>
be, I hope, only by means worthy of your eſteem.</p>

                     <p>I WAS, ſir, at the time informed of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and inſolence of the inſignificant d'Arnaud toward you, and I expreſſed my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at his conduct. I even deſired M. d'Argental to refer back to the letter of Fré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and to take a copy of it. This letter was in the hands of every one, and was circulated in ſo diſadvantageous a manner that I wiſhed to ſee the preface, which was complained of, and which was accuſed of being mutilated. It appeared to me as ſimple as I could wiſh, and I found nothing to blame in it but the name of the author and his ſtyle. In ſhort, ſir, I do not doubt that the king, whom you ſerve, will do you ſpeedy juſtice. He is fortunate who
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:024210_0263_0FC569FD407A6020"/>
has occaſion to defend the truth before a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, who himſelf patronizes and diſſeminates truth.</p>
                     <p>Yet, notwithſtanding this aſſurance, ſir, I muſt again exhort you to aſſume greater for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. A ſplendid fame, and perfect tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity are rarely found friends and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>But to return to this worthleſs man. I am this inſtant informed that he has juſt written a new letter to Fréron, in which he declares that the matter is entirely accommodated. In the name of God, ſir, while you patronize true talents, beware of thoſe drones, They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no remembrance of what they owe you, except it be to injure their benefactor. This ſubject recals to my mind that a perſon<note n="*" place="bottom">M. Dutartre.</note> told me one day, that, being placed at the theatre near the Abbé Desfontains and d'Arnaud, he heard the firſt reproach the other with enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome attachment to you. But, ſir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered d'Arnaud, you do not conſider that he ſerves me, and that I owe him my gratitude. Oh! replied the abbé, we may receive obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from him when we have occaſion; but we muſt calumniate him.</p>
                     <p>You ſee that the man has not forgotten this leſſon, nor has been ſlow to put it in practice.</p>
                     <p>Adieu, ſir; diſdain this vile race; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to arm yourſelf with philoſophy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting

                     <p>I IMAGINE, ſir, you muſt be informed that I have been ſettled at Geneva this two years. In the kind of neceſſity to which I was reduced by the unjust conduct of the French comedians of Paris of quitting that place, there was no retreat which better ſuited my natural inclination for repoſe and liberty; and I am ſo much the more ſatisfied with my choice as other reaſons have led you to the ſame aſylum. But it is not enough that our inclinations hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be mutual, our ſentiments alſo ſhould be in uniſon. How painful would it be to each of us, if, inhabiting the ſame place and viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame families, we can neither ſee nor converſe with each other without reſtraint and perhaps bitterneſs. I know that I have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, but it was not by indulging any of
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:024210_0265_0FC56A03841ECF40"/>
thoſe paſſions which are at once a diſgrace to literature, and human nature.</p>
                     <p>My attachment to Rouſſeau, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to the Abbé Desfontains were the ſole cauſes of the offence I have given you. Their death has avenged you of them; and the little good I did by my ſacrifices to them does not permit me to lament their death.</p>
                     <p>A thouſand men in my ſituation would tell you, ſir, that they eſteem you more than your moſt zealous partiſans, becauſe their eſteem was more conſiſtent and leſs blind. The proof, on my ſide, is inconteſtible. D'Auberval, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>omedian at Lyons, whoſe talents you have admired, and whoſe character you would adore did you know him as I do, can aſſure you that I charged him with the verſes, which I now ſend you, three days before your ſudden and unforeſeen departure. I availed myſelf of your taking this city in your route; and through which I was alſo paſſing. Theſe verſes are yet more ſeaſonable than ever, as I ſhall be at Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva on the 22d of this month, and as we ſhall both be ſettled there. I have nothing to add but the following offers.</p>
                     <p>I have written a criticiſm on your works in four volumes, which are yet in manuſcript; thoſe I will ſend to you. Prefixed to my firſt comedy is a letter with which you were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I have been formerly told, by Rouſſet; I will ſuppreſs that letter in the edition of my works which I am preparing. The Abbé Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fontaines
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:024210_0266_0FC56A07E7C9A370"/>
publiſhed two poems which he excited me to write againſt you; I will ſuppreſs thoſe alſo: and at this price will I merit your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                     <p>I will do more; my fugitive pieces in two volumes are dedicated to a gentleman of the country of Vaud, who is anxious to be known to you, and whoſe acquaintance would give you pleaſure; to convince the public of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of my regard for you, I am ready, with your permiſſion, to dedicate my Theatre in four volumes to you. I do not think that you can require any thing further.</p>
                     <p>But ſpeaking of editions, it is time, ſir, that you reſolve, as well as myſelf, to publiſh an edition of your works, avowed by yourſelf, and executed under your own inſpection. The public expect this with impatience, and they will not believe any thing to be yours which you do not yourſelf give them. At Geneva, you are in a place which will permit you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the deſign; and I will undertake, if you think proper, a part of this work, in the ſame manner as thirty years ſince at the Hague you confided to my care the correction of the proofs for the Henriade.</p>
                     <p>I ſend a copy of this letter, and the verſes which are encloſed, to M. de Montpéroux, who honours me with his eſteem and friendſhip. I flatter myſelf that he will be very happy to give the whole plan his protection. But is it neceſſary that the reſident ſhould join his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation

to the ſtep which I take? Do you not know, ſir, that it is greater to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our faults than never to have committed any, and more glorious to pardon than to avenge ourſelves? Merville addreſſes himſelf to Voltaire! You ſee that I finiſh poetically; but it is not as a poet, it is as a friend, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer, and a man who thinks, that I aſſure you of the particular eſteem and perfect attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with which I am,</p>

                     <p>IN every reſpect, ſir, it is my duty to expreſs my gratitude to you; and, while I offered the rude outlines of my ſorrowful reveries, I thought not of making a preſent worthy of you, but of acquitting myſelf of an obligation by rendering the homage which we all owe to you as our chief. Senſible, beſide, of the honour
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:024210_0268_0FC56A0D18C078B8"/>
which you do my country, I participate in the gratitude of my fellow citizens, and hope that it will augment in proportion to the profit they may derive from your precepts. Embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the aſylum you have choſen, enlighten a people worthy of your leſſons, and do you, who ſo well know how to diſplay liberty and virtue, teach us to cultivate them in our actions as we adore them in your writings. All who approach you ought to learn from you the road to glory and immortality.</p>
                     <p>You perceive, ſir, I do not aſpire to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of once more leading men into the woods; not but that I regret my part of the loſs of a ſtate of nature. With reſpect to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſir, to make you a ſavage would be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle ſo great that it can be wrought only by God, and ſo pernicious that it can be willed only by the devil. Do not, therefore, attempt to walk on all-fours; to do which no man on earth is leſs qualified. You teach men too ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to ſtand firmly not to remain erect yourſelf. I own the diſgrace which attends on celebrated men of letters is great indeed, nor do I deny that the evils are numerous which are attached to human nature, and which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be independent of our vain knowledge. Men have opened ſo many ſources of miſery to themſelves that their happineſs is but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed when they chance to eſcape a ſingle misfortune. There are ſecret connexions, however, in the progreſs of things which are
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:024210_0269_0FC56A0E857B0BB0"/>
unperceived by the vulgar, but which do not eſcape the thoughtful eye of the philoſopher.</p>
                     <p>It was neither Terence, Cicero, Virgil, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, nor Tacitus, who cauſed the crimes of the Romans and the misfortunes of Rome. But without the ſlow and ſecret poiſon which inſenſibly corrupted the moſt vigorous govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which hiſtory has preſerved the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, Cicero, Lucretius, Salluſt, and ſuch men had never exiſted or they had never written. The amiable age of Laelius and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence inſenſibly introduced the brilliant period of Horace and Auguſtus; and, in fine, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid epoch of Seneca and Nero, that of Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and Domitian. A taſte for the arts and ſciences has its birth in a ſecret vice which it ſoon augments in its turn; and if it be true that all human acquirements are pernicious to the ſpecies, thoſe of the mind and of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which increaſe our pride and multiply our wanderings, will ſooneſt accelerate men's misfortunes. Yet, there neceſſarily comes a time in which thoſe acquirements are requiſite to ſtay the progreſs of evil: it is the ſteel which muſt remain in the wound, leaſt, in removing it, the wounded ſhould expire.</p>
                     <p>As to myſelf, had I purſued my firſt voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and neither read nor written, I ſhould have been unqueſtionably more happy; yet if letters could now be entirely effaced, I ſhould be deprived of the only pleaſure which is left me. It is in letters that I find a conſolation for all my misfortunes; it is among their illuſtrious
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:024210_0270_0FC56A0FF584F550"/>
children that I taſte the delights of friendſhip, and learn to enjoy life and deſpiſe death. To them I owe the little merit I have, and to them am I alſo indebted for the honour of being known to you. But let us conſult inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in our concerns, and truth in our writings. Although there need philoſophers, hiſtorians, and truly learned men to enlighten the world and conduct its blind inhabitants, yet, if the wiſe Memnon has not miſinformed me, I know nothing more ridiculous than a nation of ſages. Confeſs, ſir, if it be right that great minds ſhould inſtruct men, the vulgar ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their precepts. If each takes upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to give inſtruction, where will thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Ordinary men receive the writings of the learned to criticiſe them, and not to inſtruct themſelves. Never was the world ſwarmed with ſuch dwarfs in intellect; they crowd the theatre, the coffee-houſes reſound with their ſentences, the bookſellers ſtalls are covered with their writings, and I hear the Orphan criticiſed, becauſe it is applauded, by a ſchool boy ſo little capable of perceiving its defects that ſcarcely can he feel any of its beauties.</p>
                     <p>Let us look for the firſt ſource of all the diſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of mankind proceed from error rather than ignorance; and that what we do not know is much leſs prejudicial to us than that which we think we underſtand. Now what ſurer means to run from error to error than the rage of knowing every thing? Had not men pretended to know that the earth does not turn on its axis, they had not puniſhed Gallieo, for having affirmed that it did turn. If none but philoſophers had claimed the title of philoſopher, the Encyclopédia had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced no perſecution. If a hundred deſpicable beings had not aſpired to fame, you would have been left to the peaceful enjoyment of yours, or at leaſt you would have had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with none but adverſaries worthy of you. Be not ſurpriſed then ſhould you feel ſome thorns which are inſeperable from the flowers that adorn ſuperior talents. The calumnies of your enemies are the followers of your tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; as formerly ſatyric acclamations were thoſe of the Roman generals. It is the public eagerneſs for your writings which produces the thefts of which you complain; but the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilating them with others is not eaſy, for neither iron nor lead unites with gold.</p>
                     <p>Permit me, in conſideration of the intereſt which I take in your repoſe and our inſtruction, to adviſe you to diſdain vain clamours, by which it is leſs the deſign to make you do ill than to divert you from producing good. The more you ſhall be criticiſed, the more muſt

you be admired; and a work of genius is a terrifying anſwer to weak reproaches. Who will dare to attribute books to you, which you have not written, while you continue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce inimitable works?</p>
                     <p>I am proud of your invitation, and if this winter leaves me ſo circumſtanced that I can viſit my native country in ſpring I will avail myſelf of your goodneſs. But I would rather drink the water of your fountain, than the milk of your cows; and with reſpect to the herbs of your orchard, I much fear to find nothing there but the lotos which is only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for beaſts, or the moli which prevents men from becoming brutes. I am ſincerely and reſpectfully, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I have ever thought, ſir, that the firſt duty of a man who wiſhed to acquire fame in any ſpecies of poetry, would be to form his taſte on your writings, and the ſecond to offer his eſſays to your inſpection. I acquit myſelf of this laſt, with much reliance on your indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and advice. Hitherto thoſe whom I have conſulted have given me ſuch various coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that I know not which to purſue. I am reproached by one for having too cloſely imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated la Fontaine; and by another, for not having ſufficiently imitated him. This friend complains that the morals of my fables are too long; this, that they are too ſhort; and a third would compel me to ſuppreſs them all,
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:024210_0274_0FC56A2082E7CE10"/>
alledging, notwithſtanding the example of all the fabuliſts, that the object of a fable ſhould be ſo inforced by the fable itſelf, as to paſs for that ſpecies of commentary which is called the moral. I have critics who wiſh that my fables were all as ſimple as that of La Cigale et la Fourmi<note n="*" place="bottom">The graſshopper and ant.</note>; as if a writer of fables was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be read by none but children.</p>
                     <p>This variety of opinions reſpecting my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction has often led me to apply to myſelf the fable of the miller, his ſon, and the aſs:

                     <p>You ſee, ſir, how neceſſary it is I ſhould be determined by a ſound judgment and from which my critics cannot appeal, and I ſhall act according to your advice, if I can deſerve that the author of the Henriade ſhould ſacrifice ſome moments to the reading a few fables, and that he ſhould deign to communicate his opinion to me. I expect this favour, ſir, from your zeal to encourage riſing talents, and I ſhould at all times be proud to take leſſons from the fineſt genius of France. I am, &amp;c.</p>

                           <p>My muſe does not vainly hope, in her attempts, to equal the high renown of la Fontaine. She knew the danger into which ſhe was led by the love of dulcet rhime; but thou deigneſt to encourage; and, though her flight be daring, if thee ſhe can but pleaſe, what has ſhe to fear? Since the time when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of poetry firſt hurried me into the land of fable, my dread has been continual: but now ſweet hope guides and animates my ſteps, and I cede to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive charms of indulgence which flatters me but too much. Who would not be inebriated by incenſe, which thy hand diſpenſes!</p>
                           <p>I want the charming touches of the friend of la Sablière; but of man and his miſtakes I may draw pleaſant pictures, and in the palace or in the cottage delinate his follies. I may teach every animal, whether lion, ant, eagle, or ſparrow, by new traits to diſcover the pride of human reaſon. Heroes thou haſt ſung; but whether of Athens or of Rome, Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh or Paris, thy philoſephic dictates ſhew heroes themſelves are no more than men. The idiot clown of la Fontaine, ſwelled with vanity, wiſhed that he who created the oak had but conſulted him, in his work. Man is ever more or leſs inflated by ſome weak vanity; and fable was invented artfully to correct the inſolent haughtineſs of the great, the baſe flattery of paraſites, and the rude obſtinacy of the vulgar. Happy the author who, all attentive to the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others, can correct the defects diſcovered in himſelf. But reaſoning were vain; for, ſhould my fables but excite a ſmile from thee, I ſtill ſhall feel an increaſe of pride.</p>

                     <head>OBSERVATIONS By the Ambaſſador M. de Chouvelin, on a Letter written by M. de Voltaire to the King of Praſſia, made by Order of the Miniſtry, in 1759<note n="*" place="bottom">The original of Voltaire's letter was never found. That of the King, in anſwer, is inſerted in the 2d Vol. of the correſpondence, and is dated September 22, 1759.</note>.</head>
                     <p>THE letter is good, and the reaſoning and the manner are excellent. I have only two obſervations to make.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. I know not whether I would ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively preſent to him the idea of reſtitution. I imagine this muſt ever be a bitter draught, and I know not whether it will not injure his fame as much as his intereſt. Perhaps it will be neceſſary to ſoften this paſſage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. I think it would be expedient further to explain to him the baſis of a ſyſtem of paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which ſhould originate in his own ideas, ſuch as they are found in his laſt letter; conſequently to me it appears that I ſhould addreſs him thus:</p>
                     <p>You will not make peace but in conjunction with the Engliſh, and you are right, for your honour is pledged; but why will you not make peace for the Engliſh and for yourſelf at the ſame time? Have you not ſufficient claims to their eſteem, or aſcendency enough over them, to induce them to ſacrifice ſome of their
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:024210_0279_0FC56A2BE01DFC20"/>
advantages to the honour of ſecuring your own poſſeſſions? Would not the French, in compenſation for ſuch a benefit, be impelled and authoriſed to prevail on their allies to make conceſſions equivalent to thoſe which the Engliſh ſhould have made in your favour? Will you not then become the author and the mover of theſe reciprocal conceſſions which ſhall reduce the whole to an equilibrium that will be deſirable and beneficial to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? In a word, ſhould you induce the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh not to engroſs the dominion of the ſeas, the proprietorſhip of all the colonies, and of trade in general, can you doubt but that the French would engage your enemies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce theſe claims which to you are moſt noxious.</p>
                     <p>Such a paragraph modelled by the genious of M. de Voltaire, embelliſhed by the powerful charms of his ſtyle, and combined with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he has of managing the king of Pruſſia and of the objects moſt proper to excite his attention, would, in my opinion, fully diſplay the grand outlines of a plan which it would be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſhould this monarch ſeize on, adopt, and bring to maturity.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>DID I not know you to be ſufficiently wiſe to look with contempt on the baubles of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur ſo as not to be ſuſceptible of them, I ſhould feel no ſurpriſe that you had diſdained to anſwer the letter I ventured to write to you, in which my heart deſcribed all its ſenſations. I was convinced when my hand was the faithful interpreter of my ſentiments that the dignity of yours would not ſuffer you to remain inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the afflictions of an unfortunate man, and that you knew how to dry up the tears
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:024210_0282_0FC56A335C501F88"/>
which grief had cauſed to flow. I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that your bounty would not be implor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain, that your arms would readily open to afford innocence an aſylum, and that your heart was ſuperior even to your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſuch were, ſuch ſtill are, my thoughts; and theſe emboldened me to explain my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſituation in my firſt letter. Imagine, ſir, whether I am not afflicted by your ſilence at preſent. Alas, perhaps you have ſuppoſed I ſhould repay your friendſhip and favours with the blackeſt ingratitude, and that I ſhould be cowardly and criminal enough not to be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Act, ſir, as you pleaſe with reſpect to my other requeſts, but let me entreat you not to do me the injuſtice of thus ſuſpecting my probity. This is the only wealth I now poſſeſs, it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious jewel which I wiſh to preſerve from the general contagion. Your ſuſpicions dim its luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, but your generoſity and greatneſs of mind may preſerve and render it more reſplendent. Affection, zeal, and reſpect, are all the wealth I have, and now are and ever will remain yours. Were you to refuſe me what I have requeſted with ſo much ardour, but which it may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for you to grant, I ſhould ever remain convinced your refuſal was dictated by virtue, and that you were guided by reaſons unknown to me; and I then ſhould only be anxious of being informed of what they were. In fine, ſir, whatever your kind intentions may be, let me deſire you would inform a youth of them

                        </opener>
                        <p>PERMIT one of thoſe who are moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured with the Belles Lettres without the power of ſtudying them, and with theſe men of genius who ſtudy them with ſucceſs, to take the preſent opportunity of renewing that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which is more flattering to himſelf than to you. The ſentiments which I have inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly avowed appear to have affected you, and for theſe I am ſufficiently repaid ſhould your feelings have been in union with mine.</p>
                        <p>The kindneſs which you have ſhewn toward me, induces me to aſk a favour. During theſe ſhort intervals which employment more gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my have allowed me to dedicate to my love of poetry, I have formed the raſh deſign of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a tragedy, the ſubject of which is perhaps the moſt ſingular and intereſting of any to be found in modern ſtory. It is the death of Charles I. and the uſurpation of Cromwell. The difficulties attending ſuch a fable were
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:024210_0284_0FC56A3657A52D48"/>
great, nor have I by the labour of a year been able to ſurmount them. I have written no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more hitherto than the plan of my piece; after having changed it ſeveral times, and moſt mercileſsly burnt one entire act, and more, which did not equal the high idea I had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of my ſubject. I am not, however, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, but have begun again; yet my ardour has ſlackened, becauſe I have been informed that you have for ſome time been yourſelf at work on the ſame ſubject, and that ſoon or late you intend to preſent your piece to the public.</p>
                        <p>You may well imagine, ſir, that my raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not quite great enough to contend with an antagoniſt like yourſelf. It belongs only to a few to enter the liſts with and vanquiſh their maſters. I ſhould quickly abandon my plan, were I certain that you had formed the ſame; and eſpecially as this perhaps will be the only work I ſhall ever write during a life of obſcurity; and baniſhed as I am to a town in which there are men of wit, but who make no uſe of that quality, and who hate or deſpiſe thoſe who do. My days will be ſhortened by labour, which is the only wealth and the only pleaſure of which fortune could not deprive me; and Cromwell only, to whom I ſhould dedicate the remains of life, would preſerve the memory of a youth who grew too early old becauſe he began to think too ſoon.</p>
                        <p>Yes, ſir, at the age of ſeven, I endeavoured
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:024210_0285_0FC56A37B736C400"/>
to cultivate poetry, and you may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how much aſſiduous ſtudy injures the health of a child. Excuſe me for having ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained you on ſubjects of ſo little moment. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let me intreat you to inform me whether I ought to continue my project, and whether you have not anticipated my deſign. Deign to afford me leſſons, of which I am too much in want, and of which I am ſo deſirous, that you will ſcarcely refuſe them. By your aid, I may diſcover impediments which I have not foreſeen, or beauties which I could never have invented. You will encourage me in executing a difficult taſk, and will teach me to avoid rocks and quick-ſands, among which I ſhould otherwiſe be wrecked, but which your genius will enable me to eſcape. Do not, I conjure you, deny the requeſt of a youth who ſeeks for inſtruction, who reſpects his maſters, who loves your perſon becauſe he loves your works in which your ſoul ſhines forth, and who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to you for every thing, becauſe from you he has learned to think.</p>

                        <p>I HAVE broken my bonds, ſir, and have ſhaken of claſſic duſt. Here am I at Paris, in
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:024210_0286_0FC56A3B7B1C2FD8"/>
freedom and almoſt happineſs, and in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the arts where I ſo long have deſired to live and cultivate literature. But, ah, ſir, how ſtrangely have literature and good taſte gone to decay! How little does all I ſee aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate with the ideas I had formed from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our beſt authors! I am fallen as it were from the clouds. I underſtand no man, and no man underſtands me. They tell me of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which make the audience weep, and I ſee tragedies which oblige me to laugh. I am deſired to write in the ſame taſte, and I do not know what taſte they mean. It is neceſſary, however, that I ſhould ſubmit; and I begin to perceive the thing it not ſo very difficult.</p>
                        <p>I really, ſir, do not know what will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be thought of the preſent age; but I am convinced that it is intolerably like the age of Seneca and Silius Italicus. You, ſir, are the man who beheld the meridian of the Belles Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, and for the decline of which you long have conſoled us; but you have the affliction of not leaving any hope behind you of ſimilar conſolation.</p>
                        <p>Pardon this complaint ſir, from a gloomy partiſan of old taſte, and an admirer of your works. I cannot prevail on myſelf ever to think that beautiful which never can be ſo, unleſs it be proved that Molière, Racine, Boileau, and yourſelf are wretched writers.</p>
                        <p>But I come to the main purport of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is to thank you for having procured
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:024210_0287_0FC56A3E4901E498"/>
me the acquaintance of M. de la Harpe. I cannot ſufficiently praiſe his politeneſs, the goodneſs of the advice he has given me, and particularly the veneration which he expreſſes for you, He ſwears by your name as Philocte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſwore by Hercules; and I have no doubt but that he will nobly fill the part of Philocte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. He will certainly be well able to oppoſe the torrent, and combat the monſters of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But the evil is too deeply rooted; his his example will come too late; and he will only be able to ſave himſelf from the general ſhipwreck.</p>
                        <p>I did not find the minds of men much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced in favour of my Médée non-Magicienne (Medea no Enchantreſs.) They took it ill that I ſhould rob the ſtage of a ſplendid ſpectacle which produced ſo fine an effect in the opinion of merchant's clerks, and of the vulgar. They further add that the magic invocations of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge pierre have their charms; and that his verſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation will again become pleaſant to our ears. In vain did I affirm with you that an enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs cannot affect the paſſions which are totally deſtroyed by magic, and would be thought ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous in any other character except Medea, and that it is diſguſting and monſtrous for her to kill her children without any cauſe, ſince ſhe might have carried them off in her carr. I added a thouſand other things of the ſame nature, but to no effect; and I find the people of this philoſophic age are more addicted to ſorcery than they ſuppoſe.</p>

An aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma was my prevailing and familiar malady; however, a ſevere regimen, and a plant which I do not know, but of which I have fortunately procured a good ſtock, though I have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to uſe it at preſent, cauſed every ſymptom to diſappear toward autumn. My health there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therefore

is as good as I could wiſh, but my trifling fortune and my affairs are in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt confuſion. I have for three years paid 600 livres annually, in conſequence of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements into which I entered at the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of my daughter.</p>
                     <p>The following is the ſtate of my income: 1200 livres from the king of Pruſſia, of which only a thouſand are clear profit, 200 being ſet apart to pay for the journals and papers from which I make my extracts, and for copying thoſe and other works which I find it neceſſary to add. Theſe 1000 livres from the king of Pruſſia, with an annuity of 2600 livres, which is ſecured on the Hotel de Ville, and 400 livres per annum, paid me by the Count de Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guais, gave me hopes of extricating myſelf from my difficulties, and of even continuing to pay the 600 livres according to my engagement. But a new perpetual charge has accrued by the neceſſity of my taking a ſecond wife to aid me in my infirmities.</p>
                     <p>You did me the favour to inform me, in the beginning of 1766, when I begged you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me in the diſtribution of your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions that I had deferred my application too long, and that as a puniſhment I muſt wait longer; that I ought to have reminded you of my granary in the time of the harveſt, and that every body had gleaned except myſelf, ſeeing I did not preſent myſelf among the reſt. You promiſed to repair the ill conſequence of
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:024210_0291_0FC56A4994B7AE30"/>
my negligence, and you added in the moſt obliging and gratifying manner that you had the ſame regard for me as formerly.</p>
                     <p>This recalls to my mind with what zeal you undertook and endeavoured, toward the latter end of the regency, to procure half of your pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be ſettled on me and in what manner, through your ſolicitations, the Duke de Melun intereſted himſelf in the ſucceſs of that deſign under the adminiſtration of the regent. But the ſorrowful events which followed in rapid ſucceſſion rendered ineffectual this uncommon inſtance of friendſhip and benevolence, and which was particularly noticed in the Hollard Gazette.

                     <p>Among the young people who at that time played with ſome reputation, and part of

whom have ſince ſettled in the country, I am the only one who remained at Paris; and this circumſtance, which I owed rather to my good fortune than any ſuperiority of talents, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the following way.</p>
                     <p>The room in which we performed in the Hotel de Jabac being in ſuch condition that the repairing of it could be no longer delayed, we were under the neceſſity of requeſting permiſſion of the comedians of the Hotel de Clermont. Tonnerre to play an their theatre, alternately with them. An agreement was accordingly entered into by both parties, in the month of July, 1749, by which we were bound to pay half the expences; and we open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Sidney and George-Dandin.</p>
                     <p>It will be readily ſuppoſed that the emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two companies would excite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes in the public, the reſult of which could not be favourable to one without diminiſhing the reputation which the other till then had enjoyed. The audience were divided in their opinion of theſe gentlemen and of thoſe, of the young ladies of this theatre and the young ladies of that. The firſt were more pleaſing, but the other diſplayed more knowledge of the theatre, and more grace and art, &amp;c. Thus were the public amuſed and combatted ſome for the company de Tonnerre, and others for the company de Jabac. But who could have imagined that a ſociety of young people who united pleaſure and decorum could provoke
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:024210_0294_0FC56A4FC8BE9A08"/>
the jealouſy and complaints of the high-prieſts of Melpomene? Yet, their influence inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted our performances, and a Janſeniſt prieſt re-eſtabliſhed them. The Abbé de Chauvelin, Conſéiller-Clerc of the parliament of Paris, condeſcended to employ his power in behalf of pupils againſt their maſters, and we played the Mauvais-riche, a new comedy in five acts and in verſe, written by M. de Arnaud, to the moſt brilliant aſſembly then in Paris; but it was received with little applauſe. This was in the month of February, 1750.</p>
                     <p>M. de Voltaire was invited by the author to ſee the repreſentation; and, whether induced by his compaſſion for M. d' Arnaud or his complaiſance to the actors who to the utmoſt exerted themſelves to give ſome value to that feeble unintereſting work, this great man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared well pleaſed, and particularly inquired who it was that played the part of the lover. He was informed that the performer was the ſon of a goldſmith of Paris who played for his amuſement, but who really wiſhed to make it his ſerious employment. He expreſſed to M. Arnaud a deſire of knowing me; and deſired him to engage me to pay him a viſit on the following day.</p>
                     <p>The pleaſure this invitation gave me was even greater than my ſurpriſe; but it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to deſcribe the ſenſations of my mind when I beheld this man whoſe eyes burned with imagination and genius. As I
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:024210_0295_0FC56A5194D02000"/>
ſpake to him I felt myſelf penetrated with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, admiration, and fear; but while I experienced theſe ſenſations, M. de Voltaire had the goodneſs to put an end to my embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment by taking me in his arms and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God for having created a being who could excite his feelings by the repetition of ſuch moderate verſes.</p>
                     <p>He afterwards made ſeveral enquiries rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to my ſituation, and that of my father, the manner in which I have been educated, and the ideas I entertained of my future fortune. Having ſatisfied him on theſe ſubjects, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partaken of a dozen cups of coffee mixed with chocolate, the only nouriſhment which M. de Voltaire took from five in the morning till three in the afternoon, I informed him with great earneſtneſs that I knew no other happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on earth than that of playing dramatic pieces; that a melancholy loſs had left me maſter of my actions, and that enjoying a ſmall patrimony of ſeven hundred and fifty livres income, I had reaſon to hope that ſhould I abandon my father's occupation, I ſhould loſe nothing by the change, provided I could one day be admitted into the king's company of comedians.</p>
                     <p>"Ah my friend," cried M. de Voltaire, "never take that reſolution; continue to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form for your pleaſure, but think not of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this your profeſſion. It is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt difficult talents, but it is degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:024210_0296_0FC56A52C2DBBC38"/>
by unfeeling people and proſcribed by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites. France ſhall one day eſteem your art, but it will then no longer poſſeſs Baron, le Couvreur, or Dangeville. If you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your deſign I will lend you ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand francs to employ in commerce, and you ſhall return the ſum as it ſhall be convenient to you. Come to me again at the end of the weak; reflect well on the ſubject, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with your poſſitive determination."</p>
                     <p>Diſconcerted, and moved almoſt to the ſhedding of tears, with the generous offer of this exalted being whom men have called ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious, inflexible, and unfeeling, I wiſhed to give way to my ſentiments in expreſſing of gratitude, and four times began a ſpeech with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being once able to finiſh it. At length I reſolved to take my leave, which I attempted with a ſtammering voice; but as I retired he called me back and deſired me to recite ſome morſels of any part which I had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to play. Without conſidering the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I fooliſhly enough propoſed to ſpeak the celebrated couplet in the ſecond act of Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus. "No, not Piron," ſaid M. de Voltaire, with a piercing and terrifying voice, "I wiſh not to hear bad verſes. Repeat me any part you know from Racine."</p>
                     <p>Fortunately I recollected that while I was at the College de Mazarin I had learned the whole tragedy of Athalïe by having heard that play repeated numerous times by the ſcholars
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:024210_0297_0FC56A544531E520"/>
who performed it. I began therefore at the firſt ſcene and played Abner and Joad alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately. But I had not finiſhed my taſk when M. de Voltaire ſuddenly cried with enthuſiaſm, "Ah, my God what poetry, and how aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this tragedy ſhould be written through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with the ſame purity and paſſion!" He then diſmiſſed me; and ſaid, while he embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me, "I foreſee that you will poſſeſs a moſt pathetic voice; and that you will become the delight of Paris; but think no more of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic theatre."</p>
                     <p>This is an exact account of my firſt viſit to M. de Voltaire. The ſecond was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, as he conſented, after the moſt earneſt ſolicitations on my ſide, to receive me into his houſe, and to allow me a yearly income; he built, over his own apartment, a ſmall theatre in which he had the goodneſs to ſee me and the whole company to which I belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed play with his nieces. He could not reflect without the ſtrongeſt diſpleaſure that till then we had been permitted to expend much money to afford amuſement to our friends and to the public.</p>
                     <p>The expence which M. de Voltaire incurred by this temporary eſtabliſhment, and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſintereſted offer to me, convinced me in the ſtrongeſt manner that he was as noble and generous in his actions as his enemies were unjuſt while they aſcribed to him the vice of ſordid economy. Theſe were facts of which I
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:024210_0298_0FC56A578B437028"/>
was myſelf a witneſs; but truth obliges me further to confeſs that M. de Voltaire did not only aid me with his advice for more than ſix months, but alſo that he defrayed my expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces during the whole of that time, and that ſince my being eſtabliſhed in the theatre I hate proofs of receiving from him more than two thouſand crowns. At preſent he calls me "His great actor, His Carrick, His dear child!" Theſe are titles which I owe ſolely to his partiality for me; but the title which my heart adopts is that of a reſpectful and grateful pupil.</p>
                     <p>And indeed I ought to be grateful ſince it was to M. de Voltaire alone that I owed the firſt notions of my art; and ſince it was ſolely through his intereſt that the Duke de Aumont thought proper to grant the order for my firſt appearance at the theatre in the month of September, 1750; the reſult of which was that, aided by a perſeverance, proof againſt every obſtacle, I, at the end of ſeventeen months, ſurmounted all oppoſition from the city and the court, and was entered on the liſt of the king's comedians in the mouth of February, 1752.</p>
                     <p>Whoever reads theſe details will obſerve that I am far from reſembling thoſe ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearts who bluſh to acknowledge a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and who, to complete their baſeneſs, meanly calumniate their benefactors. I have known more than one of that kind connected

with M. de Voltaire. I have been witneſs of the depredations which have been made on him by people of every rank. Some he has pitied, ſilently deſpiſed others, but never avenged himſelf of any. The bookſellers, whom he has prodigiouſly enriched by the various editions of his works, have ever publicly aſperſed his character; but there is not one of them who has dared to attack him in a court of juſtice, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cious as they were of their guilt.</p>
                     <p>The friendſhip of M. de Voltaire is ever unſhaken. His manner is impetuous, his heart good, his ſoul compaſſionate; he is modeſt in in an extreme degree, notwithſtanding the praiſes which have been laviſhed on him by kings, by men of letters, and by a people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to hear and admire him; profound and juſt in his opinion of the works of other writers, abounding with affability and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his commerce with men, and inflexible toward thoſe who have offended him. In theſe features his character will be ſeen drawn with truth.</p>
                     <p>He could never be reproached with having been the firſt to attack his adverſaries; but, after hoſtilities were commenced, he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as a lion ruſhing from his retreat, and at ſuch times ſome of his enemies have fallen before him, and others have taken their flight.</p>
                     <p>I have heard him frequently ſay, that his being unable to poſſeſs the friendſhip of Cré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billon gave him great affliction; that he had
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:024210_0300_0FC568677154C0F0"/>
ever eſteemed his abilities, but could never pardon his having refuſed his approbation to Mahomet.</p>
                     <p>I will ſay nothing of the ſublimity of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious talents; in whatever way he exerciſed them, he diſplayed erudition, wit, taſte, and philoſophy; and Europe will pronounce his eulogium. His works, diſtributed over the earth, are ſufficient to form the materials of his praiſe; and happy is he who can appreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them, and ſpeak worthily of this celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and extraordinary man.</p>
                     <p>The facility with which he wrote is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known; but few have been witneſs to ſuch inſtances as the following, which I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaw.</p>
                     <p>His amanuenſis had loſt or deſtroyed the fifth act of the tragedy of Zulima. M. de Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire produced another in a very ſhort time, and which abounded with new ideas, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances had ſuggeſted.</p>
                     <p>He altered the character of Cicero, in the fourth act of Rome Preſerved, when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that tragedy in the month of Auguſt, 1750, at the theatre of the Ducheſs du Maine, at the Chateau de Sceaux. I think it is not poſſible that any one could be more true, more pathetic, or more enthuſiaſtic than M. de Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire in this part. It was, indeed, Cicero himſelf, pouring forth his eloquence from the tribunal, againſt the deſtroyer of his country, of its laws, its manners, and its religion. I
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:024210_0301_0FC56868F405A850"/>
cannot forget that the Ducheſs du Maine, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having expreſſed her admiration of this new part, aſked M. de Voltaire who was the performer of Lentulus; Sura, and that M. de Voltaire anſwered, "Madam, he is the beſt of us all." It was myſelf whom he treated with ſuch diſtinguiſhed goodneſs, nor was it very flattering to the knights, counts, and marquiſſes, whoſe companion I then was.</p>
                     <p>I will not conclude this article without nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome other anecdotes which were within my own knowledge, and which may perhaps ſerve to give ſtill more correct ideas of the character of M. de Voltaire.</p>
                     <p>It is well known that, on the death of the celebrated Baron, and on the retreat of Bauberg from the ſtage, both the comic and the tragic parts of theſe great actors were given to Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſin, who at that time did not approach near the excellence of his maſters, a circumſtance which drew a ſevere ſarcaſm from Voltaire, who had committed to him the part of Brutus in the tragedy of the ſame name. The piece was rehearſed at the theatre, and the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sarraſin in his invocation to Mars, his want of vigour, grandeur, and dignity through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the firſt act, excited Voltaire's indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuch a degree that he cried out, "Sir, do you recollect that you are Brutus, the moſt auguſt of all the Roman Conſuls, and that you muſt not addreſs the god Mars as you would ſay, Ah good Virgin, let me gain a prize of a hundred francs in the lottery!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="303" facs="unknown:024210_0302_0FC5686C369D7DB8"/>The reſult of this new mode of inſtruction was that Sarraſin diſplayed no more ſtrength of animation, for he did not poſſeſs thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and was only a good actor when the ſcene required pathos. He knew not the art of painting the paſſions with energy, nor was the ſoul of Mithridates, nor the dignity of Auguſtus ever perceived in him.</p>
                     <p>The celebrity which Mademoiſelle Dumeſnil had acquired in the part of Merope, and which ſhe has uniformly maintained during twenty years is well known. Yet even this reputation was no protection from the railleries of M. de Voltaire. When ſhe rehearſed Merope for the firſt time he obſerved that this famous actreſs did not inveigh againſt Polifonte in the fourth act with ſufficient vehemence and paſſion. "I muſt be poſſeſſed by the devil," ſaid Madame Dumeſnil, "to aſſume the tone you deſire." "Yes, Madam," anſwered Voltaire, "we muſt be poſſeſſed by the devil to excel in any art!" I believe that M. de Voltaire then ſpoke a great truth,</p>
                     <p>He was one day aſked his opinion reſpecting the propriety with which ſome preferred Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſſelle Dumeſnil to Mademoiſelle Clairon, and the juſtneſs of that enthuſiaſm which this laſt excited in the public to the great mortification of the actreſs who had ſerved her as a model. The partiſans of the old taſte pretended that to ſeize on the ſoul and to excite its feelings, it was neceſſary to poſſeſs, like Mademoiſelle Dumeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nil,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:024210_0303_0FC5686F94F12908"/>the magic wand of Corncille, and that Mademoiſelle Clarion had it not. "She has it in the throat," cried Voltaire; and the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was accurately decided.</p>
                     <p>A very young and beautiful girl, daughter of a Procureur<note n="*" place="bottom">An Attorney.</note> belonging to the parliament, played with me the part of Palmire in Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, on M. de Voltaire's theatre. This ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able girl, who was but fifteen years old, was far from being able to ſpeak with ſufficient ſtrength and grandeur the imprecations which it was her part to utter againſt her tyrant. She was young, handſome, and intereſting, and M. de Voltaire aſſumed more gentleneſs while he ſhewed her how far diſtant ſhe was from the ſpirit of her part. "Madam," ſaid he to her, "imagine to yourſelf that Mahomet is an impoſtor, an attrocious villian, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your father to be aſſaſſinated, has juſt poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned your brother, and who to crown his kindneſs would abſolutely raviſh yourſelf. If all this trifling treachery gives you a certain pleaſure, your politeneſs to him is well judged. But if he excited the leaſt diſguſt in you, this, Madam, it the tone that you ſhould aſſume."</p>
                     <p>Then M. de Voltaire himſelf repeated the imprecation and gave this poor innocent girl, who was bluſhing with ſhame and trembling with fear, a leſſon ſo much more precious as he joined precept to example; and ſhe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became a very pleaſing actreſs.</p>

                        <pb n="305" facs="unknown:024210_0304_0FC5687072B4E178"/>In 1755, being at M. de Voltaire's houſe of the Delices near Geneva, which he had juſt obtained from the attorney-general Tronchin, he depoſited in my hands the Orphan of China, which was at firſt in three acts, and which he named his hidden treaſure. Speaking of a noble character in this tragedy which poſſeſſed great novelty, he ſaid to me, "My friend, the inflexions of your voice are naturally ſoft and melodious, but beware of ſuffering any of thoſe to eſcape you in the part of Gengis Khan. You muſt impreſs it ſtrongly on your mind that I have painted him as a tyger who, while he careſſes his female, ſtrikes his talons into her ſides. If the other performers find the piece languid in parts, I permit them to make cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailments. Theſe are citizens that we muſt ſometimes ſacrifice to the ſafety of the republic. But take care that they uſe the licence with caution; for falſe critics are often more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in dictating theſe ſort of alterations, than men who are down-right ignorant."</p>
                     <p>After my departure from Ferney, in the month of April, 1762, M. de Voltaire formed a deſire to have the Orphan of China played at his little theatre. The bookſeller Cramer ſtudied the part of Gengis Khan, under the inſtruction of the Duke de Villars. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of this nobleman to teach the art of performing on the ſtage are well known; he made his pupil Cramer a cold, inſipid, declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. M. de Voltaire was not ſlow to perceive
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:024210_0305_0FC5687226BE80B8"/>
the defect; and, in the firſt rehearſal, he was more than ever convinced that a man may be at the ſame time a duke, a fine wit, and the ſon of a great man, without any of theſe titles giving him talents to exerciſe the fine arts, knowledge to comprehend their principles, or taſte to decide on their execution.</p>
                     <p>M. de Voltaire hiſſed Cramer; and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to torment him this way till he ſhould have changed his ſtyle of acting. The faithful Geneveſe applied with incredible application to forget the whole of his maſter's leſſons, and returned to Ferney at the end of fifteen days, to repeat his part in a new manner before M. de Voltaire, who perceiving a very great change, cried with rapture to Madame Denis, "My Neice, God be praiſed! Cramer has diſgorged his Duke!"</p>
                     <p>For more than thirty years Paris had never beheld a party as ſtrong as that which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to oppoſe the firſt repreſentation of the tragedy of Oreſtes, except indeed, that which was formed againſt Adelaide de Gueſclan. Oreſtes was hiſſed from three to eight in the evening. Yet, the beſt informed part of the public, whoſe judgment alone ſurvives tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary efforts becauſe it is impartial, prevailed by degrees over Crébillon's zealots, and finally teſtified its ſatisfaction by the moſt unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acclamations. It was in one of theſe ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briating moments that Voltaire ſprang half out of his box, and cried with all his ſtrength, "Go on Athenians! It is Sophocles!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="307" facs="unknown:024210_0306_0FC56875D633F5C0"/>This frankneſs and admirable preſence of mind every hour characterized the only man of whom we have collected any anecdotes. This which follows diſplays M. de Voltaire as nature formed him, that is, animated, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and ever philoſophic.</p>
                     <p>In 1743, at the third or fourth repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Merope, M. de Voltaire obſerved a defect in a part of the dialogue. On his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Marchioneſs du Chatelet's houſe, where he had ſupped, he corrected the faulty part, made a packet of his corrections, and ordered a ſervant to carry them to the Sieur Paulin, a very worthy man, but a very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate actor, whom Voltaire had educated, as he uſed to ſay, with great care to play his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. The ſervant obſerved to his maſter that it was paſt midnight, and that it would be impoſſible to awaken M. Paulin at that hour. "Away," replied the author of Merope, "tyrants never ſleep."</p>

                     <head>DECLARATION OF M. DE VOLTAIRE TO THE KING OF PRUSSIA. [Remitted by him to his Majeſty's Miniſter, at Frankfort, 1753.]</head>
                     <p>I AM dying; and I proteſt before God and man that, being no longer in the ſervice of
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:024210_0307_0FC5687AAFAD71C0"/>
his majeſty the king of Pruſſia, I am not the leſs attached to his intereſt, nor leſs ready to obey his pleaſure for the ſhort time I have to live.</p>
                     <p>He arreſted me at Frankfort for a collection of his poetry, of which he made me a preſent, and I remained in priſon till the book was brought from Hamburg. I have reſtored to the king's miniſter, at Frankfort, all the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his majeſty which I had preſerved as precious marks of the goodneſs with which he had honoured me. At Paris I will reſtore all the other letters which may be demanded by him.</p>
                     <p>His majeſty wiſhes to recal a contract which he had deigned to make with me. I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ready to return it with all the reſt; and, as ſoon as it ſhall be found, I will reſtore it or cauſe it to be reſtored. This writing, which was not a contract but altogether the effect of the king's goodneſs, and which has been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effect, was on a piece of paper one half leſs than that which d'Arget took from my chamber to the king's apartment at Potſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. It contained nothing more than thanks on my part for the penſion which his majeſty had granted me with the permiſſion of the king my maſter, for that which he had alſo granted to my neice after my death, and for the croſs, and chamberlain's key.</p>
                     <p>The king of Pruſſia deigned to write at the bottom of this ſcrap of paper, as well as I
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:024210_0308_0FC5687BB9B3A310"/>
remember: "I ſign with great pleaſure the grant which I have deſigned to make for more than fifteen years paſt." This paper, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely uſeleſs to his majeſty, to myſelf, and the public, ſhall aſſuredly be returned as ſoon as it can be found among my other papers. I neither can nor will make the leaſt uſe of it; and, to remove all ſuſpicion, I declare myſelf guilty of treaſon toward the king of France, my maſter, and the king of Pruſſia if I do not deliver up this paper the inſtant it ſhall fall into my hands.</p>
                     <p>My neice, who attends me in my ſickneſs, engages under the ſame oath to reſtore it if it ſhall come into her poſſeſſion; and till I can examine my papers at Paris I entirely annul the ſaid writing. I declare that I have no claim on his majeſty the king of Pruſſia; and, in my preſent cruel ſituation, I look for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing except the compaſſion which his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind owes to a dying man who has hazarded and loſt all by his attachment to his majeſty, who has ſerved him with zeal, and has been uſeful to him but has never failed in reſpect to his perſon, and who relies on the goodneſs of his heart. I am obliged to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, being unable to write. I ſign, with the profoundeſt reſpect, the pureſt innocence, and the moſt lively grief,</p>

                  <div n="1" type="part">
                     <p>I WAS tired of the lazy and turbulent life led at Paris, of the multitude of Petit-Maitres, of bad books printed with the approbation of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and the privilege of the King, of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals and parties among the learned, and of the mean arts, plagiariſm, and book-making which diſhonour literature. In the year 1733, I met with a young lady who happened to think nearly as I did, and who took a reſolution to go with me and ſpend ſeveral years in the country, there to cultivate her underſtanding, far from the hurry and tumult of the world.</p>
                     <p>This Lady was no other than the Marchion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs de Châtelet, who, of all the women in France, had a mind the moſt capable of the different branches of ſcience. Her father, the Baron de Breteuid, had taught her Latin, which
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:024210_0313_0FC5688B24A48228"/>
ſhe underſtood as perfectly as Madame Dacier. She knew by rote the moſt beautiful paſſages in Horace, Virgil, and Lucretius, and all the philoſophical works of Cicero were familiar to her. Her inclinations were more ſtrongly bent towards the mathematics and metaphyſics than any other ſtudies, and ſeldom have there been united in the ſame perſon ſo much juſtneſs of diſcernment, and elegance of taſte, with ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a deſire of information.</p>
                     <p>Yet, notwithſtanding her love of literature, ſhe was not the leſs fond of the world, and thoſe amuſements which were adapted to her ſex and age: ſhe, however, determined to quit them all, and go and bury herſelf in an old ruinous chateau, upon the borders of Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne and Loraine, and ſituated in a barren and unhealthy ſoil. This old chateau ſhe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and embelliſhed with tolerably pretty gardens; I built a gallery, and formed a very good collection of natural hiſtory: add to which, we had a library not badly furniſhed.</p>
                     <p>We were viſited by ſeveral of the learned, who came to philoſophize in our retreat: among others we had the celebrated Köenig for two intire years, who has ſince died Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor at the Hague, and Librarian to her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the princeſs of Orange. Maupertuis came alſo, with John Bernouilli; and there it was that Maupetuis, who was born the moſt jealous of all human beings, made me the object of a paſſion which has ever been to him exceedingly dear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="unknown:024210_0314_0FC5688DCD619920"/>I taught Engliſh to Madame du Châtelet, who in about three months, underſtood it as well as I did, and read Newton, Locke, and Pope, with equal eaſe. She learnt Italian likewiſe as ſoon. We read all the works of Taſſo and Arioſto together, ſo that when Algarotti came to Cirey, where he finiſhed his Neutonianiſmo per le Dame, [The Ladies Newton,] he found her ſufficiently ſkilful in his own language to give him ſome very excellent information by which he profited. Algarotti was a Venetian, the ſon of a very rich tradeſman, and very amiable; he travelled all over Europe, knew a little of every thing, and gave to every thing a grace.</p>
                     <p>In this our delightful retreat we ſought only inſtruction, and troubled not ourſelves concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what paſſed in the reſt of the world. We long employed all our attention and powers upon Leibnitz, and Newton: Madame du Châ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telet attached herſelf firſt to Leibnitz, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained one part of his ſyſtem, in a book exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly well written, entitled Inſtitutions de Phyſique. She did not ſeek to decorate philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy with ornaments to which philoſophy is a ſtranger; ſuch affectation never was part of her character, which was maſculine and juſt. The properties of her ſtyle were clearneſs, preciſion, and elegance. If it be ever poſſible to give the ſemblance of truth to the ideas of Leibnitz, it will be found in that book: but at preſent
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:024210_0315_0FC5688F47413550"/>
few people trouble themſelves to know how or what Leibnitz thought.</p>
                     <p>Born with a love of truth, ſhe ſoon aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſyſtem, and applied herſelf to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the great Newton; ſhe tranſlated his whole book on the Principles of the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics into French; and when ſhe had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enlarged her knowledge, ſhe added to this book, which ſo few people underſtood, an Algebraical Commentary, which likewiſe is not to be underſtood by common readers. M. Clairaut, one of our beſt Geometricians, has carefully reviewed this Commentary, an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it was begun, and it is not to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the age, that it never was finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>At Cirey we cultivated all the arts; it was there I compoſed Alzire, Mérope, l'Enfant, Prodigue, and Mahomet. For her uſe I wrote an Eſſay on Univerſal Hiſtory, from the age of Charlemagne to the preſent. I choſe the epocha of Charlemagne, becauſe it was the point of time which Bouſſuet ſtopped at, and becauſe I durſt not again treat a ſubject alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy handled by ſo great a maſter.</p>
                     <p>Madame du Chàtelet, however, was far from ſatisfied with the Univerſal Hiſtory of this prelate; ſhe thought it eloquent only, and was provoked to find that the labours of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuet were all waſted upon a nation ſo deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the Jewiſh.</p>
                     <p>After having ſpent ſix years in this retreat, in the midſt of the arts and ſciences, we were
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:024210_0316_0FC56890B2780758"/>
obliged to go to Bruſſels, where the family of du Châtelet had long been embroiled in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit with the family of Honſbrouk.</p>
                     <p>Here I had the good fortune to meet with a grandſon of the illuſtrious and unfortunate Grand Penſioner De Wit, who was Firſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the Chamber of Accounts, and had one of the fineſt libraries in Europe, which was of great uſe to me in writing my Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>But I had a ſtill ſuperior happineſs at Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and which gave me infinite pleaſure. I terminated the law-ſuit, by an accommodation, in which the two families had been ruining each other with expences for near ſixty years, and gained two hundred and twenty thouſand livres paid in ready money to the Marquis du Châtelet.</p>
                     <p>While I remained at Bruſſels, and in the year 1740, the unpoliſhed King of Pruſſia, Frederic-William, the moſt intolerant of all Kings, and beyond contradiction the moſt fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and the richeſt in ready money, died at Berlin. His ſon, who has ſince gained ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular a kind of reputation, had then held a tolerable regular correſpondence with me above four years. The world never perhaps beheld a father and ſon who leſs reſembled each other than theſe two monarchs.</p>
                     <p>The father was an abſolute Vandel, who thought of no other thing, during his whole reign, than a maſſing of money, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the leaſt poſſible expence, the fineſt
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:024210_0317_0FC5689847144950"/>
ſoldiers in Europe. Never were ſubjects poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or King more rich. He bought up at a deſpicable price the eſtates of a great part of the Nobility, who ſoon devoured the little money they got for them, above half of which returned to the Royal coffers by means of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon conſumption. All the King's lands were farmed out to tax-gatherers, who held the double office of Exciſeman and Judge; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that if a landed tenant did not pay this collector upon the very day appointed, he put on his Judge's robe, and condemned the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in double the ſum. It muſt be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if this ſame Exciſeman and Judge did not pay the King by the laſt day of the month, the day following he was himſelf oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay double to the King.</p>
                     <p>Did a man kill a hare or lop a tree any where near the Royal domains, or commit any other peccadillo? he was inſtantly condemned to pay a fine. Was a poor girl found guilty of making a child? the father or the mother, or ſome other of the girl's relations, were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay his Majeſty for the faſhion.</p>
                     <p>The Baronneſs of Kniphauſſen, who at that time was the richeſt widow in Berlin, that is to ſay, ſhe had between three and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a year, was accuſed of having brought one of the King's ſubjects clandeſtinely into the world in the ſecond year of her widowhood. His Majeſty thereupon wrote her a letter, with his own hand, wherein he informed her it was
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:024210_0318_0FC56899D5256BF0"/>
neceſſary, if ſhe meant to ſave her honour, and preſerve her character, ſhe muſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſend him thirty thouſand livres (1250 l.) This ſum ſhe was obliged to borrow, and was ruined.</p>
                     <p>He had an Ambaſſador at the Hague, whoſe name was Luiſius; and certainly of all the Ambaſſadors that appertained to royalty, he was paid the worſt. This poor man, that he might be able to keep a fire, had cut down ſome trees in the garden of Hous-lardick, which then appertained to the Royal-houſe of Pruſſia. His next diſpatches brought him word that the King, his gracious Sovereign, had ſtopped on this account, a year's ſalary to defray his damages, and Luiſius, in a fit of deſpair, cut his throat with the only razor he had. An old valet, happening to come in, called aſſiſtance, and unhappy for him ſaved his life. I afterwards met with his Excellency at the Hague, and gave him alms at the gate of the Palace, which is called the Old Court, and which belonged to the King of Pruſſia, where this poor Ambaſſador had lived twelve years.</p>
                     <p>Turkey, it muſt be confeſſed, is a Republic, when compared to the deſpotiſm exerciſed by this Frederick-William.</p>
                     <p>It was by ſuch like means, only, that he could, in a reign of twenty-eight years, load the cellers of his Palace at Berlin with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty millions of crowns (fifteen
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:024210_0319_0FC5689CA3DDAFB8"/>
millions ſterling) all well caſked up in barrels, hooped with iron.</p>
                     <p>He took great pleaſure in furniſhing the grand apartment of the Palace whith heavy articles of maſſy ſilver, in which the worth of the workman ſurpaſſed not the ſterling of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He gave to the Queen his wife, in charge, that is, a cabinet, the contents of which, even to the coffee-pot, were all gold.</p>
                     <p>The Monarch uſed to walk from his Palace cloathed in an old blue coat, with copper but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, half way down his thighs, and when he bought a new one, theſe buttons were made to ſerve again. It was in this dreſs that his Majeſty, armed with a huge ſerjeant's cane, marched forth every day to review his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of giants. Theſe giants were his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delight, and the things for which he went to the heavieſt expence.</p>
                     <p>The men who ſtood in the firſt rank of this regiment were none of them leſs than ſeven feet high, and he ſent to purchaſe them from the farther parts of Europe to the borders of Aſia. I have ſeen ſome of them ſince his death.</p>
                     <p>The King, his ſon, who loved handſome, and not gigantic men, had given thoſe I ſaw to the Queen, his wife, to ſerve in quality of Heiduques. I remember they accompanied the old ſtate coach, which preceded the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Beauvan, who came to compliment the new King in the month of November, 1740. The late King Frederic-William, who
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:024210_0320_0FC5689D769B0100"/>
had formerly fold all the magnificent furniture left by his father, never could find a purchaſer for that enormous unguilt coach. The Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duques, who walked on each ſide to ſupport it, in caſe it ſhould fall, ſhook hands with each other over the roof.</p>
                     <p>After Frederic-William had reviewed his giants, he uſed to walk through the town, and every body fled before him full ſpeed. If he happened to meet a woman, he would demand why ſhe ſtaid idling her time in the ſtreets, and exclaim, "Go—get home with you, you lazy huſſy; an honeſt woman has no buſineſs over the threſhold of her own door;" which remonſtrance he would accompany with a hearty box on the ear, kick in the groin, or a few well applied ſtrokes on thee ſhoulders with his cane.</p>
                     <p>The holy Miniſters of the Goſpel were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo in exactly the ſame ſtyle, if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to take a fancy to come upon the parade.</p>
                     <p>We may eaſily imagine, what would be the aſtoniſhment and vexation of a Vandal, like this, to find he had a ſon endowed with wit, grace, and good breeding; who delighted to pleaſe, was eager in the acquiſition of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and who made verſes, and afterwards ſet them to muſic. If he caught him with a book in his hand, he threw it into the fire; or playing on the flute, he broke his inſtrument; and ſometimes treated his Royal Highneſs, as
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:024210_0321_0FC5689F194F4750"/>
he treated the ladies and the preachers when he met with them on the parade.</p>
                     <p>The Prince, weary of the attentions of ſo kind a father, determined one ſine morning, in 1730, to elope, without well knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would fly to France or England. Paternal economy had deprived him of the power of travelling in the ſtyle of ſon and heir to a farmer-general, or even an Engliſh tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and he was obliged to borrow a few hundred ducats.</p>
                     <p>Two young gentlemen, both very amiable, one named Kat, the other Keit, were to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him. Kat was the only ſon of a brave General Officer, and Keit had married the daughter of the ſaid Baroneſs of Kniphauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, who had paid the ten thouſand crowns about the child-making buſineſs before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The day and hour were appointed; the father was informed of the whole affair, and the Prince and his two travelling compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were all three put under arreſt.</p>
                     <p>The King believed at firſt, that the Princeſs Wilhelmina, his daughter, who was afterwards married to the Prince Margrave of Bareith, was concerned in the plot: and as he was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for diſpatch in the executive branch of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he proceeded to kick her out of a large window, which opened from the floor to the cieling. The Queen-Mother, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at this exploit, with great difficulty ſaved her, by catching hold of her petticoats at the
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:024210_0322_0FC568A0743C4C98"/>
moment ſhe was making her leap. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs received a contuſion on her left breaſt, which remained with her during life, as a mark of paternal affection, and which ſhe did me the honour to ſhew me.</p>
                     <p>The Prince had a ſort of miſtreſs, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ſchool-maſter, of the town of Brande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, who had ſettled at Potzdam. This girl played tolerably well upon the harpſicord, and the Prince accompanied her with his flute. He really imagined himſelf in love, but in this he was deceived; his avocation was not with the fair ſex. However, as he had pretended a kind of paſſion, the King, his father, thought proper that the damſel ſhould make the tour of Potzdam, conducted by the hangman, and ordered her to be whipped in preſence of his ſon.</p>
                     <p>After he had regaled him with this diverting ſpectacle, he made a transfer of him to the citadel of Cuſtrin, which was ſituated in the midſt of a marſh. Here he was ſhut up, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſingle ſervant, for the ſpace of ſix months, in a ſort of dungeon, at the end of which time he was allowed a ſoldier as an attendant.</p>
                     <p>This ſoldier, who was young, well made, handſome, and played upon the flute, had more ways than one of amuſing the royal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. So many fine qualities have made his fortune; and I have ſince known him, at once Valet de Chambre and firſt Miniſter, with all the inſolence which two ſuch poſts may be ſuppoſed to inſpire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="324" facs="unknown:024210_0323_0FC568A5AC87C7C0"/>The Prince had been ſome weeks in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at Cuſtrin, when one day an old officer, followed by four grenadiers, entered his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, weeping. Frederic had no doubt he was going to be made a head ſhorter; but the officer ſtill in tears, ordered the grenadiers to take him to the window, and hold his head out of it, that he might be obliged to look on the execution of his friend Kat, upon a ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold expreſsly built there for that purpoſe. He ſaw, ſtretched out his hand, and fainted. The father was preſent at this exhibition, as he had been at that of the girl's whipping-bout.</p>
                     <p>Keit, the other confidant, had fled into Holland, whither the King diſpatched his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary meſſengers to ſeize him. He eſcaped merely by a minute, embarked for Portugal, and there remained till the death of the moſt clement Frederic-William.</p>
                     <p>It was not the King's intention to have ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped there; his deſign was to have beheaded the Prince. He conſidered that he had three other ſons, not one of whom wrote verſes, and that they were ſufficient to ſuſtain the Pruſſian grandeur. Meaſures had been already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed to make him ſuffer, as the Czarovitz, eldeſt ſon to Peter the Great, had ſuffered before.</p>
                     <p>It is not exceedingly clear, from any known laws, human or divine, that a young man ſhould have his head ſtruck off, becauſe he had a wiſh to travel. But his majeſty had
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:024210_0324_0FC568A6A8A36588"/>
found judges in Pruſſia, equally as learned and equitable as the Ruſſian expounders of law. Beſides that his own paternal authority, in a caſe of need, would at any time ſuffice.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor Charles the Sixth, however, pretended that the Prince Royal, as a Prince of the Empire, could not ſuffer condemnation but in a full Diet; and ſent the Count de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kendorf to the father, in order to make very ſerious remonſtrances on that ſubject.</p>
                     <p>The Count de Sekendorf, whom I have ſince known in Saxony, where he lives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, has declared to me, it was with great difficulty indeed, that he could prevail with the King not to behead the Prince. This is the ſame Sekendorf who has commanded the armies of Bavaria, and of whom the Prince, when he came to the throne, drew a hideous portrait, in the hiſtory of his father, which he inſerted in ſome thirty copies of his Memoires dc Brandebourg<note n="*" place="margin">I gave the Elector Palatine the copy of this work, which the King of Pruſſia preſented to me.</note>. Who would not, after this, ſerve Princes, and prevent tyrants from cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their heads?</p>
                     <p>After eighteen months impriſonment, the ſolicitations of the Emperor, and the tears of the Queen, obtained the Prince his liberty; and he immediately began to make verſes, and write muſic more than ever. He read
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:024210_0325_0FC568A7F7DB54E8"/>
Leibnitz, and even Wolf, whom he called a compiler of traſh, and devoted himſelf to the whole circle of ſciences at once.</p>
                     <p>As the King, his father, ſuffered him to have very little to do with the national affairs, or as there rather, indeed, were no ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in a government the whole buſineſs of which was reviews, he emyloyed his leiſure in writing to thoſe men of letters in France, who were ſomething known in the world. Theſe letters were ſome in verſe, and others were treatiſes of metaphyſics, hiſtory, and politics. He treated me as a ſomething divine, and I him as a Solomon. Epithets coſt us nothing. They have printed ſome of theſe ridiculous things in a collection of my works, and happily they have not printed the thirtieth part of them. I took the liberty to ſend him an exceedingly beautiful ink-ſtand; he had the bounty to preſent me with a few gew-gaws of amber, and all the wits of the Pariſian coffee-houſes imagined with horror my fortune was made.</p>
                     <p>A young Courlander, named Keizerling, who was likewiſe a rhymer, and of courſe a favourite with Frederic, was diſpatched from the frontiers of Pomerania to us at Cirey. We prepared a feaſt for him, and I made a fine illumination, the lights of which compoſed the cypher, and name of the Prince Royal, with this device, l'Eſperance du genre humain:— "The hope of all nations."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="327" facs="unknown:024210_0326_0FC568ABF434FD80"/>For my own part, had I been inclined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge perſonal hopes, I had great reaſon ſo to do; for my Prince always called me his dear friend, in his letters, and ſpoke frequently of the ſolid marks of friendſhip which he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me as ſoon as he ſhould mount the throne.</p>
                     <p>The throne at laſt was mounted, while I was at Bruſſels, and he began his reign by ſending an Ambaſſador Extraordinary to France; one Camas, who had loſt an arm, formerly a French refugee, and then an officer in the Pruſſian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He ſaid that, as there was a miniſter from the French court at Berlin, who had but one hand, he, that he might acquit himſelf of all obligation towards the Moſt Chriſtian King, had ſent him an Ambaſſador with only one arm.</p>
                     <p>Camas, as ſoon as he arrived ſafe at his inn, diſpatched a lad to me, whom he had created his page, to tell me that he was too much fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued to come to my houſe, and therefore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged I would come to him inſtantly, he having the fineſt, greateſt, and moſt magnificent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that ever was preſented, to make me on the part of the King his maſter. Run—run as faſt as you can, ſaid Madame du Châtelet, he has aſſuredly ſent you the diamonds of the crown.</p>
                     <p>Away I ran, and found my Ambaſſador, whoſe only baggage was a ſmall keg of wine, tied behind his chaiſe, ſent from the cellar of
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:024210_0327_0FC568B0561CB888"/>
the late King by the reigning Monarch, with a royal command for me to drink. I emptied myſelf in proteſtations of aſtoniſhment and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for theſe liquid marks of his Majeſty's bounty, inſtead of the ſolid ones I had been taught to expect, and divided my keg with Camas.</p>
                     <p>My Solomon was then at Straſbourg; the whim had taken him while he was viſiting his long and narrow land, which extends from Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Baltic ocean, that he would come incognito to view the frontiers and troops of France. This pleaſure he enjoyed at Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, where he went by the name of Count du Four, a Lord of Bohemia. His brother, the Prince Royal, who was with him, had alſo his travelling title; and Algaroti, who already had attached himſelf to him, was the only one who went unmaſked.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty ſent me a hiſtory of his journey to Bruſſels, half verſe, half proſe, written in a taſte ſomething ſimilar to that of Bachau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont and Chapelle; that is to ſay, as ſimilar as a King of Pruſſia's could be ſuppoſed to be. The following are extracts from his letter.</p>

we may ſee by this letter, that he was not yet, become the beſt of all poſſible poets, and that his philoſophy did not look with total indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the metal of which his father had made ſuch ample proviſion.</p>
                     <p>From Straſburg he went to viſit his territories in the Lower Germany, and ſent me word he would come incognito to ſee me at Bruſſels. We prepared elegant apartments for him in the little Chateau de Meauſe, two leagues from Cleves. He informed me, he expected I ſhould make the firſt advances, and accordingly I went to pay him my moſt profound reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Maupertius, who had already formed his plan, having the mania of becoming Preſident of an Academy upon him, had preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and was lodged with Algaroti and Keizer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in one of the garrets of this palace. One ſoldier was the only guard I ſound. The Privy-Counſellor and Miniſter of State, Rambonet, was walking in the court-yard, blowing his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. He had on a pair of large dirty coarſe ruffles, a bat, all in holes, and an old judge's wig, one ſide of which hung into his pocket, and the
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:024210_0330_0FC568B673733808"/>
other ſcarcely touched his ſhoulder. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, this man was charged with a ſtate affair of great importance, and ſo indeed he was.</p>
                     <p>I was conducted into his Majeſty's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which I found nothing but four bare walls. By the light of a bougie, I perceived a ſmall truckle bed, two feet and a half wide, in a cloſet, upon which lay a little man, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in a morning gown of blue cloth. It was his Majeſty, who lay ſweating and ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beneath a beggarly coverlet, in a violent ague fit. I made my bow, and began my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance by feeling his pulſe, as if I had been his firſt phyſician.</p>
                     <p>The fit left him, and he roſe, dreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſat down to table with Algaroti, Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerling, Maupertius, the Ambaſſador to the States General, and myſelf; where at ſupper, we treated moſt profoundly on the immortality of the ſoul, natural liberty, and the Androgy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Plato.</p>
                     <p>While we were thus philoſophizing upon freedom, the Prevy-Counſellor Rambonet, was mounted upon a poſt-horſe, and riding all night towards Liege, at the gates of which he arrived the next day, where he proclaimed, with ſound of trumpet, the name of the King his maſter, while two thouſand ſoldiers from Veſel were laying the city of Liege under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution. The pretext for this fine expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was certain rights, which his Majeſty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:024210_0331_0FC568B873BA2C18"/>
to have over a part of the ſuburbs. It was to me he committed the taſk of drawing up the manifeſto, which I performed as well as the nature of the caſe would let me; never ſuſpecting that a King, with whom I ſupped, and who called me his friend, could poſſibly be in the wrong. The affair was ſoon brought to a concluſion, by the payment of a million of livres, which he exacted in good hard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, and which ſerved to defray the expences of his tour to Straſbourg, concerning which he complained ſo loudly in his poetic proſe epiſtle.</p>
                     <p>I ſoon felt my attachment to him, for he had wit, an agreeable manner, and was more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, a King; which is a circumſtance of ſeduction hardly to be vanquiſhed by human weakneſs. Generally ſpeaking, it is the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men of letters to flatter Kings; but in this inſtance, I was praiſed by a King, from the crown of my head to the ſole of my foot, at the ſame time that I was libelled, at leaſt once a week, by the Abbé Des Fontaines, and other Grub ſtreet poets of Paris.</p>
                     <p>Some time before the death of his father, the King of Pruſſia thought proper to write againſt the principles of Machiavel. Had Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel had a Prince for a pupil, the very firſt thing he would have adviſed him to do, would have been ſo to write. The Prince Royal, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was not maſter of ſo much fineſſe; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meant what he wrote; but it was before
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:024210_0332_0FC568BDCCD049E8"/>
he was a King, and while his father gave him no great reaſon to fall in love with deſpotic power. He praiſed moderation and juſtice with his whole ſoul; and in the ardour of his enthuſiaſm, looked upon all uſurpation as an abſolute crime.</p>
                     <p>This manuſcript he had ſent to me at Bruſſels, to have it corrected and printed; and I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made a preſent of it to a Dutch book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, one Venduren, one of the greateſt knaves of his profeſſion. I could not help feeling ſome remorſe, at being concerned in printing this Anti-Machiavelion book, at the very moment the King of Pruſſia, who had a hundred millions in his coffers, was robbing the poor people at Liege of another, by the hands of the Privy-Counſellor Rambonet.</p>
                     <p>I imagined my Solomon would not ſtop there. His father had left him ſixty-ſix thouſand four hundred men, all complete, and excellent troops. He was buſily augmenting them, and appeared to have a vaſt inclination to give them employment the very firſt opportunity.</p>
                     <p>I repreſented to him, that perhaps it was not altogether prudent to print his book juſt at the time the world might reproach him with having violated the principles he taught; and he permitted me to ſtop the impreſſion. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly took a journey into Holland, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do him this trifling ſervice; but the book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller demanded ſo much money, that his Majeſty, who was not, in the bottom of his
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:024210_0333_0FC568C0CB4642D0"/>
heart, vexed to ſee himſelf in print, was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed to be ſo for nothing, than to pay for not being ſo.</p>
                     <p>While I was in Holland, occupied in this buſineſs, Charles the Sixth died, in the month of October, 1740, of an indigeſtion, occaſioned by eating champignons, which brought on an apoplexy, and this plate of champignons chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the deſtiny of Europe. It was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident, that Frederic the third, King of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, was not ſo great an enemy to Machiavel as the Prince Royal appeared to have been.</p>
                     <p>Although he had then conceived the project of his invaſion of Sileſia, he did not the leſs neglect to invite me to his court; but I had before given him to underſtand I could not come to ſtay with him; that I deemed it a duty to prefer friendſhip to ambition; that I was attached to Madame du Châtelet; and that, between philoſophers, I loved a lady bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a King. He approved of the liberty I took, though for his own part he did not love the Ladies. I went to pay him a viſit in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and the Cardinal de Fleury writ me a long letter, full of praiſes of the Anti-Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and of the author, which I did not forget to let him ſee.</p>
                     <p>He had already aſſembled his troops, yet not one of his Generals or Miniſters could pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into his deſigns. The Marquis de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veau, who was ſent to compliment him on his
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:024210_0334_0FC568C2326473A0"/>
acceſſion, believed he meant to declare againſt France, in favour of Maria-Thereſa, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, and daughter of Charles the Sixth; and to ſupport the election of Francis of Lorraine, Grand Duke of Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and huſband of that Queen, to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſuppoſing he might thence derive great advantages.</p>
                     <p>I had more reaſon than any perſon to ſuppoſe, the new-crowned King of Pruſſia meant to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe this party; for three months before, he had ſent me a political diſſertation, after his manner wherein he conſidered France as the natural enemy and depredator of Germany. But it was conſtitutional with him to do the direct contrary of what he ſaid or wrote; not from diſſimulation, but becauſe he ſpoke and wrote with one kind of enthuſiaſm, and afterwards acted with another.</p>
                     <p>He departed on the 15th of December, with the quartan ague, for the conqueſt of Sileſia, at the head of thirty thouſand combatants, well diſciplined, and well accoutred. As he mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his horſe, he ſaid to the Marquis de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vau, Maria Thereſa's Miniſter, "I am going to play your game; ſhould the trumps fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hands, we will divide the winnings."</p>
                     <p>He has ſince that written the hiſtory of that conqueſt, and he ſhewed me the whole of it. Here follows one of the curious paragraphs, in the introduction to theſe annals, which I, in preference, carefully tranſcribed, as a thing unique in its kind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="336" facs="unknown:024210_0335_0FC568C452D912C0"/>"Add to the foregoing conſiderations, I had troops entirely prepared to act; this, the fulneſs of my treaſury, and the vivacity of my character, were the reaſons why I made war upon Maria-Thereſa, Queen of Bohemia and Hungary."</p>
                     <p>And a few lines after, he has theſe very words.</p>
                     <p>"Ambition, intereſt, and a deſire to make the world ſpeak of me, vanquiſhed all, and war was determined on."</p>
                     <p>From the time that conquerors, or fiery ſpirits that would be conquerors, firſt were, to the preſent hour, I believe he is the only one who has ever done himſelf thus much juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Never man, perhaps, felt reaſon more forcibly, or liſtened more attentively to his paſſions; but this mixture of a philoſophic mind, and a diſorderly imagination, have ever compoſed his character.</p>
                     <p>It is much to be regretted that I prevailed on him to omit theſe paſſages, when I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards corrected his works; a confeſſion ſo uncommon, ſhould have paſſed down to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and have ſerved to ſhew upon what motives the generality of wars are founded.</p>
                     <p>We authors, poets, hiſtorians, and acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mician declaimers, celebrate theſe fine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits; but here is a monarch who performs and condemns them.</p>
                     <p>His troops had already entered Sileſia, when his Miniſter at Vienna, the Baron de Gotter,
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:024210_0336_0FC568C76523C448"/>
made the very impolite propoſal to Maria-Thereſa, of ceding, with a good grace, to the Elector and King his maſter, three-fourths of that province: for which his Pruſſian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would lend her three millions of crowns, and make her huſband Emperor.</p>
                     <p>Maria-Thereſa, who at that time had neither troops, money, nor credit, was notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inflexible; ſhe rather choſe to riſk the loſs of all, than crouch to a Prince whom ſhe looked upon as the vaſſal of her anceſtors, and whoſe life the Emperor, her father, had ſaved. Her Generals could ſcarcely muſter twenty thouſand men. Marſhal Neuperg, who commanded them, forced the King of Pruſſia to give bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle under the walls of Neiſſe. The Pruſſian cavalry was at firſt put to the rout by the Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian; and the King, who was not accuſtomed to ſtand fire, fled at the firſt ſhock as far as Opeleim, twelve long leagues from the field of battle.</p>
                     <p>Maupertuis, who hoped to make his fortune in a hurry, was in the ſuit of the Monarch this campaign, imagining that the King would at leaſt find him a horſe. But this was not the royal cuſtom. Maupertuis bought an aſs for two ducats, on the day of battle, and fled with all his might after his Majeſty on aſs-back. This ſteed, however, was preſently diſtanced, and Maupertuis was taken and ſtripped by the Auſtrian huſſars.</p>
                     <p>Frederic paſſed the night on a truckle-bed,
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:024210_0337_0FC568CA8DC03BB0"/>
in a village alehouſe near Ratibor, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Poland, whence he was preparing to enter the northern part of his own dominions, when one of his horſemen arrived from the camp at Molwitz, and informed him he had gained the victory. This news was confirmed a quarter of an hour after by an Aid-de-Camp, and was true enough.</p>
                     <p>If the Pruſſian cavalry was bad, the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was the beſt in Europe; it had been under the diſcipline of the old Prince of Anhalt for thirty years. Marſhal Schwerin, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, was a pupil of Charles the Twelfth. He turned the fate of the day as ſoon as the King was fled. The next day his Majeſty came back to his army, and the conquering General was very near being diſgraced.</p>
                     <p>I returned to philoſophize in my retreat at Cirey, and paſſed the winter at Paris, where I had a multitude of enemies; for, having long before written the Hiſtory of Charles XII. preſented ſeveral ſucceſsful pieces to the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and compoſed an epic poem, I had, of courſe, all thoſe who write either in verſe or proſe as perſecutors; and as I had the audacity to write likewiſe on philoſophic ſubjects, I of neceſſity, according to ancient uſage, was treated as an atheiſt by all thoſe who are called devotees.</p>
                     <p>I was the firſt who dared develop to my countrymen, in an intelligible ſtyle, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the great Newton. The Carteſian
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:024210_0338_0FC568CBF30A40F0"/>
prejudices, which had taken place of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Peripatetics, were at that time ſo rooted in the minds of the French, that the Chancellor d' Agueſſeau regarded any man whatever who ſhould adopt diſcoveries made in England, as an enemy to reaſon and the ſtate. He never would grant a privilege that I might have my Elements of the Newtonian Philoſophy printed.</p>
                     <p>I was likewiſe a vaſt admirer of Locke; I conſidered him as the ſole reaſonable Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. Above all, I praiſed that moderation ſo new, ſo prudent, and at the ſame time ſo daring, where he ſays, we have not ſufficient knowledge to determine or affirm, by the light of reaſon, that God could not grant the gifts of thought and ſenſation to a being which we call Material.</p>
                     <p>The obſtinate malignity and intrepidity of ignorance, with which they ſet upon me on this article, cannot be conceived. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Locke had never occaſioned any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes in France before, becauſe the Doctors read St. Thomas Aquinas and Quênel, and the reſt of the world read Romances. As ſoon as I had praiſed this Author, they began to cry out againſt both him and me. The poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who were hotteſt in this diſpute, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew very little of either matter or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The fact is, we none of us know what or how we are, except that we are convinced we have motion, life, ſenſation, and thought,
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:024210_0339_0FC568CFD6C5F8A8"/>
but without having the leaſt conception of how we came by them. The very elements of matter are as much hidden from us as the reſt. We are blind creatures, that walk on, groping and reaſoning in the dark; and Locke was exceedingly right when he aſſerted, it was not for us to determine what the Almighty could or could not do.</p>
                     <p>All this, added to the ſucceſs of my theatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal productions, drew a whole library of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets down upon me, in which they proved that I was a bad Poet, an Atheiſt, and the ſon of a Peaſant.</p>
                     <p>A hiſtory of my life was printed, in which this genealogy was inſerted— An induſtrious German took care to collect all the tales of that kind, which had been crammed into the libels they had publiſhed againſt me. They had imputed adventures to me with perſons I never knew, and with others that never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted. I have found while writing this, a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Marſhal de Richelieu, which inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me of an impudent Lampoon, in which it was proved his wife had given me an elegant coach, with ſomething elſe, at a time when he had no wife.</p>
                     <p>At firſt I took ſome pleaſure in making a collection of theſe calumnies, but they multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to ſuch a degree I was obliged to leave off. Such were the fruits I gathered from my labours: I, however, eaſily conſoled myſelf; ſometimes in my retreat at Cirey, and at others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="341" facs="unknown:024210_0340_0FC568D4E2935950"/>While the refuſe of literature were thus making war upon me, France was doing the ſame upon the Queen of Hungary; and it muſt be owned, this war was equally unjuſt; for after having ſolemnly ſtipulated, guaranteed, and ſworn to the Pragmatic Sanction of the Emperor Charles VI. and the ſucceſſion of Maria-Thereſa to the inheritance of her father, and after having received Lorraine as the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of theſe promiſes, it does not appear very conſiſtent with the rights of nations to break an engagement ſo ſacred. The Cardinal de Fleury was perſuaded out of his pacific meaſures; he could not ſay, like the King of Pruſſia, it was the vivacity of his temper which occaſioned him to take arms. This fortunate Prelate reigned when he was eighty-ſix years of age, but held the reins of Government with a very feeble hand.</p>
                     <p>France was in alliance with the King of Pruſſia when he ſeized upon Sileſia. Two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were ſent into Germany at a time when Maria-Thereſa had none. One of theſe armies had penetrated to within five leagues of Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, without meeting a ſingle opponent. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia was given to the Elector of Bavaria, who was elected Emperor alſo, after having been created Lieutenant-General of the armies of the King of France. They ſoon, however, committed all the faults neceſſary to loſe the advantages they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

matured his courage, and gained ſeveral victories, concluded a peace with the Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Maria, to her infinite regret, gave him up the county of Glatz with Sileſia. Having, without ceremony, broke off his alliance with France on theſe conditions, in the month of June, 1342, he writ me word he had put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under a proper regimen, and ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viſe the other invalids to do the like.</p>
                     <p>This Prince was then at the height of his power, having one hundred and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men under his command accuſtomed to victory, and the cavalry of which he himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He drew twice as much from Sileſia as it produced to the Houſe of Auſtria, ſaw himſelf firmly ſeated in his new conqueſt, and was happy, while all the other contending powers were ſuffering the miſeries of depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.

                     <p>He now turned his attention to the embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of the city of Berlin, where he built one of the fineſt opera-houſes in Europe, and whither he invited artiſts of all denominations. He wiſhed to acquire glory of every kind, and to acquire it in the cheapeſt manner poſſible.</p>
                     <p>His father had reſided at Potzdam in a vile old houſe; he turned it into a palace. Potz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam became a pleaſant town; Berlin grew daily more extenſive; and the Pruſſians began to taſte the comforts of life, which the late King and entirely neglected. Several people

had furniture in their houſes, and moſt even wore ſhirts, for in the former reign ſuch things were little known. They then wore ſleeves and fore bodies only, tied on with pack thread, and the reigning Monarch had been ſo edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>

                     <p>CARDINAL de Fleury died the twenty-ninth of February, 1743, at the age of ninety. Never did man come to be Prime-Miniſter la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in life, and never did Prime-Miniſter keep his place ſo long. He began his career of good fortune at the age of ſeventy-three, by being King of France; and ſo he continued, indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, to the day of his death, always affecting the greateſt modeſty, never amaſſing riches, and without pomp, forming himſelf only to reign. He left the reputation of an artful and amiable perſon, rather than that of a man of genius, and was ſaid to have known the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of a court, better than the affairs of Europe.</p>
                     <p>I have often ſeen him at the houſe of Madam de Villeroi, when he was only the ancient
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:024210_0344_0FC568DBBAB5D8A0"/>
Biſhop of the little paltry town of Frejus, of which he was always called Biſhop by divine indignation, as may be ſeen in ſome of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Madame de Villeroi was an exceedingly ugly woman, whom he repudiated as ſoon as ever it was convenient. The Marſhal de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroi, her huſband, who knew not the Biſhop had long been the lover of his lady, prevailed on Louis XIV. to name him Prceptor to Louis XV. From Preceptor he became Prime-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and was not backward in contributing to the exile of his benefactor. Ingratitude ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, he was a tolerably good man; but, as he had no talents himſelf, he took care to drive away all thoſe who had, be they of what kind they would.</p>
                     <p>Several of the Academicians were deſirous I ſhould ſupply his place in the French Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. It was aſked at the King's ſupper, who ſhould pronounce the Cardinal's funeral orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the Academy? His Majeſty replied, it ſhould be me; the Dutcheſs of Chateauroux, his Miſtreſs would have it ſo; but the Count de Maurepas, Secretary of State, would not. He was bit with a fooliſh rage of quarrelling with all the Miſtreſſes of his Maſter, and found the effects of his diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>An old idiot, who was Preceptor to the Dauphin, formerly a Theatine Monk, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards biſhop of Mirepoix, named Boyer, undertook, for conſcience-ſake, to ſecond the caprice of M. de Maurepas. This Boyer having
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:024210_0345_0FC568DD44FA5A60"/>
the diſpoſal of the church livings, the King left all the affairs of the Clergy to his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This, in his opinion, came under the head of eccleſiaſtical matters; and he remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that it would be an offence againſt God, ſhould a prophane perſon, like me, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a Cardinal.</p>
                     <p>I knew that M. de Maurepas inſtigated him to act thus; I therefore went to this Miniſter, and told him, that though the honour of being an Academician was not a very important dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet, after having been appointed, it was a diſagreeable thing to be excluded. You are upon ill terms with the Dutcheſs de Chateaur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oux, with whom his Majeſty is in love, and likewiſe with the Duke de Richelieu, by whom ſhe is governed; but pray, my Lord, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion is there between theſe diſputes of your's, and a poor ſeat in the French Academy? I conjure you to tell me ſincerely, in caſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Chateauroux can vanguiſh the Biſhop de Mirepoix in this conteſt, will you remain neuter? —He ſeemed to collect himſelf for a moment, and then replied, "No; I ſhall cruſh you."</p>
                     <p>The Prieſt at length conquered the Miſtreſs, and I loſt my ſeat in the Academy, which did not give me much vexation; but I love to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect this adventure; it depicts ſo truly the little arts of thoſe whom we call the Great, and ſhews how really trifles are often conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them as very important matters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="347" facs="unknown:024210_0346_0FC568E3D12FB050"/>Public affairs, however, went on no better ſince the death of the Cardinal, than they had, done during the two laſt years of his life. The Houſe of Auſtria roſe from its aſhes into new life; France was preſſed hard by her and by England; and we had no reſource left but in the King of Pruſſia, who had led us into this war, and who abandoned us in our neceſſity. They conceived the deſign of ſending ſecretly to ſound the intentions of this Monarch, and try if he was not in a humour to prevent the ſtorm, which, ſoon or late, muſt gather at Vienna, and fall upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after having viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; to ſee therefore if he would not lend us a hundred thouſand men on this occaſion, and thus fix himſelf more firmly in the Sileſian conqueſt.</p>
                     <p>The Duke de Richelieu, and the Dutcheſs de Chateauroux firſt imagined this ſcheme, the King adapted it, and M. Amelot, Miniſter for Foreign Affairs, but in a very ſubaltern ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, was ſingly charged to haſten my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. A pretext was wanted, and I ſeized that of my diſpute with the old Biſhop of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repoix, which met with his Majeſty's approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I writ to the King of Pruſſia, that I could no longer endure the perſecutions of this Theatine Monk; and that I muſt take refuge with a King, who was a philoſopher, to eſcape the ſnare of a Biſhop, who was a bigot. This Prelate always ſigned himſelf l'anc, inſtead of Pancien, [the ancient] Biſhop of Mirepoix;
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:024210_0347_0FC568E591588D40"/>
and his writing being very bad, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> uſed conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nually to read and call him the aſs of Mirepoix. It was a ſubject of pleaſantry, and never was negociation more gay.</p>
                     <p>The King of Pruſſia, who ſtruck not with a palſied hand, when the blow was intended for the cheek of a Monk, or a Prelate become courtier, replied with a deluge of ſarcaſms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aſs of Mirepoix, and preſſed me to come.</p>
                     <p>I took great care, that both my letters and theſe anſwers ſhould be read. It ſoon came to the Biſhop's ears, and he went to complain to his Majeſty, that he was laughed at for a fool in a foreign court.</p>
                     <p>The King's anſwer was, it was a matter agreed on, and he muſt let it paſs without notice.</p>
                     <p>This anſwer has very little of the character of Louis XV. in it; and, as coming from him, always appeared to me extraordinary. Thus I had, at once, the pleaſure of revenging my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon a Biſhop, who had excluded me from the Academy, of taking a very agreeable jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and of having an opportunity to exert myſelf in the ſervice of the King and State. Even the Count de Maurepas entered into this project with warmth, becauſe at that time he governed M. Amelot, and conſidered himſelf, in fact, as the miniſter for foreign affairs.</p>
                     <p>The moſt ſingular part of this buſineſs was, that we were obliged to let Madame du Châ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telet
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:024210_0348_0FC568E6F2D79060"/>
into the ſecret. There was not, in her opinion, any thing in the world ſo unmanly, ſo abominable, as for a man to leave a woman to go and live with a King; and ſhe would have made a moſt dreadful tumult, had they not agreed, that to appeaſe her, ſhe ſhould be informed of the reaſon, and that the letters ſhould all paſs through her hands.</p>
                     <p>Whatever money I wanted for my journey, was given, upon my mere receipt, by M. de Monmartle, which power I took care not to abuſe. I ſtayed ſome time in Holland, while the King of Pruſſia was galloping, from one end of his territories to the other, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at reviews, and my ſtay at the Hague was not uſeleſs. I had apartments in the Palace de la Vicille Cour, which belonged at that time to the King of Pruſſia, in participation with the Houſe of Orange. His envoy, the young Count de Padvitz, loved, and was beloved by the lady of one of the principal perſons among their High Mightineſſes; and he obtained from her, copies of all their ſecret reſolutions, which at that time, were very prejudicial to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of France. Theſe copies I ſent to our court, and my ſervice was found very accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>When I came to Berlin, his Majeſty would lodge me in the Palace, as he had done on my fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If you wiſh to know the royal ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, what they were on great, and what on common occaſions, the functions of his high Almoner, his great Chamberlain, the firſt Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, and his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen uſhers, I anſwer, a ſingle lacquey came to light his ſire, dreſs, and ſhave him, though he partly dreſſed himſelf alone. His chamber was rather beautiful; a rich baluſtrade of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ornamented with little loves, of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly good ſculpture, ſeemed to form the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cove of the ſtate-bed, the curtains of which were ſeen; but behind theſe curtains, inſtead of a bed there was a library; and as to the royal bed, it was compoſed of a ſtump bed-ſtead without ſacking, but croſs corded, and a ſlight mattreſs, the whole concealed by a ſcreen. Marcus Aurelius and Julian, the two greateſt men among the Romans, and Apoſtles of the Stoics, lay not on a harder couch.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as his Majeſty was dreſſed and boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Stoiciſm, for a few moments, gave place to Epi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed: theſe were either Lieutenants, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, Pages, Heiduques, or young Cadets. Coffee was brought in, and he to whom the handkerchief was thrown, remained ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes tête à tête with his Majeſty. Things were not carried to the laſt extremity, becauſe, while Prince, in his father's life time, he had been very illy treated for, and effectually cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of love, in his amours de paſſade<note n="*" place="bottom">Of once and away.</note>. He could not play principal, and was obliged to content himſelf with the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſchool-boy ſports being over, the ſtate affairs next were conſidered, and his firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter came with a large bundle of papers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his arm. This firſt Miniſter was a clerk, with lodged up two-pair-of-ſtairs in the houſe of Frideſdorff, and was the ſoldier, now valet de chambre and favourite, who had formerly ſerved the King at Cuſtrin. The Secretaries of State ſent all the diſpatches to the King's Clerk, who brought extracts to his Majeſty, and the King writ his anſwer in the margin in two words. The whole affairs of the Kingdom were expedited in an hour, and ſeldom did the Secretaries of State, or the Miniſters in office, come into his preſence; nay, there were ſome to whom even he had never ſpoken. The King, his father, had put the finances under ſuch exact regulations, all was executed in ſuch a military manner, and obedience was ſo blind, that four hundred leagues were governed with as much eaſe as a manor.</p>
                     <p>About eleven o'clock, the King, booted, reviewed in his garden his regiment of guards; and at the ſame hour all the Colonels did the like throughout the provinces, in the interval of parade and dinner-time. The Princes his brothers, the General Officers, and one or two

of his Chamberlains, eat at his table, which was as well furniſhed as could be expected in a country where they had neither game, tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable butcher's meat, nor poultry, and where they got all their wheat from Magdebourg.</p>
                     <p>When dinner was over, he retired to his cabinet, and writ verſes till five or ſix o'clock; a young man of the name of Darget, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Secretary to M. de Valory, the French En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, then came and read to him. At ſeven he had a little concert, at which he played the flute, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                        </gap>poſitions were often among the pieces played, for there was no art he did not culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; and had he lived among the Greeks, he would not, like Epaminondas, have had the mortification to confeſs he did not underſtand muſic.</p>
                     <p>They ſupped in a little hall; the moſt ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ornament of which was a picture, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of which he himſelf gave to Pene, his paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and one of our beſt colouriſts. The ſubject was totally Priapian. Turtles billing, young men in the embraces of young women, nymphs beneath ſatyrs, cupids at laſcivious ſports, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fainting with deſire at beholding them, and rams and goats at ſimilar paſtimes. The ſupper was frequently ſeaſoned with the ſame kind of philoſophy; and any perſon who had hêard the diſcourſe, and looked at this picture, would have ſuppoſed they had caught the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sages of Greece in a brothel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="353" facs="unknown:024210_0352_0FC568EE2D4F7108"/>Never was there a place in the world where liberty of ſpeech was ſo fully indulged, or where the various ſuperſtitions of men, were treated with ſo great a degree of pleaſantry and contempt. God was reſpected, bur thoſe who in his name had impoſed upon credulity, were not ſpared. Neither women nor prieſts ever entered the palace; and, in a word, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric lived without religion, without a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and without a court.</p>
                     <p>Some of the provincial Judges were about to burn a poor devil of a Peaſant, accuſed of an intrigue of a ſhocking nature. No perſon, however, is executed in the Pruſſian domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons till Frede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The King wrote at the bottom of the ſentence, that free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of opinion, and of ******* were allowed throughout his Territories.</p>
                     <p>A Miniſter, near Stettin, thought this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence exceedingly ſcandalous, and let fall ſome expreſſions in a ſermon upon Herod, which glanced at the King; he was therefore ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appear before the Conſiſtory at Potz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, though, in fact, there was no more a Conſiſtory at Court than there was a Maſs. The poor man came. The King put on a band and ſurplice. M. d'Argens, Author of the Jewiſh Letters, and one Baron de Polnitz, who had changed his religion three or four times, dreſſed themſelves up in the ſame manner. A
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:024210_0353_0FC568EFCC23F8A0"/>
folio volume of Bayle's Dictionary was placed upon the table by way of a Bible, and the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prit was introduced by two grenadiers, and ſet before theſe three Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>My brother, ſaid the King, I demand, in the name of the Moſt High God, who the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod was, concerning whom you preached? He who ſlew the children, replied the ſimple Prieſt. But was this Herod the firſt? ſaid the King; for you ought to know there have been ſeveral Herods. The Prieſt was ſilent; he could not anſwer this queſtion. How! continued the King, have you dared to preach about Herod, and are ignorant both of him and his family? You are unworthy of the holy miniſtry. We ſhall pardon you for this time, but know we ſhall excommunicate you if ever you dare hereafter preach againſt any one whom you do not know.</p>
                     <p>They then delivered his ſentence and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to him, ſigned by three ridiculous names invented on purpoſe. We ſhall go to morrow to Berlin, added the King, and we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand forgiveneſs for you of our brotherhood. Do not fail to come and find us out. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Prieſt went, and enquired for theſe three labourers in the goſpel vineyard all over Berlin, where he was laughed at; but the King, who had more humour than liberality, forgot to reimburſe him for the expences of his journey.</p>
                     <p>Frederic governed the church with as much
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:024210_0354_0FC568F33B678500"/>
deſpotiſm as the ſtate. He pronounced the divorces himſelf when huſband and wife want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pair themſelves differently. A Miniſter one day cited the Old Teſtament on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of divorces, and the King told him, Moſes managed the Jews juſt as he pleaſed; as for me, I muſt govern my Pruſſians to the beſt of my abilities.</p>
                     <p>This ſingularity of government, theſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſtill more ſingular, this contract of Stoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and Epicurianiſm, of ſeverity in military diſcipline, and effeminacy in the interior of the palace, of Pages with whom he amuſed himſelf in his cloſet, and of Soldiers who ran the gauntlet ſix and thirty times, while the monarch beheld them through his window, under which the puniſhment was inflicted, of reaſoning on ethics, and of unbridled licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, formed, altogether, a heterogeneous picture, which, till then, few had known, and which has ſince ſpread through Europe.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt economy of every kind was obſerved at Potzdam; the King's table, and that of his officers and domeſtics, were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated at thirty-three crowns (about four gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas) a day, excluſive of wine. Inſtead of the Officers of the Crown taking charge of this expence, as at other courts, it was his valet de chambre Frideſdorff, who was at once his High Steward, Great Cup-bearer, and Firſt Pantler.</p>
                     <p>Whether it was from policy or economy, I
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:024210_0355_0FC568F67A428530"/>
know not, but he never granted the leaſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to any of his former favourites, eſpecially to thoſe who had riſked their lives for him when he was Prince Royal. He did not even pay the money he borrowed at that time. Like as Louis XII. would not revenge the affronts of the Duke d'Orleans, neither would the King of Pruſſia remember the debts of the Prince Royal.</p>
                     <p>His poor miſtreſs, who had ſuffered whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for his ſake by the hands of the common hangman, was married at Berlin to the Clerk of the Hackney-Coach office; for they had eighteen hackney-coaches at Berlin; and her royal lover, allowed her a penſion of ſeventy crowns (eight pounds fifteen ſhillings) a year. She called herſelf Mademoiſelle Saumers, and was a tall, meagre figure, very like one of the Sybils, without the leaſt appearance of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be publicly whipped for a Prince.</p>
                     <p>When, however, he was at Berlin, he made a great diſplay of magnificence on public days. It was a ſuperb ſpectacle for the vain, that is to ſay, for almoſt all mankind, to ſee him at table, ſurrounded with twenty Princes of the Empire, ſerved in veſſels of gold, the richeſt in Europe, by two and thirty Pages, and as many young Heiduques, all ſplendidly cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bearing diſhes of maſſy gold. The State Officers were alſo employed on theſe occaſions, though unknown at any other time.</p>
                     <p>After dinner they went to the Opera at the
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:024210_0356_0FC568F79D95D658"/>
large Theatre, three hundred feet long, which had been built without an Architect by one of his Chamberlains, whoſe name was Knoberſtoff. The fineſt voices and beſt dancers were engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſervice. Barberini at that time dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at his Theatre, the ſame who has ſince been married to the ſon of his Chancellor. The King had her carried off by his ſoldiers from Venice, and brought even through Vienna as far as Berlin. He was a little in love with her, becauſe ſhe had legs like a man; but the thing in moſt of all incomprehenſible, was, that he gave her a ſalary of thirty two thouſand livres (above thirteen hundred pounds.) His Italian Poet, who was obliged to put the operas into verſe, of which the King himſelf gave the plan, had little more than a thirtieth part of this ſum; but it ought to be remembered, he was very ugly, and could not dance. In a word, Barb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rini touched for her ſhare more than any three of his Miniſters of State toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>As for the Italian Poet, he one day took care to pay himſelf with his own hands, for he ſtript off the gold from the ornaments in an old chapel of the firſt King of Pruſſia's; on which occaſion Frederic remarked, that as he never went to the chapel, he had loſt nothing. Beſides, he had lately written a diſſertation in favour of thieves, which is printed in the collections of his academy; and he did not think proper this time to contradict his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by his actions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="358" facs="unknown:024210_0357_0FC568F8F9DC1688"/>This indulgence was not extended to any military being. There was on old gentleman of Franche Comté, confined in the priſon of Spandau, who was ſix feet high, and whom the late King, for that reaſon, had inveigled into Pruſſia. They promiſed him the place of Chamberlain, and gave him that of foot ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. This poor man ſoon after deſerted with one of his comrades, bat was taken and brought before the late King. He had the ſimplicity to tell him, he repented of nothing but that he had not ſtabbed ſuch a tyrant; and for this anſwer he had his noſe and ears cut off, ran the gauntlet ſix and thirty times, and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſent to wheel the barrow at Spandau. He continued this employment to the very time that M. de Valory, our Envoy, preſſed me to beg remiſſion for him of the moſt clement ſon of the moſt iron-hearted Frederic-William.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty had been pleaſed to ſay, it was to oblige me that he had got up an Opera, full of poetical beauties, and written by the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Meteſtaſio, called La Clemenza di Tito. The King, with the aſſiſtance of his compoſer, had ſet it to muſic himſelf. I took this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to recommend the poor old French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, without noſe and ears, to his bounty, which I did in the following admonitory verſes.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>The requeſt was ſomething daring, but one may ſay what one will poetically. His Majeſty promiſed remiſſion, and ſome months after even had the bounty to ſend the poor gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in queſtion to the Hoſpital, at three pence a day, which favour he had refuſed to the Queen, his mother; but ſhe, in all probability, had aſked only in proſe.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of all theſe feaſts, operas, and ſuppers, my ſecret negociation went forward; the King was willing I ſhould ſpeak on every thing, and I frequently took occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix queſtions concerning France and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria with the Eneid and Roman Hiſtory. The converſation was ſometimes animated; the King became warm, and would tell me, that while our Court was knocking at every door to procure peace, he ſhould not think it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to go to war in our defence. I ſent my reflexions upon paper, left half blank, from my apartment to his; and he anſwered my daring remarks in the margin. I have this paper ſtill, in which I have ſaid,</p>
                     <p>Can it be doubted that the Houſe of Auſtria will ſeize the very firſt opportunity to rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Sileſia? to which he anſwerd in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

                     <p>This new kind of negociation finiſhed by a diſcourſe, in which, in one of his moments of vivacity, he made me againſt the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, his dear Uncle. Theſe two Kings did not love one another. My Pruſſian Monarch told me, "George was the Uncle of Frederic, but not of the King of Pruſſia;" and he ended by ſaying, "Let France declare war againſt England, and I will march."</p>
                     <p>This was all I wanted. I returned inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to France, and I gave an account of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; with ſuch hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> with a hundred thouſand men, while the Auſtrians were in Alſatia.</p>
                     <p>Had I related my adventure to any good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſian, with the ſervice I had done the ſtate, he would not have made the leaſt doubt of my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been promiſed an excellent place. I will tell you what was recompenſe. The Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs de Chateauroux was vexed the negociation had not been brought about entirely by her means; ſhe had likewiſe an inclination to have M. Amelot turned out becauſe he ſtuttered
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:024210_0360_0FC568FF0ADAFDE0"/>
which trifling defect ſhe found offenſive, and ſhe farther hated him becauſe he was governed by M. de Maurepas; he was accordingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed eight days after, and I was included in his diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>It happened ſome time after this, that Louis XV. fell extremely ill at the City of Metz. This was the time for M. de Maurepas and his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal to ruin the Dutcheſs de Chateauroux. The Biſhop of Soiſſons, Fitz-James, ſon of the baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of James II. who was thought a ſaint, would, in quality of Grand Almoner, convert the King; and declare he would neither grant him abſolution, nor ſuffer him to communicate, if he did not drive his Miſtreſs, with her Siſter the Dutcheſs of Laurigais, and their friends from court; and the two Siſters in conſequence departed, with the execrations of the people of Metz.</p>
                     <p>This action of Louis XV. was the occaſion that the Pariſians, equally ſtupid with the good folks of Metz, gave him the ſurname of Bien-Aimé, Well beloved. A fellow named Vadé firſt invented this title, which all the Almanacs echoed. As ſoon as the Prince recovered, he deſired only to be the well-beloved of his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, for whom he found his affection increaſe; and ſhe was again going to undertake her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, when ſhe died ſuddenly, in conſequence of the paſſions into which ſhe had been thrown by her diſmiſſion. She was preſently forgot.</p>
                     <p>A Miſtreſs was now wanted, and the choice
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:024210_0361_0FC569007938F8B8"/>
fell upon the Demoiſelle Poiſſon. She was the daughter of a kept woman and a countryman, who lived at La Fertéſous-Jouare, and who had amaſſed ſome money by ſelling wheat to the corn factors. This poor man at that time had abſconded, having been condemned for malverſation, and they had married his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the under Farmer general le Normand, Lord of Etiole, and Nephew of the Farmer-general le Normand, of Tourneham, who kept her mother. The daughter had been well educated, was prudent, amiable, very graceful, had great talents, a fine underſtanding, and a good heart.</p>
                     <p>I was tolerably intimate with her, and was even the confidant of her amours. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to me, ſhe had always had a ſecret fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought that the King would fall in love with her, and that ſhe had always ardently wiſhed he might, without making her wiſhes too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. This idea which ſeems ſo chimerical for a perſon in her ſtation, originated from her having been often taken to the royal hunt in the foreſt of Senar. Tourneham, her mother's lover, had a country houſe near there, and uſed to take her out to air in a neat Calaſh. His Majeſty had obſerved her, and had often ſent her veniſon. Her mother never ceaſed telling her ſhe was handſomer than Madame de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teauroux, and the good man Tourneham con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it in raptures. It muſt be owned, the daughter of Madame Poiſſon was a morſel for
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:024210_0362_0FC56901F75C6CA0"/>
Majeſty. After ſhe was certain of her Royal Lover, the told me ſhe was firmly perſuaded of the doctrine of predeſtination, and ſhe had ſome cauſe ſo to be. I paſſed ſeveral months with her at Etiole, while the King made the campaign of 1746.</p>
                     <p>I hence obtained rewards which had never been granted to my works or my ſervices. I was deemed worthy to be one of the forty uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Members of the Academy, was appointed Hiſtoriographer of France, and created by the King one of the Gentlemen in Ordinary of his Chamber. From this I concluded it was better, in order to make the moſt trifling fortune, to ſpeak four words to a King's miſtreſs than to write a hundred volumes.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as I had the appearance of a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man, the whole brotherhood of the Beaux-Eſprits of Paris was let looſe upon me, with all the inveterate animoſity which might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, againſt a perſon who obtained thoſe benefactions, which they imagined only due to their own merits.</p>
                     <p>My connexion with Madame du Châtelet was never interrupted; our friendſhip, and our love of literature, were unalterable; we lived together both in town and out of town. Cirey is ſituated upon the borders of Lorraine, and King Staniſlaus at that time kept his little agreeable court at Luneville. Old and fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic as he was, he yet had a friendſhip with a lady who was neither. His affections were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between Madame da Marquiſe de Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers,
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:024210_0363_0FC56908263CB628"/>
and a Jeſuit, whoſe name was Menou; a Prieſt, the moſt daring, the moſt intriguing I have ever known.</p>
                     <p>This man had drawn from King Staniſlaus, by means of his Queen, whom he had govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, about a million of livres, (near forty-two thouſand pounds) part of which were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in building a magnificent houſe for himſelf and ſome Jeſuits of Nancy. This houſe was endowed with twenty-four thouſand livres, or a thouſand pounds a year; half of which ſupplied his table, and the other half was to give away to whom he pleaſed. The King's miſtreſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Omit the word Miſtreſs, it is falſe, and inſert Friend. The Marchioneſs de Boufflers was a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted friend, and ſeldom uſed her intereſt but in the ſervice of her friends; and the expreſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to buy her petticoats, is not at all applicable.</note> was not by any means ſo well treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d; ſhe ſcarcely could get from his Poliſh Majeſty wherewith to buy her petticoats; and yet the Jeſuit envied what ſhe had, and was violently jealous of her power. They were at open war<note n="†" place="bottom">
                           <p>Madame de Boufflers never was at varience with Father Menou, who, all-intriguing as he was, never thought of giving Staniſlaus Madame du Châtelet for a miſtreſs. That lady, and M. de Voltaire, never were at Luneville, except when invited by M. de B***, whom they often viſited, and found very ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; they never went as to the King of Poland. If Menou really propoſed the journey to Voltaire and Madame du Châtelet, it was when he was informed they were coming, and to make a merit of it with the King.</p>
                           <p>The two laſt notes are by M. de St. Lambert, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a Poem on the Seaſons.</p>
                        </note>, and the poor King had enough to
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:024210_0364_0FC5690984BA9240"/>
do every day when he came from maſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile his miſtreſs and his confeſſor. Our Jeſuit at laſt having heard of Madame du Châ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telet, who was exceedingly well ſhaped, and ſtill tolerably handſome, conceived the project of ſubſtituting her to Madame de Boufflers.</p>
                     <p>Staniſlaus amuſed himſelf ſometimes in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little works, which were bad enough, and Menou imagined an authoreſs would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with him as a miſtreſs better than any other. With this fine trick in his head he came to Cirey, cajoled Madame du Châtelet, and told us how delighted King Staniſlaus would be in our company. He then returned to the King, and informed him how ardently we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to come and pay our court to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. Staniſlaus aſked Madame de Boufflers to bring us; and we went to paſs the whole year, 1749, at Luneville. But the projects of the holy Jeſuit did not ſucceed; the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe took place; we were devoted to Madame de Boufflers, and he had two women to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat inſtead of one.</p>
                     <p>The life led at the court of Lorraine was tolerably agreeable; though there, as in other courts, there were plenty of intrigues and artifice.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of the year, Poncet, Biſhop of Troyes, who was overwhelmed with debts, and whoſe reputation was loſt, wiſhed to come and augment our intrigues and artifice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="366" facs="unknown:024210_0365_0FC5690BCF8E3938"/>When I ſay he had loſt his reputation, I mean alſo the reputation of his ſermons and funeral orations. He obtained, through the intereſt of our two ladies, the place of Grand-Almoner to the King, who was flattered by having a Biſhop in his pay, and at very ſmall wages too. This Prelate did not come till 1750: he began his career by intriguing againſt Madame de Boufflers, his benefactreſs, and was diſmiſſed. His anger alighted on Lewis XV. the ſon-in-law of Staniſlaus: being returned to Troyes, he would needs play a part in the ridiculous farce of the confeſſional billets, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Beaumont, Arch biſhop of Paris: he made head againſt the parliament, and braved the King. This was not the way to pay his debts, but to get himſelf impriſoned. Lewis ſent him into Alſatia, and had him ſhut up in a convent of fat German Friars.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt return to what concerns myſelf. Madame du Châtelet died in the palace of Staniſlaus, after two days illneſs; and we were ſo affected, that not one of us ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered to ſend for Prieſt, Jeſuit, or any of the Seven Sacraments. It was we, and not Madame du Châtelet, who felt the horrors of death. The good King Staniſlaus came to my chamber, and mixed his tears with mine: few of his brethren would have done ſo much on a like occaſion. He wiſhed me to ſtay at Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neville, but I could no longer ſupport the place, and returned to Paris.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="367" facs="unknown:024210_0366_0FC5690D55170470"/>It was my deſtiny to run from King to King, although I loved liberty even to idolatry. The King of Pruſſia, whom I had frequently given to underſtand I would never quit Madame du Châtelet for him, would abſolutely entrap me, now he was rid of his rival. He enjoyed at that time a peace, which he had purchaſed with victory; and his leiſure hours were always devoted to making verſes, or writing the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of his country campaigns. He was well convinced, that in reality his verſe and proſe too, were ſuperior to my verſe and proſe, as to their eſſence; though as to the form, he thought there was a certain ſomething, a turn, that I, in quality of Academician, might give to his writings; and there was no kind of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, no ſeduction, he did not employ to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me to come.</p>
                     <p>Who might reſiſt a Monarch, a Hero, a Poet, a Muſician, a Philoſopher, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too to love me, and whom I thought I alſo loved. I ſat out once more for Potzdam, in the month of June, 1750. Aſtolphus did not meet a kinder reception in the palace of Alcina. To be lodged in the ſame apartments that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal Saxe had occupied; to have the royal cooks at my command, when I choſe to dine alone; and the royal coachmen, when I had an inclination to ride, were trifling favours.</p>
                     <p>Our ſuppers were very agreeable. I know not if I am deceived, but I think we had a deal of wit. The King was witty, and gave
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:024210_0367_0FC5690EC7C0C978"/>
occaſion to wit in others; and what is ſtill more extraordinary, I never found myſelf ſo much at eaſe. I worked two hours a day with his Majeſty, corrected his works, and never failed highly to praiſe whatever was worthy of praiſe, although I rejected the droſs. I gave him details of all that was neceſſary in rhetoric and criticiſm, for his uſe; he profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my advice, and his genius aſſiſted him more effectually than my leſſons.</p>
                     <p>I had no court to make, no viſits to pay, no duty to fulfil; I led the life of liberty, and had no conception of any thing more happy than my then ſituation. My Frederic-Alcina, who ſaw my brain was already a little diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, redoubled the potions that I might be totally inebriated. The laſt ſeduction was a letter he wrote, and ſent from his apartments to mine. A Miſtreſs could not have written more tenderly; he laboured in his epiſtle to diſſipate the fear which his rank and character had inſpired; it contained theſe remarkable words:</p>
                     <p>"How is it poſſible I ſhould bring unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the man I eſteem, who has ſacrificed his country, and all that humanity holds dear, to me? I reſpect you as my Maſter, and love you as my friend. What ſlavery, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, what change can be feared, in a place where you are eſteemed as much as in your own country, and with a friend who has a grateful heart? I reſpected the friendſhip that endeared you to Madame du Châtelet, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:024210_0368_0FC56910D609E820"/>
her I am one of your oldeſt friends. I give you my promiſe you ſhall be happy here as long as I live."</p>
                     <p>Here is a letter, ſuch as few of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties write: it was the finiſhing glaſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete my drunkenneſs. His wordy proteſtations were ſtill ſtronger than his written ones. He was accuſtomed to very ſingular demonſtrations of tenderneſs to younger favourites than I, and forgetting for a moment I was not of their age, and had not a fine hand, he ſeized it and imprinted a kiſs; I took his, returned his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and ſigned myſelf his ſlave.</p>
                     <p>It was neceſſary I ſhould get permiſſion from the King of France to belong to two Maſters: the King of Pruſſia took charge of every thing, and wrote to aſk me of Louis. I never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined they were ſhocked at Verſailles, that a Gentleman in Ordinary of the Chamber, one of the moſt uſeleſs Beings of a Court, ſhould become a uſeleſs Chamberlain at Berlin. They granted me full permiſſion, but were highly piqued, and did not pardon me. I greatly diſpleaſed the King of France without pleaſing the King of Pruſſia, who laughed at me in the bottom of his heart.</p>
                     <p>Behold me then with a ſilver key gilt with gold hanging at my button-hole, a croſs round my neck, and twenty thouſand livres, or eight hundred guineas a year. Maupertuis fell ſick, and yet I did not perceive the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>At that time there was a Phyſician at Berlin,
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:024210_0369_0FC5691561D0F3B0"/>
one La Metrie, who was the moſt frank and declared Atheiſt of all the medical people of Europe. He was a gay, pleaſant, thoughtleſs fellow, who knew the theory of phyſic as well as the beſt of his brethren, but without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction the worſt practitioner upon earth, for which reaſon he had left the profeſſion. He ridiculed the whole faculty of Paris, and had even written many perſonalities againſt individuals, which they could not pardon; and they obtained a decree againſt him, by which a reward was offered for his apprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>La Metrie had, in conſequence, fled to Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, where he amuſed himſelf ſufficiently by his gaiety, and likewiſe by writing and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that can be imagined moſt impudent upon manners; his books pleaſed the King, who made him, not his Phyſician, but, his Reader.</p>
                     <p>One day after the lecture, La Metrie, who ſpoke whatever came uppermoſt, told his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty there were perſons exceedingly jealous of my favour and fortune.—"Be quiet a while," ſaid Frederic, "we ſqueeze the orange, and throw it away when we have ſwallowed the juice."—La Metrie, did not forget to repeat to me this fine apophthegm, worthy Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius of Syracuſe. From that time I determined to take all poſſible care of the orange peel. I had about twelve thouſand guineas to place out at intereſt, but was determined it ſhould not be in the territories of my Alcina. I found an advantageous opportunity of lending them
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:024210_0370_0FC56917B66BBB70"/>
upon the eſtates which the Duke of Wurtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg poſſeſſed in France.</p>
                     <p>The King, who opened all my letters, did not doubt of my intention to quit his court. The furor of rhyming, however, ſtill poſſeſſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> him, as it did Dionyſius, I was obliged conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to pore, and again reviſe his Hiſtory of Brandenbourg, and all the reſt of his works.</p>
                     <p>La Metrie died from having eaten a paſty ſtuffed with truffles, after a very hearty dinner at the table of Lord Tyrconnel, Envoy from France, It was pretended he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed before his death. The King was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly vexed at this, and took care to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly informed concerning the truth of the aſſertion; they aſſured him it was an atrocious calumny, for La Metrie had died as he lived, abjuring God and Phyſicians. His Majeſty was convinced, and immediately compoſed his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral oration, which was read, in his name, at a public ſitting of the Academy, by Darget his Secretary. He ſettled five and twenty pounds a year likewiſe upon a girl of the town, whom La Metrie had brought from Paris, where he had left his wife and children.</p>
                     <p>Maupertuis, who knew the anecdote of the orange-peel, took an opportunity to ſpread a report, that I had ſaid, the place of King's Atheiſt was vacant. This calumny did not ſucceed; but he afterwards added I had alſo ſaid, the King's poetry was bad; and this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="372" facs="unknown:024210_0371_0FC5691B9CF70230"/>From this time forward, I found the King's ſuppers were no longer ſo merry; I had few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er verſes to correct, and my diſgrace was complete.</p>
                     <p>Algaroti, Darget, and a Frenchman, whoſe name was Chaſol, one of the King's beſt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, left him all at once. I was preparing to do the ſame, but I wiſhed, before I went, to enjoy the pleaſure of laughing at a book Maupertuis had juſt printed. It was the beſt of opportunities, for never had any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo ridiculous or abſurd. The good man ſeriouſly propoſed to travel directly to the two Poles; to diſſect the heads of giants, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the nature of the ſoul by the texture of the brain; to build a city, and make the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants all ſpeak Latin; to ſink a pit in the center of the earth; to cure the ſick by plaiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering them over with gum-reſin; and, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to propheſy, by enthuſiaſtically inflating the fancy.</p>
                     <p>The King laughed, I laughed, every body laughed at his book; but there was a ſcene acting at that time of a far more ſerious nature, concerning I know not what mathematical nonſence that Maupertuis wanted to eſtabliſh as diſcoveries. A more learned Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Koënig, Librarian to the Princeſs of Orange at the Hague, ſhewed him his miſtake, and that Leibnitz, who had before time examined that old idea, had demonſtrated its falſity in ſeveral of his letters, copies of which he ſent Maupertuis.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="373" facs="unknown:024210_0372_0FC5691CF826D508"/>Maupertuis, Preſident of the Academy at Berlin, enraged that an aſſociate and a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould prove his blunders, took care firſt to perſuade the King, that Koënig, being ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in Holland, was of courſe his enemy; and next, that he had ſaid many diſreſpectful things of his Majeſty's verſe and proſe to the Princeſs of Orange.</p>
                     <p>This precaution taken, he ſuborned ſome few poor penſioners of the Academy, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, had Koënig condemned as a forger, and his name eraſed from the number of Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicians. Here however he was anticipated, for Koënig had ſent back his Patent-Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mician-Dignity to Berlin.</p>
                     <p>All the men of letters in Europe were as full of indignation at the manoeuvres of Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis as they were weary of his book, and he obtained the contempt and hatred even of thoſe who did not underſtand the diſpute. They were obliged to content themſelves at Berlin with a mere ſhrug of the ſhoulders; for the King had taken a part in this unfortunate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, no perſon durſt ſpeak. I was the only one who ſpoke out. Koënig was my friend; and I had at once the ſatisfaction to defend the liberty of the learned, the cauſe of a friend, and of mortifying an enemy, who was as much the enemy of moderation as of me.</p>
                     <p>I had no intention to ſtay at Berlin; I had always preferred liberty to every thing; few men of letters have a proper ſenſe of it; moſt

of them are poor; poverty enervates, and even philoſophers, at court, become as truly ſlaves as the firſt Officer of the Crown. I felt how diſpleaſing my free ſpirit muſt be to a King more abſolute than the Grand Turk. He was a pleaſant Monarch, in the receſſes of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, we muſt confeſs: he protected Mauper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis. and laughed at him more than any one. He writ againſt him, and ſent his manuſcript to my chamber by one Marvitz, a Miniſter of his ſecret pleaſures; he turned to ridicule the Pit to the center of the earth, the method of cure with Plaiſter of gum-reſin, the voyage to the South Pole, the Latin city, and the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice of the Academy, in having ſuffered the the tyranny exerciſed upon poor Koënig. But his motto was, "No clamour when I don't cry;" and he had every thing burnt that had been written upon the controverſy, except his own work.</p>
                     <p>I ſent him back his order, his Chamberlain's key, and his penſion; he then did every thing in his power to make me ſtay, and I every thing in my power to depart. He again gave me his croſs and his key, and would have me to ſup with him; I therefore once more ſupped like Democles, after which I parted with a promiſe to return, but with a firm deſign ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſee him more.</p>
                     <p>Thus there were four of us who had eſcaped in a ſhort time, Chaſol, Darget, Algaroti, and I; in fact, there was no ſuch thing as
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:024210_0374_0FC569224ED4E7D0"/>
ſtaying. It is well known how much muſt be borne from Kings, but Frederic was too free in the abuſe of his prerogative. All ſociety has its laws, except the ſociety of the Lion and the Lamb. Frederic continually failed in the firſt of theſe laws; which is, to ſay nothing diſobliging to any of the company. He often uſed to aſk his Chamberlain Polnitz, if he would not willingly change his religion a fourth time, and offered to pay a hundred crowns down for his converſion. "Good God, my dear Polnitz, he would ſay, I have forgot the name of that perſon at the Hague, whom you cheated by ſelling him baſe for pure ſilver; let me beg of you to aſſiſt my memory a little." He treated poor d'Argenes in much the ſame way; and yet theſe two victims remained. Polnitz having waſted his fortune, was obliged to ſwallow ſerpents for bread, and had no other food; and d'Argens had no property in the world, but his Jewiſh Letters, and his wife, called Cochois, a bad provincial actreſs, and ſo ugly ſhe could get no employment at any trade, though ſhe practiſed ſeveral. As for Maupertuis, who had been ſilly enough to place out his money at Berlin, and not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hundred piſtoles better in a free coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try than a thouſand in a deſpotic one, he had no choice but to wear the ſetters which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had forged.</p>

                     <p>LEAVING my palace of Alcina, I went to paſs a month with the Dutcheſs of Saxe-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, the beſt of Princeſſes, full of gentleneſs, diſcretion, and equanimity, and who, God be thanked, did not make verſes. After that I ſpent a few days at the country-houſe of the Landgrave of Heſſe, who was ſtill a remove father from poetry than the Princeſs of Gotha. Thus I took breath, and thence continued, by ſhort journies, my rout to Franckfort, where a very odd kind of deſtiny was in reſerve for me.</p>
                     <p>I fell ill at Franckfort, and one of my nieces, the widow of a Captain who had belonged to the regiment of Champagne, a moſt amiable woman, with excellent talents, and who, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, was eſteemed at Paris as belonging to
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:024210_0376_0FC5692788CEDA30"/>
the Order of Good Company, had the courage to quit that city, and come to me on the Maine, where ſhe found me a priſoner of war.</p>
                     <p>This fine adventure happened thus: one Freïtag, who had been baniſhed Dreſden, after having been put in chains and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the wheel-barrow, became afterwards an agent to the King of Pruſſia, who was glad to be ſerved by ſuch-like Miniſters, becauſe they aſked no wages but what they could ſteal from travellers.</p>
                     <p>This Ambaſſador, and one Schmitt, a tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, formerly condemned and puniſhed for coining, ſignified to me, on the part of his Majeſty the King of Pruſſia, that I muſt not depart from Franckfort, till I had given back the precious effects I had carried off from his Majeſty. "My very good Meſſieurs (ſaid I) I have brought nothing out of that country, I can aſſure you, not even the leaſt regret; what, then, are theſe famous jewels of the crown of Brandenbourg, that you thus re-demand?"— "Dat it be, Montſeer (anſwered Freïtag) ouf dey vurks ouf poeſy ouf de King mine maſter." —"Oh! (anſwered I) with all my heart; he ſhall have his works in verſe and proſe, though I have more titles to them than one, for he made me a preſent of a fine copy, printed at his own expence; but, unfortunately for me, this printed copy is at Leipſic, with my other effects."</p>
                     <p>Freïtag then propoſed that I ſhould ſtay at
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:024210_0377_0FC5692B768663A8"/>
Franckfort till this treaſure arrived from Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, and ſigned the following curious quittance:</p>
                     <p>Montſeer ſo ſoon as ſhawl dey great pack come ouf Leipſic, mit de vurks ouf poeſy be given mit me, you ſhawl go ouf vere you do pleaſe. Given at Franckfort de vurſt of June, 1753.—Freïtag, Reſident ouf de King mine maſter.</p>
                     <p>At the bottom of which I ſigned,—Good, vor dey vurks ouf poeſy ouf de King your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:—With which the Reſident was well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
                     <p>On the twelfth of June the great pack of poeſy came, and I faithfully remitted the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred depoſit, imagining I might then depart, without offence to any crowned head; but at the very inſtant when we were ſetting off, I, my Secretary, my ſervants, and even my niece, were arreſted. Four ſoldiers dragged us through the midſt of the dirt, before M. Schmitt, who had I know not what right of Privy. Counſellor to the King of Pruſſia. This Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort trader thought himſelf at that moment a Pruſſian General; he commanded twelve of the town guards, with all the importance and grandeur an affair of ſuch conſequence requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. My niece had a paſſport from the King of France, and, moreover, never had correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King of Pruſſia's verſes. Women are uſually reſpected amidſt the horrors of war, but the Counſellor Schmitt, and the Reſident Freïtag, endeavoured to pay their court to
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:024210_0378_0FC5692CC25171E0"/>
Frederic, by hauling one of the fair ſex through the mud. They ſhut us up in a kind of inn, at the door of which the twelve ſoldiers were poſted. Four others were placed in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, four in the garret, where they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted my niece, and four in a ſtill wore wretched garret, where my Secretary was laid upon ſtraw. My niece, it is true, was allowed a ſmall bed, but four ſoldiers, with fixed bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onets, ſerved her inſtead of curtains and chamber-maids.</p>
                     <p>In vain we urged we had been invited to the court the Emperor had elected at Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; that my Secretary was a Florentine, and a ſubject of his Imperial Majeſty; that I and my niece were ſubject of the moſt Chriſtian King; and that there was no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the Margrave of Brandenbourg. They informed us, that the Margrave had more power at Franckfort than the Emperor.</p>
                     <p>Twelve days were we held priſoners of war, for which we paid a hundred and forty crowns, or ſeventeen pounds ten ſhillings a day. The Merchant Schmitt had ſeized on all my effects, which were given back one half lighter: one need not wiſh to pay dearer for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oeſy of the King of Pruſſia. I loſt about a much as it had coſt him to ſend for me and to take leſſons, and we were quits at parting.</p>
                     <p>To complete the adventure, one Venduren, a Bookſeller at the Hague, knave by profeſſion, and bankrupt by habit, was then retired to
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:024210_0379_0FC5692E87362548"/>
Franckfort. This was the man to whom I had made a preſent thirteen years before of Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric's manuſcript of the Anti-Machiavel. One finds friends where one leaſt expects them. He pretended that his Majeſty owed him ſome twenty ducats, for which I was reſponſible: he reckoned the intereſt, and the intereſt of the intereſt. The Sieur Friliard, a Burgo-maſter of Franckfort, in the then year of his reign, ſaid, he, as a Burgo-maſter, found the account exceedingly right; he likewiſe found the means to make me diſburſe thirty ducats, ſix and twenty of which he took to himſelf, and gave the remaining four to the honeſt Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Oſtrogothian and Vandalian affairs being all thus ſatisfactorily ended, I embraced my hoſts, thanked them for their kind recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and departed.</p>
                     <p>Some time after I want to drink the waters of Plombieres, and with them drank heartily of the waters of Lethe, from a thorough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, that misfortunes of all kinds are good for nothing but to be forgotten. My niece, Madame Dennis, who was the conſolation of my life, attached to me by her taſte for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the tendereſt friendſhip, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me from Plombieres to Lyons. Here I was received by the acclamations of the whole city, and tolerably ill too by the Cardinal de Tencin, Archbiſhop of Lyons, ſo well known by the manner in which he had made his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:024210_0380_0FC5692FBB5C80B0"/>
that is, in making the famous Law, or Laſs, Author of the ſyſtem that ruined France, a Catholic. His Council of Embrin finiſhed the fortune his converſion of Law had begun. This ſyſtem made him rich enough to purchaſe a Cardinal's hat. He was a Miniſter of State, and told me in confidence, he durſt not give me a public dinner becauſe the King of France was vexed that I had quitted him for the King of Pruſſia. To this I anſwered I never dined, and as to Kings or Cardinals, I was the man who perhaps of any in the world was ſooneſt determined how to act.</p>
                     <p>I had been adviſed to drink the waters of Aix, in Savoy, and though this place was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of a King, I proceeded to take the journey. I neceſſarily paſſed through Geneva, where the famous Phyſician Tronchin was juſt eſtabliſhed, and who declared that the waters of Aix would kill, but that he would cure me, and I followed his advice. No Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic is permitted to ſettle at Geneva, nor yet in the Swiſs Proteſtant Cantons; and it was to me a ſubject of pleaſantry, to aconite domains in the only country upon earth where it was forbidden I ſhould have any.</p>
                     <p>I bought, by a very ſingular kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, of which there was no example in that country, a ſmall eſtate of about ſixty acres, which they ſold me for about twice as much as it would have coſt me at Paris; but pleaſure is never too dear. The houſe was pretty and
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:024210_0381_0FC5693140FAFDE8"/>
commodious, and the proſpect charming; it aſtoniſhes without tiring: on one ſide is the Lake of Geneva, and the city on the other. The Rhone runs from the former in vaſt guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, forming a canal at the bottom of my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, whence is ſeen the Arve deſcending from the Savoy Mountains, and precipitating itſelf into the Rhone, and farther ſtill another river. A hundred country-ſeats, a hundred delightful gardens, ornament the borders of the lakes and rivers. The Alps at a vaſt diſtance riſe and terminate the horizon, and among their prodigious precipices, twenty leagues extent of mountain are beheld covered with eternal ſnows.</p>
                     <p>I had another good houſe, with a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive view, at Lauſanne; but a ſeat near Geneva is much more agreeable. In theſe two habitations I enjoyed what Kings do not give, or rather what they take away, Liberty and Eaſe. I likewiſe had what they ſometimes do give, and what I had not of them. Here then I put my own precepts in practice.</p>
                     <p>How happy did I live in this iron age! Every convenience of life and good cheer were found in my two houſes. An affable and intelligent ſociety, filled up the moments which ſtudy and the care of my health left va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. My proſperity was ſufficient to make my dear fellow-labourers in literature burſt with envy. I was not however born rich, and it may be aſked by what art I could acquire
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:024210_0382_0FC56932B780B1C8"/>
wealth enough to live like a Farmer-general: to which I anſwer, and I would have others make me their example, I had ſeen ſo many men of letters poor and deſpiſed, that I had long determined not to augment the number.</p>
                     <p>In France, every man muſt be either the hammer or the anvil, and I was born the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A ſmall patrimony daily becomes leſs, becauſe the price of every thing gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, and becauſe government often has both rent and crop.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary to be attentive to every al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration which Miniſtry, ever in want and ever inconſtant, makes in the finances. There always are occaſional opportunities by which an individual may profit without obligation to any one, and nothing is ſo agreeable as to be one ſelf the founder of one's fortune. The firſt efforts are a little painful, the following are pleaſant; and he who is an economiſt in his youth, will be ſurpriſed in old age at his own wealth, which is the time when fortune is moſt neceſſary. It was then I enjoyed fortune: it was then that, after having lived with Kings, I became a King myſelf.</p>
                     <p>And now, while living in this peaceable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulence, and the moſt rigid independence, the King of Pruſſia thought proper to be appeaſed: in 1755 he ſent me an Opera he had made from my Tragedy of Merope, which was, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſpute, the worſt thing he ever wrote. From that time he continued to write to me:
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:024210_0383_0FC56936D04F9D08"/>
I always had held a correſpondence with his ſiſter, the Margraveſs of Bareith, whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards me was unalterable.</p>
                     <p>Thus while I, in my retreat, enjoyed the moſt pleaſant life imaginable, I had the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic ſatisfaction of ſeeing, that the Kings of Europe taſted not of my tranquillity; and of thence inferring, that the ſituation of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual is often preferable to that of the greateſt Kings, as will preſently be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>In 1756, England made a piratical war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on France for ſome acres of ſnow; at the ſame time that the Empreſs Queen of Hungary appeared very deſirous to recover her dear Seliſia, of which ſhe had been pillaged by his Majeſty of Pruſſia. For this purpoſe ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociated with the Empreſs of Ruſſia and the King of Poland, that is, in quality of Elector of Saxony, for nobody negociates with the Poles. On the other hand, the King of France wiſhed to revenge himſelf upon Hanover, for the miſchief which the Elector of Hanover, the King of England, did him at ſea. Frederic, who at that time was in alliance with France, and who held our government in the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found contempt, preferred an alliance with England; he therefore united himſelf with the houſe of Hanover, imagining he could keep the Ruſſians out of Pruſſia with one hand, and the French out of Germany with the other. He was miſtaken in both theſe imaginings; but their was a third in which he was not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; which was to invade Saxony under
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:024210_0384_0FC569386BA1EC00"/>
pretext of friendſhip, and make war upon the Empreſs Queen of Hungary with the money he ſhould rob the Saxons of. The Marquis of Brandenbourg, by this remarkable manoeuvre, ſingly changed the whole ſyſtem of Europe. The King of France, deſirous of retaining him in his alliance, ſent the Duke de Nivernois, a man of wit, and who made very pretty verſes, into Pruſſia. The embaſſage of a Duke, a Peer, and a Poet, ſeemed likely to flatter the vanity and taſte of Frederic; but he laughed at the King of France, and ſigned his treaty with England, the very day the Embaſſador arrived. He played off the Duke and the Peer very happily, and made an epigram upon the Poet.</p>
                     <p>It happened at that time to be the privilege of poetry to govern kingdoms. There was another Poet at Paris alſo, a man of rank, very poor, but very amiable; in a word, the Abbé de Bernis, ſince Cardinal. He began by writing verſes againſt me; he afterwards was my friend, though that was of little ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him; but he likewiſe became the friend of Madame de Pompadour, and ſhe ſerved him effectually. He had been ſent from Parnaſſus on an embaſſy to Venice; and he was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Paris, and in great credit.</p>
                     <p>The King of Pruſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> had glided a verſe in his poor book of poeſy, which that Freïtag had re-demanded ſo earneſtly at Franckfort, againſt the Abbé de Bernis.</p>

                     <p>I do not believe either the book or the verſe ever reached the Abbé; but as God is juſt, God made him an inſtrument to avenge France of Frederic. The Abbé concluded an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and defenſive treaty with M. de Starem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, the Auſtrian Ambaſſador, in deſpight of Rouillé, then Miniſter for Foreign affairs. Madame de Pompadour preſided at the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation; and Rouillé was obliged to ſign the treaty, in conjunction with the Abbé de Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, which was a precedent without example. Rouillé, it muſt be owned, was the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Secretary of State the King ever had; and moreover, the moſt ignorant the Long Robe ever knew. He aſked one day if Wete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia was in Italy. While there was nothing difficult to tranſact, he was ſuffered; but as ſoon as great objects came on the tapis, his inſufficiency was felt, and the Abbé de Bernis ſupplied his place.</p>
                     <p>Mademoiſelle Poiſſon, the wife of Le Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and Marchioneſs de Pompadour, was in reality firſt Miniſter of State.

The court of France, that pretended to cruſh Auſtria, in 1741, ſupported her in 1756; and in concluſion, France, Sweden, Ruſſia, Hungary, the half of Germany, and the Fiſcal of the Empire, all declared againſt the ſingle Marquis of Brandenbourg. This Prince, whoſe grandfather could ſcarcely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain twenty thouſand men, had an army of a hundred thouſand foot, and forty thouſand horſe, well provided, well ſelected, and better diſciplined; but there were four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men in arms to oppoſe theſe. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in that war, that each party ſeized upon what was next at hand. Frederic took Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony; France took the territories of Frederic, from the town of Guilders to Minden upon the Weſer, and for a while poſſeſſed all the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torate of Hanover and Heſſe, the allies of Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric; while the Empreſs of Ruſſia took the whole of Pruſſia. The King of Pruſſia, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at firſt by the Ruſſians, beat the Auſtrians, and was afterwards beaten by them in Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, the eighteenth of June, 1757.</p>
                     <p>The loſs of one battle ought apparently to have cruſhed this Monarch; preſſed on all ſides by the Ruſſians, French and Auſtrians, he himſelf gave all for loſt. Marſhal de Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu had juſt concluded a treaty near Stadt, with the Hanoverians and Heſſians, which greatly reſembled that of the Caudian Forks. Their army was no longer allowed to ſerve, and the Marſhal was ready to enter Saxony

with ſixty thouſand men: the Prince de Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſe prepared to penetrate it on another ſide, with thirty thouſand, and was to be ſeconded by the arms of the circles of the empire, whence they were to march to Berlin. The Auſtrians had gained a ſecond victory, and were already in poſſeſſion of Breſlau; and one of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals had even puſhed to Berlin, and laid it under contribution. The treaſury of the King of Pruſſia was nearly exhauſted, and in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance he would not long have a ſingle vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage left. They were going to put him under the ban of the empire; his proceſs was begun; he was declared a rebel, and had he been tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, in all probability would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to loſe his head.</p>
                     <p>In this extremity he took a fancy to kill himſelf. He wrote to his ſiſter, the Margra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſs of Bareith, that he was going to terminate his life; but he could not conclude the play without rhyming. His paſſion for poetry was ſtill ſtronger than his hatred of life; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wrote the Marquis d' Argens a long epiſtle in verſe, wherein he informed him of his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and bade him adieu.</p>
                     <p>However ſingular this epiſtle may be, from the ſubject, the perſon by whom it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the perſon to whom it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, it cannot be tranſcribed entirely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the many repetitions; but there are paſſages, which I will inſert, tolerably well turned for a Northern King.</p>

He waited on the fifth of November, 1757, for the French and Imperial army, in a tolerably advantageous poſt at Roſbach, on the frontiers of Saxony; and as he had been continually talking of killing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was willing his brother, Prince Henry,
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:024210_0391_0FC569492D067958"/>
ſhould perform this promiſe for him, at the head of five Pruſſian battalions, which were to ſuſtain the firſt ſhock of the enemy, while his artillery thundered upon them, and his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry attacked theirs.</p>
                     <p>Prince Henry was, in fact, ſlightly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the neck by a muſket ball, and I believe was the only Pruſſian hurt on that day.

                     <p>The fatal affair at Roſbach, occaſioned all France to murmur at the treaty of the Abbé de Bernis, with the court of Vienna. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal de Tencin, Archbiſhop of Lyons, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways maintained his rank of Miniſter of State, and a private correſpondence with the King of France and he was, more than any one, a verſe to the Auſtrian alliance. He had given me a reception at Lyons, which he had a right to believe was not very ſatisfactory; the itch of intriguing, however, which followed him in his retreat, and which, it is ſaid, never leaves men in place, made him deſirous of leaguing with me to engage the Margraveſs of Bareith to treat with him, and put the intereſts of her brother in his hands. He would reconcile the King of Pruſſia to the King of France, and hoped to procure a peace. It was not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to perſuade Madame de Barieth, and the King her brother, to this negociation; and I undertook it with the greater alacrity, becauſe I foreſaw it could not ſucceed. The Margra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſs
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:024210_0393_0FC5694E928C0C00"/>
wrote to Frederic, and the letters between her and the Cardinal paſſed through my hands. I had the ſecret ſatisfaction of being the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediator in that grand affair; and perhaps a ſtill farther pleaſure, that of foreſeeing the Cardinal was preparing for himſelf a ſubject of great diſappointment. He wrote to the King of France, and incloſed the letter of the Margraveſs; but how utter was his aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at receiving a laconic anſwer from the King by which he learnt, the Secretary for Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Affairs would inform him what was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's pleaſure. The Abbé de Bernis dictated the anſwer which the Cardinal was obliged to ſend to Frederic; which anſwer was an entire refuſal to negociate. He was forced to ſign a copy of this letter, by which every thing was ended, and died of chagrin in about a fortnight afterwards.</p>
                     <p>I never could thoroughly underſtand this kind of death, or how Miniſters of State, and old Cardinals with hardended ſouls, ſhould have a ſufficient degree of ſenſibility to die through ſome trifling diſguſt.

They had ſtipulated with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal de Richelieu not to bear arms againſt us, but to repaſs the Elbe, beyond which they had been ſent; they, however, broke their bargain of the Caudian Forks, as ſoon as they knew we had been beaten at Roſbach. Deſertion, the want of diſcipline, and diſeaſe, deſtroyed our armies; and the reſult of all our opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the ſpring of 1758, was, that we had loſt twelve millions and a half ſterling, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand men in Germany, in ſupport of Maria-Tereſa, as we had done in 1741 with fighting againſt her.</p>
                     <p>The King of Pruſſia, who had beaten our army at Roſbach, in Thuringia, went next to fight the Auſtrian army at ſixty leagues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

                     <p>I left writing memoirs of myſelf on the 6th of November, 1759, thinking them as uſeleſs as Bayle's letters to his mother; the life of St. Evremont, written by Defmaiſeaux, or of the Abbé Mongon, written by himſelf.

I behold from my windows the city where John Chauvin, the Picard, called Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, reigned; and the place where he burnt Servet for the good of his ſoul. Almoſt all the prieſts of this country think at preſent like Servet; nay they even go farther. They do not believe that Jeſus Chriſt was God; and theſe Meſſieurs, who formerly gave no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to purgatory, are now ſo far humaniſed, as to find favour for ſouls in hell. They pretend their torments ſhall not be eternal; that The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus ſhall not always ſit upon his ſtony chair, nor Syſiphus continue everlaſtingly to roll his rock. Thus they have turned their hell, in
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:024210_0396_0FC569582F59C3E0"/>
which they no longer believe, into purgatory, in which alſo they do not believe. This is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a pleaſant revolution in the hiſtory of the human mind, and might furniſh diſputes enough for the cutting of throats, making of bonfires, and acting St. Bartholomew's day once more. And yet they do not even call names, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach one another, ſo much are manners changed. I muſt indeed except myſelf, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Only obſerve the contradictions of this world; here are people almoſt avowedly ſectaries of Servet, who, yet, abuſe me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I found Calvin wrong for burning him at a flow fire of green faggots.</p>
                     <p>They would prove to me in form, that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin was a good Chriſtian, and petitioned the Council of Geneva to communicate the papers uſed on the trial of Servet; but the Council was more prudent; the papers were refuſed, and they forbidden to write againſt me in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva. I look upon this little triumph, as one of the ſtrongeſt proofs of the progreſs of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in our age.</p>
                     <p>Philoſophy enjoyed a ſtill more ſignal victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over its enemies at Lauſanne. Some Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſters of that country thought proper to compile, I know not what bad book againſt me, for the honour, as they called it, of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; and I, with little difficulty, was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:024210_0397_0FC56958FAE73170"/>
to ſeize and ſuppreſs the impreſſion by authority of the Magiſtrates. This was perhaps the firſt time Theologians have been obliged to be ſilent, and reſpect a Philosopher. Judge then if I ought not paſſionately to love this country. Yes, thinking beings, I aſſert it is exceedingly agreeable to live in a republic where you may ſay to its chiefs,—Come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow and dine with me.</p>
                     <p>I did not, however, yet think myſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free; and as I held this a ſubject worthy attention, that I might become ſo, I purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome adjoining lands in France. There were two eſtates about a league from Geneva, which had formerly enjoyed all the privileges of that city; and I had the good fortune to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Brevet from the King by which thoſe privileges were continued to me. At laſt I ſo managed my deſtiny that I was independent in Switzerland, the territories of Geneva, and in France. I have heard much of liberty, but do not believe there is an individual in Europe who had wrought his own freedom like me. Let thoſe who will, follow my example; or, rather, thoſe who can.</p>
                     <p>I certainly could not have choſen a better time than this, to enjoy repoſe far from Paris. They were then as mad and inveterate about their private diſputes as in the days of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, except having actually a civil war. But as they had neither a Monarch of the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, like the Duke de Beaufort, nor a Co-adjutor,
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:024210_0398_0FC5695A74B846E0"/>
granting benedictions with a dagger, they proceeded only to wordy wars. They began by forging bank bills for the other world, invented as I have already ſaid by Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Archbiſhop of Paris, an obſtinate man, who did evil with all his heart, and from an exceſs of zeal. He was a ſerious fool, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſtyle of St. Thomas à Becket. The quarrel grew more violent concerning an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the hoſpital, the appointment to which the Parliament pretended was in them; and the Archbiſhop holding it to be a ſacred place, ſaid it depended totally on the church. Paris was all divided into parties, and the trifling factions of Janſeniſts and Moliniſts did not ſpare each other. The King thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to treat them as they ſome times ſerve fools who fight in the ſtreet, over whom they throw buckets of water to part them: he very rightly ſaid they were both wrong; but they remained not the leſs enveno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>d. He exiled the Archbiſhop and the Parliament; but a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould not turn off his ſervants, till he is certain of finding others to ſupply their places. The Court was obliged to recall the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe a Chamber, called royal, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Counſellors of State, and Maſters of Requeſts, and erected to determine Law-ſuits, had loſt its practice. The Pariſians had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a fancy not to plead before any Court of Juſtice, except that called the Parliament. All the members therefore were recalled, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:024210_0399_0FC7470476C65E90"/>
they had gained a ſignal victory over the King. They paternally adviſed him in their remonſtrances no more to baniſh his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe, ſaid they, that is giving a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad example. They proceeded to ſuch lengths at laſt, that the King reſolved to aboliſh one of their Chambers, and diminiſh the others; and, ſoon after, theſe Meſſieurs all had their diſmiſſion, except thoſe of the great Chamber. Loud murmurs now went abroad; they publicly declaimed againſt the King, and the fire which came out of their mouth unhappily caught the brain of a Lackey, named Damiens, who often frequented the great Hall. It is proved, by the proceſs, this fanatic of the long robe never intended to kill the King, but only to inflict a gentle correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is nothing ſo abſurd which may not enter the head of man. This poor wretch had been uſher to the Jeſuit's College, where I have ſometimes ſeen the ſcholars give ſlight ſtabs with their penknives, and the uſhers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them. Damiens, therefore, went to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaills with this reſolution, and there, in the midſt of his cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>They did not fail during the firſt horror of the accident, to impute the blow to the arm of the Jeſuits, to whom, ſaid they, it belonged according to ancient uſage. I have red a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from one father Griffet, in which he ſays, This time it was not us; it is at preſent the
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:024210_0400_0FC74711BAF2AAF0"/>
turn of Meſſieurs. It was of courſe the office of the Grand Prevot of the Court to judge the aſſaſſin, becauſe the crime had been committed within the precincts of the palace. The cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prit began by accuſing ſeven members of the Court des Enquètes, and they wiſhed nothing better than to leave this accuſation upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and execute the criminal. Thus the King rendered the Parliament odious, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an advantage which will endure as long as the monarchy.</p>

                     <p>IT was thought, that M. d'Argenſon adviſed the King to grant the Parliament permiſſion to judge the foregoing affair, and he was well rewarded; for eight days after he loſt his place, and was exiled. The king had the weakneſs to grant large penſions to the Counſellors who conducted the trial of Damiens, as if they had rendered him ſome ſignal and difficult ſervice; which conduct inſpired them with new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. They again imagined themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant perſonages, and their chimeras of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the nation, and being tutors to Kings, were once more awakened.</p>
                     <p>This ſcene over, and having nothing elſe to do, they amuſed themſelves with perſecuting the philoſophers. Omer Joli de Fleury, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate general of the Parliament of Paris, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played a triumph the moſt complete, that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, deceit, and hypocriſy ever obtained.
<pb n="403" facs="unknown:024210_0402_0FC5677C5BD4F060"/>
Several men of letters, moſt eſtimable from their learning and deportment, formed an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation to compoſe an immenſe dictionary of whatever could enlighten the human mind, and it became on object of commerce with the bookſellers. The Chancellor, the Miniſtry, all encouraged an enterpriſe ſo noble; ſeven volumes had already appeared, and were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into Engliſh, Italian, German, and Dutch. This treaſure, opened by the French to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, might be conſidered as what did us at that time the moſt honour; ſo much were the excellent articles in the Encyclopedia ſuperior to the bad, which were alſo tolerably nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. They had little to complain of in the work, except too many puerile declamations unfortunately adopted by the authors of the collection, who ſeized whatever came to hand to ſwell the book; but all which thoſe authors wrote themſelves was good.</p>
                     <p>Omer Joli de Fleury, however, on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-third of February, 1759, accuſed theſe poor philoſophers of being Atheiſts, Deiſts, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of youth, rebels to the King, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and to prove his accuſation, cited St. Paul, and the trials of Theophilus and Abraham Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maix<note n="*" place="bottom">Abraham Chaumaix, formerly * * *, ſince Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt and Convulſionary, was then the oracle of the Parliament of Paris. Omer Joli de Fleury cited him as a Father of the Church; he has ſince been a ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter at Moſcow.</note>. He wanted nothing but to have read
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:024210_0403_0FC567804ED4A180"/>
the book againſt which he exclaimed; for if he had read it, he was a ſtrange imbecile being. He demanded juſtice of the Court againſt the article ſoul, which, according to him, was pure materialiſm.</p>
                     <p>Pray remark that the article ſoul, one of the worſt in the work, was written by a poor Doctor of the Sorbonne, who killed himſelf with declaiming, right or wrong, againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialiſm.</p>
                     <p>The whole diſcourſe of this Omer Joli de Fleury was a ſtring of ſimilar blunders. He informed againſt a book he had either not read or not underſtood; and the entire Parliament, at the requisition of Omer, condemned the work, not only without examining, but even without reading a ſingle page. This manner of doing juſtice, is very much beneath the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Bridoye, for there they may chance to be right.</p>
                     <p>The editors had procured the King's privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and the Parliament certainly had no right to revoke a privilege granted by his Majeſty. It appertains not to them either to judge of an Arrêt du Conſeil, or of any thing confirmed in Chancery: they however aſſumed the power to condemn what the Chancellor had approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and appointed Lawyers to decide upon the ſubjects of geometry and metaphyſics contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Encyclopedia. A Chancellor of the leaſt fortitude would have annulled the Arret of Parliament as incompetent: the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor

L'Amoignon ſatisfied himſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the privilege, that he might not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the ſhame of ſeeing what he had ſtamped with the ſeal of ſupreme authority judged and condemned.</p>
                     <p>One would imagine this adventure had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the days of Father Garaſſe, and that theſe were arrets againſt taking emetics; but on the contrary, it was in the moſt enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed age France had ever ſeen. So true it is, that one fool is enough to diſhonour a nation.</p>
                     <p>No one will ſcruple to confeſs, that under ſuch circumſtances, Paris was no reſting-place for a Philoſopher, and that Ariſtotle was very prudent in retiring to Chalcis when Fanata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm reigned at Athens. Beſides, the condition of a man of letters, at Paris, is but one ſtep above a Mountebank.</p>
                     <p>The place of Gentleman in ordinary to his Majeſty, which the King had given me, was no great thing. Men are very ſilly; for my part, I think it much better to build a fine manſion, as I did, have a theatre, and keep a good table, than to be hunted at Paris like Helvetius, by people holding the court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or by other people holding the ſtables of the Sorbonne. As I was certain I could never make men more reaſonable, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament leſs pedantic, nor the Theologians leſs ridiculous, I continued to be happy far from their follies.</p>
                     <p>And yet, while I contemplate the ſtorm, I am
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:024210_0405_0FC567830BFFF9C8"/>
almoſt aſhamed of my own tranquillity. I behold Germany dyed in blood; France utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruined; our fleets and armies beaten; our miniſters diſmiſſed, one after another, without any proſpect of better ſucceſs; and the King of Portugal aſſaſſinated, not by a Lacky, but the Nobility of the kingdom. Neither can the Jeſuits this time ſay, it was not us: they have carefully preſerved their rights; it has been ſufficiently proved theſe good Fathers had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the ſanctified knife to the Parricides. They give for reaſon their ſovereignty of Paraguay, and ſay they have treated with the King of Portugal as between crown and crown.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now relate a trifling, but as ſingular an adventure as ever happened ſince Kings and Poets firſt were ſeen on earth. Frederic, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed ſome time guarding the frontiers of Sileſia, in an impenetrable camp, began to be tired of inactivity; and, therefore, to paſs time away, compoſed an Ode, and ſigned it Frederic; this he put at the head of an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous bundle of verſe and proſe, which he ſent to me. I opened the package, and found I had not been the firſt who had performed that operation; it was evident the ſeals had been broken, and I was terrified at reading the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes:

                     <p>I trembled as I read the poem, ſome lines of which are excellent, or may paſs for ſuch. I had unfortunately acquired, and deſerved, the reputation of having been the continual corrector of the King of Pruſſia's poetry. The packet had been opened, the verſes read, might perhaps have been publiſhed, the King of France would attribute them to me, and I ſhould become not only guilty of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the King, but, which was ſtill worſe, againſt Madame de Pompadour.</p>
                     <p>In this perplexity, I deſired the French Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident at Geneva to come to my houſe, and ſhewed him the packet. He agreed it had been opened before it arrived, and thought there was no other way of acting in a caſe where the ſafety of my head was concerned, but ſending it as it was to the Duke de Choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeul, Miniſter of State. In any ſituation but this I ſhould not have followed his advice; but it was neceſſary to prevent my own ruin, and I
<pb n="408" facs="unknown:024210_0407_0FC567896FC6DD90"/>
acquainted the court with the true character of its enemy. I knew the Duke de Choiſeul would not betray me, but content himſelf with perſuading his Majeſty that Frederic was an enemy, whom, if they could, they ought to cruſh.</p>
                     <p>The Duke did not ſtop here; he was a man of wit, wrote verſes, and had friends who wrote alſo: he paid the King of Pruſſia in his own coin, and ſent me a ſatire againſt Frederic, as biting and unmerciful as his own.

                     <p>The Duke de Choiſeul aſſured me when he ſent this anſwer, that he would print the ſatire if the King of Pruſſia publiſhed his; and added, they would beat him as heartily with the pen, as they hoped to do with the ſword. Had I been inclined ſo to amuſe myſelf, it depended only on me to ſet the King of France and the King of Pruſſia to war in rhyme, which would have been a farce of novelty upon earth. But I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed another pleaſure; that of being more prudent than Frederic. I wrote him word his ode was beautiful, but that he ought not to publiſh it; he had glory enough without that, and ſhould not ſhut every door of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the King of France, aggravate him beyond bearing, and force him to ſome deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate effort to obtain a juſt revenge. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, my niece had burnt his ode, in mortal fear of its being imputed to me. He believed me, and returned me thanks; but not without a few reproaches, for having burnt the beſt verſes he had ever written. The Duke de Choiſeul kept his word, and was diſcreet.</p>
                     <p>To make the pleaſantry complete, I thought it poſſible to lay the foundation of the peace of Europe on theſe poetical pieces, which might have continued the war to the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Frederic, My correſpondence with
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:024210_0409_0FC56794EAB48A78"/>
the Duke de Choiſeul gave birth to that idea; and it appeared ſo ridiculous, ſo worthy the tranſactions of the times, that I indulged it, and had myſelf the ſatisfaction of proving on what weak and inviſible pivots the deſtinies of nations turn. The Duke wrote me ſeveral oſtenſible letter, conceived in ſuch terms, as the King of Pruſſia might venture to make overtures of peace without danger of Auſtria taking umbrage at France; and Frederic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned anſwers in a ſimilar way, with little riſk of diſpleaſing the Engliſh court. This tickliſh treaty is ſtill in agitation, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the ſports of cats, which give a pat with one paw and a ſcratch with the other. The King of Pruſſia, driven out of Dreſden, and beaten by the Ruſſians, is in want of peace; and France, beaten at ſea by the Engliſh, and on ſhore by the Hanoverians, with an ill-timed loſs of men and money, is obliged to finiſh this ruinous war.</p>
