            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AN occaſion truly ſolemn has aſſembled us this day; and, that your attention may be alike ſolemn and ſerious, hear, in the firſt place, the voice of eternal truth. <q>It is better to go to the Houſe of Mourning than to the Houſe of Feaſting;</q> for— <q>None of us liveth to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf;</q>
            </p>
            <p>But there are ſome men, illuminated with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ray of divinity; Patriots of the firſt magnitude, who, in a peculiar ſenſe, may be ſaid to live and die, not to themſelves, but to others; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to him who is the author of all goodneſs, Endowed with that ſuperior excellence which does honour to our whole ſpecies, the virtuous of every nation claim kindred with them; and the general intereſts of humanity are concerned in their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>In veneration of ſuch men, to exchange the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed walks of pleaſure for the Houſe of Mourning; to bedew its ſacred receſſes with tears of gratitude to their memory; to ſtrive, if poſſible, to catch ſome portion of their eternal ſpirit, as it mounts from this earthly ſphere, into perfect union with congenial ſpirits above, is a laudable cuſtom,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015085_0003_0F95A7F2A43B7B70"/>coeval with ſociety, and ſanctified to us by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the wiſeſt nations.</p>
            <p>It was the manner of the Egyptians, the fathers of arts and ſcience, not only to celebrate the names, but to embalm the bodies, of their deceaſed he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, that they might be long preſerved in public view, as examples of virtue; and, although "dead, yet ſpeaking,"</p>
            <p>But this honour was not eaſily to be obtained; nor was it beſtowed indiſcriminately upon the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Great. It was decreed only by the public voice, a venerable aſſembly of Judges, before whom the body of the deceaſed was brought for trial, and ſolemnly acquitted or condemned upon the evidence of the people.</p>
            <p>Even Kings themſelves, however much ſpared when alive, for the ſake of public tranquility, had ſtill this more than fiery Ordeal before their eyes; and, by the example of ſome of their number, who had been refuſed ſepulture in thoſe very tombs which their pride had prepared to their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, were taught both to venerate and to dread a law, which extended its puniſhments beyond the uſual times of oblivion.</p>
            <p>The moral of this inſtitution was truly ſublime, conſtantly inculcating a moſt important leſſon— "That whatever diſtinctions our wants and vices may render neceſſary, in this ſhort and imperfect period of our being, they are all cancelled by the hand of death; and, through the endleſs untried periods which ſucceed, virtue and beneficence will make the true diſtinctions, and be the only founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of happineſs and renown!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:015085_0004_0F95A7F379F62E38"/>
If from the Egyptians, we paſs to the Greeks, particularly the enlightened Athenians, we ſhall find that they had an expreſs law, appointing Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and public Funerals, in honour of thoſe who gloriouſly ſacrificed their lives to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And this ſolemn office was performed before the great aſſemblies of the people; ſometimes for one, and ſometimes for bands of heroes together.</p>
            <p>Thucydides, has recorded a cerebrated Oration of this laſt kind, delivered by Pericles. The illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious ſpeaker, after a moſt animating deſcription of the <hi>Amor Patriae,</hi> the love of our country— which he exalts above all human virtues, turns to the deceaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Having beſtowed their lives to the public, every one of them, ſays he, hath received a praiſe that will never decay; a ſepulchre that will always be moſt illuſtrious; not that in which their bones lie mouldering, but that in which their fame is preſerved. This whole earth is the ſepulchre of illuſtrious citizens</q>—and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is written upon the hearts of all good men.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As for you, the ſurvivors, from this very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, emulating their virtues, place your ſole happineſs in liberty, and be prepared to follow its call through every danger.</q> Then, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf, with exquiſite tenderneſs, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts and children of the deceaſed, he ſuggeſts to them, that the common wealth was their huſband, their father, and brother.</p>
            <p>
               <q>From this day forward, to the age of matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſhall the Orphans be educated at the public
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015085_0005_0F95A7F81FD6B220"/>expence of the ſtate. For this benevolent meed have the laws appointed to all future relicts of thoſe who may fall in the public conteſts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor were the Romans leſs careful in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Conſidering men in general as brave, more by art than nature; and that honour is a more powerful incentive than fear; they made frugality, temperance, patience, and labor, manly exerciſe, and love of their country, the main principles of education. Cowardice and neglect of duty in the field, were ſeldom puniſhed with death or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inflictions; but by what was accounted worſe, a life decreed to ignominious expulſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation from Roman privileges.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, deeds of public virtue were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, according to their magnitude, with ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, triumphs of various kinds, peculiar badges of dreſs at public ſolemnities, and ſongs of praiſe to the living as well as the dead.</p>
            <p>Next to the hymns compoſed in honor of the Gods; Poetry derived its origin from the ſongs of triumph to heroes, who tamed the rude manners of mankind, founded cities, repelled the incurſions of enemies, and gave peace to their country. And this cuſtom began when Rome contained only a few ſhepherds, gathering ſtrength by an alluvies of the outcaſts of neighbouring nations.</p>
            <p>Thoſe firſt efforts of poetic eulogy, whether in proſe or verſe (like thoſe of a ſimilar origin, which nature, always the ſame, teaches our ſavage neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) although often ſublime in ſubſtance, were yet ſo rude in ſtructure, that Livy forbears quoting them, as having become intolerable to the more
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015085_0006_0F95A7F8D5E38400"/>refined taſte of their poſterity; however ſuitable they might nave been to the aera of their production.</p>
            <p>What a multitude of compoſitions of this kind muſt have exiſted between the barbarous ſongs of the military upon the triumph of Coſius, and the celebrated panegyric of Pliny upon Trajan! They are ſaid to have been ſwelled into two thouſand volumes, even in the time of Auguſtus. In ſhort, the praiſe of public virtue was wrought into the whole texture of Roman polity; and Virgil, calling Religion to his aid, gave it the higheſt finiſh.</p>
            <p>He divides his Hades, or place of Ghoſts, into different regions; and to the gulph of deepeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, conſigns thoſe monſters of iniquity who delighted in the deſtruction of mankind, betrayed their country, or violated its religion and laws. There he excruciates them, in company with</p>
            <p>"Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire—" Vultures prey upon their vitals, or they are whirled eternally round with Ixion upon his wheel, or bound down with Tantalus, whoſe burning lips hang quivering over the eluſive waters it cannot touch; or the Fury Tiſyphone, her hair entwin'd with ſerpents, her garments red with human gore, urges on their tortures with unrelenting hand!</p>
            <p>The Poet having thus exhauſted imagination as well as mythology, in the deſcription of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the diſturbers of mankind and foes to their country, raiſes his concluſion to a height of horror beyond the reach of expreſſion—
<q>
                  <l>"Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,</l>
                  <l>"A voice of braſs, and adamantine lungs;</l>
                  <l>"Not half the mighty ſcene could I diſcloſe;</l>
                  <l>"Repeat their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> their dreadful woes.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:015085_0007_0F95A7FC0D3E8890"/>Nor has Virgil ſtrayed any farther through the fields of fancy or fable in this place, than to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtrength of colouring for the garb of truth; and I ſuſpect, that he drank from a purer fountain than that of Helicon, when he peopled his Tartarus with the ancient ſcourges of the human race. An au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſacred among chriſtians has indeed given us a moſt awful confirmation of his doctrine.</p>
            <p>A Prophet and Poet indeed, whoſe inſpiration was truly from Heaven, the incomparably ſublime ISAIAH, foretelling the fall of Babylon, has an Ode of triumph, wherein he exults over its haughty Monarch in ſtrains of wonderful irony and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. He reprobates him as a deſtroyer of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; who had "made the world a wilderneſs." He repreſents the whole earth as delivered from a curſe by his fall! The trees of the foreſt rejoice, becauſe he is laid low! The very grave refuſes a covering to his execrable corſe! he is conſigned to the depths of miſery; while the infernal manſions themſelves are moved at his approach, and the ghoſts of departed tyrants riſe up, in horrid array and mockery of triumph, to bid him welcome to his final abode!</p>
            <p>The aſtoniſhing grandeur and ſpirit of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and indeed of the whole Ode, are unrivalled by any Poet of Greek or Roman name.</p>
            <p>
               <q>How hath the oppreſſor ceaſed! The Lord hath broken the ſtaff of the wicked! He that ſmote the people in wrath—that ruled the nations in anger—is perſecuted and none hindereth! The whole earth is at reſt—they break forth into ſinging; yea the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015085_0008_0F95A7FC75AB3E18"/>cedars of Lebanon, ſaying, ſince thou art laid down no ſeller is come up againſt us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming. It ſtirreth up the dead for thee—even the chiefs of the nations! They ſay unto thee, art thouf alſo become weak as we? Thy pomp is brought down to the grave—How art thou fallen. O Lucifer, that didſt weaken the nations? All kings, (meaning juſt and merciful kings) even all of them lie in glory, every one in his own houſe (or ſepulchre;) but thou art caſt out of thy grave like an abominable branch</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But although the reward of heroes, in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian's heaven, be our proper theme on this ſolemn day; yet the paſſing view which we have taken of the perdition decreed to the traitors of their country, in the Poet's hell, confirmed alſo by the voice of ſcripture, is not foreign to our main purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I know your boſoms glow with ſo ſtrong an averſion to all the foes of liberty in this life, that you will ſurely avoid every thought and action, which might doom you to their company in the life to come; and therefore, bidding adieu—and may it be an eternal adieu—to thoſe dreary regions and their miſerable inhabitants, let us now exalt our joyous view to thoſe celeſtial manſions, where the benefactors of mankind reap immortal triumphs!
<q>
                  <l>"Lo! the bleſt train advance along the meads,</l>
                  <l>"And ſnowy wreaths adorn their glorious heads</l>

"Friends of the world, and patrons of mankind,</l>
                  <l>"Some on the verdant plains are ſtretch'd along,</l>
                  <l>"Sweet to the ear, their tuneful Paeans rung.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But here, ye Pagan poets, and thou Prince of their choir, we leave you far behind; for your ſublimeſt flights are now infinitely ſhort of the theme! Your gloomy Theology gave you tolerable aid in forming a Hell, but the utmoſt efforts of natural genius could not make a heaven worthy of a rational and immortal ſoul! The glory of giving ſome animating deſcription of that bliſs "which eye hath not ſeen, nor ear before heard, nor could "the unenlightened heart of man otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive," was left for a more divine teacher. From him we learn, that a heart pure and detatched from ſordid pleaſures, a ſoul panting after perfection, ſtriving to imitate the goodneſs of heaven, antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating its approving ſentence, and devoted to the ſervice of mankind, ſhall at laſt riſe and mix in eternal fellowſhip with the beatified family of God.</p>
            <p>Having now, my reſpected countrymen—and I hope I do not weary you—laid a wide foundation upon the practice of the wiſeſt nations—in ſupport of the preſent ſolemnity; I ſhall add but little more concerning the public utility of the thing itſelf.</p>
            <p>Circumſtanced as we now are, perhaps ſhall long be, in building up a fabric for future ages, it would be a wiſe inſtitution, if in imitation of the Genoeſe 'feaſt of union,' we ſhould make at leaſt an annual pauſe, for a review of paſt incidents, and of the characters of thoſe who have borne an illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious ſhare in them; thereby animating our virtue,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015085_0010_0F95A7FEC01A36F0"/>and uniting ourſelves more cloſely in the bonds of mutual friendſhip.</p>
            <p>The world, in general, is more willing to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, than to be taught; and examples of eminent characters have a ſtronger influence than written precepts. Men's actions are a more faithful mirror of their lives than their words. The former ſeldom deceive; but the latter often. The deeds of old, contract a venerable authority over us, when ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the voice of applauding ages; and, even in our own day, our hearts take an immediate part with thoſe who have nobly triumphed, or greatly ſuffered in our behalf.</p>
            <p>But the more uſeful the diſplay of ſuch charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be to the world, the more difficult is the work. And I am not to learn, that of all kinds of writing, panegyric requires the moſt delicate hand. Men ſeldom endure the praiſe of any actions, but thoſe which their ſelf-love repreſents as poſſible to themſelves. Whatever is held up as an example, if placed beyond the reach of humanity duly exalted by public ſpirit, will exite no emulation; and whatever is placed within the vulgar walks of life, will attract no attention.</p>
            <p>There is a further difficulty, peculiar to certain times; particularly thoſe of civil diſſenſion, when the minds of men are worked into a ferment. Whence it happens, that they who have been the ſubjects of obliquy in one age, have become the theme of praiſe in another. Such was Hampden—in the days of paſſive obedience; branded as a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſturber of his country's peace; and at the bleſſed aera of the revolution, exalted into the firſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015085_0011_0F95A8002E66A598"/>rank of patriots. Such was Sidney, condemned to a ſcaffold in the former period; and, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, immortalized by the delegated voice of the nation!</p>
            <p>What judgment poſterity will form of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mighty conteſt, in which theſe united colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are engaged, I am at no loſs to determine in my own heart. But, while the ſame actions are, by one part of a great empire, pronounced the moſt criminal reſiſtance, and by another, the moſt laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able efforts of ſelf-preſervation; no public character can be drawn alike acceptable to all. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as the faithful hiſtorian is the beſt panegyriſt of true merit, he will not faſhion himſelf to times and ſeaſons, but exalt himſelf above them; and, conſcious of his dignity, as reſponſible to ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages, will take eternal truth as his ſupport, which can alone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the impartial teſt of future examination. He knows that the divine colors of virtue, although they may give a temporary glare, will not blend or mellow into a ground-work of vice.</p>
            <p>Whatever events, diſaſtrous or happy, may lie before us; yet ſome degree of applauſe, even from an enemy, is certainly due to thoſe illuſtrious men, who, led by conſcience and a clear perſuaſion of duty, ſacrifice their eaſe, their lives and fortunes to the public; and from their friends and country, they are entitled to a deathleſs renown.</p>
            <p>Periſh that narrow pride, which will ſuffer men to acknowledge no virtue, but among their own party. In this direful conteſt, the chief concern of a liberal mind, will be, that ſo much perſonal
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015085_0012_0F95A800C75A2FD8"/>virtue as may be found on both ſides, inſtead of being united in ſome great national point for the common good, ſhould be dreadfully employed to the purpoſe of mutual deſtruction. And a man can as ſoon diveſt himſelf of his humanity, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the tribute of veneration, due to actions truly magnanimous.</p>
            <p>When once it becomes criminal to plead the cauſe of a ſuffering people; when their virtues can no longer be ſafely recorded, then tyranny has put the laſt hand to her barbarous work. All the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable purpoſes of ſociety are fruſtrated; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other human fate remains will be wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to the wiſe and good.</p>
            <p>There are alſo many whoſe minds are ſo little, that they can conceive nothing great, which does not court the eye in all the trappings of dreſs, titles, and external ſplendor. An <hi>American-Patriot!</hi> a <hi>Blanket-Hero!</hi> a <hi>General</hi> from the <hi>plough!</hi> All theſe are terms of ridicule and reproach among many. Yet ſuch was <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> in the beſt days of Roman virtue; and a Britiſh poet, already quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hath boldly taught his countrymen this noble leſſon:</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Some, with whom compar'd, your inſect-tribes</l>
               <l>"Are but the beings of a ſummer's day,</l>
               <l>"Have held the ſcale of empire, rul'd the ſtorm</l>
               <l>"Of mighty war; then, with unweary'd hand,</l>
               <l>"Diſdaining little delicacies, ſeiz'd</l>
               <l>"The <hi>plough,</hi> and greatly independant liv'd."</l>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>THOMPSON.</hi>
               </bibl>
            </q>
            <p>The ſame noble leſſon is alſo taught, by the well known ſtory of the two Spaniſh grandees, who
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015085_0013_0F95A801892D7108"/>were ſent ambaſſadors to the Hague. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the pride of their nation, they did not deſpiſe the Dutch deputies, when they met them in a plain habit, and ſaw them on a journey ſit down upon the graſs, to a frugal repaſt of bread and cheeſe, out of their knapſacks. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they cried out, <q>We ſhall never be able to conquer theſe people; we muſt even make peace with them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Should ambaſſadors honor us with a viſit, upon a like occaſion; let us be prepared to meet them in the ſame majeſtic ſimplicity of dreſs and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Let us convince them that public virtue is confined to no claſs of men; and that although it ſometimes baſks in the ſunſhine of courts, it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently lies hid in the ſhades of obſcurity, like the latent fire in flint, till called forth by the collifive hand of oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Adverſity is the ſeaſon which ſhews the ſpirit of a man in its full vigor; and times of civil calamity never fail to ſtrike forth lights, ſometimes ſingle, and ſometimes whole conſtellations, mingling their kindred rays to warm and to illuminate the genius of their country.</p>
            <p>The ſacred flame thus enkindled, is not fed by the fuel of faction or party; but by pure benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and love of the public. It therefore, ſoon riſes above the ſelfiſh principles, refines and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens as it riſes, and expands itſelf into heavenly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions. Being inextinguiſhable in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the blood of thouſands on the ſcaffold or in the field, is but as oil poured into a conflagration, encreaſing its vehemence, till it conſumes all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015085_0014_0F95A8024C93B230"/>it; burning ſtill clearer and ſtronger, unto the full day of peace and civil happineſs.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who enjoy a true portion of this divine flame, duly called forth into exerciſe, ſtand in no need of further titles or diſtinctions, either by birth or grant. For what can the world preſent greater to the fight of mortals, or even immortals, than a man who knows and courts the bleſſings of peace, who wiſhes to breathe out his laſt in its arms; and, keeping it ſtill as his object, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs rouſed by the firſt pang of his ſuffering country; gives his whole illuſtrious ſpirit to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; riſes above all human allurements; never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his zeal; fears nothing; regards nothing, but the ſentiments which virtue and magnanimity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire? What higher qualities can be required to entitle a man to the veneration and eulogies of his country? And theſe too will be his moſt durable monument.</p>
            <p>The magnificent ſtructures raiſed by the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of mankind to their benefactors of old, had but a local and temporary uſe. They were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held only by one people, and for a few ages.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"The Heaven aſpiring pyramid, the proud</l>
               <l>"Triumphal arch, and all that e'er upheld</l>
               <l>"The worſhipp'd name of hoar antiquity</l>
               <l>"Are mouldering into duſt."</l>
            </q>
            <p>In vain does the way-faring man inveſtigate the tottering ruins for the divinity once enſhrined there! A ſcanty reſceptacle, about ſix feet in length, and half the breadth, informs him, that it once contained ſome human duſt, long ſince ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the common maſs. In vain does the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015085_0015_0F95A80407E64B08"/>prying antiquary dwell upon the ſculpture, or ſtrive to collect and ſpell the ſcattered fragments of letters. The inſcription is gone—long ſince gone, effaced, obliterated! And fruitleſs were the ſearch, through the whole world, for the Hero's name, if it were not recorded in the Orator's page, and proclaimed by the faithful voice of hiſtory.</p>
            <p>There it ſhall live, while the ſmalleſt veſtiges of literature remain upon earth, yea, till the final diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of things human; nor ſhall it periſh then; but, being the immediate care of Heaven, the great Archangel, when he ſweeps ſuns and ſyſtems from their place, and kindles up their laſt fires, ſtretching forth his mighty arm, ſhall pluck the deathleſs ſcroll from the devouring conflagration, and give it a place among the archives of eternity!</p>
            <p>But whither am I borne? to what heights have I aſcended? I look down with aſtoniſhment and tremble at my ſituation! O! Let your friendly arms be extended to ſave me as I fall. For in the idea I have of my ſubject, I have undertaken to guide the chariot of the ſun; and how ſhall I ſteer through the exalted tract that lies before me?— Conſidering myſelf as honored with this day's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by the delegated voice of ſome millions of people through a vaſt continent, upon an occaſion, wherein their gratitude, their dignity, their love of liberty, are all in ſome degree concerned; what language ſhall I uſe, or how ſhall I accommodate myſelf to every circumſtance, in the arduous work?</p>
            <p>Truth alone muſt guide the hand that delineates a character, Should I affect to ſoar aloft and dip my pencil in the colours of the ſky, I ſhould but
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015085_0016_0F95A804F68D3D90"/>endanger my own wings, melt their wax, and be precipitated headlong. Nor is the danger leſs in the other extreme.</p>
            <p>Oh! then, for ſome better Phoebus, ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding Genius, to guide me through my remaining way; to point out the middle path, and teach me to unite dignity with eaſe, ſtrength with perſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and truth with the unaffected graces of elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Or rather, you ſhall be my Phoebus, my inſpiring as well as preſiding genius, ye delegated fathers of your country! So far will I ſtrive to imitate him, who always animated himſelf with his ſubject, by thus accoſting himſelf before he went forth to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>"Remember, thou art this day going to addreſs men born in the arms of liberty, Grecians, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians!" —Let no thought enter thy heart—let no word fall from thy tongue, unworthy of ſuch an audience!</p>
            <p>As to that hero, whoſe memory you celebrate as a <hi>Proto-Martyr</hi> to your rights, for through whatever fields I have ſtrayed, he has never eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped my view, as to him I ſay, if any thing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could now reach his ear, nothing but the great concerns of virtue, liberty, truth and juſtice would be tolerable to him; for to theſe was his life devoted, from his early years.</p>
            <p>He had received a liberal education in Ireland, his native country, before he went into the army; and was indeed endued with talents which would have led him to eminence in any profeſſion. His own he ſtudied with a folicity which ſoon diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed his military abilities; but war and conqueſt
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015085_0017_0F95A805B5A5FE58"/>having no other charms to him than as the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means of peace and happineſs, to mankind; he ſtill found leiſure, in the midſt of camps, to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate an excellent taſte for philoſophy, and polite literature. To theſe he added a careful ſtudy of the arts of government, and the rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, looking forward to that time, when he might deſcend into the <hi>ſtill ſcenes</hi> of private life; and give a full flow to the native and acquired vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a heart rich in moral excellence.</p>
            <p>Above eighteen years ago he had attained the rank of Captain in the 17th regiment, under Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Monckton, and ſtood full in the way of higher preferment; having borne a ſhare in all the labors of our American wars, and the reduction of Canada. Ill-fated region! ſhort-ſighted mortals! Little did he foreſee the ſcenes which that land had ſtill in reſerve for him! Little did thoſe generous Americans, who then ſtood by his ſide, think that they were aſſiſting to ſubdue a country, which would one day be held up over us, as a greater ſcourge in the hands of friends, than ever it was in the hands of enemies!</p>
            <p>Had ſuch a thought then entered our hearts, we ſhould have ſtarted with indignation from the deed of horror. Our heroiſm would have appeared madneſs and parricide! The lifted ſteel would have dropped from the warrior's arm! The axe and the hoe from the warrior's arm! The axe and the hoe from the laborer's graſp! America would have weeped through all her foreſts; and her well-cultivated fields refuſed to yield farther ſuſtenance to her infatuated ſons!</p>
            <p>But far different were our thoughts at that time.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015085_0018_0F95A8091B83BF38"/>We conſidered ourſelves as co-operating with our brethren, for the glory of the empire; to enable them to ſecure our common peace and liberty; to humanize, adorn, and dignify, with Britiſh privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, a vaſt continent; to become ſtrong in our ſtrength, happy in our happineſs; and to derive that from our affection, which no force can extort from a free people; and which the miſerable and oppreſſed cannot give!</p>
            <p>And theſe, too, were the ſentiments of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Hero; for he had formed an early attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, amounting even to an enthuſiaſtic love for this country! The woodland and the plain; the face of nature, grand, venerable, and yet rejoicing in her prime; our mighty rivers, deſcending in vaſt cataracts through wild and ſhaggy mountains, or gliding in ſilent majeſty through fertile vales; their numerous branches and tributary ſprings; our romantic ſcenes of rural quiet; our ſimplicity of manners, yet uncorrupted by luxury or flagrant vice; our love of knowlege and ardor of liberty, all theſe ſerved to convey the idea of primaeval fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity to a heart which he had taught to beat uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the harmony of Heaven!</p>
            <p>He therefore choſe America, as the field of his future uſefulneſs; and as ſoon as the bleſſings of peace were reſtored to his country, and duty to his ſovereign would permit, he took his leave of the army, and having ſoon connected himſelf, by marriage, with an ancient and honorable family, in the province of New-York, he choſe a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful retirement upon the banks of Hudſon's river, at a diſtance from the noiſe of the buſy world!—
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015085_0019_0F95A80AAA069350"/>Having a heart diſtended with benevolence, and panting to do good, he ſoon acquired, without courting it from his neighbours, that authority, which an opinion of ſuperior talents, and inflexible integrity, never fail to create.</p>
            <p>In this moſt eligible of all ſituations, the life of a country gentleman, deriving its moſt exquiſite reliſh from reflection upon paſt dangers, and paſt ſervices, he gave full ſcope to his philoſophic ſpirit, and taſte for rural elegance, Self-ſatisfied and raiſed above vulgar ambition, he devoted his time to ſweet domeſtic intercourſe with the amiable partner of his heart, friendly converſe with men of worth, the ſtudy of uſeful books, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his favoured villa. Nor from that happy ſpot did he wiſh to ſtray, until he ſhould receive his laſt ſummons to happineſs, more than terreſtial.</p>
            <p>But when the hand of power was ſtretched forth againſt the land of his reſidence, he had a heart too noble not to ſympathize in its diſtreſs. From that fatal day—and Oh! that it had never found a place in the volumes of Time; from that fatal day, in which the firſt American blood was ſpilt by the hoſtile hands of Britiſh brethren, and the better genius of the empire, veiling her face in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, turned abhorrent from the ſtrife of death among her children; I ſay, from that fatal day, he choſe his part.</p>
            <p>Although his liberal ſpirit placed him above lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal prejudices, and he conſidered himſelf as a member of the empire at large; yet America, ſtruggling in the cauſe of liberty, henceforth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015085_0020_0F95A80C64A88D50"/>his peculiar country; and that country took full poſſeſſion of his ſoul; lifting him above this earthly droſs, and every private affection! Worth like his, could be no longer hid in the ſhades of obſcurity; nor permit him to be placed in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior ſtation with which a mind, great in humility and ſelf denial, would have been contented. It was wiſely conſidered, that he, who had ſo well learned to obey, was fitteſt to command; and therefore, being well aſſured of his own heart, he reſigned himſelf to the public voice, nor heſitated a moment longer to accept the important commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion freely offered to him, and, with the firmneſs of another Regulus, to bid farewell to his peaceful retirement, and domeſtic endearments.</p>
            <p>Here followed a ſcene of undiſſembled tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtreſs, which all who hear me may, in ſome degree, conceive; but all cannot truly feel. You only who are huſbands, whoſe hearts have been intimately blended with the partners of your bliſs, and have known the pangs of ſeperation, when launching into dangers, uncertain of your fate. You only, would I now more directly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. Give a moment's pauſe for reflection! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call your own former feelings, your inward ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, your virtuous tears! Here bid them again freely flow, while you liſten to our hero's parting words,—</p>
            <q>
               <l>Ye ſcenes where home-felt pleaſures dwell,</l>
               <l>And thou, my dearer ſelf, farewell!</l>
               <l>"Perhaps the Cypreſs, only tree</l>
               <l>"Of all theſe groves, ſhall follow me;"</l>
               <l>But ſtill, to Triumph or a Tomb,</l>
               <l>Where virtue calls, I come, I come!</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:015085_0021_0F95A80CC7C9ED50"/>
"I COME, I come!" Nor were theſe the words of diſappointed ambition; nor dictated by any ſudden ſtart of party zeal. He had weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conteſt well, was intimately acquainted with the unalienable rights of freemen, and ready to ſupport them at every peril! He had long fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen and lamented the fatal iſſue to which things were haſtening. He knew that the ſword of civil deſtruction, once drawn, is not eaſily ſheathed; that men having their minds inflamed and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of defence in their hands, ſeldom know the juſt point where to ſtop, even when they have it in their power; and often proceed to actions, the bare contemplation of which would at firſt have aſtoniſhed them.</p>
            <p>It was therefore his deſire rather to ſoften than enflame violent humors, wiſhing that America, in all her actions, might ſtand juſtified in the ſight of God, and the world. He foreſaw the horrid train of evils which would be let looſe by the ſtroke which ſhould ſever the ancient bond of union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great-Britain and us. It was therefore his wiſh, that ſuch a ſtroke ſhould never proceed firſt from the hand of America. Nor did it ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>The reſiſtance made at Lexington, was not the traiterous act of men conſpiring againſt the ſupreme powers; nor directed by the councils of any public body in America; but roſe immediately out of the caſe, and was dictated by ſelf-preſervation, the firſt great law of nature as well as ſociety. If there was any premeditated ſcheme here, it was preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated by thoſe who created the dreadful neceſſity,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015085_0022_0F95A80D93E840A0"/>either of reſiſtance of ruin. For could it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that any people, poſſeſſing the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of virtue and liberty, would tamely ſubmit to deſtruction and ravage; to be diſarmed as ſlaves; ſtripped of their property, and left a naked prey even to the inſults of ſurrouding ſavages?</p>
            <p>Was this an experiment worthy of Great-Britain? Where was the wiſdom of her counſellors? Had their juſtice, their moderation quite forſaken them? Could they poſſibly expect obedience in ſuch a caſe as this? Would they themſelves, in a ſimilar caſe, even under a competent legiſlative authority, ſubmit to laws which would deſtroy the great end of all laws, Self-Preſervation? Human nature ſays, No; The Genius of the Engliſh conſtitution ſays, No. The nation itſelf hath heretofore ſaid, No; and a great oracle <hi>(blackſtone)</hi> of its laws has given his ſanction to the verdict— <q>In caſes of national oppreſſion, ſays he, the nation hath very juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably riſen as one man, to vindicate the original contract, ſubſiſting between King and people.</q> And—<q>If the ſovereign power threatens deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a ſtate, mankind will not be reaſoned out of the feelings of humanity, nor ſacrifice liberty to a ſcrupulous adherence to political maxims.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If the caſe of America does not come within the above deſcription, there ſeems to be no equity left upon earth; and whatever is exacted by force, muſt be yielded through fear. But if juſtice be any thing more than a name, it is ſurely a ſoleciſm in politics to ſay, that one part of a free country has a right to command that which the other <q>cannot obey without being ſlaves, nor reſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015085_0023_0F95A80E414BE4D8"/>being rebels.</q> Yet to ſuch a ſad dilemma does the parliamentary claim of a right to bind us "in all caſes whatſoever," reduce America; involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in a total ſurrender of our liberties; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeding the uſe of our own legiſlatures; marking us with ſuch a badge of ſervitude as no freemen can conſent to wear; and ſubjecting us to burdens laid by thoſe who are not only unacquainted with our circumſtances, and bear no part of the weight, but caſe themſelves in proportion as they load us. If this be law, if it be equity, it has no example among any other people, poſſeſſing the leaſt glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings of virtue or native freedom.</p>
            <p>But although this claim be ſo repugnant to every idea of natural as well as legal juſtice, that the guilt of blood which it may occaſion can be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only on thoſe who attempt to enforce it; yet I am well aſſured that when compelled at laſt by hard neceſſity, either to avert the dagger pointed at our breaſt or crouch to unconditional ſervitude, our hero's heart bled for the dreadful alternative.</p>
            <p>His principles of loyalty to his ſovereign [whom he had long ſerved, and whoſe true glory conſiſts in healing thoſe ſtreaming wounds] remained firm and unſhaken. Love to our brethren whom we muſt oppoſe the interchange of good offices, which had ſo intimately knit the bonds of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between them and us; the memory of thoſe better days, in which we fought and triumphed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the vaſt fabric of mutual happineſs raiſed by our union, and ready to be diſſolved by our diſſentions; the annihilation of thoſe numerous plans of improvement in which we were engaged
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015085_0024_0F95A80F0E35B200"/>for the glory of the empire; all theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conſpired to render this conteſt peculiarly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrent to him, and every virtuous American, and could have been outweighed by nothing earthly, but the unquenchable love of liberty, and that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred duty which we owe to ourſelves and our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</p>
            <p>Hence, as appears from his papers, even in the full triumph of ſucceſs, he moſt ardently joined his worthy friend, General Schuyler, in praying that <q>Heaven may ſpeedily re-unite us in every bond of affection and intereſt; and that the Britiſh empire may again become the envy and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the univerſe, and flouriſh</q> till the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of earthly things.</p>
            <p>This part of his character, I dwell upon with particular ſatisfaction; and indeed had he evidenced a contrary ſentiment, or gone forth in the rage of conqueſt inſtead of the ſpirit of reconciliation; not all his other virtues, nor yet the reſpect which I owe to the appointment wherewith I am now ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, could have induced me to appear in this place, on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>God forbid that any of the profeſſion to which I belong, ſhould ever forget their peculiar charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, exerciſe a turbulent ſpirit, or proſtitute their voice to enſlave men's minds to the purpoſes of wild ambition, or mutual deſtruction. I am hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in knowing that nothing of this kind is wiſhed from me; nay, that the delegated voice of the continent, as well as of this particular province, ſupports me in praying for a reſtoration <q>of the former harmony between Great-Britain, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015085_0025_0F95A8124C240458"/>theſe colonies upon ſo firm a baſis as to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate its bleſſings, uninterupted by any future diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, to ſucceeding generations in both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed this matter reſts in ſafe hands, and is clear in itſelf. If redreſs of grievances, eſſential liberty, and ſecurity againſt future oppreſſion can be obtained, agreeable to our own deſires; then, neither conſiſtency, dignity, or a regard to our il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Britiſh friends, who have defended our cauſe, pledged themſelves for our ſincerity, and hope by our aid to reſtore and perpetuate the glory of the whole empire, can ſuffer us to heſitate. To ſay, let them look to their own ſafety, and we will look to ours, would be unworthy of the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſoul of any American, truly animated in our preſent cauſe, and with the love of univerſal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe theſe terms cannot be obtained?— Why then, there will be no need of further argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, much leſs of aggravations. Timid as my heart, perhaps is, and ill-tuned as my ear may be to the din of arms, and the clangor of the trumpet; yet, in that caſe, ſounds which are a thouſand times more harſh; "even the croaking of frogs in the uncultivated fen," or the howling of wild beaſts on the mountain top, where liberty dwells, would be "preferable to the Nightingale's ſong," in vales of ſlavery, or the melting notes of Corelli, in cities clanking their chains!</p>

            <p>The Canada expedition is one of thoſe meaſures, which the enemies of American peace having firſt rendered neceſſary, will now ſtrive to miſconſtrue into hoſtility and offence. But when authentic proofs were obtained that a people profeſſing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſubjected to laws, different from ours, together with numerous tribes of ſavages were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated and preparing to deluge our frontiers in blood, let God and the world judge whether it was an act of offence; or rather, whether it was not mercy to them, to ourſelves, to the whole Britiſh empire, to uſe the means in our power for fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the barbarous attempt.</p>
            <p>Indeed there was benevolence in the whole plan of his expedition. It was to be executed not ſo much by force as by perſuaſion; and appearing in the country with ſuch a reſpectable ſtrength, as might protect the inhabitants from the inſults and vengeace of thoſe, who were ſtriving to make them liſt up their reluctant arm to the ſhedding fraternal blood. It was further wiſhed to kindle up the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring lamp of liberty among them; to open their eyes to its divine effulgence; and enable them to raiſe their drooping head, and claim its bleſſing as their own.</p>
            <p>This was a work, in all its parts, ſuited to the genius of a Montgomery. He had a head and heart which equally pointed him out as a fit guide in ſuch an undertaking. He underſtood and could well explain the bleſſings of a free government
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015085_0027_0F95A819892998A8"/>Perſuaſion dwelt upon his tongue. He had a ſoul, great, diſintereſted, affectionate, delighting to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate diſtreſs, and to diffuſe happineſs. He had an induſtry not to be wearied out; a vigilance not to be impoſed upon; and a courage, when neceſſary, equal to his other abilities.</p>
            <p>But ſtill, with a few new raiſed men, of different colonies, and perhaps different tempers; ill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with arms and ammunition; worſe diſciplined; unaccuſtomed to look cannon in the face; to make or to mount a breach—in ſuch circumſtances, I ſay, and in the ſhort ſpace of an autumnal and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter campaign, in rigorous northern climes, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve a work which coſt Great-Britain and the colonies the labor of ſeveral campaigns, and what was a ſacrifice of infinitely more value—the life of the immortal WOLFE—this certainly required a degree of magnanimity beyond the ordinary reach, and the exertion of the higheſt abilities of every kind.</p>
            <p>The command and conduct of an army, were but ſmall parts of this undertaking. The Indians were to be treated with, reſtrained and kept in temper. The Canadians were likewiſe to be managed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and ſupported: And even his own army in ſome degree to be formed, diſciplined, animated, accuſtomed to marches, incampments, dangers, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues and the frequent want of neceſſaries.</p>
            <p>Camps, of all wordly ſcenes, often exhibit the greateſt pictures of diſtreſs. The ſick and the wounded—the dying and the dead—as well as the wants and ſufferings of the living—all theſe call forth the moſt tender feelings, and require of a General that, to the courage of a ſoldier, he ſhould unite the utmoſt benevolence of a man!</p>

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:015085_0028_0F95A81B3ABDA4B8"/>
Our General poſſeſſed theſe united qualities in their higheſt luſtre; of which there are numerous teſtimonies not only from his own army, but from the priſoners, Engliſh as well as Canadians, now amongſt us.</p>
            <p>When his men laboured under fatigue, wanted bread and other neceſſaries, had their beds to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n ſnow or deep moraſſes, they were aſhamed to complain, finding that he was willing to ſhare in the execution of whatever he commanded. And the example which he thus ſet to others, did more to inſpire patience, obedience, love of order and diſcipline, than the moſt rigid exerciſe of power could have done. The influence of this example was ſtill ſtronger, as it did not appear to be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of conſtraint or political neceſſity; but the amiable expreſſion of a ſympathizing ſoul; leading him to condeſcend to all capacities; exact in his own duties, and great even in common things. His letters, confidential and official, are a full proof of this.</p>
            <p>"Our incampment is ſo ſwampy, I feel, ſays he exceedingly for the troops; and proviſions ſo ſcarce, it will require not only diſpatch, but good fortune, to keep us from diſtreſs. Should things not go well, I tremble for the fate of the poor Canadians, who have ventured ſo much. What ſhall I do with them, ſhould I be obliged to evacuate this country? I have aſſured them that the United Colonies will as ſoon give up Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts to reſentment as them."</p>
            <p>Theſe ſentiments were worthy of a heroic ſoul, and of the faith he had pledged to thoſe people.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015085_0029_0F95A81BC1D92118"/>Nor is he leſs to be venerated for his tender regard towards his own army. Inſtead of making a merit of his difficulties (which were indeed more than ought to be mentioned in this place) he often ſeeks to conceal them; aſcribing any little faults or tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, in his young troops, to their want of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in forming; to their hard duty, the conſtant ſucceſſion of bad weather and the like—ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them to nobler efforts in future. And if any impatience of diſcipline appeared, he nobly attributed it to <q>that ſpirit of freedom, which men accuſtomed to think for themſelves, will even bring into camps with them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His own ſuperior military knowledge he has been known to ſacrifice to the general voice, rather than interrupt that union on which ſucceſs depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when a meaſure was once reſolved upon by the majority, however much contrary to his own advice and judgment, he magnanimouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it with his utmoſt vigor; diſdaining that work of low ambition, which will ſtrive to defeat in the execution what it could not direct in planing</p>
            <p>His perſerverance and conduct in gaining poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of St. John's and Montreal, have already been the theme of every tongue, and need not be mentioned in this place.

            <p>Leaving him, therefore for a while—alas too ſhort a while—to enjoy the nobleſt of all triumphs, the applauſe of his country, and the conſcious teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of his own heart, let us enquire after another band of brave and hardy men who are ſtemming rapid rivers, aſcending pathleſs mountains; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing unpeopled deſerts; and haſtening through deep moraſſes and gloomy woods to meet him in ſcenes of another iſſue—</p>

            </q>
            <p>This praiſe was paid to ten thouſand heroes, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining every danger, in a retreat to their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and is certainly due, ſo far as heroiſm is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to leſs than a tenth part of the number, marching through equal difficulties againſt the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of a hoſtile country.</p>
            <p>Even the march of Hannibal over the Alps, ſo much celebrated in hiſtory, allowing for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of numbers, has nothing in it of ſuperior merit, to the march of Arnold; and in many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances there is a moſt ſtriking ſimilitude.</p>
            <p>The former had to encounter the rapid Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck, thro' an immenſe length of country. The
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015085_0031_0F95A81EC06C1010"/>former when he came to quit the river, found his further paſſage barr'd by mountains, rearing their ſnowy creſts to the ſky, rugged, wild, uncultivated. This was alſo the caſe with the latter, whoſe troops, carrying their boats and baggage, were obliged to croſs and recroſs the ſame mountains ſundry times. At the foot of the mountains, the former was deſerted by three thouſand of his army, deſponding at the length of the way, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at the hideous view of thoſe ſtupendous heights, which they conſidered as impaſſable—In like circumſtances, about a third part of the army of the latter, deſerted ſhall I ſay, or uſe the more courteous language "returned home." The march of the former was about twelve hundred miles in five months. The Virginia and Pennſylvania rifle-companies, belonging to the latter, including their firſt march from their own habitations to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and thence to Quebec, marched near the ſame diſtance in about three months.</p>

He further flattered himſelf, that his ſucceſs, if ſpeedy, might have ſome influence upon Parliament, in haſtening a reconciliation.

You remember his generous ſpirit in his early years, for they drank of the ſame ſprings of ſcience with many of you now before me; and we who reached the cup to yon lip, rejoice that it contributed to invigorate both him and you into wiſdom and public ſpirit. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed his ſcolaſtic education, he ſtudied the laws of his country, under a lawyer and a patriot of diſtinguiſhed name; and animated by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as precepts, had become eminent in his profeſſion, at an age when ſome have ſcarce begun to think of buſineſs. The love of liberty being his ruling paſſion, he thought it his duty in the preſent ſtruggle, to offer himſelf to the ſervice of his country, and he had ſoon an opportunity of attaining that military pre-eminence, of which he was laudably ambitious.</p>
            <p>Enjoying a hereditary bravery, joined to a well cultivated underſtanding, and an active ſpirit, he ſoon became the boſom friend of General Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery, was his Aid de camp, was entruſted with a ſhare in the management of his moſt important ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations,

            <p>Here likewiſe fell Captain Cheeſman, of the New-York forces, covered with honor, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by all who knew him, as an active and gallant officer.

            <p>I muſt not, however, omit the name of the brave Captain Hendricks, who commanded one of the Pennſylvania rifle companies, and was known to me from his infancy. He was indeed prodigal of his life, and courted danger out of his tour of duty. The command of the guard belonged to him, on the morning of the attak; but he ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obtained leave to make a more conſpicuous poſt; and having led his men through the barrier, where his commanding officer, General Arnold, was wounded, he long ſuſtained the fire of the garriſon with unſhaken firmn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
