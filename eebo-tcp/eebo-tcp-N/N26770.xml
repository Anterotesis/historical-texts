            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have formed no hypotheſis; I have hazarded no conjecture. Long reflection on the nature, deſtination and happineſs of man, matured by the influence of experience, has affixed to it, with me, its ſeal of <hi>ſlow</hi> approbation. I now ſubmit it to the examination of parents in general, as a map of that country, through which both pupil and preceptor muſt travel together, to the temple of uſeful knowledge. In paths diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified like theſe, I ſhall continue to walk, ſo long as the intereſts of my riſing offspring ſhall juſtify my perſeverence. The period of the contract I made expreſsly with ſome of you, and virtually with all, on my arrival in this city, being expired, I ſhall not loſe this opportunity of obſerving, that your ſtrict punctuality is entitled to the public avowal of my gratitude
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:035626_0004_1006113BA5D77C18"/>and eſteem. This punctuality I have been anxious to meet by an unremitted attention to the duties of my office.</p>

            <p>WERE I aſked what principle in human power was calculated to produce the greateſt effects on the dignity, uſefulneſs and happineſs of man, I ſhould anſwer—<hi>EDUCATION.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Happily, we live in the cloſe of a century, in which its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is no longer a problem ſeeking for ſolution, but an axiom that commands aſſent—Man has not lived in vain—Millions of <hi>individuals</hi> are rendered inviſible by the ſhades of death, but the hiſtory of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> has given energy and duration to the moſt momentous truths. The progreſs of nations has marked the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of education in characters which challenge time to obliterate: but it is the prerogative of civilization to appreciate its value. "Knowledge," ſays Bacon, "is power;" and it belongs to the century whoſe twilight now ſkirts our horizon, to convert this knowledge to the <hi>amelioration of the ſpecies.</hi> We have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument within our graſp: dark, diſſolute and guilty, will be that nation that has not virtue to uſe it. It is no longer neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the man of reflection to enquire what conferred on Athens and on Rome its ancient celebrity? what gave duration to the ſtate of Sparta? what diſtinguiſhed Egypt for its litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and its ſcience, when Greece and Rome ranked with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians?
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035626_0007_100611432B6E7820"/>why has the ſun ſet ſo long on Africa and the Eaſt? what conſtitutes the difference between England in the days of Caeſar, and at the cloſe of the eighteenth century? Had New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton paſſed his days in the country of the Hottentots, or Locke vegetated in the wigwams of the natives of this continent, what a tremendous chaſm would have appeared in the pyramids of phyſical and moral ſcience! The diſtinction which annihilates all others between the ſame nation at different periods, and different nations at the ſame period; between different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of the ſame community, and the ſame perſon at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times,—is <hi>Cultivation:</hi> but who does not perceive that this keeps pace with education?—is accelerated by it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded by the want of it? Deſtitute of a liberal education, how ſhall our youth move with dignity where ſcenes of uſefulneſs open?—how, where education alone qualifies?—how, where education alone is reſpected?—how fill the offices of a republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can government, or take that lead in the active departments of life which manly ſenſe, poliſhed by culture, and dignified by integrity, is alone entitled to? Can honeſty of intention, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever honourable, compenſate for the errors of incapacity? What but the advantages of education can prevent the gloomy irkſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ruſtic ſolitude, or the fruitleſs wiſhes of advancing decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude?—But I arreſt my pen. All civilized nations now perceive its influence; all ranks deſire to ſecure its advantages; and no man forms an exception to this obſervation, but he who is a ſlave to the moſt puerile inattention, or fallen into the ſtupor of groſs depravity.</p>
            <p>The man of property is compelled to regard it as a mine of exhauſtleſs value; and the creature of a title feels that <hi>without</hi> it he is a phantom in creation! The numbers of Horace, the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of Ariſtotle, and the code of Lycurgus harmonize here. I rejoice that the citizens of this and other republics join the chorus. The conſtitutions of America favour a courſe of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral education—its legiſlatures encourage it: and while the fatigued ſpirit of a Waſhington roares from the theatre of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic action, exclaiming with Horace,
<q>"Quid leges ſine moribus vanoe proficiunt?"</q>
Adams re-echoes in his inaugural oration,
<q>
                  <l>"Doctrina ſed vim promovet inſitam</l>
                  <l>"Vectique cultus pectora voberant."</l>
                  <bibl>HOR. Lib. Car. 4. Ode 4.</bibl>
               </q>
Men like theſe know that education <hi>alone</hi> can ſupply this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public with citizens formed to <hi>ſubstdination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:035626_0008_1005EDEBE6777150"/>
What then, it may be aſked, is the <hi>end</hi> which education pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes? I anſwer, to render our youth moſt <hi>uſeful</hi> to themſelves, and to the ſtate of which they are members; and by availing ourſelves of the knowledge of the nature of man, to ſecure for them the greateſt quantity of happineſs in the moſt expeditious manner. It is thus that education anticipates and avails itſelf of the ſlow fruits of experience; and ſuch is its widely extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed influence, that the liberal inſtruction of the rich will aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly better the condition of the poor; while the education of the poorer ranks will, for the moſt uſeful purpoſes, enable them to meaſure footſteps with the moſt opulent.</p>
            <p>As a mean to this end, education includes an attention to the health, the underſtanding, and the morals, It divides itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts: 1. <hi>phyſical;</hi> 2. <hi>moral;</hi> 3. <hi>intellectual.</hi> To conduct tuition therefore upon the largeſt ſcale, would require that a tutor ſhould be attentive to the health, agility, addreſs, and activity of the body: that he ſhould know and attend to the influence of the elements, nouriſhment, cloathing, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, exerciſes, and paſſions: that he ſhould accuſtom the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to the various recreations of running, leaping, dancing, wreſtling, carrying burdens, playing at tennis, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>moral</hi> part would require from him a regular training to the various perſonal and ſocial virtues. Beyond mere lectures on morality, the tutor ſhould contrive ſuch occaſions as would bring every leſſon into action: a particular attention ſhould be given to the biography of men in every ſituation of active life; and I will add, altho' gloomy ſcepticiſm, wide-ſpreading infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and deſolating profligacy, ſhould arraign me at their bar, <hi>He ſhould know how to impreſs his pupils with juſt ideas of the moral character of the God of the univerſe, his government over all objects and events, and the exalted deſtiny of the whole human race.</hi> This, taught free from every thing extraneous, incidental, ſectarian or puerile, will furniſh ſuch motives, excite ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, impel to ſuch actions, as will ſecure a love of <hi>juſtice</hi> in the magiſtrate, and of <hi>law</hi> in the citizen. From ſuch principles, a ſpirit of ſubordination will ariſe, ſpontaneous as the fountain, diffuſive as light, and harmonious as the ſolar ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>To cultivate the underſtanding of young people, is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe object of a <hi>day-ſchool.</hi> It is not poſſible from the nature of ſuch an inſtitution, or any thing analagous to it, that a tutor ſhould be able to give more than an indirect and ſubordinate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to either the health or morals of his pupils. The inſtant they leave the claſs-room, all reſponſibility on the part of their tutor is at an end; they then enter under the ſole juriſdiction of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035626_0009_10061144B15374E8"/>and are amenable alone to them for any miſconduct. To unite all the advantages of phyſical, moral and intellectual educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would require that a tutor ſhould be the companion of his claſſes. This is done to the beſt effect in ſmall ſelect boarding ſchools. When in England, I put my pupils under ſuch regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as rendered it impoſſible for them to loſe much time. Hours of recreation were occupied in amuſements conducive to health; and the internal police of the ſeminary was regulated by a ſmall code of laws, rendered effectual by corporal confinement, of longer or ſhorter duration.</p>
            <p>That the minds of youth ſhould be prepared for the future ſcenes of active life, by a <hi>fixed courſe of liberal education,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and acted upon by all orders in ſociety. What branches ſhall enter into this courſe, has ſuffered more or leſs fluctuation, according to the variations of opinion, the progreſs of taſte, or the preſſure of neceſſity. Hence the different degrees of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paid to certain arts, ſciences and languages, in the ſame or different ages. Milton publiſhed a courſe of education in 1650: it appears to be for boys from the age of 12 to 20. His ideas on the order in which the branches of education ſhould ſucceed each other, are founded on a juſt theory of the mind. When he complains that "youth learned <hi>mere words, ragged notions and babblements,"</hi> does he not forcibly characteriſe the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our expiring century? Gaillard, who publiſhed in 1678, particularly recommends the ſtudy of logic, ethics, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. A diſtinguiſhed writer of the preſent day, who has been much employed in qualifying young gentlement for active life, branches his courſe into the following articles: Religion, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural philoſophy, natural hiſtory, agriculture, architecture, fortification, ſcience of government, and navigation. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Williams, a ſtar of no deſpicable magnitude in the hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere of literature, and who about the year 1773, brought forward his plan of education, founded on that given by Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, who was invited to England to reform its ſchools, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly recommends an attention to writing, drawing, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics, logic, civil hiſtory, ethics, compoſition, botany, natural hiſtory in general, and the Latin, Greek, and French languages.</p>
            <p>Without enquiring why certain objects are enumerated in, or excluded from the above-cited courſes, I ſhall mark out ſuch a one, as I hope will be found ſuited to <hi>this age and country—com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, uſeful, practicable, and preparatory to either of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, or any department of active life.</hi> As a parent deeply anxious to quality my <hi>own</hi> children for the chequered ſcenes of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035626_0010_100611463A5862D8"/>life, I aſk myſelf, upon what <hi>principles</hi> ought their courſe of education to be founded? Can I bear that an object of ſuch known and mighty influence, ſhould be left to the irregular caprice or undiſcerning prejudice of <hi>cuſtom?</hi>—that they ſhould be merely fitted to move in the lower walks of life, and not rather to aſcend the more extended ſpheres, if circumſtances invite them to it? Am I willing to ſubſtitute the ſhowy for the ſolid?— branches almoſt obſolete, or whoſe utility is confined and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, for ſuch as I know the momentary occurrences of life call for?—ſuch as can never become uſeleſs—ſuch as will enable them to qualify themſelves for any department, that inclination, neceſſity, the hand of friendſhip, proſpect of reputation, hope of gain, or ardent love of public good, may juſtify their purſuing? Though it belongs not me, at this diſtance to know, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their future ſituations, I will have them furniſhed with ſuch materials as will ſupport whatever ſuperſtructure prudence ſhall require hereafter to be raiſed. In determining this queſtion of <hi>utility,</hi> I perceive that I ought to have them educated in thoſe branches which are moſt frequently called into action; ſuch as will facilitate their acquaintance with others, and be they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics, tradeſmen, merchants, profeſſional characters, or living in eaſy independence, their tutor ſhall preſent them with ſuch keys as will open any of the doors of ſcience. With ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, ariſing out of the moſt precious cares of the heart, what are thoſe particular advantages I am eager to ſecure my offspring by entering them into a courſe of education, whoſe principles I have now determined on? I anſwer, that as I do not ſend my ſon to a ſchool that he may forget the moſt important years of his exiſtence, I propoſe to myſelf a ſerious object.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I wiſh as ſoon as poſſible that he ſhould poſſeſs a diſtinct articulation; an authorized pronunciation; a well-placed accent; a varied, but juſt emphaſis; a pleaſing modulation; a well-timed cadence, with every other attainment neceſſary to the uſual pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of <hi>reading</hi> or <hi>ſpeaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That he ſhould be capable of ſelecting and arranging his words in ſuch a manner, as to avoid ſoleciſms, barbariſms, ambiguities and vulgarities, with every other ſpecies of <hi>gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> inaccuracy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he ſhould <hi>write</hi> our uſual literal characters wit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, perſpicuity and diſpatch.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he ſhould manage numbers with caſe and correctneſs for the common purpoſes of civil life.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035626_0011_10061148E4D0ED40"/>
5. That when he has occaſion to record any thing, he ſhould be capable of doing it with the greateſt poſſible expedition.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That he ſhould be acquainted with the moſt ſtriking facts of ancien: and modern <hi>hiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. That he ſhould know the <hi>time</hi> when they happened.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That he ſhould know the <hi>place</hi> where they happened.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That he ſhould be able to reaſon on quantity, meaſure, extenſion; calculate on theſe with expedition; and thus be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to concentrate his attention with effect on aſtronomy, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural philoſophy, architecture, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That he ſhould come into life fitted to take a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive view of whatever may be the ſubject of his reflections; know how to avoid falſe judgments and inconcluſive reaſonings, and be able to methodize his thoughts for the purpoſes of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial communication.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That he ſhould have his taſte formed and refined by an acquaintance with the laws and kinds of ſtyle; the ſources of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; the uſes of figurative language; and be able to expreſs himſelf on any ſubject with eaſe, propriety and force.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I wiſh him not to be ignorant of the deſign of his moral powers; the moſt frequent ſprings of human actions, with their probable conſequences.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That he ſhould be qualified to become an enlightened and good citizen; underſtand the nature, deſign and kinds of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the reciprocal duties of the governors and the governed.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Finally, That he ſhould have ſuch an acquaintance with the dead and living languages, as will qualify him for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, employ his leiſure by drinking from the original ſources of information, or at him to hold a communication with modern nations for the purpoſes, of ſcience, commerce or recreation.</p>
            <p>To obtain theſe advantages, would require that a tutor ſhould ſuperintend the education of his pupils through the following acts, ſcience, and languages: Reading, Engliſh grammar, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, writing, arithmetic of integers, vulgar and decimal fraction, ſhort hand, hiſtory, chronology, geography and the uſe of the globes, The following branches of ſimple mathematics;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:035626_0012_1006114B51CFB140"/>
Menſuration, geometry, trigonometry and algebra, general principles, including logic, rhetoric and compoſition, ethics and the ſcience of government. Laſtly, The Latin, Greek and French languages. Such is the courſe through which I doubt not men of enlarged minds would wiſh their children, by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eaſy ſteps to be conducted; ſuch is the courſe through which I offer to conduct them. If it will not perfect them, no plan of education is deſigned to do it. I have been ſolely led to this ſelection, by a ſentiment of general utility. It does not <hi>include an object but what has important uſes to a young gentlemen, whatever be his particular deſtination in life, and that as long as life ſhall laſt.</hi> Whatever bye-path I may wiſh to conduct my ſon through in any future period, this is the high road he ſhould firſt be familiar with, and on which I would accustom him to exerciſe himſelf. To be a phyſician, a legal character, an officer of government, or a theologian, would require that he ſhould aſcend this ſcale in regular gradation; and without ſuch a previous progreſs, he will in all probability ſoon deſcend not to riſe again. With ſuch qualifications as a proper ſtudy of this courſe will give him, I doubt not but any young gentleman would ſoon <hi>fit himſelf for any particular department.</hi> And ſuch a courſe begun early in life, conducted with order, perſeverence and talent, may be finiſhed ſufficiently early to enter into any ſcene of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life. Like the ſtrong current of a wide navigable river, it eaſily conducts them to other diverging ſtreams, and all fall at laſt into thoſe great waters, on which men navigate for honour, profit or pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Having delineated the parts of a liberal education, that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents my be at no loſs to conceive how I would proceed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them, I ſhall thew what is the moſt eaſy, expeditious, pleaſant and ſucceſsful method of doing this. I give the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the reſult of my own obſervation. Theſe various branches ſhould be taught by ſeparate claſſes, at particular hours allotted for the objects of each claſs. Upon the uſual plan of day-ſchools, a great number of young gentlement are aſſembled in the ſame room, at the ſame time; who learning a variety of different branches, neceſſarily diſtract each other's attention, when in fact they ought to aſſiſt it. The explanation which it is requiſite for the profeſſor to give upon one ſubject, weakens and calls off the attention of thoſe who purſue another. The attention of the tutor is kept perpetually on the ſtretch; having to anſwer in ſucceſſion queſtions upon topics totally unconnected with each other, his mind is more diſtracted, and his temper more tried: beſides, are not habits of a deſultory nature unavoidably formed in young men, from the neceſſity which ſuch a practice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035626_0013_1006114E919A35D8"/>every tutor to, of hearing ſeveral different claſſes at the ſame time? It is equally impoſſible for him to make thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, which are neceſſary to correct the taſte or enlarge the mind.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, I preſume it will be evident, that where a definite number aſſemble to attend to the ſame object, at the ſame meeting, according to the plan I am going to lay down, none of theſe diſadvantages can take place. I will ſuppoſe then, the tutor provided with the beſt text books the country will afford, for the branches of this courſe. At the cloſe of the period allotted to each claſs, let him explain a part of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary treatiſe; let every pupil be obliged to commit this to memory, in readineſs for the next meeting; let them repeat it memoritor, or give the ideas in their own language; let them be obliged to prove that they underſtand principles, by giving diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified examples in converſation and writing. This exerciſe will add new force to the memory by enlightening the underſtanding. At ſhort ſtated intervals there ſhould be a regular cloſe examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole learnt within that period. The ſciences ſhould be inſtilled by the Socratic mode of converſation and memory; the arts by numerous exerciſes to form the requiſite habits; the reaſon of every practice ſhould be ſcrupulouſly pointed out, and the tutor ſhould never deſiſt, till the ſcholar has given proof of <hi>real knowledge.</hi> By proceeding on ſuch a plan, the evils of our common day-ſchools will be obviated, and the time requiſite for any particular branch may be calculated. When a wiſe man undertakes a journey, he firſt determines upon the moſt expeditious way of arriving at the end, and ſecuring the object of it. If a guide be neceſſary, he will chuſe one who is beſt acquainted with the road.</p>
            <p>Such is the method in which I think education ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted. But aware of the force of prejudice and the reluctance parents would feel to their children not being employed the whole of the day, under the eye of a tutor, I propoſe to execute the above courſe by a morning and afternoon ſchool, as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and to divide into 5 Claſſes.</p>
            <div type="curriculum">
               <head>CLASS I.</head>
               <p>Will include the art of reading different ſpecies of proſe and poetry, elocution, writing, and the grammar of the Engliſh language. This will ſuit children from 6 to 8 or 10 years of age. As all knowledge begins with particular facts, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are univerſally moſt intereſted by them, their books will
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035626_0014_1006115048760FB8"/>relate to natural hiſtory, civil and religious biography, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of things, cuſtoms, moral principles as taught by fables and other ſpecies of writing accommodated to their tender age. To the art of reading will ſucceed the Engliſh grammar. As lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is not only a mean of mental improvement, but of ſocial communication, and, on a knowledge of our <hi>own,</hi> muſt be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that of the Latin, Greek and modern languages, a more than ordinary attention will be given to this. We can <hi>only go from the known to the unknown.</hi> Spelling will be connected with this. The art of writing will begin with the ſimpleſt principles. I have nothing to add to the catechiſm on this ſubject already before the public. Terms, 8 dollars per quarter; 5 dollars entrance.</p>

The eaſieſt branches ſhould be ſucceeded by the more difficult. The dead languages ſhould follow our own, and general principles an acquaintance with particular facts. Natural and civil hiſtory, biography and natural philoſophy, are the proper materials of juſt thinking. Terms, 15 dollars per quarter; 5 dollars entrance.</p>

               <p>Will conſiſt only of thoſe who learn the Latin, Greek, and French languages.—15 dollars per Quarter; 5 dollars entrance.</p>
               <p>Much has been written to abbreviate the time uſually devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to languages. Men of literature have complained with juſtice:
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035626_0015_10061152A51A0C00"/>but more remains to be done. Amongſt the grammarians who have wiſhed to remedy this evil, may be ranked Cowley and Lewis, Milton and Voſſius, Clarke and Hoadly, Johnſon and Lowe: Tanaquil Faber and Philips, have publiſhed ſome judicious obſervations on their method of teaching the learned languages. Perſons are not yet agreed which of theſe ſhould be taught firſt. Some have recommended the Hebrew. David Williams and Gregory Sharp, the Greek. But European cuſtom begins with the Latin; and there is not doubt but any modern lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage may be learnt without either, though not to that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Leaving theſe remarks as extraneous to my ſubject, I ſhall obſerve, that the only objects any man can propoſe to himſelf in learning either dead or living languages, are the three following. 1. To ſeize with preciſion the ideas the authors meant to convey. 2. To be able to compoſe in the language with grammatical propriety. Or, 3. To be able to ſpeak in them for the different purpoſes of ſocial communication. The object of the Greek and the Latin is <hi>now</hi> uſually confined to the firſt. That of the modern, as the French, frequently include all three. The only means yet diſcovered for attaining theſe ſeveral objects are reduced to the four following. 1. By accuſtoming the eye to receive impreſſions from the conſtant peruſal of authors in thoſe languages. 2. By impreſſions made on the ear in converſation, or reading an author aloud: thus good reading becomes an aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliary to juſt pronunciation, and the meaning of a language ſteals in by the ear. 3. By exerciſing ourſelves in compoſing mentally or by writing. This renders our knowledge of the conſtruction of a language more definite, and enables us to correſpond with others. 4. By daily converſation in the language. In general, we neither learn to ſpeak dead languages, nor hear them ſpoken; our object is either to underſtand or compoſe; we therefore uſually learn them by impreſſions on the eye, or by writing exerciſes.</p>
               <p>This claſs will begin with the grammar of the Latin language; a knowledge of which will be much facilitated by a previous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with that of the Engliſh. Every grammar neceſſarily conſiſts of the moſt <hi>abſtract</hi> ideas: hence children never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them without much labour, and are generally averſe to them. Few parts of learning have been leſs productive to young men than that of languages. The reaſon is evident; exerciſes of memory do not infer thoſe of the judgment; and boys uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wordy parrots and mere prating machines! A good tutor will be able to remedy this <hi>Vox et praeterea nihil.</hi> After having commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome ſhort, clear and comprehenſive grammar to memory, the pupil ſhould be able to give a rational anſwer to every queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his own words. Knowledge has its characteriſtics, and a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035626_0016_10061155202B1798"/>man of ſenſe will ſoon perceive whether his pupils have gained the object of their labour. The vocabulary will give a copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of words. Exerciſes in the firſt three parts of grammar may begin in Sententiae Pueriles, or any book conſiſting of ſhort pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod and eaſy conſtruction. To this ſhould ſucceed a courſe of <hi>proſe</hi> writers, due attention being paid to the nature of the ſtyle; ſuch as Eutropius, Florus, Cornelius Nepos, Caeſar, Quintus Curtiss, and Juſtin. The <hi>idioms</hi> of the language ſhould be carefully pointed out. The <hi>Roman Hiſtory</hi> in Engliſh, Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net's Roman Antiquities, Plutarch's Lives and Ancient Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, well digeſted. Whilſt theſe authors are analized by the application of the grammatical rules, Latin exerciſes ſhould be written for the ſame purpoſe. In ſome of the colleges of France they make uſe of a book, entitled, "Les Racines dela langue Latine," which will enable a ſcholar to decompoſe the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Hermes Anglo-Latinus is an excellent little book, and Auſonius Ropma de Differentiis verborum, would be a valuable acquiſition, to our ſchools. In tranſlating, the complete ſenſe of the writer ſhould be given, without the tireſome and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious method of taking every word ſeparately; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in no caſe be forced. As ſoon as the tutor perceives that the knowledge of conſtruction, idiom, hiſtory, &amp;c. is ſufficiently advanced, he may permit a leſs literal tranſlation. I am decidedly of opinion, that a young gentleman ſhould be conſiderably <hi>advanced in tranſlating proſe before he attempts poetry.</hi> The proſody of proſe ſhould be taught before that of poetry; and each may be learnt by a few diſtinct exerciſes, without that conſumption of time which the reading every leſſon muſt occaſion.</p>
               <p>While a pupil is applying his knowledge of <hi>figurative</hi> ſyntax by reading of Phoedrus, or Ovid, he ſhould be taught the theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of verſification; the mythology of the Romans, from Tooke's Pantheon or Spence's Polymetis; learn a ſhort treatiſe on the figures of rhetoric, and ply his Gradus ad Parnassum. Theſe will facilitate his knowledge of Virgil, Horace, Terence, Martial, Catullus, Berſius, and Juvenal. His courſe in proſe will cloſe with different treatiſes of Cicero, Suetonius, Livy, and Tacitus. If found neceſſary, the profeſſor may introduce ſome other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in the two ſpecies of compoſition; but I preſume the courſe already marked out, will be found amply ſufficient to qualify any young gentleman to apply the Roman language to any purpoſe his future circumſtances may require. To converſe, if neceſſary, with learned foreigners, will be by no means diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, as I found myſelf during my reſidence in France.</p>

               <p>The reader will perceive, that to every qualification which a wiſe and liberal ſyſtem of education aims to ſecure, there cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds ſome particular branch of knowledge. This unſecured, time, labour and expence, may be pronounced wholly and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally loſt. To prevent ſo fatal, and I am ſorry to add ſo common an evil, every tutor ſhould lay down ſuch a code of <hi>Laws,</hi> as, with the vigorous co-operation of parents, will give him the higheſt probability of ſucceſs. Theſe laws ſhould fix the attention, promote order, preſerve ſilence, inculcate manners, and infuſe a ſpirit of enquiry and the love of truth.

No one ſhould be permitted to leave his ſeat without a reaſonable cauſe, converſe on any ſubject but his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, nor learn any leſſon with an audible voice.</p>
               <p>Two pupils ſhould not be abſent at the ſame time, and no one out of the claſs-room more than five minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:035626_0018_1006115A0216B6B8"/>
Every pupil ſhould have a regular portion of labour aſſigned him for every evening.</p>
               <p>Every pupil ſhould keep a weekly account of his progreſs. Every claſs ſhould go through a weekly, monthly, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly examination.</p>
               <p>All indecorum, ariſing from reproachful names, and mutual blows, ſhould be conſidered as interruptions to the courſe of education.</p>
               <p>Every pupil, who, after repeated admonition and due report made to his parents, continues to fruſtrate the deſign of the meeting, by indolence, impudence, obſtinacy or moroſeneſs, ought to be expelled the claſs-room.</p>
               <p>Corporal puniſhment for the youth of either ſex, in a day-ſchool properly regulated, is ſeldom neceſſary, and as ſeldom effectual. The corporal puniſhment of beating, for want of memory, diſcernment, accidental inattention or mere inadvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is <hi>contemptible.</hi> The corporal puniſhment of flogging, is <hi>ſervile, immodeſt, execrable;</hi>—but too often the debaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of groveling pedagogues! Even Horace complains of one Orbilius, whom he ſurnames <hi>Plagoſus,</hi> his ſchoolmaſter, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Domitius Marſus, communicated knowledge by the <hi>ferula et ſcutica:</hi> no wonder that Suetonius ſhould denominate him a <hi>ſour man.</hi> No remedy can equally apply to all: puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſhame and neglect have often been found more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than any other. I am ſorry to add, that until our children are brought up with <hi>more rational ideas of liberty and independence,</hi> the apprehenſion of ſome puniſhment is rendered neceſſary. Want of delicacy generates impertinerce; deluſive and unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial ideas of conſequence lead to inſolence, and any opinions of liberty, of <hi>which juſtice to all mankind is not the ſoul, produce the two moſt tremendous evils,</hi> that can blaſt the comforts of a ſocial ſtate,—<hi>ruthleſs tyranny, and deſolating anarchy.</hi> If in any caſe, puniſhment by blows be found indiſpenſable, it is for ſullen ſtubbornneſs, imperious contempt, and fixed rebellion; but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, poſſeſſed of that addreſs which a know ledge of the human mind will ever give, will ſeldom be under the neceſſity of uſing any violent remedy. To bring this Proſpectus to a concluſion—</p>
               <p>If education be that inſtrument of intellectual and moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which the God of nature has put into our hands,—if its influence upon the whole of human happineſs be now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by all civilized nations of an evidence equal to intuition,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035626_0019_1005EDE8F1B37ED8"/>rendered ſo, by the fatal experience of ſo many ages, whence that deathly ſtupor that has benumbed the faculties of man? Why has its commanding energy been ſo little felt in ſociety? I anſwer, To the culpable careleſſneſs, or buſy engagements of parents, has been long united ſhameful ignorance in thoſe who ſuperintend the tuition of youth. The moſt important branch of knowledge, and that which can alone render education omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, is the leaſt cultivated, I mean, the <hi>Theory of the Mind.</hi> The diſreſpect with which the generality of teachers are treated, and the pittance of pecuniary emolument which ariſes from the profeſſion, diſcourage characters beſt qualified from embarking in it. Hence it becomes the <hi>refuge of indigence or the reſort of bankruptcy.</hi> The ancients poſſeſſed more practical wiſdom; it was with them a calling of honour. Their nobles taught gratuitouſly, and the expence of a tutor was a ſecondary conſideration. From the ignorance already mentioned, have ariſen books of all kinds the leaſt adapted to the juvenile mind, and methods directly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of the object of all education. Let theſe evils be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; let profeſſors be ſought, who know how to render truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable and virtue lovely,—who to the knowledge of man, unite the dignity of moral character,—who can inſpire a pupil with the emulation of himſelf, unalloyed by the knawing envy of another,— who can conciliate affection, ſupport authority, and habituate to ſubordination,—who can be ſevere without ſullenneſs, and familiar without degradation,—who can repreſs inſolence, fix caprice, invigorate attention, and diſtinguiſh the faults of levity from the criminality of vice,—who, mindful of the maxim of Horace, with a ſlight alteration, <hi>"Puerum rege; qui niſi paret imperat,"</hi> can ſupport authority without tyranny; while that of Seneca, <hi>"Si vis amari, ama,"</hi> teaches him to inſpire love without hypocriſy. I repeat it; let ſuch men be ſought, and receive a compenſation equal to the talents requiſite for ſuch an ardous undertaking: the dawn of a new aera will appear—magiſtrates will have leſs crimes to puniſh—parents leſs follies to bewail—good governments leſs inſurrections to fear, and the lower claſſes leſs vices to copy after. Superſtition, no longer nouriſhed by ignorance, will die to the root. Each ſex will be better fitted to be parents, and that maſs of moral and political evil, which has miſerably oppreſſed man-kind for ages, gradually mouldering away, we ſhall ſee man voluntarily ariſe to that health, innocence, and enjoyment, which a wiſe ſyſtem of education and juſt government, will infallibly crown him with.</p>
