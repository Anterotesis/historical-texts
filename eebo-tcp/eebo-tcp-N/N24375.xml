            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I CONCEIVE that it is totally unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to make any comment upon the great advantage it would be to this country to be ſupplied with all the uſeful metals from its own mines; to purchaſe which, an immenſe ſum, every one knows, is annually ſent to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</p>
            <p>Americans are an enlightened people, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry capable of judging of what is calculated to promote the true intereſt of their country.</p>
            <p>I therefore ſubmit, with much deference, the following plan and propoſals to their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a plan that I have taken full time to conſider, and am convinced of its practicability.</p>
            <p>The greateſt difficulty that I ſee will attend it is, that mining is a buſineſs that the people in general are afraid of being concerned in.</p>
            <p>I muſt, therefore, beg that my reader will lay aſide all that ſort of prejudice, while peruſing the following pages; if ſo, his reaſon will, I flatter myſelf, be convinced, and he will ſee, that mining is not ſo dangerous a buſineſs as he may have ſuppoſed it to be.</p>
            <p>The plan of forming a company with a large capital to work mines of lead, copper, coals, &amp;c.
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:032245_0003_0FF1A3EA18BECB08"/>in the United States, is not a new idea with me.</p>
            <p>Every perſon converſant with buſineſs is able to eſtimate the advantage ariſing from an aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of capital. Undertakings of great public as well-as private utility are, by this mode, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with eaſe; and by it many valuable ſources of wealth have been diſcovered. I will beg leave to note a few.</p>
            <p>The firſt veſſel fitted out in England for a whaling voyage was from the port of Hull, by a number of adventurers joining in the expenſe. Their ſucceſs was great, and, in a few years, a number of ſhips were fitted out for that trade; and there was ſcarce a huxter, or even a porter, in the town, that was not concerned.</p>
            <p>The plan was the ſame with regard to the coal-trade. Many veſſels have been fitted out from Newcaſtle and Whitehaven, on ſhares even ſo low as £5. Similar aſſociations with regard to ſhipping are very common in this country, particularly in the eaſtern ſtates, where we often find, that even the men before the maſt are in part owners. The advantage ariſing to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity is great; for theſe ſchemes give the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious poor an opportunity of employing their little ſavings to advantage, which might otherwiſe have been ſpent in riot and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>I have often, with much ſatisfaction, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated the good effects ariſing from the various aſſociations of capital in Britain; and my reaſon has long been convinced that they have been, and ſtill are, the principal ſources from whence the amazing wealth of that country flow. I know
<pb facs="unknown:032245_0004_0FF1A41AC1EEB870"/>of no purſuit where an aſſociation of capital is ſo proper as for the purpoſe of working mines; for, in general, the ſum required is great, and the riſk conſiderable. Unleſs the vein is already diſcovered, the riſk conſiſts in ſearching for it; but there is no riſk in the mines I am about to recommend, and which I ſhall prove by the moſt unqueſtionable teſtimony to be of immenſe value.</p>
            <p>I have now been near ſix years in America, the greateſt part of which time has been ſpent in making diſcoveries in the mineral kingdom, and in which I have been very ſucceſsful. I now offer to the public a plan by which they may benefit from my reſearches, looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward only to a moderate compenſation for my time and travelling expenſes. It is probable that many grammatical errors will be diſcovered by my learned reader; but he will, I am ſure, wave criticiſm, when he is informed, that the only colleges that I have had an opportunity of ſtudying in were, mines, ſmelting works, and manufactories.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE firſt mines I would recommend, are ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in Lancaſter county, Pennſylvania, five miles from Straſburgh, thirteen from Lancaſter, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five from Wilmington, fifty from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and only two miles from the turnpike road.</p>
            <p>They were diſcovered by a German, of the name of Terſey, in or before the year 1732; and in that year, the hon. John Penn, made a grant of the land where the mine was found, to the following gentlemen, for the expreſs purpoſe of having it worked, viz. governor Hamilton, judge Allen, James Logan, James Steel, and Thomas Schute, <abbr>eſq</abbr> And it alſo appears, that Mr. Penn joined in the expenſe of opening the mine, &amp;c. in doing which, they diſcovered one of thoſe uncommon vitriolic ſprings, called by the Germans, <hi>ziment waſſer,</hi> i. e. water ſtrongly impregnated with the vitriol of copper, or, as ſome writers have called them, copper ſprings; but, notwithſtanding this invaluable diſcovery, it does not appear that any of the gentlemen were acquainted with the value of the water, as no attempt appears to have ever been made to turn it to account after the European manner, which I ſhall have occaſion to deſcribe. But previous, I will, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe who may wiſh to forward my plan, ſtate the proofs I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032245_0006_0FF1A3F00415F1B8"/>of ſuch a ſpring having been actually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, in the Gap mines, when firſt opened. Theſe proofs alſo, fortunately, report the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and value of the water; and, from the great ability as well as reſpectability of the men, leave no doubt of the truth of the diſcovery. The report is as follows:</p>

                        <p>IN the province of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia is a copper mine, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a ſpring, that appears to have the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as that Iriſh water lately deſcribed by Dr. William Henry, and Dr. Bond, in the 47th, and 48th volumes of the philoſophical tranſactions, but is much ſharper, for it will diſſolve iron in a quarter part of the time; and we are aſſured, by the accounts tranſmitted from the proprietors of it, of the trials they have made, that it yields the ſame copper, mud, or duſt, as our crone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baun water, of the county of Wicklow, in this kingdom, (being the water above mentioned) which, being collected from bars of iron im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in it, for the purpoſe of extracting the copper from the Pennſylvania water, it produced above half pure copper, on being melted in a crucible; an experiment that requires to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, in order to aſcertain the proportion of copper contained, with accuracy; our copper ſpring, of the county of Wicklow, yielding a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032245_0007_0FF1A420B2071D18"/>proportion conſiderably larger than this, viz. ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen parts of copper out of twenty of the mud.</p>
                        <p>In the neighbourhood is a great abundance of the ores of vitriol and ſulphur, and the ſpring comes through an immenſe body of vitriol ore, and the ſupply of water is very large; 700 or 800 hogſheads flowing in 24 hours. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of a pale green colour, of an acid, ſweet, auſtere, inky, and nauſeous taſte.</p>
                        <p>But the genuine quality, as well as large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the impregnating ſalt, will further appear by the following analyſis of this water, viz. a pint of it exhaled by a ſlow fire, left 400 grains of ſolid contents, which were partly green, and partly ochre coloured, with an intermixture of bluiſh, and of a rough ſweetiſh taſte, like that of ſal martis, and appeared to be chiefly ſaline, not leaving above four grains of indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble matter, on diſſolving 196 grains of it and filtring.</p>
                        <p>Thus it appears, that the proportion of vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic parts in this water is very large, viz. above ſix drachms to a pint, or 3200 grains to a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon; and, conſequently, it is a ſtronger ſolution of vitriol than ſea water is of marine ſalt; and moreover is, truly, conſiderably the ſtrongeſt of all the vitriolic waters that have yet occurred to my obſervation; for, our Cronebaun water, in the county of Wicklow, gives but 256 grains from a gallon; Haigh, in Lancaſhire, (the ſtrongeſt in Britain, that I know of) 1920 grains; Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, 1320; Kilbrew, in the county of Mealth, 1530, from the ſame quantity; ſo that, beſides the copper to be obtained by immerſing bars of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032245_0008_0FF1A3F2FA623290"/>iron, as in our county of Wicklow water, this water offers to its proprietors another peculiar advantage, viz. an opportunity of erecting a copperas work, or manufacture, of vitriol; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, the vaſt ſupply of water, and plenty of fuel in the place, conſidered.</p>

                        <p>THIS IS TO CERTIFY, to whom it may concern, that we the ſubſcribers were frequently at the copper mines in Lancaſter county, known by the name of the Gap mine, during the time the ſaid mine was working by James Logan and Co.; and, from hearing the people often talking of the water turning iron into copper, we have very often, when at the mines, put the blade of our knives into the water as it came from the pumps, which, in a few minutes, would be covered with copper. A negro, called black Ned, took advantage of this circumſtance and fixed a large trough in ſuch manner that part of the water from the pumps uſed to run through the ſame. In this trough he put pieces of old iron, which the water (as then underſtood) turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into copper, of which he uſed to make buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, handles for knives, and other ſmall articles. This negro was a ſmith by trade, and was ſaid to be a very ingenious man.</p>
                        <p>And we further certify, that we have often ſeen quantities of the ore got in this mine, and frequently heard the miners ſay, that it was a very rich mine, if the water could be kept down ſo as they could work conſtantly. At this time, there were eight pumps working in the pit, which turned out ſo much water that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed a meadow, and deſtroyed the graſs ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually that moſt of the places the water uſed to cover, are barren at this time. The ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was alſo ſuppoſed to kill the fiſh, as they were at that time deſtroyed for ſeveral miles down the creek.</p>

                        <p>I HAVE to lament that the Gap mine cannot be worked upon terms worthy of its conſequence, in my opinion, unleſs advances larger than my preſent engagements permit, can be brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. I viſited the work, you know, when one of the ſhafts was nearly exhauſted; and, from the effect of the little water of the ziment kind then examined, it produced a precipitation which was promiſing indeed. From the effect of this kind of water firſt in Germany, then in Arklow, and laſtly from the artificial ziment water in the Paris mine, I am convinced, nothing could be more profitable. Could the work proceed upon proper principles, with a capital equal to erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an engine to free the works of water, and ſaving of the martial vitriol, and ſulphur, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no eſtate could equal it. How different, from purſuing a vein through a <hi>ſtony country,</hi> of incertain yield, is the proceſs of precipitation, which proceeds with little labour, whilſt we are at reſt. That the ore after roaſting and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſulphureous quality to a profit, would be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032245_0011_0FF1A426B75F5AA0"/>an object to the company, I have no doubt; but I cannot, without aid, purſue the neceſſary plan, and muſt therefore accede to a ſale of ſhares, if partners well diſpoſed to a fair experiment of public utility and fair and reaſonable profits can be procured. I therefore, Sir, agree to the ſale of ſhares, ſo as to bring to the teſt the value of that work, but without relinquiſhing all my right, and you will conſider this as the evidence of my aſſent. What number of ſhares I ſhall retain, will depend upon other circumſtances, but I believe, from my known opinion of the proſpect, you will ſuppoſe the number will be as great as I can compaſs.</p>

               <hi>As many of my readers will, I preſume, be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the value of copper ſprings, that have been diſcovered in Europe, I have conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the following extracts may give them much ſatisfaction, being from ſuch unqueſtionable and reſpectable authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'IN the year 1673, Doctor Brown viſited a famous copper mine at Hern Grundt, about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Engliſh miles from <hi>New Sol,</hi> in upper Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, and he informs us, that there he ſaw two ſprings, called the old and new ziment, which turned iron into copper, as it is vulgarly ſaid.</p>
            <p>'But the caſe is, that the iron is diſſolved by the vitriolic acid of this ſpring-water, and the copper is precipitated in its metallic form in the place of the iron.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:032245_0012_0FF1A3F7B86E80B0"/>
'It has been the cuſtom in Germany for ſome centuries, to collect the copper contained in theſe waters, by filling with them ſome pits made purpoſely for this operation. Old iron is thrown in; and, being diſſolved by the acid, is ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the water while the copper is precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the mud being raked out, is melted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in a furnace, and very fine copper is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. From 100 tons of iron, 84 and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 90 tons of fine copper is thus produced.</p>
            <p>'But although this method of obtaining cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per has been long practiſed in Germany, yet it is but of late years, ſays biſhop Watſon, (<hi>p.</hi> 238 of the firſt volume of his eſſays) that any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful attempts of this kind have been made either in England or Ireland; in the laſt, at leaſt, it was quite owing to an accident. There are the very celebrated copper mines at Arklow, in the county of Wicklow, in Ireland, and from theſe mines iſſue a great quantity of water ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impregnated with vitriol of copper. One of the workmen having accidentally left an iron ſhovel in the <hi>water</hi> he found it, ſome weeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo incruſted with a coat of copper, that it was thought to be changed into copper.</p>
            <p>'The proprietors of the mines, in purſuance of this hint, made proper pits and receptacles for the water; and have obtained, by means of ſoft iron bars put in them, ſuch quantities of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that theſe ſtreams are now of as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence as the mines themſelves.</p>
            <p>'One ton of iron produces near two tons of copper mud, and each ton of mud produces, when melted, 1600 wt. fine copper, which ſells
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032245_0013_0FF1A428579965A8"/>for £ 10 ſterling per ton more than the copper which is fluxed from the ore.</p>
            <p>'There is, in the Iſle of Angleſey, on the coaſt of North-Wales, a mountain called Paris, which abounds in copper ore, the bed of ore being above 40 feet in thickneſs. The leſees of this mine, annually raiſe from ſix to 700 tons of merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ore, and daily employ above 40 furnaces in ſmelting it. This ore contains a great quantity of ſulphur, which muſt be ſeparated by roaſting before it can be fluxed into copper.</p>
            <p>'The phlogiſton, with part of the vitriolic acid, is diperſed into the air by the force of the fire. Another part of the acid attacks and diſſolves ſuch a quantity of the copper, that the water in which the roaſted ore is waſhed (by means of old iron immerſed in it according to the German method) produces great quantities of fine cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſo that the proprietors have there obtained, in one year, near 100 tons of copper precipitated from this water.</p>
            <p>'If this water was afterwards evaporated, it would yield green vitriol, at the rate of nearly 200 tons of vitriol, for each hundred tons of iron.'</p>
            <p>I have viſited both the above mines, and know that the biſhop's ſtatements are taken from facts, and upon which I founded my calculations, <hi>See the Table.</hi> When I was at the Arklow mines in Ireland, one of the proprietors informed me, that they had then four hundred tons of iron in the different pits and reſervoirs, precipitating the copper fom the water, and that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the quantity. He alſo ſaid, that they were
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032245_0014_0FF1A3FD9DF88410"/>buying plates of caſt iron, which, if found to anſwer, would make a very great ſaving; and, ſince I came to America, I have received infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that the caſt iron did anſwer, and that they uſe no other, either at <hi>Crone Baun,</hi> or in the iſle of Angleſey.</p>
            <p>Since the diſcovery of theſe natural vitriolic waters, the proprietors of copper mines have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the hint of trying the ores after roaſting, and find that, where they are highly ſulphureous, the waters uſed to waſh them (which is done before ſmelting) always become ſufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with copper, to pay them well for their trouble and expence of precipitating it by means of iron.</p>
            <p>In my eſtimate, I have put only a ſmall value upon the ORE at the Gap mines, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quantity is immenſe, and ſimilar to the <hi>ore</hi> worked in the iſle of Angleſey. I have ſunk upon the body in ſeveral places, and always found the ore within a few feet of the ſurface, but it cannot be got in quantity until there is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine erected to pump off the water. The <hi>ore</hi> may then be raiſed with as much eaſe as the quarrying of ſtone.</p>
            <p>I have treated this ore in the ſame manner they do the ore at the Angleſey mines, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obtained a proportionate yield of copper from it; and I now ſay, that it is my candid opinion, that this body or bed of ore, may be worked to great and certain profit. But I find that it is a generally received opinion in this country, that wages are yet too high to carry on any large works to advantage. That this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032245_0015_0FF1A42B6BE5EA40"/>may be well founded, with regard to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, I admit, but that it applies with equal force to mining I deny.</p>
            <p>There is no manufactory in England but what is carried on by conſtant oppoſition of one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturer againſt another, and their firſt care is to reduce the poor workmen as low as they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can. But the mining buſineſs is carried on in a very different manner; the work is almoſt all done by <hi>bargains.</hi> When a vien of ore is diſcovered, a miner or gang of miners are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work, and the captain (i. e. the manager) and they ſettle the price per ton that ſhall be paid by the proprietors for raiſing the ore. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts are generally made for from one to three months, and they are, in fact, a continued lottery between the miners and proprietors of the mines. If the vein prove poor, then the miners make only low wages; if rich, they will make from one to five pounds ſterling per day, and that for weeks together. This is a proof, that a mine can pay great wages, and yet give great fortunes to the owners; for the managers never let a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the miners but with a certainty of gain to the proprietors.</p>
            <p>The great riſk in mining is in ſearching for the vein of ore and opening the works. A ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king proof of this was exhibited at <hi>Schuyler</hi>'s mines, near Newark, in New-Jerſey. Some years after thoſe mines were known to be very productive, a company in Briſtol (in England) to whom ſome of the ore had been ſent, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a leaſe from the owners of the land on the oppoſite ſide of the hill, where Schuyler was
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032245_0016_0FF1A3FF2962A290"/>raiſing ore in great quantities. They ſent over a number of experienced miners and other work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who continued to ſearch for the vein, until they had ſpent their employers £ 30,000, who then gave up the purſuit. All this time, Mr. Schuyler was making a large fortune, which ſhews that high wages are not ſo inimical to the working of mines in any country, if you have a good vein of ore to work upon. But I will admit that, where wages are low, you may work a poor mine to advantage, which, in a country where they are high, you might loſe money by.</p>
            <p>The fact juſt ſtated ſhews wherein the danger of working mines conſiſts, and I am ready to admit it is very great. But, at the Gap mines, there is no riſk. The ore, we know, is there in great abundance, and the vitriolic ſpring, which is of an incalculable value, I have proved, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated trials, to be in thoſe mines, and the works are now in ſuch a ſtate as to require only the aid of a machine of ſufficient power to raiſe the water ſo as to keep the pits clean. A ſteam en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, of moderate powers, will be capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this.</p>
            <p>But there are many objections to erecting a ſteam engine in this country. 1 ſt. The great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of erecting one; 2d, the conſumption of fuel; 3d, the frequent repairs; and 4th, the high wages you muſt give to an engineer to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the machine. I would, therefore, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that a level ſhould be brought up through a meadow to the mines, by which a fall of from 25 to 30 feet may be gained, and a water-wheel of 25 feet diameter will be ſufficient to works as
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032245_0017_0FF1A42FC2E74558"/>many pumps as will clear the mines of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and raiſe the copper water for uſe. There are three ſmall ſtreams in the mine lands, that may be conducted into on reſervoir, which would then, I am certain, give as much water as the machine will require to keep it conſtantly going.</p>
            <p>The machinery, on this plan, will be ſimple, and ſuch as may be made at the mines. Nor will it be ſo liable to get out of order as the works of a ſteam engine. Another advantage will be, the ſaving of fuel, which may be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated at between two and three cords per day; and further, if this plan is put in practice, the mines may be much ſooner made productive; for when the level is brought up, the bed of poor ore, before noted, will be laid dry, and may be worked to immediate profit much ſooner than if we have to wait for the erecting of a ſteam engine, and at much leſs expenſe to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It may be proper to note another circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in favour of the level, which is, that I have well-founded reaſon to ſuppoſe, that, as much ore may be raiſed in driving it as will pay a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part, if not all the expence; and, when the works are completed, the repairs would be but trifling compared with thoſe of a ſteam en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, which would be a conſtant and heavy draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back upon the company's profits. My candid opinion, therefore, is, after the moſt mature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, in favour of the level, and a machine to be worked by water.</p>
            <p>I will now, for the information of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who may be diſpoſed to join in forwarding the propoſed plan, note the</p>

                        <p>We have built a ſaw-mill, made two dams, and cut a head, tail, race, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>There is a large log-houſe for the copperas works, a large lead boiler, ſeveral ley tubs, ciſterns, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>There are a carpenter's and ſmith's ſhops, and two log-houſes for workmen.</p>
                        <p>There is a variety of tools, with pit-ropes, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes, buckets, &amp;c.; alſo, a complete ſet of boring rods, one hundred feet long.</p>
                        <p>The two main ſhafts have been cleaned out, which was attended with great trouble and difficulty, as we were obliged to work night and day on account of the water.</p>
                        <p>There is a machine to work the pumps which will be of great uſe in getting the water out until a more powerful one can be completed; and there are eight tier of pumps, two tier deep, all in good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king order. About fifty tons of are have been raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a great deal of other work done, but which I do not conceive it neceſſary for me to deſcribe.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall, therefore, only further note, that a ſmall part of the level is drove, and that two men are now at work upon it.</p>

            <p>Theſe various works have coſt our company a conſiderable ſum, as will appear by our books, and the company who firſt opened the mines muſt, I am certain, have expended at leaſt thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand dollars; ſo that the propoſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany will come in on very advantageous terms, as, by thoſe expences, the mines have been put
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032245_0019_0FF1A4314E23B488"/>in ſuch a ſtate that they only now require a ſteam or other engine to make them pay the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit I have ſtated, and with probability much greater.</p>
            <p>I will now deſcribe the works below:</p>
            <p>One of the pits is ſeven feet ſquare, the other is ſeven by five. The wide ſhaft is only about ſixty feet deep; the other is much deeper, the vitriolic water riſes fifteen feet from the bottom of the wide ſhaft, and there is forty feet of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water over it; this I have proved many times by my boring rods.</p>
            <p>When we had cleared the pits of earth and ſtones, and had the waters out, I went down. I found the main ſhaft in moſt excellent order; the frame, conſiſting of ſquared logs, laid cloſe upon each other, as in building a houſe; in ſhort, I never ſaw ſuch ſtrong work, and ſo well ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in any mine I ever was in before.</p>
            <p>I found that three drifts had been drove from the main ſhaft. One of them I ſuppoſe to be more than two hundred yards, as it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with ſome ſhafts that were ſunk upon a ſmall hill. Another extends only about twenty yards, at the end of which a ſump had been ſunken, and I found a pump that had been worked by hand in this ſump. An old man, who worked at theſe mines when firſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, told me, that he had often heard the miners ſay, that there was a very rich vien of ore in the place where the hand pump was fixed, but he ſaid, that all the contrivances they could think of were not ſufficient to keep the water down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:032245_0020_0FF1A40270EAEB30"/>
Several of the old Dutchmen who remember the firſt opening of and are ſtill living near the Gap mines, have told me, that they knew for certain, that the miners frequently met with lumps of gold; and one family has been poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out to me, who are now wealthy, and who, my informer ſaid, he knew had bought <hi>ore</hi> from the miners ſeveral times; and that this man went back to Germany, and that it was well known, that he took ſome ſmall barrels of the <hi>ore</hi> from the Gap mines with him.</p>
            <p>My informer alſo ſaid, that the man returned, and that he ſoon after bought a plantation. He alſo ſaid, that he knew all his friends in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that they were all poor, and that he was certain he could not have gotten his money any other way; that a brother of his father's (then in Germany) wrote to him to ſend him ſome <hi>ore</hi> from the ſame mine that the perſon alluded to got his from, and that it was very rich in gold.</p>
            <p>I do not bring forward this common report with a view to recommend the mines; nor do I place any dependance on the various ſtories that have been told me, of gold having been got in them—yet it is a common and well-known fact, that ſome copper <hi>ores</hi> are often rich in both gold and ſilver. The reaſon with me for men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning it is, as proof that an ore of ſome value has been found in thoſe mines; and, ſhould it only prove to be rich in copper, I ſhall not wiſh for any thing more valuable. That there was a great deal of ore raiſed, I have not the ſmalleſt doubt; nor that there is an immenſe quantity in the mines. But, be this as it may, my depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032245_0021_0FF1A432E0B805B8"/>is, and always was, upon the ſtrength of the vitriolic water. When a ſpring of this kind is once fortunately diſcovered, they have never been known to fail, and the profits ariſing from them are juſt as certain as that two and two make four.</p>
            <p>It is now one hundred and twenty-four years ſince Dr. Brown's report was made on the <hi>cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> ſpring in Hungary, and forty-one ſince Dr. Rutty's account of thoſe in Ireland, and both thoſe ſprings ſtill continue to run, and give great profits to their owners. The ſpring at Crone Baun, in Ireland, was purchaſed about eight years ago by the Liverpool company, and it was ſaid they gave £. 20,000 ſterling for them, and that, at the end of the ſecond year, they had cleared upwards of £. 40,000 ſterling by them.</p>
            <p>I now ſubmit to every candid and intelligent perſon, if there is not, in many of the common purſuits of man to gain property, as much riſk as there will be in working a mine under ſuch circumſtances as I have deſcribed. That min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in general, may be compared to a lottery I am ready to admit; but, that it may be reduced to as great a certainty as moſt other trades and occupations, I muſt alſo inſiſt upon; and, when a fortunate diſcovery is made, the adventurers acquire wealth much ſooner than by any other buſineſs that I am acquainted with. I will alſo admit, that many men have been ruined by mining; but this has been owing to their own folly, by riſking too much, which they have been allured to by the proſpect of great gains. But let me aſk, is not this alſo the caſe in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantile
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032245_0022_0FF1A4087ABDCFB0"/>world? Great ſtrokes, as they are called, are ſometimes made by great riſks, but the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, well-informed merchant, will never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them. It is the ſame in mining. A ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king inſtance, among many that I could recite, was the caſe of lord Hopeton, of Scotland. He had ſpent the greateſt part of his fortune in ſearching for a vein of lead ore on his eſtate, which ſome miners had reported to him they were certain they could find. But the chaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long, that his lordſhip's purſe began to complain, and he determined to give up the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; but the miners, being confident of ſucceſs, agreed to give their employer a month's work; the conſequence was, that, in the middle of the laſt week of the month, they came upon the vein, which was a very rich one. Lord Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton died only a few years ago, and was ſaid to be one of the richeſt men in Scotland, which he made intirely by thoſe lead mines, and they ſtill continue to be productive.</p>
            <p>It may, probably, be an objection with ſome to my plan, that the Gap mines have never been productive; but this, without preſuming too much, may I believe, be accounted for. The original company conſiſted entirely of men of great property, but not one of them appears to have had any knowledge of the mining buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; of courſe, every thing was left to mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who had no intereſt further than their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary. Under ſuch circumſtances, great underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings have generally failed.</p>
            <p>But the failure of thoſe gentlemen, becomes an advantage to thoſe who follow. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032245_0023_0FF1A437870F0D78"/>a large ſum, and proved the mines to be valuable; but, under ſuch management, had the produce been ever ſo great, they would, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, have got but little of it, and that a mine may be given up, and yet be very rich in <hi>ore,</hi> the famous Paris mine, in the iſle of Angleſey, is a proof. Several unſucceſsful attempts had been made upon this mine, before the Liverpool com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany undertook it; their property is large, and moſt of them are well ſkilled, both in the art of mining and ſmelting. A number of men were ſet to work, and they ſoon diſcovered a large body of poor copper <hi>ore;</hi> and, it appears, that they have raiſed from 6 to 7000 tons of ore every year, ſince the diſcovery, and have obtained near 100 tons of fine copper, every year, from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I have before noted. In order to ſhew that the above mine had been worked before the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpool company got a leaſe from the proprietor, (lord Uxbridge) I will mention a curious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that happened reſpecting this mine. A Mr. Griffith, a poor Welſh curate, in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over ſome old papers which had come into his hands by the death of his wife's grand-father, found an old leaſe, that had been granted by the preſent lord Uxbridge's father to ſaid Griffith's wife's grand-father, the term of which was not expired. This happened when the mines were giving up treaſure in the moſt extraordinary manner. Mr. Griffith, on this diſcovery, takes the leaſe to a Mr. Williams, an attorney, who informs him, that he thinks his right good, as his wife was the heir of her grand-father. Mr. Griffith makes this buſineſs known to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032245_0024_0FF1A40CD96A7070"/>then working the mines; but they were not diſpoſed to admit his claim. He applies to to his friend, the attorney, again, and entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an agreement with him that he ſhould have half of all he gets if he ſucceeds, but the curate to be ſubject to no coſt. The buſineſs remains in law for a conſiderable time; but the company are compelled, at laſt, to admit the poor curate's claim; by which, both he and the attorney have become men of large fortunes, and of ſome note. Williams was elected a member of parliament ſeven or eight years ago; and the curate, I have been told, thinks himſelf as good a man as any bifhop in England.</p>
            <p>Let us now conſider the neceſſity there is for the people of America to turn their thoughts to the ſubject of mining. Copper ſells now for three ſhillings per pound, and the avarage for ſix years paſt may be rated at two ſhillings and nine pence. This high price will be attributed to the wars in Europe, and I admit that they may have operated ſo as to occaſion an advance. But, was there no other reaſon, the riſe would only have been in proportion to the riſe of inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. In that caſe, the advance would only have been about four per cent.; inſtead of which we find that the riſe avarages about twenty per cent.; a ſtriking proof that there muſt be other cauſes, and, ſo far as relates to the mining intereſt in England, (in particular) they are of a more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature than the preſent war; for the fact is, that the copper mines in that country have been declining in produce for the laſt ten years, and, ſince the <hi>uſe</hi> of ſheathing and copper bolts for
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032245_0025_0FF1A43BF0BB76C0"/>ſhips have come into practice, the demand for copper has been gradually increaſing. The Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton mine, in Staffordſhire, belonging to the duke of Devonſhire, which, for upwards of twenty years, yielded a profit of from twenty to even £. 30,000 ſterling per annum, is entirely work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out. The mines in Cornwall have become much leſs productive; and the famous Paris mine, in the iſle of Angleſey, which has given ſuch immenſe fortunes to its owners, is apparently working out very faſt. Mr. Williams, who is now the principal man in theſe mines, has made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tours through different parts of Scotland within the laſt ſix years, entirely for the purpoſe of diſcovering mines; and, it was well known, that the failure of the Paris mine was the reaſon.</p>
            <p>But, whether it is owing to a failure of the mines, or the encreaſed demand for copper, the effect here will be the ſame; and, the rapid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of population in the United States, muſt add greatly to the demand. Let us, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, look back to the ſituation of this country, during the revolution, both with regard to lead and copper. The latter was frequently ſold for ten ſhillings per pound, hard money, and the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to be got, even at that price, was far ſhort of this demand. But I ſhould be ſorry to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as looking forward to deriving any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to my plan from the calamities of war. No, my hopes and prayers are, that this happy country may never experience it again; but, as the wiſdom of men have not yet diſcovered any mode of ſettling national differences, without firſt having recourſe to arms, it certainly is ſound po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032245_0026_0FF1A40E661A9BB0"/>in every nation to render itſelf as indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as poſſible of any other. Now, as this is admitted to be <hi>ſound policy</hi> among the European nations, how much ſtronger does it apply to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote countries, and, in particular, to the United States; where population has encreaſed and is encreaſing in ſo rapid a degree!</p>
            <p>The origin of commerce muſt have been from ſome nation having a ſurplus of ſundry articles, and offering thoſe articles in exchange to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation for ſomething they had to ſpare; and, probably, for ſomething the other country did not produce. This muſt have been the caſe, for the trade by barter muſt, of neceſſity, have taken place as ſoon as there was a hundred hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings in the world, but it was a long time before metal was thought of being uſed as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium for commerce. Trade is ſtill regulated by the ſame policy, from which it originated. Ports are opened and ſhut as the neceſſity occurs. This, in general, only relates to grain; but it is only a few years ago that there was an embargo laid upon copper in Britain, and this may be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the caſe, as copper is now claſſed among the articles of naval ſtores, and as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is ſo much encreaſed, in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The riſe of copper in England has alarmed the manufacturers, and ſeveral companies have been formed among that uſeful claſs of people, for the purpoſe of working mines and ſmelting the ores. In Birmingham, the company, when firſt formed, conſiſted of one hundred ſhares of £. 500 ſterling each; and no man was allowed to have more than one ſhare. The reaſon is obvious:
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032245_0027_0FF1A43EF14CF4D8"/>it was a new buſineſs with them; they therefore adopted that prudent plan in order to prevent any man from being ruined by riſking too much, which ſome men are apt to do, and particularly in <hi>mining.</hi> This undertaking ſhews the good ſenſe of thoſe who carried it into effect. The price of copper, about twenty years ago, was as low as ſeven-pence per pound ſterling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo for ſeveral years. It has ſince varied much in price, but I do not remember that it was ever down ſo low as the price noted, and it is now at ſixteen-pence per pound. I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved information that this company have been very ſucceſsful, and that a company, on a ſimilar plan, has been ſince formed in the town of Sheffield. Need I remark, that, if it was thought neceſſary by the manufacturers in Britain to pay attention to mining, that there certainly muſt be a much greater neceſſity for the manufacturers in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to do it? I will even extend the idea further, I will ſay, that it is the intereſt of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual (the importer excepted) in the United States, to join in any well formed plan for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mines of this country; and that the United States abounds with copper, lead, and iron, is notorious to every one; and I have found, by aſſay, many of the ores both of lead and cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are rich in ſilver, and ſome of the copper ores hold gold. I have diſcovered lead ores in ſeveral parts of this ſtate that are much richer than any I ever aſſayed in England. Sixty ounces of fine ſilver from a ton of lead is conſidered very rich there, but the ore I allude to, gives two hundred and forty ounces, which I have
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032245_0028_0FF1A4118B77D638"/>proved by repeated trials. Lead, in England, is refined when only containing twenty ounces; but, in that caſe, the litharge muſt be ſold; as there is, by this proceſs, an encreaſe of weight equal to ten per cent. But, if the litharge is to be reduced to lead again, a loſs of near fifteen per cent. takes place; of courſe it requires the lead to be richer in ſilver when the refiner has not a demand for all his litharge.</p>
            <p>Zinc ores are found in great quantities in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtates. Some cobalt has alſo been diſcovered, of good quality; but I never have been ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as to meet with any tin ore. However, I have no doubt but it will be diſcovered when mines are more generally ſought for. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has not been ſparing of her bounties, in this reſpect, to the United States. The Supreme Being has wiſely ordered it ſo, that, although he has created every thing for the uſe of man, yet he cannot enjoy it without induſtry, and, in many caſes, not without great exertions, both of mind and body, and in none more ſo than what relates to the working of mines. From theſe obſervations may we not conclude, that there is not in ſociety a more uſeful member than the miner; ſince all that his induſtry produces is adding to the public ſtock? It muſt alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that the plough cannot go until the miner has firſt produced the metal.</p>
            <p>I have now only to beg leave to recommend my eſtimate and plan to the ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my readers, and to aſſure them, that the views contemplated by this ſcheme are fair and honourable.</p>
