            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>Boſton.</speaker>
               <p>WE are like to be involved under great difficulties and bondage by the Projecting Gentlemen of this Town.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Charge of Incorporating this Town will be very Great, in Tranſlating of it into a City, a Town, Priſon and Keeper, a Bridewell, and keeper of Two Great Silver Maſes, to be carryed before the Mayor, and two Men to carry them; and a Sword Bearer; a Clerk of the Court; a Clerk of the Market; a Recorder; a Chamberlain; and our Paying for our Freedom, that was Free-born and in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to no Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which is worſt than all, is to the Trading part which is put under a poſſibility of being reduced to manage but one Trade, which will be great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, if not Unſupportable in its difficulties, <hi>viz.</hi> The Shop-keepers which do many of them occupy more than Twelve Trades; and the Handy crafts-men as many as their Genus and Stock do lead them to, without Interruption.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Laying us under difficulties with reſpect to our Proviſion, in that it muſt be brought into the Market, and there Pay dues and duties, and obſerve our Cuſtoms; which we believe they will not ſo long as <hi>Charleſtown</hi> and <hi>Rexbury</hi> do ſtand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The taking away the Ancient Rights, and undoubted Property of our Voting at Town Meetings, which we now injoy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Country-man.</speaker>
               <p n="1">1. I Have heard ſomething of this before. and it was reſented to me to be for the Honour and Benefit of the Town, which I ſhould be glad of, <hi>viz</hi> The Mayor and Aldermen muſt be Men of conſiderable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the World, which will be for the Honour of your Town: at the leaſt they muſt be worth a 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They will be able by this to Regulate your Town better than now it is, and to take Notice who comes into the Town; and to Let in or Keep out who they pleaſe: for they hinder by your Charter all that will not Pay 5 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> for their Freedom to the Mayor; and be alſo able to detect Vice, and to hinder ſuch Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages as have broke out of late.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhould be willing to hope that they will not lay you under thoſe difficulties with reſpect to the Trading Part of the Town, altho I confeſs it is in their Power to Reduce each Man in the Town to Occupy but one Trade.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What if you loſe your Priviledge of Voting, as long as you have Men in of Good Eſtates, and undoubted Fidelity, for they take off the trouble from you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By this you reflect upon thoſe Gentlemen that Compoſed your Charter.</p>

               <p>I Alwayes obſerved, That when any Great Project was in hand by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning and Projecting People, it was covered over with ſome plauſible Story: If you look back no further than Dr. <hi>Sacheverell</hi>'s days. That the Church was in danger under the preſent Miniſtry, when in reality it was France was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Pretender was in danger: but Experience hath taught us, That the Church hath really been in danger ever ſince that Miniſtry was turned out, until His Majeſty King GEORGE came to the Crown.</p>

                  <hi>I anſwer:</hi> I do not like the Rule of Regulating of it, not the Qualifications of Mayor &amp; Aldermen; for a Man may be worth a 1000 <abbr>

                  <hi>Sir,</hi> You miſtake again, there is no grounds for you or us to hope ſo, except you believe that Rich Coveteous Mayors will not love Money, not honeſt Mayors be bounded by the Oath of God, nor Town-Sericants willing to Serve Warrants, nor Counſollors willing to plead Caſes. Furthermore, I can aſſure you, That a Hatter in this Town which underſtands the Nature of a Corporation, I believe, better than thoſe Projecting Gentlemen did declare in my hearing, That if this Place was Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, they ſhould have a good Trade (for from that day no Shop-keeper might Sell a Hat:) and further added, That there was ſome Shop-keeper did Sell more Hats than they, which was of the Trade.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You ſay, What if your do loſe your Power of Voting at Town Meeting, as long as you have Men in of Good Eſtates and undoubted Fidelity, to take off the trouble from you.</p>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Its hard to find them amongſt us: but the common Maxim is, <hi>If you would have your work well done do it yourſelf.</hi> I obſerve in that great and laſt Speech of King WILLIAM, of Bleſſed Memory, to His Parliament, He Exhorts them to hold the Ballance of <hi>Europe</hi> in their hands; therefore I conclude, we ought to be careful how we let go the Ballance out of our hands.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You ſay, By this you reflect upon thoſe Gentlemen, even Thirty that Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Compoſed this Charter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> Tis true, and if Men will fiſh in ſuch dirty Waters, and bring or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring on their Neighbours ſuch Calamities, they ought not to think or take it hard to have dirt thrown in their Faces, for I ſee no ground to believe that they were free from Proud Spirits, and a deſire from their Places to receive Greetings in the Market Places, and Coveteous, if not of finding the Philoſophers Stone; yet to have a fellow-feeling of every bodies Pocket in the whole Town, and of being like to the Great Fiſh, of being lords over the Small, to make them to obſerve their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alſo in part to live upon them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Be careful to bring up your North Nagatives,</p>
