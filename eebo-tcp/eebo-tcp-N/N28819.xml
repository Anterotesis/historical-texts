            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>COLUMBIA this day ſits a diſconſolate mourner at the tomb, "weeping for her WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, and will not be comforted, becauſe he is not."— Death, regardleſs of his intrinſic worth, and his accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated honors, has laid him low in the duſt. That heart, which once glowed with celeſtial fire, has ceaſed to beat, and the ſhadows of the long night ſtretch over his remains. The remembrance of his goodneſs, and of his greatneſs, however, like the mild glory of the evening ſun, ſheds a placid influence of delight over the ſoul, and ſoftens it to tender regret. What tho' he has reſted from his labours, his works do follow him, and proclaim a aloud his excellence. His memory is embalmed in our boſoms, and forces from us the grateful, tho' feeble tribute of a tear—HE was, under GOD, the Grand <hi>agent</hi> in connecting us, and preſerving us— in animating us, and controuling us, during the critical period of our national infancy.—Rivalling the glory of ancient and modern names, in heroiſm &amp; ſkill, he far ſurpaſſed them in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maneneſs —in integrity—in diſintereſtedneſs. Combining in himſelf every requiſite for a model, as a Citizen, Soldier and Stateſman, HE was one of thoſe extraordinary perſonages, who ſeem born to effect great and ſurprizing revolutions.</p>
            <p>By nature fierce, and violent in his diſpoſition, his firſt conteſt was with himſelf. Fortunately for his country, his judgment gained the victory over his paſſions. This pav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the way for his future greatneſs—for who ſo fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand others, as HE who can command himſelf.—Thus calm and ſelf collected, prudence, firmneſs and moderation char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acterized every action—He had but few confidants—depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the reſources of his own mind. His judgment ſeldom deceived him—as his perception was clear, rapid and true.—His boſom was a ſtranger to envy—at leaſt HE never gave occaſion for ſlander to faſten an imputation of this kind upon his character—He cheriſhed talents where he ſaw them, and praiſed men when it was their due. Though

his <hi>own</hi> merit was diſtinguiſhed, and commanded univerſal admiration and love, yet was HE unaſſuming. He rather retired from, than obtruded himſelf upon, public view—and when HE did appear, it was the unſolicited voice of his country that had called him.</p>
            <p>View him in the walks of domeſtic life. Order and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity prevailed throughout his houſehold. Strangers, who viſited Mount Vernon, ſaw contentment &amp; tranquility pictur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every ſcene. Here licentiouſneſs was a ſtranger, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality obliged to aſſume a virtuous diſguiſe. Such was WASHINGTON's force of character, that the profligate bowed before it, and approved what they could not imitate. HE profeſſed himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian!</hi> And who will attach to him the imputation of hypocriſy? His ſtrong capacious mind, no doubt, ſaw the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which, to ſupport its cauſe, muſt overturn all evidence, and reſt upon ſpeculation—uncertain as the "baſeleſs fabric of a viſion;" and his moral principles cannot but have ſhrunk back from a view of infidel practices—for where infidelity commences, ſtrict morality generally ceaſes—it then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the form of an accommodating, a verſatile philoſophy, encouraging the unreſtrained enjoyment of every vice.— Convinced that no ſociety could exiſt without <hi>religion,</hi> we heard him uniformly recommend it to his fellow-citizens—and would to GOD! that they who are now ſo furiouſly zealous, for his name, as to clamor merely for ſins of omiſſion againſt WASHINGTON, would ſo far reverence his memory, as, in this particular, to obey his precept.—It was a precept ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>example.</hi> He not only joined in the ſacred rites of <hi>religion</hi>—but he alſo preformed thoſe actions, which, as a member of ſociety, as well as a Chriſtian, he was bound to do—thus connecting what our divine Savior emphatically call "works of ſacrifice with works of mercy." To the ſtranger he was hoſpitable—to the poor, charitable—to his equals, dignified—to his inferiors, affable—to his friends, kindly affectionate—and in his dealings <hi>an honeſt man.</hi> Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thoſe rare qualifications which entitled him at all times to govern, when his lot came to be governed, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in him the prompt and obedient <hi>Citizen.</hi> To the laws and conſtituted authorities he ever paid that reſpect which was due. In his enlarged view, every ſituation in life, where virtue ruled, was honorable—With him, in fine, nothing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was too little, becauſe nothing human was too great!</p>
            <p>But, my fellow-citizens, it was not in the private walks of life that our WASHINGTON diſcovered his ſingular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted

talents. Had he not appeared on a more conſpicuous theatre, he would have had many rivals in worth—'Tis not a calm ſea, a mild ſky—but it is the ſtorm, the tempeſt, that tries the ſkill or the fortitude of the pilot: In the firſt, the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of a ſunſhine ſcenery chaſes away all apprehenſion—In the laſt, the darkened clouds, the rolling thunder, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lightening, arreſt the ſenſes, and ſpread a general confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion over the mind. Thus, alſo, in the humble vale of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſcenes that preſent themſelves to view are too u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform—the circumſtances that occur are too unintereſting to draw forth the full force of a man's character. 'Tis in the rugged and diverſified ſcenes of trouble—'Tis in the intereſting and uncommon circumſtances of danger, that the ſoul of man is arouſed—that his latent faculties are called forth into action—in fine, that he diſcovers himſelf WHAT HE IS!</p>
            <p>It was in a dreary wilderneſs—amidſt ſavage foes—in the horror and diſmay of a ſavage ſlaughter, occaſioned by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent bravery,<note n="*" place="bottom">The event here alluded was Braddock's defeat.</note> that the ſuperior genius of our HERO firſt diſplayed itſelf with uncommon ſplendor—He arreſted the progreſs of death—He reanimated his drooping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and, like another Xenophon, led his little band ſafe to Virginia, through a country moſtly inimical, and affording but few, if any neceſſaries.</p>
            <p>Though his fame was now eſtabliſhed, it had not reached its zenith. He was only advanced one grade in the climax of his greatneſs. God, who had thus favourably uſhered him into public life, was preparing new laurels to enwreathe his brows. An event ſoon occurred, embracing every thing ſingular in its commencement, difficult in its nature, ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its developement, and terrible in its conſequences, if unfavorably terminated, but glorious if otherwiſe, which called forth all the great reſources of WASHINTON, and diſplayed unto us, to his enemies, and to the world at large, his pre-eminently exalted character. This <hi>event,</hi> was that revolution in which we ſo juſtly glory, and which has laid the foundation of our national independence and conſequence. At the firſt dawn of our troubles, he took a deciſive part: It was a part adopted from a conviction of its juſtice, and ſanctioned by Nature and Nature's God. Need I mention, it was a part againſt the ill-timed—the prepoſterous—the unnatural pretenſions of Britain.—When the troubles were drawing to an awful criſis, and a reſort to arms was unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the eyes of our Rulers, attracted by the glories of a
<pb facs="unknown:038421_0006_1011E935D57F18F8"/>
riſing ſun, faſtened upon <hi>the hero of Mount Vernon,</hi> and they unanimouſly called him to head the undiſciplined armies of his country. He accepted the appointment of <hi>Commander in chief,</hi> though with diffidence—He doubted his abilities, and in thoſe doubts, was ſeen that modeſty which ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies real merit.</p>
            <p>Behold him, now in the field, directing the movements of an army, half formed, ſcarcely clothed, and with little or no ammunition—His taſk was Herculean—the labour attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it enormous!! Yet nothing could <hi>deter</hi> him from his undertaking, or intimidate him in the completion of it—nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the celebrity of Britiſh valor, maturated by repeated victories, nor the greatneſs of Britiſh reſources, increaſed by a ſeries of proſperity, nor even the imputation of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and wanton rebellion, ſo bitterly painful to a mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of its integrity. It was juſtice—the juſtice of an injured people crying for reparation, that <hi>nerved</hi> the arm of WASHINGTON, and inſpired his boſom with heroic ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. Feeling its power, and following its impulſe, he dared to oppoſe the armies of a nation, grown grey with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. His ſucceſs was aſtoniſhing, and was effected, not ſo much by bloody battles, as by ſkill and prudence, in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding off dangers when foreſeen, and ſeizing advantages when offered. His great deſire was to prevent <hi>an unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effuſion of human blood</hi>—His heart bled for the victims of war, and he has ever been ſeen to drop a tear in the midſt of battle. How unlike thoſe heroes, ſo greatly celebrated in the pages of ancient and modern ſtory! They have added tenfold to the horrors of war, by their brutality and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. And tho' they may have made themſelves praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while living—yet their memories are branded with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my—They were, undoubtedly, the deſtroyers of the human race.—Not ſo our WASHINGTON—He diſplayed, in the late conteſt an humaneneſs of diſpoſition, that forced an univerſal tribute of honor and love. The tears of the widow and the orphan, wantonly injured by him, can never have diſturbed his repoſe: but his reflections, in this particular, muſt have been "pleaſant, like the memory of paſt joys."</p>
            <p>My countrymen, need I enlarge upon his military a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements? Shall I picture to your imagination the battles won by his valor, or the advantages obtained by his ſkill? In the volume of hiſtory they are recorded, and on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of our hearts they are engraved. Though he had il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious compeers, who aſſiſted in the ſublime ſtruggle, and who are entitled to the juſt tribute of enthuſiaſtic praiſe,

yet, under God, HE was the principal inſtrument. Like a firm and maſſy pillar in a tottering fabric, he ſupported our precarious and ſinking nation. Superior to adverſity, his firmneſs never forſook him. Even when the proſpect of ſucceſs was awfully forbidding and gloomy, HE was calm and undiſmayed,

But WASHINGTON roſe ſuperior to every misfortune, and thus, when all appeared to be loſt, literally ſaved our country. Never, never can we forget our forlorn condition, when the poor remnant of our army had fled beyond the Delaware. The tempeſt of war was pouring in a main upon us—our hands hung in deſpondence— gloom ſat depicted in every face—deſpair reigned in every heart—our national exiſtence was at its laſt gaſp—it was ſtruggling in the agonies of an untimely death—When lo! guided by the God of Battles, WASHINGTON, with the ſudden and rapid force of a mountain torrent, fell upon the Britiſh at Trenton and Princeton, and put them to flight. Like Oſſian's hero, "he moved like an angry ghoſt before a cloud, when meteors encloſe him, and the dark winds are in his hands." Victory thus once more perched upon the American ſtandard, re-animated our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring country, and cauſed her to look forth with all the fond anticipations of hope. Nor was ſhe diſappointed; Heaven, in pity for her ſtruggles, which were many and great, inſpired a foreign power to ſend aſſiſtance to our coaſts. The armies and fleets of Louis the XVI ſeconded our efforts with ſuch energy, as to haſten an honorable peace. WASHINGTON directed the whole, and, like "a ſtream of many tides," rolled on in his courſe with majeſty and power, paralyzing every oppoſition. With one hand he upheld a diverſified confederation, and with the other ſmote the enemies of his country. Thus he progreſſed in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and fame, till the valor of Americans, under his guidance, forcibly wrung from Britain, what juſtice, what honor, what honeſty had not been able to obtain; and the acknowledgement of our independence rewarded our toils, our hardſhips, and our ſufferings.—At this time, had WASHINGTON had the leaſt ſpark of ambition in his boſom,

the wind of popular applauſe would have blown it into a blaze But no; ambition lurked not in him; he was the true patriot. Not all the enticements of military power, ſo long enjoyed, or the inſinuations of ſome fellow-officers, could divert him from his ſteady purpoſe. He had drawn his ſword for American freedom, and when this was obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, HE ſheathed it, magnanimouſly reſigning his command, and retiring to his eſtate. Here, fellow-citizens, were wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and reſolution diſplayed, to which hiſtory can afford no ſecond. The conduct of our chieftain was wiſe; for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs power has a tendency to corrupt the mind, and ſtrangle fellow-feeling; it affords the means of ſenſuality, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders depraved habits. Had WASHINGTON ſeized the opportunity which offered, this day would probably have been a day of rejoicing, for a tyrant would have been no more. The conduct of our chieftain was reſolute; for the love of power is one of the ſtrongeſt paſſions inherent in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature; it is coeval with the firſt exertions of reaſon, and accompanies us through all the ſtages of ſubſequent life.</p>
            <p>While in retirement, unlike thoſe turbulent ſpirits, who are ever diſſatisfied unleſs they direct public affairs, WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON was the quiet, though uſefully active citizen. He did not indulge himſelf in inglorious eaſe, but attended to the purſuits of ſcience, and the employments of agriculture. Thus, in the peaceful ſhade of his villa, he enjoyed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined luxury of an "<hi>otium cum dignitate.</hi>"</p>
            <p>His retirement, however, was ſhort. A ſenſe of duty again obliged him to take an active part on the grand theatre of life. The impotence of the old confederation was ſoon felt, and its imperfections univerſally acknowledged. The ſerpent of diſunion was charming us to ruin, and deſtruction creeping imperceptibly upon our infant nation; when, by a ſtrong, though peaceful effort, we ſtrangled the firſt, and arreſted the progreſs of the laſt. <hi>A New Conſtitution,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an armed force to impoſe it, was adopted by our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and WASHINGTON was called, by the unanimous voice of his countrymen, to the reſponſible office of ſupreme magiſtrate. The joy expreſſed on his acceptance, as you know, Americans, was unbounded. Wherever he came he was received in triumph, and, from every quarter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations were ſent, breathing nothing but gratitude, love and admiration. Theſe general applauſes, which were beſtowed upon WASHINGTON, did not inflate him with pride, as it would have done weaker minds. They were, no

doubt, pleaſing to his boſom, and had a tendency to ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late him to new diſplays of zeal and attachment to his native and newly emancipated country.</p>
            <p>HE now entered on the arduous, the difficult, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and, to him, untried duties of a <hi>ſtateſman.</hi>— He trod a path that had miſled many in its intricate wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and which, like the fabled Minotaur of old, had proved their ruin. But, like Theſeus, he eſcaped unhurt; his Ariadne was <hi>Integrity;</hi> no intrigues ſtained his politics; no corruption marked his meaſures. That ſame love for his country, that ſame regard for her welfare, which had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore diſcovered itſelf, ſtill actuated him. His ſituation was novel, and called for uncommon prudence. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of republicaniſm had never prevailed in their purity— at leaſt <hi>no modern example</hi> offered. Of courſe the idea of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional liberty, upon a republican plan, muſt have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect till our revolution. He had then no model for his conduct but his <hi>own</hi> mind. Beſides this, he preſided when the old world was horribly convulſed with <hi>war,</hi> and ſuch a war as was unexampled in the annals of hiſtory, for its atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and its woeful ſlaughter; like a tornado, it whirled through Europe with ſuch direful violence, as to root up prejudice itſelf, and threaten the diſſolution of ſociety.— Gratitude for a recent and ſplendid benefit, intereſted Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica on one ſide of the contending parties—Prudence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt forbade an interference with either. Thus critically ſituated, WASHINGTON, by his wiſdom and moderation, ſteered the veſſel of which he was pilot, ſafe through the ſtreight in which it lay, "leaving Scylla on the left, and Charybdis on the right." To ſay that he ſatisfied all his countrymen, wouuld be ſaying what experience denies.— The voice of ſome, who had a right of thinking, as well as he had a right of acting, arraigned his policy, and doubted his gratitude. The energy of that voice was, however, ſoon loſt in the remembrance of his paſt ſervices. No one could, with any juſtice, attach <hi>improper motives</hi> to him, who, under God, principally eſtabliſhed our independence, and who had ſo magnanimouſly reſiſted the allurements of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when preſented. That HE was liable to error, could not be denied. He was a <hi>man,</hi> and, as ſuch, neceſſarily imperfect. He never, however, erred upon principle. The defects of his adminiſtration, when they occurred, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not from the <hi>heart,</hi> but the <hi>head.</hi> His heart ſtill beat for his country—his affections plead all for her intereſt.— His judgment, indeed, was capable of deception, and yet ſuch was the clearneſs of his comprehenſion, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
leſs miſtakes, perhaps, than any ſtateſman that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded him. Although he ruled over a people jealous of their rights to an extreme, the exceptions to his conduct were, comparatively, ſmall. His adminiſtration, as to its general complexion, was <hi>impartial.</hi> He made no pointed invidious diſtinctions in the choice of officers. He conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf as a public character, and, of courſe, was not ſwayed by private attachments. Beſides, he knew full well that government was intended for the good of a whole community; and, as ſuch, that the ſmile of government ought to extend upon every member of that community. He had yet to learn the incomprehenſible paradox, that <hi>political opinion,</hi> which is as diverſified as human diſpoſitions, conſtitutes the alone and perfect criterion of merit, of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of morality, nay, of <hi>Chriſtianity!</hi> He graſped in his enlarged embrace the whole American nation. They were his brethren, and he felt that he was exalted above them ſolely for their good. Wealth was not his object—he only regarded it for the neceſſaries of life. You all know how he nobly refuſed compenſation for his ſervices. His great object, as a ſtateſman, was your happineſs—your proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For this he devoted his time—his faculties—his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty —his life. Deaf to the inſinuations of flattery, he was alſo regardleſs of reproach, when his actions originated in his mature judgment. The breath of popular applauſe or popular diſlike never influenced him to ſwerve from his purpoſe. A manly deciſion formed a prominent trait in his character; and yet it was tempered with ſo much <hi>modeſty,</hi> as even to diſarm the violence of party. He never arrogated any importance to himſelf, but arreſted the attention, and pointed it to the <hi>ſource</hi> of his greatneſs. His magnanimity could not ſtoop to that <hi>contemptible littleneſs</hi> of ſoul, which, in the contemplation of ſecond cauſes, forgets the Supreme Firſt Cauſe. He rendered tribute where tribute was due, and gratefully acknowledged, that GOD alone had made him great.</p>
            <p>Compare HIM with thoſe illuſtrious ſtateſmen that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded him; where will you find ſo few ſtriking defects, ſo many uncommon excellencies? We may at leaſt aſſert, that none of them exceeded, and but few rivalled him. In the ſyſtems of the ancients, we find much rudeneſs; and in thoſe of the moderns, much inconſiſtency. Both ancient and modern ſtand attainted with the charge of diſhoneſty, and both diſcovered but little ſenſe of their dependant nature.— An unmanly pride for the moſt part tinctured their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which urged them to exalt a worm to the throne of Jehovah, and made the wretched reptile arbiter of his own fate.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>WASHINGTON, advancing in the vale of years, felt fatigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the burden of public affairs, and wiſhed for eaſe in his old days. This however would not have been conſulted, if duty had ſtill required his labors—for to this he uniformly ſacrificed private feelings—But he had finiſhed the work which his country had aſſigned to him. The new gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment was organized, and bid fair for perpetuity—Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had now no charms for him—HE returned once more to the boſom of his country, and, like another Cincinnatus, reſumed his agricultural employments. This ſtep, like the reſt of his conduct, was excluſively his own. It diſplayed the man! The more we conſider it, the more admirable and uncommon does his diſintereſted patriotiſm appear. The poſſeſſion of power was here conſiſtent with duty. He might have again aſpired with the greateſt juſtice to the firſt office of his country. Our eyes were ſtill fixed upon him, to follow his movements and obey his authority—But he retired from our view, and ſecluded himſelf once more in the receſs of his dear villa.</p>
            <p>Whilſt there, his country was threatened by a foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who once were our friends, but now appeared to aſſume a hoſtile aſpect. A reſort to arms became a matter of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency. WASHINGTON was a third time called forth upon the public ſtage, and conſented to take the command of our armies. Before a new trial of his valor and prudence occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Angel of Death ſummoned him to the tribunal of his GOD! He deſended to the grave in the full bloſſom of age, "bearing his bluſhing honors thick upon him."<note n="*" place="bottom">SHAKESPEARE.</note>

            <p>In reviewing every circumſtance of WASHINGTON's life —conſidering the temptations accompanying popularity like his—the many trying and novel ſcenes in which he was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and then recollecting <hi>his uniform patriotiſm—his undevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating integrity—his unſhaken fortitude—his humane bravery— his uncommon modeſty—and, above all, the brilliant ſucceſs</hi> which attended him thro' life, we may boldly aſſert, that the world has never ſeen one ſuperior to the Hero of Mount Vernon. Others, indeed, have been ſplendidly great, but none, like him, connected moral goodneſs, in ſo great a degree, with his greatneſs. The beauties of his character are ſo many, and ſo intereſting, as to caſt the mantle of forgetfulneſs over his blemiſhes. "Illuſtrious man! to whoſe tomb poſterity ſhall come and ſay, as Pericles did over the bodies of his deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fellow ſoldiers, you are like to the divinites above us— You are no longer with us—You are known only by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which you have conferred."<note n="†" place="bottom">FLOOD—THE IRISH ORATOR.</note>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>Such was WASHINGTON, whoſe loſs we this day mourn. How ſtrange and ſad the reverſe which a year has produced! On this day, ere now, the ſound of joy re echoed through our land. It was the birth day of our Illuſtrious Favorite. But now—Righteous GOD! how ſolemn and inſtructive thy leſſons!!—now HE is gone to "that land, from whoſe bourne no traveller returns"—and inſtead of commemorating his birth, we lament his death!.... Ideas the moſt mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ruſh to our minds, and force open the flood gates of grief. He is gone from us forever. Our eyes ſhall no more ſee him till on that day, "when the Angel of the Lord, ſtanding with his one foot on the ſea, and the other on the land, ſhall lift up his hand to heaven, and ſwear by HIM that liveth forever and ever, that time ſhall be no more!.....</p>
            <p>But, Americans, although dead, his example ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and affords us emphatic leſſons, worthy of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and obedience.</p>
            <p>To you, ſoldiers, its language is, "unſheathe not your ſwords for the purpoſe of ſhedding blood, except it be for ſelf-defence, or in defence of your country, and its rights— and, in the latter caſe, keep them unſheathed, and prefer falling with them in your hands, to their relinquiſhment."<note n="*" place="bottom">WASHINGTON'S WILL.</note> In your warfare remember you are men, and add not to the miſeries of war. Avoid raſhneſs, and falſe courage. Be temperately brave, intrepid and prudent. Bear up againſt reverſes of fortune, and reſt your hopes on the God of Battles.</p>
            <p>To you, Free and Accepted Maſons, the example of WASHINGTON enforces the practice of thoſe virtues, which conſtitute the extetnal objects of your inſtitution. Let your love be without diſſimulation, and your charity not to be ſeen of the world, but to diſſipate human woe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect love to God and the precepts of Chriſtianity, with love to the Brethren and the precepts of morality. Study to ſhew yourſelves workmen that need not be aſhamed, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performing your ſeveral duties.</p>
            <p>To us, fellow-citizens, the example of WASHINGTON recommends reverence for religion, obedience to the laws, and the cultivation of ſocial love. Be upright, diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and virtuous—avoid diſſentions—annihilate the infernal ſpirit of party, and let harmony reign throughout our land.</p>
            <p>But his example, Americans, does not only inſtruct us. From his tomb a voice proceeds, impreſſive and awful, and ſpeaks to you—to me—to us all, with energy, "PREPARE TO DIE, AND MEET YOUR GOD!"</p>
