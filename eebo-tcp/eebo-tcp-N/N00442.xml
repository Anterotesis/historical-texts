            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Our Blessed Religion is wonderfully suited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our constitution, by laying before us both <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> objects to converse withal; but <hi>Quakerism,</hi> under the pretence of advancing the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Objects of Religion, goes to annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all the <hi>Sensible</hi>; so that we must have no <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> no <hi>Jesus,</hi> no <hi>Baptism,</hi> no <hi>Eucharist,</hi> no <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> but what shall be so Evaporated into Mystical Notions, as to become unto the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, altogether unintelligible, or at least unprofitable.

               <q>They are miserable Sinners, and they do those things they ought not to do?</q>
Is not this the Reflection there made upon it.
<q>And if so, then not Believers; for they that believe in Christ, are not miserable sinners, neither do those things they ought not to do.

Heretofore, at almost every Meeting, you might have seen some of them, taken with a strange <hi>Quaking,</hi> which look'd so like a <hi>Diabolical Possession,</hi> as that it well nigh produced another sort of <hi>Quaking,</hi> by the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror it gave to the Beholders of it; and <hi>Fisher</hi> in his <hi>Rusticus ad Academicos,</hi> which is in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, <hi>The Clown speaking to the Scholar,</hi> calls Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> a <hi>Blind Guide</hi> and a <hi>Bruit Beast,</hi> [a Language, befitting a <hi>Clown</hi>] for some words of his against (as the man styles it) <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duty of Quaking.</hi> But this is now grown, I suppose, a rarer thing among them; and the words of their <hi>Patric Livingston</hi> upon it are,

Friends are ceased and Friends are still, cool, and quiet, they think that the same power is not in Meetings; but oh ye Foolish Ones,— Were not all the shakings and quakings of Friends Bodies, to purge out sin? they were but for a little time, and so were quickly gone again; and the voice of the Lord was not distinctly discerned there. The stilness being come, that's a durable thing; and here the mind is brought into a capacity to discern the voice of the Lord.</q>
One would inferr from this; either that those who are of late years Converted unto <hi>Quakerism,</hi> have <hi>no Sin</hi> to purge out; or else that after their <hi>Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism</hi> they continue with their <hi>sins unpurged</hi> all their Days.

<q>If they believe just as they speak in some of their Confessions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, pray why do they oppose and reproach us for speaking of those very things?</q>
For instance, The <hi>Quakers</hi> will <hi>verbally say,</hi> that they own the man Christ Jesus, who suffered for our sins, and in the entire and perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is gone into Heaven, and shall in like manner come again.

in other places, may gather what he counts <hi>True</hi>; and I now promise you the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and finest System, we have yet had of a <hi>Quakers</hi> Divinity. He tells us, we hold <hi>False Doctrine,</hi> when we say, <hi>That God hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Counsel wholly to Writing</hi>; by which he knows, we mean, <hi>That God has not obliged us to believe or practise any thing in order to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Scriptures do not either directly or by just consequence Reveal unto us.</hi> So then, the <hi>Quaker</hi> holds. <hi>That there is part of Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> (that is, that we are to think or do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in order to our own Salvation) <hi>which we cannot learn from the Holy Scriptures.</hi> He tells us, we hold <hi>False-Doctrine,</hi> when we say, <hi>That God hath foreordained whatever cometh to pass</hi>; although he knows we affirm, <hi>That God has not by his Eternal Decree either taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the liberty of the Creature, or become the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of sin in the Creature.</hi> So then the Quaker holds, <hi>that there are some things come to pass which God has not foreordained</hi>; and so the Blessed God either do's not <hi>Fore-Know</hi> every thing, or else He do's <hi>Fore-Know</hi> something which He do's not <hi>Decree:</hi> and it must be said, that He knows things because <hi>they will be,</hi> and not that things <hi>will be</hi> because he appoints them; and His Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge must be Fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ble and Uncertain; and the Glorious First-Being is made Subordinate to, &amp; Determined by second causes. He tells us we hold <hi>False-Doctrine</hi> when we say <hi>That God hath not afforded or provided sufficiency of Grace, and means
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000563_0021_0FA70DFA378BD940"/>
of salvation to all mankind whereby they may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>; albeit we also say, <hi>That all mankind are Salvable.</hi> So then the <hi>Quaker</hi> holds, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> and <hi>Negroes,</hi> and the <hi>Pagans</hi> beyond <hi>China,</hi> have <hi>Sufficiency of Grace and means of Salvation.</hi> He therefore holds according to what <hi>Keith</hi> adds upon it, <hi>That the Light that is in every man, is sufficient to enable him to do any work acceptable to God.</hi> He must hold that there is not in the darkest corner of the <hi>Indies,</hi> a man that is <hi>Vnto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>That the satisfaction of our Lord is both sufficient for all men, and offered to all men; and that a day of patience for all men is thereby procured.</q>
So then the <hi>Quaker</hi> holds, That,
<q>Christ has Dyed for all men;</q>
And that the vertue and success of our Lords Death depends wholly upon something to be done by <hi>men themselves,</hi> which God is not the doer of: That the Death of Christ never bought that <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> for us by which the Elect are qualified to enjoy the vertue and success of it; and that <hi>Peter</hi> was no more beholden to the Merit of the Lord Jesus for his Salvation, than <hi>Judas</hi> was for his. He tells us, we hold <hi>False-Doctrine</hi> when we say
<q>That Justification is only by Christs Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness without us, imputed unto us, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Faith alone, and not by any Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness

Albeit, he cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that we think <hi>Justification</hi> is always atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Evangelical Obedience.

<q>The Graces of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication are the Instruments of obtaining Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from Christ;</q>
and so that men exercise all those Graces, before they can be <hi>Justify'd</hi>; and (as <hi>Keith</hi> also elsewhere expresses it)
<q>He who is imperfectly Sanctify'd, cannot, while such, be perfectly Justify'd; and so it seems there is not <hi>one Justify'd</hi> man alive in the world.</q>
He tells us we hold <hi>False-doctrine,</hi> when we say, <hi>That beginnings of true Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation cannot be totally fallen from</hi>; although we do also say, That every sin is <hi>Mortal</hi>; That Saints falling into grosser scandals, do bee loud the Evidences of their <hi>Saintship</hi>; That yet Saints cannot fall so far, but God will <hi>Recover</hi> them before they dy, and make them sincerely penitent.

            <p>Once more, He saies, we hold <hi>False-Doctrine,</hi> because we say,
<q>No men ever since the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles Days are assisted, by any Infallible Spirit, to Preach, Pray, and Write; and that to Speak and Pray by the Holy Ghost, as the Prophets and Holy men witnessed of old, are ceased.</q>

And yet we own special <hi>Illuminations</hi> of the Holy Spirit which the Souls of all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers do and must experience; and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that without special <hi>Assistances</hi> of the Holy Spirit, we can do no Duty as it should be done. We do not think (as <hi>Keith</hi> did a a minute or two ago) that we bring into the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000563_0024_0FA70DFC73E971A8"/>
world with us a principle that <hi>is sufficient to enable us to do any work acceptable unto God.</hi> Now the <hi>Quaker</hi> must then hold, <hi>That men in our Days have the same Inspirations and Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that were given to the Apostles of old; and may preach, pray, write, with as much Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as they.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are several other things, which <hi>Keith</hi> charges us with <hi>False-Doctrine</hi> for holding of; and what <hi>sense</hi> can there be in his charges? what is he but stark out of his wits, if he do not hold the contray for true Doctrine himself?

In that Letter he says, That he has <hi>diligently examined our Confession of Faith,</hi> and thereby <hi>Learnt</hi> what we <hi>Preach.</hi> Now [to see how he wanted the <hi>Memory</hi> so necessary for such persons] in that <hi>Confession,</hi> there is one whole <hi>Article,</hi> to assert this Doctrine,
<q>That

the Heavenliness of the matter [<hi>of the Holy Scriptures</hi>] the Efficacy of the Doctrine, the Majesty of the Style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole, the full Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very it makes of the only way of mans Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the many other Incomparable Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and the Entire Perfections thereof, are Arguments whereby it doth abundantly Evidence it self to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, <hi>Our full Perswasion and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the Infallible Truth and Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof, is from the INWARD WORK of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our Hearts.</hi>
                  </q>
If this do not prove <hi>Keith</hi> a LYAR of the first magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, there never was yet a <hi>Lyar from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi> And you shall now hear how Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he is in his <hi>Lying. I</hi> did in print Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him of this <hi>Lye,</hi> because it was in Print he vented it; but he does in Print Reply up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, <hi>Thy Affirmation is False</hi>; and adds ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lye</hi> to it; by saying, That we <hi>deny the inward Revelation of the Holy Spirit in the Hearts of the Saints.</hi> And lest here should not be <hi>Lye</hi> enough, he further says, Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> denies that <hi>the Scripture derives its Evidence from the Inward Revelation of the Holy Spirit in Mens Hearts.</hi> Whereas Dr. <hi>OWEN</hi> in the Book to which, I suppose, he refers, expresly says, <hi>That the Scripture be Received as the Word of God, there is required a twofold Efficacy of the Spirit; The First respects the</hi> Subject <hi>or the mind of man,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000563_0029_0FA70E047B781348"/>
that assents to the Authority of the Scripture.</hi> And then the Doctor spends more than four whole Pages, to tell us, That the Spirit of God communicates a <hi>Spiritual Light</hi> unto men, and with his work of <hi>Illumination</hi> takes off the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Disposition in their minds, and Effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>perswades</hi> them to receive the Truth; and therewithal gives them a Spiritual <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Tast</hi> thereof in themselves in order hereunto. Thus palpably does <hi>Keith</hi> you see cover lye with lye, and yet it <hi>Rains through</hi> after all. I durst refer it unto any sober <hi>Quaker</hi> in the world, whether <hi>Keith</hi> be not now Convicted of gross <hi>Lying in matter of Fact: I</hi> do here, <hi>in auditu quam plurimorum,</hi> charge him as an <hi>Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious lyar</hi>; and let him lay his <hi>Action</hi> against me when he please.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when <hi>Keith</hi> comes among you, you must consider him as an <hi>Impenitent Lyar,</hi> who ha's yet blasphemously Entituled, the Blessed Spirit of our God, unto his LYE. But will you then hear such a man as a <hi>Preacher of the Truth</hi>? or must you not reasonably suspect all his pretended <hi>Inspiration</hi>; I say, <hi>Beware the Geese</hi> when such creatures Preach!

Nevertheless there are such Persons who have upon them, the Direful marks, of their being <hi>Not far from the Great Transgression</hi>; and for some of them, <hi>Keith</hi> has been observable. He has been enlightned, and had formerly much of his education and conversation among the people of God; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless he is a most Infamous <hi>Apostate</hi> from the Truths and Ways of God, professed among them; and of an <hi>Apostate</hi> he is become, as far as his <hi>Chain</hi> will reach, a <hi>Persecutor</hi>; for besides all his malicious <hi>Railing,</hi> at the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of God, which the Scripture calls <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> he levels his Writings at no Design more plainly, than to get them starved of all their poor <hi>Subsistence</hi> in the world; which was <hi>Julians</hi> way of <hi>Persecution.</hi> Were the <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of Souls</hi> a Truth, you might, when you see <hi>Keith,</hi> imagine that you see <hi>Alexander the Coppersmith,</hi> alive among us, <hi>doing much harm</hi> to the Religion of which he once made, like <hi>Alexander,</hi> a no mean profession <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Now, I confess, I took that for the <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>scope</hi> of the Text; and I am deceived, if I have not the generality of Interpreters on my side. Yea, 'tis plain, that our Lord Jesus is there vindicating himself from the cursed aspersion (which <hi>Keith</hi> has cast upon the poor Servants of the Lord Jesus here) of
<q>casting out Divels by <hi>charms</hi> and <hi>spells</hi>;</q> and His Argument is from the subtilty and policy of the <hi>Devil.</hi>
For if <hi>Devils</hi> do so side with our Lord as to confirm His word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the <hi>casting out of Divels,</hi> the Devils <hi>Kingdome</hi> would be so <hi>Divided</hi> as to be quickly <hi>Ruined</hi>; but the Devil is too cunning to admit of such a Division in his Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
               <p>Whereas, <hi>Keith</hi> affirms, <hi>That Christ doth not so much as imply, That Satan is not divided against Satan.</hi> Yea, says he,
<q>'Tis utterly <hi>False,</hi> for Satan is divided oftimes against Satan; and his Kingdom is divided also.</q>
Behold, how concerned <hi>Keith</hi> is to wrest from our Blessed Jesus, the chief Argument, by

In short, I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Mystery of their CHRIST, in better Terms, than Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> has done it for them;
<q>There was an Heavenly, Spiritual, Divine Body Constituted of Flesh, Blood and Bones, in which Christ came from Heaven; and he put that Body, into the other Body of our Nature, which He took of the Virgin; and that outermost Body, He left behind, when He Ascended into Heaven, no-body knows where; and this Heavenly, Spiritual Body, is the Man Christ, which is in the Quakers; and so the Quakers are as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Christs, as ever the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> was; for they also have the Divine Nature of Christ, dwelling in a Body of Spiritual Flesh and Blood, and those their Bodies which we see, are but the outward Tabernacles of the God, and the Man Christ Jesus.</q>

But see whether in p. 55. <hi>Keith</hi> have it not, if he have any at all.

Can any thing be so <hi>Ridiculous</hi> as this man, in pag. 169. Where he finds fault with us, for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our Assemblies together, by a <hi>Bell,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we should have,
<q>A Gospel-Bell to Ring and Sound in our Hearts, and call us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</q> or have his Friends got the property of the <hi>Cynocephalus</hi> in the Temple of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Serapis</hi>? or are they qualify'd like the man in <hi>Germany,</hi> who never can speak a word, but just precisely at one a Clock?
One of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest Writers in the world, cannot forbear a <hi>Sarcasm</hi> on this occasion; he tells the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> our <hi>Bells</hi> are not <hi>carnal</hi> ones, as they call them; for if they were <hi>flesh</hi> they would never be able to sound so <hi>high</hi> and <hi>far</hi> as they do. But if the <hi>Quakers</hi> don't allow <hi>Bells,</hi> we shall see they can afford <hi>Libels</hi> before we have done; which are things that one archly derives, as being <hi>Lies,</hi> because <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>Bells</hi> because <hi>Loud.</hi> And <hi>Keith</hi> too carries about <hi>a Carnal Clapper</hi> in his head. Is it not <hi>Ridiculous</hi> to make an <hi>Invisible Work</hi> in mens hearts to be the <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of a visible Church?</hi> Is it not <hi>Ridiculous</hi> to tell us, That the <hi>Baptism</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by our Saviour and practised by his Apostles, belonged only to <hi>Johns Dispensation</hi>?

Is not the man Infatuated, when he tells us,

<q>Ye can give no Evidence in Church-History, that Infant Baptism, was practised until <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Time, past two hundred years from Christ's Resurrection.</q>
An Assertion to which there needs no Rejoinder, but what <hi>Calvin</hi> made upon them that uttered the like, <hi>In eo Foedissime Mentiuntur; siquidem nullus est Scriptor tam Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tustus, qui non ejus Originem ad Apostolorum Sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum pro certo referat.</hi> You see, No less a man than <hi>Calvin,</hi> has call'd <hi>Keith, A most fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Lyar,</hi> for so speaking; and from <hi>Calvin</hi> let him take it. The poor man doubtless thought, that our <hi>young Libraries</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> had not yet got any of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in them; but he is mistaken.

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000563_0055_0FA70E2293309CE8"/>
he says in his fourteenth Sermon on <hi>Luke, Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ones</hi> [Parvuli] <hi>are Baptised for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins</hi>; with much more to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And in his 18th. Sermon on <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> he says, <hi>Secundum Ecclesiae obsernantiam, etiam parvulis Baptismum dari</hi>; it had been a custome and usage in the Church of God. Nor is it any other than a <hi>Cavil,</hi> to object, That these and more such passages were the <hi>Interpolations</hi> of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> afterwards. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Keith</hi> may tell us, That <hi>Origen</hi> dy'd not very long before <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and he is not, such a <hi>Computer of Times,</hi> but that you may allow him a handful of <hi>Minutes</hi> to prevent or excuse the mistakes of his Chronology; I shall ask him, what Age <hi>Tertullian</hi> lived in? Whether he lived not in the Century before <hi>Cyprian?</hi> Well, Did not this very <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the People of God then <hi>made Haste</hi> for the <hi>Baptism</hi> of their Children, while their <hi>Innocens Etas,</hi> their <hi>Innocent Age</hi> was yet upon them?

When I was preparing one of my Little Books for the Press, a <hi>Devil</hi> from the mouth of a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed person threatned me with much <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace</hi> for what I was about; whereupon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, <hi>George Keith</hi> Printed a Ridiculous Pamphlet, on purpose to Revile <hi>That</hi> very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In sum, I have made these observations, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Quakerism,</hi> with which you have now seen me Combating.

I</hi> have Observ'd, Sixthly, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> like the Ancient <hi>Pharisees and Hypocrites</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by our Lord, will mightily Applaud those that are <hi>Dead,</hi> and at the very same time spend whole volleys of Curses upon the <hi>Living Saints,</hi> that are of the very same <hi>Creed</hi> and <hi>way.
