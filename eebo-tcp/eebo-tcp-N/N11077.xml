            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>COMPASSION—'tis a stranger to my heart,</l>
               <l>Or if it comes—un welcome guest depart,—</l>
               <l>Boston farewel, thy final doom is pass'd,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>North</hi> hears my prayers, and I'm recall'd at last;</l>
               <l>Sailor on high thy canvas wings display,</l>
               <l>Howl ye West winds and hurry me away;</l>
               <l>Rise boisterous clouds and bellowing from on high,</l>
               <l>Whisk me along, ye tyrants of the sky—</l>
               <l>Quick, let me leave these friendless shores that shed,</l>
               <l>Ten thousand curses on my hated head—</l>
               <l>But why so swift, why ask I gales so strong,</l>
               <l>Since conscience, cruel conscience goes along,</l>
               <l>Must conscience rack my bosom o'er the deep?</l>
               <l>I live in hell while she forbears to sleep;</l>
               <l>Come father <hi>Francis,</hi> be my heart display'd,</l>
               <l>My burden'd conscience asks thy pious aid;</l>
               <l>Come, if confession can discharge my sin,</l>
               <l>I will confess till hell itself shall grin,</l>
               <l>And own the world has found in me again,</l>
               <l>A second <hi>Nero,</hi> nay another <hi>Cain.</hi>

               <l>Your honour surely has the sense to know,</l>
               <l>Your sins are veneal—trust me when I say,</l>
               <l>Your deepest sins may all be purg'd away—</l>

               <l>Sure friar <hi>Francis</hi> can afford relief:</l>

               <l>Would scorn to bow to giddy fortune's frown,</l>

               <l>Walks his gay round and sparkles in the sun;</l>
               <l>Faints not, encircled by the ambient blaze,</l>
               <l>Tho' pestring clouds may sometimes blunt its rays</l>
               <l>But come, confession makes the conscience light,</l>
               <l>Confess, my son, and be absolv'd this night.</l>

               <l>(For tho' we whisper, heaven you know can hear)</l>
               <l>This faultless country ne'er deserv'd my hate,</l>
               <l>Just are its pleas; unmerited its fate.</l>
               <l>When <hi>North</hi> ordained me to this thankless place,</l>
               <l>My conscience rose and star'd me in the face,</l>
               <l>And spite of all I did to quench its flame,</l>
               <l>Convinc'd me I was wrong before I came—</l>
               <l>But what alas, can mortal heroes do,</l>
               <l>They are but men, as sacred writings shew—</l>

               <l>Who could a monarch's favourite wish deny?</l>
               <l>I yielded just for peace—ay faith did I—</l>
               <l>If this be sin, O tell me, reverend sage,</l>
               <l>What will alas, become of guilty <hi>Gage?</hi>

               <l>In evil hour assail'd me with temptation,</l>
               <l>To issue forth a damned proclamation,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014039_0006_0F92AC060CDC82D0"/>
What prince, what king, from <hi>Belzebub</hi> is free,</l>
               <l>He tempted <hi>Judas,</hi> and has tempted me!</l>
               <l>This, this O friar was a deadly flaw,</l>
               <l>This for the civil, founded martial law,</l>
               <l>This crime will <hi>Gage</hi> to <hi>Lucifer</hi> consign,</l>
               <l>And purgatory must for this be mine.</l>
               <l>Next—and for this I breathe my deepest sigh,</l>
               <l>Ah cruel, flinty, hard remorseless I—</l>
               <l>How could I crowd my dungeons dark and low,</l>
               <l>With wounded captives of our injur'd foe,</l>
               <l>How could my heart more hard than hardned steel,</l>
               <l>Laugh at the pangs that mangled captives feel?</l>
               <l>Why sneer'd I at may fellow men distrest,</l>
               <l>Why banish'd pity from this iron breast!</l>
               <l>O Friar, could heaven approve my acting so,</l>
               <l>Heaven still to mercy swift, to vengeance slow?—</l>
               <l>O no—you say, then cease your soothing chat,</l>
               <l>Cowards are cruel, I can instance that—</l>
               <l>But hold, why did I, when the fact was done,</l>
               <l>Deny it all to gallant WASHINGTON,</l>
               <l>Why did I stuff th' epistolary page,</l>
               <l>With vile invectives, only worthy <hi>Gage?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Come friar help—shall I recant and say,</l>
               <l>I writ my letter on a druken day?</l>
               <l>How will it sound, if men should chance to tell</l>
               <l>A drunken hero can compose so well?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <head>FRIAR.</head>
               <l>Your fears are groundless, give me all the blame,</l>
               <l>I writ the letter, you but sign'd your Name,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:014039_0007_0F92AC069C93FE88"/>
Nor let the proclamation cloud your mind,</l>
               <l>'T was I compos'd it and you only sign'd—</l>
               <l>I friar <hi>Francis</hi>—papist tho' I be,</l>
               <l>You private papists can't but value me;</l>
               <l>Your sins in <hi>Lethe</hi> shall be swallowed up,</l>
               <l>I'll clear you if you please before we sup.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <head>GAGE.</head>
               <l>Nay, clear me not—tho' I should cross the brine,</l>
               <l>And pay my vows in distant <hi>Palestine,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or land in <hi>Spain</hi> a stranger poor and bare,</l>
               <l>and rove on foot a wretched pilgrim there,</l>
               <l>And let my eyes in streams perpetual flow,</l>
               <l>Where great MESSIAH dy'd so long ago,</l>
               <l>And wash his sacred footsteps with my tears,</l>
               <l>And pay for masses fifty thousand years,</l>
               <l>All would not do—my monarch I've obey'd,</l>
               <l>And now go home, perhaps to lose my head—</l>
               <l>Pride sent me here, pride blasted in the bud,</l>
               <l>Which if it can, will build it's throne in blood,</l>
               <l>With slaughter'd millions glut it tearless eyes,</l>
               <l>And make all nature fall that it may rise,—</l>
               <l>Come let's embark, your holy whining cease,</l>
               <l>Come let's away, I'll hang myself for peace:</l>
               <l>So <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> for his murder'd Lord,</l>
               <l>In his own bosom sheath'd the deadly sword—</l>
               <l>Tho' he confess'd and wash'd his hands beside,</l>
               <l>His heart condemn'd him, and the monster dy'd.</l>
