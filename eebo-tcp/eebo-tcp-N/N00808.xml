            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000971_0006_0FAE3A2A85F884C8"/>
can perform this first Part? And with what Ease, Courage and Safety, can they both defend themselves, and offend their Enemies? Whereon the contrary, the chiefest Arms (without Exercise) become not onely toublesome Burthens unto the unskilful Bearers, but oftentimes prove hurtful and dangerous, both to themselves and others: Therefore this ought to be considered by all, who intend any profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in this part of the <hi>Art Military</hi>; that both with Art and Courage (in time of danger) Defend both their King and Country. It hath been the manner of all famous Generals to bring their Souldiers to perfection by Exercise: <hi>Vegetius</hi> saith vey well, <hi>It is not length of Life or number of Years, that teacheth the Art of War, but continual Discipline, and Exercise of Arms: Let a Souldier Serve never so many years, so long as he is Unexercised, he shall still be a raw Souldier.</hi> No man is born a Souldier naturally, one may more incline to War than another; but the skill cometh not without industry and pains.</p>
                     <p>Notable was the saying of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to his Muster-Master; <hi>Chuse you</hi> (saith he) <hi>Good Bodies, and I will make them Good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:</hi> A strong Body is most requisite in a Good Souldier, to undergo the Labours

I could have given you an account of the Exercise used in Ancient Time, and of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which have been obtained by a small number of men well Exercised, against a multitude Unskilful and Untrained: But that not being pertinent to my intent, and having too much transgressed already, I shall give next a touch upon the Definition of a <hi>Posture.</hi>

                     <p>THe noble Souldier being inquisitive after Honour is much desirous to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his place of worth and dignity<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

which he ever conceives to be as due to him as his Life: which was the reason that caused both the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Generals to be so exact and curious in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing Rewards upon all Valiant Souldiers who were deserving of the same, &amp; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to every Man's worth and Dignity, gave him precedence of place and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the others, that they might lead and direct them as occasion shall require there for.</p>
                     <p>First, Know that a File is a number of men, beginning at one Leader, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in order of followers to the last man; or from the first, which is termed a <hi>File-leader,</hi> to the last which is termed a Bringer-up.</p>
                     <p>For the number of a File, our present Discipline only allows four, though in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towns in this Province, they allow six, so that there needs no further dispute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the number of a File.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A <hi>Rank</hi> is a row of men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of <hi>Files</hi> more or less joyned together<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as when one <hi>File</hi> is laid fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>nkwiss to one another, standing shoulder to shoulder from the right-hand to the left.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the <hi>File leader</hi> ought to be the worthiest, because he not only commands his <hi>File,</hi> but makes the first on-set against his enemy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:000971_0020_0FAE3A3D8704A568"/>The <hi>Bringer up</hi> ought to be the second in place of honour, because he is the last man in the Field marching in the Reer, which upon all occasions he ought to defend.</p>
                     <p>The Half-file leader is the third in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, because he is the leader of the Reer-half-files upon their several Motions, as doubling the Front, either intire, or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal.</p>
                     <p>The last man (or Bringer-up) of the Front-half files, is the last man in Dignity; but when the <hi>Reer half files</hi> are commanded off, he hath the honour of defending the Reer.</p>
                     <p>So by this Geometrical Proportion, the whole Body is equivalent in skill &amp; worth, and as it were (and indeed ought to be) seconds the one to the other, so long as life indureth. And then it may be said of them, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth of the holy Band of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> that it was never Beaten until the Battel of <hi>Cheraean</hi>; after which Battel, <hi>Philip</hi> the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the dead bodies, and coming to the place where these three hundred lay, all close mingled one with another, &amp; struck through with the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Pikes, he wondred greatly; but hearing that it was the Band of Lovers and belov'd he wept, and said, <hi>Evilly may they perish, that suspect

                     <p>These two (I suppose) cannot be said to be points of War, but only private di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for a Watch or Garrison, the one to give notice at what time they ought to be at Rest, and the other to shew the time that the Gates should be set open, or the Watch break up.</p>
