            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

INQUIRY
INTO THE
RIGHTS of the BRITISH Colonies.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I TAKE the Liberty to address you, as the Author
of <q>The Regulations lately made concerning
the Colonies, and the Taxes imposed upon
them considered.</q> It is not to the Man,
whoever you are, that I address myself; but it is to
the Author of a Pamphlet which, according to the
Light I view it in, endeavours to fix Shackles upon
the <hi>American</hi> Colonies: Shackles which, however
nicely polished, can by no Means sit easy upon Men
who have just Sentiments of their own Rights and
Liberties.</p>
            <p>You have indeed brought this Trouble upon yourself,
for you say that <q>many Steps have been lately taken
by the Ministry to cement and perfect the necessary
Connexion between the Colonies and the Mother
Kingdom, which every Man who is sincerely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
in what is interesting to his Country will
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010244_0003_0F7E2630DFE22BA0"/>
anxiously consider the Propriety of, will inquire into
the Information, and canvas the Principles upon
which they have been adopted; and will be ready
to applaud what has been well done, condemn what
has been done amiss, and suggest any Emendations,
Improvements, or Additions, which may be within
his Knowledge, and occur to his Reflexion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Encouraged therefore by so candid an Invitation, I
have undertaken to examine, with an honest Plainness
and Freedom, whether the Ministry, by imposing Taxes
upon the Colonies by Authority of Parliament, have
pursued a wise and salutary Plan of Government, or
whether they have exerted pernicious and destructive
Acts of Power.</p>
            <p>I pretend not to concern myself with the Regulations
lately made to encourage Population in the new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions:
Time can only determine whether the
Reasons upon which they have been founded are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Maxims of Trade and sound Policy, or not.
However, I will venture to observe that if the most
powerful Inducement towards peopling those Acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is to arise from the Expectation of a Constitution
to be established in them similar to the other Royal
Governments in <hi>America,</hi> it must be a strong Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
in my Opinion, against their being settled by
<hi>Englishmen,</hi> or even by <hi>Foreigners,</hi> who do not live
under the most despotick Government; since, upon
your Principles of Colony Government, such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
will not be worth their Acceptance.</p>
            <p>The Question is whether the Colonies are represented
in the <hi>British</hi> Parliament or not? You affirm it to be
an indubitable Fact that they are represented, and from
thence you infer a Right in the Parliament to impose
Taxes of every Kind upon them. You do not insist
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010244_0004_0F7E2631906EB5F8"/>
upon the <hi>Power,</hi> but upon the <hi>Right</hi> of Parliament to
impose Taxes upon the Colonies. This is certainly a
very proper Distinction, as <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> have very
different Meanings, and convey very different Ideas:
For had you told us that the Parliament of <hi>Great
Britain</hi> have <hi>Power,</hi> by the Fleets and Armies of the
Kingdom, to impose Taxes and to raise Contributions
upon the Colonies, I should not have presumed to
dispute the Point with you; but as you insist upon the
<hi>Right</hi> only, I must beg Leave to differ from you in
Opinion, and shall give my Reasons for it.</p>
            <p>But I must first recapitulate your Arguments in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of this Right in the Parliament. You say <q>the
Inhabitants of the Colonies do not indeed choose
Members of Parliament, neither are nine Tenths of
the People of <hi>Britain</hi> Electors; for the Right of
Election is annexed to certain Species of Property,
to peculiar Franchises, and to Inhabitancy in some
particular Places. But these Descriptions comprehend
only a very small Part of the Lands, the Property
and People of <hi>Britain;</hi> all Copy-Hold, all Lease-Hold
Estates under the Crown, under the Church,
or under private Persons, though for Terms ever
so long; all landed Property in short that is not
Freehold, and all monied Property whatsoever, are
excluded. The Possessors of these have no Votes
in the Election of Members of Parliament; Women
and Persons under Age, be their Property ever so
large, and all of it Freehold, have none: The
Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> a numerous and respectable
Body of Men, whose Opulence exceeds all that
<hi>America</hi> can collect; the Proprietors of that vast
Accumulation of Wealth, the Publick Funds; the
Inhabitants of <hi>Leeds,</hi> of <hi>Halifax,</hi> of <hi>Birmingham,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010244_0005_0F7E2632B8AE7B98"/>
and of <hi>Manchester,</hi> Towns that are each of them
larger than the largest in the Plantations; many of
lesser Note, that are incorporated; and that great
Corporation the <hi>East India</hi> Company, whose Rights
over the Countries they possess fall very little short
of Sovereignty, and whose Trade and whose Fleets
are sufficient to constitute them a maritime Power,
are all in the same Circumstances: And yet are they
not represented in Parliament? Is their vast Property
subject to Taxation without their Consent? Are they
all arbitrarily bound by Laws to which they have
not agreed? The Colonies are exactly in the same
Situation; all <hi>British</hi> Subjects are really in the same,
none are actually, all are virtually, represented in
Parliament: For every Member of Parliament sits
in the House not as a Representative of his own
Constituents, but as one of that august Assembly by
which all the Commons of <hi>Great Britain</hi> are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Sum of what you advance, in all the
Pomp of Parliamentary Declamation, to prove that
the Colonies are represented in Parliament, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
subject to their Taxation; but notwithstanding
this Way of reasoning, I cannot comprehend how Men
who are excluded from voting at the Election of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament can be represented in that Assembly,
or how those who are elected do not sit in the House
as Representatives of their Constituents. These Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
appear to me not only paradoxical, but contrary
to the fundamental Principles of the <hi>English</hi> Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>To illustrate this important Disquisition, I conceive
we must recur to the civil Constitution of <hi>England,</hi> and
from thence deduce and ascertain the Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010244_0006_0F7E2633307F0A00"/>
of the People at the first Establishment of the
Government, and discover the Alterations that have
been made in them from Time to Time; and it is from
the Laws of the Kingdom, founded upon the Principles
of the Law of Nature, that we are to show the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
every Member of the State is under to pay
Obedience to its Institutions. From these Principles I
shall endeavour to prove that the Inhabitants of <hi>Britain,</hi>
who have no Vote in the Election of Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
are not represented in that Assembly, and yet
that they owe Obedience to the Laws of Parliament;
which, as to them, are constitutional, and not arbitrary.
As to the Colonies, I shall consider them afterwards.</p>
            <p>Now it is a Fact, as certain as History can make it,
that the present civil Constitution of <hi>England</hi> derives
its Original from those <hi>Saxons</hi> who, coming over to
the Assistance of the <hi>Britons</hi> in the Time of their King
<hi>Vortigern,</hi> made themselves Masters of the Kingdom,
and established a Form of Government in it similar to
that they had been accustomed to live under in their
native Country<note n="*" place="bottom">Petyt's Rights of the Com. Brady's Comp. Hist. Rapin. Squire's Inquiry.</note>; as similar, at least, as the Difference
of their Situation and Circumstances would permit.
This Government, like that from whence they came,
was founded upon Principles of the most perfect Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
The conquered Lands were divided among the
Individuals in Proportion to the Rank they held in the
Nation<note n="†" place="bottom">Caesar de Bell. Gall. Tacitus de Germ. C. 28. Temple's Misc.</note>; and every Freeman, that is, every Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,
was a Member of their Wittinagemot, or
Parliament<note n="‖" place="bottom">Tacitus de Germ. C. 11.</note>. The other Part of the Nation, or the
Non-Proprietors of Land, were of little Estimation<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. C. 25.</note>.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010244_0007_0F7E2633CFD0BC90"/>
They, as in <hi>Germany,</hi> were either Slaves, mere Hewers
of Wood and Drawers of Water, or Freedmen; who,
being of foreign Extraction, had been manumitted by
their Masters, and were excluded from the high Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
of having a Share in the Administration of the
Commonwealth, unless they became Proprietors of
Land (which they might obtain by Purchase or Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
and in that Case they had a Right to sit with the
Freemen, in the Parliament or sovereign Legislature
of the State.</p>
            <p>How long this Right of being personally present in
the Parliament continued, or when the Custom of
sending Representatives to this great Council of the
Nation, was first introduced, cannot be determined
with Precision; but let the Custom of Representation
be introduced when it will, it is certain that every
Freeman, or, which was the same Thing in the Eye
of the Constitution, every Freeholder<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Inst. 27. 4 Inst. 2.</note>, had a Right
to vote at the Election of Members of Parliament, and
therefore might be said, with great Propriety, to be
present in that Assembly, either in his own Person or
by Representation. This Right of Election in the
Freeholders is evident from the Statute 1st <hi>Hen.</hi> 5.
Ch. 1st, which limits the Right of Election to those
Freeholders only who are resident in the Counties the
Day of the Date of the Writ of Election; but yet every
resident Freeholder indiscriminately, let his Freehold
be ever so small, had a Right to vote at the Election
of Knights for his County, so that they were actually
represented: And this Right of Election continued
until it was taken away by the Statute 8th <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.
Ch. 7. from those Freeholders who had not a clear
Freehold Estate of forty Shillings by the Year at the
least.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:010244_0008_0F7E263719513B50"/>
Now this Statute was deprivative of the Right of
those Freeholders who came within the Description of
it; but of what did it deprive them, if they were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
notwithstanding their Right of Election was
taken from them? The mere Act of voting was
nothing, of no Value, if they were represented as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutionally
without it as with it: But when by the
fundamental Principles of the Constitution they were
to be considered as Members of the Legislature, and
as such had a Right to be present in Person, or to send
their Procurators or Attornies, and by them to give
their Suffrage in the supreme Council of the Nation,
this Statute deprived them of an essential Right; a
Right without which, by the ancient Constitution of
the State, all other Liberties were but a Species of
Bondage.</p>
            <p>As these Freeholders then were deprived of their
Rights to substitute Delegates to Parliament, they
could not be represented, but were placed in the same
Condition with the Non-Proprietors of Land, who
were excluded by the original Constitution from having
any Share in the Legislature, but who, notwithstanding
such Exclusion, are bound to pay Obedience to the
Laws of Parliament, even if they should consist of
nine Tenths of the People of <hi>Britain;</hi> but then the
Obligation of these Laws does not arise from their
being virtually represented in Parliament, but from a
quite different Reason.</p>
            <p>Men in a State of Nature are absolutely free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
of one another as to sovereign Jurisdiction<note n="*" place="bottom">Vattel's Law of Nature. Locke on Civil Govern. Wollaston's Rel. of Nat.</note>,
but when they enter into a Society, and by their own
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010244_0009_0F7E2637BAE12690"/>
Consent become Members of it, they must submit to
the Laws of the Society according to which they agree
to be governed; for it is evident, by the very Act of
Association, that each Member subjects himself to the
Authority of that Body in whom, by common Consent,
the legislative Power of the State is placed: But though
they must submit to the Laws, so long as they remain
Members of the Society, yet they retain so much of
their natural Freedom as to have a Right to retire from
the Society, to renounce the Benefits of it, to enter
into another Society, and to settle in another Country;
for their Engagements to the Society, and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the publick Authority of the State, do not
oblige them to continue in it longer than they find it
will conduce to their Happiness, which they have a
natural Right to promote. This natural Right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
with every Man, and he cannot justly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of it by any civil Authority. Every Person
therefore who is denied his Share in the Legislature of
the State to which he had an original Right, and every
Person who from his particular Circumstances is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from this great Privilege, and refuses to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his natural Right of quitting the Country, but
remains in it, and continues to exercise the Rights of
a Citizen in all other Respects, must be subject to the
Laws which by these Acts he <hi>implicitly,</hi> or to use your
own Phrase, <hi>virtually</hi> consents to: For Men may
subject themselves to Laws, by consenting to them
<hi>implicitly;</hi> that is, by conforming to them, by adhering
to the Society, and accepting the Benefits of its Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
as well, as <hi>explicitly</hi> and directly, in their own
Persons, or by their Representatives substituted in their
Room<note n="*" place="bottom">Wollaston's Rel. of Nat.</note>. Thus, if a Man whose Property does not
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010244_0010_0F7E2638510A6188"/>
entitle him to be an Elector of Members of Parliament,
and therefore cannot be represented, or have any Share
in the Legislature, <q>inherits or takes any Thing by
the Laws of the Country to which he has no indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
Right in Nature, or which, if he has a Right
to it, he cannot tell how to get or keep without the
Aid of the Laws and the Advantage of Society,
then, when he takes this Inheritance, or whatever
it is, <hi>with</hi> it he takes and owns the Laws that gave
it him. And since the Security he has from the
Laws of the Country, in Respect of his Person and
Rights, is the <hi>Equivalent</hi> for his Submission to them,
he cannot accept <hi>that</hi> Security without being obliged,
in Equity, to pay <hi>this</hi> Submission: Nay his very
continuing in the Country shows that he either likes
the Constitution, or likes it better, notwithstanding
the Alteration made in it to his Disadvantage, than
any other; or at least thinks it better, in his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
to conform to it, than to seek any other;
that is, he is content to be comprehended in it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it is evident that the Obligation of the
Laws of Parliament upon the People of <hi>Britain</hi> who
have no Right to be Electors does not arise from their
being <hi>virtually</hi> represented, but from a quite different
Principle; a Principle of the Law of Nature, true,
certain, and universal, applicable to every Sort of
Government, and not contrary to the common Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
of Mankind.</p>
            <p>If what you say is a real Fact, that nine Tenths of
the People of <hi>Britain</hi> are deprived of the high Privilege
of being Electors, it shows a great Defect in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Constitution, which has departed so much from
its original Purity; but never can prove that those
People are even <hi>virtually</hi> represented in Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:010244_0011_0F7E2639955CE328"/>
And here give me Leave to observe that it would be
a Work worthy of the best patriotick Spirits in the
Nation to effectuate an Alteration in this putrid Part
of the Constitution; and, by restoring it to its pristine
Perfection, prevent any <q>Order or Rank of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from imposing upon or binding the rest without
their Consent.</q> But, I fear, the Gangrene has
taken <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo deep Hold to be eradicated in these Days of
Venality.</p>
            <p>But if those People of <hi>Britain</hi> who are excluded from
being Electors are not represented in Parliament, the
Conclusion is much stronger against the People of
the Colonies being represented; who are considered by
the <hi>British</hi> Government itself, in every Instance of
Parliamentary Legislation, as a distinct People. It has
been determined by the Lords of the Privy Council
that <q>Acts of Parliament made in <hi>England</hi> without
naming the foreign Plantations will not bind them<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pur. Williams.</note>.</q>
Now what can be the Reason of this Determination,
but that the Lords of the Privy Council are of Opinion
the Colonies are a distinct People from the Inhabitants
of <hi>Britain,</hi> and are not represented in Parliament. If,
as you contend, the Colonies are <hi>exactly in the same
Situation</hi> with the Subjects in <hi>Britain,</hi> the Laws will in
every Instance be equally binding upon them, as upon
those Subjects, unless you can discover two Species of
<hi>virtual</hi> Representation; the one to respect the Subjects
in <hi>Britain,</hi> and always existing in Time of Parliament;
the other to respect the Colonies, a mere Non-Entity,
if I may be allowed the Term, and never existing but
when the Parliament thinks proper to produce it into
Being by any particular Act in which the Colonies
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010244_0012_0F7E263A0F994D28"/>
happen to be named. But I must examine the Case of
the Colonies more distinctly.</p>
            <p>It is in vain to search into the civil Constitution of
<hi>England</hi> for Directions in fixing the proper Connexion
between the Colonies and the Mother Kingdom; I mean
what their reciprocal Duties to each other are, and
what Obedience is due from the Children to the general
Parent. The planting Colonies from <hi>Britain</hi> is but of
recent Date, and nothing relative to such Plantation can
be collected from the ancient Laws of the Kingdom;
neither can we receive any better Information by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
our Inquiry into the History of the Colonies
established by the several Nations in the more early
Ages of the World. All the Colonies (except those of
<hi>Georgia</hi> and <hi>Nova Scotia</hi>) formed from the <hi>English</hi>
Nation, in <hi>North America,</hi> were planted in a Manner,
and under a Dependence, of which there is not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in all the Colonies of the Ancients; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I conceive, it must afford a good Degree of
Surprise to find an <hi>English</hi> Civilian<note n="*" place="bottom">Strahan in his Preface to Domat.</note> giving it as his
Sentiment that the <hi>English</hi> Colonies ought to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, and for no better Reason
than because the <hi>Spanish</hi> Colonies, as he says, are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by those Laws. The <hi>Romans</hi> established their
Colonies in the Midst of vanquished Nations, upon
Principles which best secured their Conquests; the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
granted to them were not always the same; their
Policy in the Government of their Colonies and the
conquered Nations being always directed by arbitrary
Principles to the End they aimed at, the subjecting the
whole Earth to their Empire. But the Colonies in
<hi>North America,</hi> except those planted within the present
Century, were founded by <hi>Englishmen;</hi> who, becoming
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010244_0013_0F7E263A90491528"/>
private Adventurers, established themselves, without
any Expense to the Nation, in this uncultivated and
almost <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ninhabited Country; so that their Case is plainly
distinguishable from that of the <hi>Roman,</hi> or any other
Colonies of the ancient World.</p>
            <p>As then we can receive no Light from the Laws of
the Kingdom, or from ancient History, to direct us
in our Inquiry, we must have Recourse to the Law of
Nature, and those Rights of Mankind which flow from
it.</p>
            <p>I have observed before that when Subjects are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of their civil Rights, or are dissatisfied with the
Place they hold in the Community, they have a natural
Right to quit the Society of which they are Members,
and to retire into another Country. Now when Men
exercise this Right, and withdraw themselves from
their Country, they recover their natural Freedom and
Independence: The Jurisdiction and Sovereignty of the
State they have quitted ceases; and if they unite, and
by common Consent take Possession of a new Country,
and form themselves into a political Society, they
become a sovereign State, independent of the State
from which they separated. If then the Subjects
of <hi>England</hi> have a natural Right to relinquish their
Country, and by retiring from it, and associating
together, to form a new political Society and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
State, they must have a Right, by Compact with
the Sovereign of the Nation, to remove into a new
Country, and to form a civil Establishment upon the
Terms of the Compact. In such a Case, the Terms
of the Compact must be obligatory and binding upon
the Parties; they must be the Magna Charta, the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Principles of Government, to this new Society;
and every Infringement of them must be wrong, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010244_0014_0F7E263D8E9E4388"/>
may be opposed. It will be necessary then to examine
whether any such Compact was entered into between
the Sovereign and those <hi>English</hi> Subjects who established
themselves in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have told us that <q>before the first and great
Act of Navigation the Inhabitants of <hi>North America</hi>
were but a few unhappy Fugitives, who had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
thither to enjoy their civil and religious Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which they were deprived of at Home.</q> If
this was true, it is evident, from what has been said
upon the Law of Nature, that they have a Right to a
civil independent Establishment of their own, and that
<hi>Great Britain</hi> has no <hi>Right</hi> to interfere in it. But you
have been guilty of a gross Anachronism in your Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,
and a great Errour in your Account of the
first Settlement of the Colonies in <hi>North America;</hi> for
it is a notorious Fact that they were not settled by Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives
from their native Country, but by Men who
came over voluntarily, at their own Expense, and
under Charters from the Crown, obtained for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
long before the first and great Act of Navigation.</p>
            <p>The first of these Charters was granted to Sir <hi>Walter
Raleigh</hi> by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> under her great Seal, and
was confirmed by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in the
Year 1684<note n="*" place="bottom">This Charter is printed at large in Hakluyt's Voyages, P. 725, Folio Edition, Anno 1589; and the Substance of it is in the 3d Vol. of Salmon's Mod. Hist. P. 424.</note>. By this Charter the whole Country to
be possessed by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> was granted to him,
his Heirs and Assigns, in perpetual Sovereignty, in as
extensive a Manner as the Crown could grant, or had
ever granted before to any Person or Persons, with full
Power of Legislation, and to establish a civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in it as near as conveniently might be agreeable to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010244_0015_0F7E263D979F8BE0"/>
the Form of the <hi>English</hi> Government and Policy thereof.
The Country was to be united to the Realm of <hi>England</hi>
in perfect LEAGUE AND AMITY, was to be within the
Allegiance of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and to be held
by Homage, and the Payment of one Fifth of all Gold
and Silver Ore, which was reserved for all Services,
Duties, and Deman<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> under this Charter, took Possession
of <hi>North America,</hi> upon that Part of the Continent
which gave him a Right to the Tract of Country which
lies between the twenty fifth Degree of Latitude and
the Gulf of <hi>St. Laurence;</hi> but a Variety of Accidents
happening in the Course of his Exertions to establish a
Colony, and perhaps being overborn by the Expense
of so great a Work, he made an Assignment to divers
Gentlemen and Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> in the 31st Year
of the Queen's Reign, for continuing his Plantation in
<hi>America.</hi> These Assignees were not more successful in
their Attempts than the Proprietor himself had been;
but being animated with the Expectation of mighty
Advantages from the Accomplishment of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
they, with others, who associated with them,
obtained new Charters from King <hi>Iames</hi> the First, in
whom all Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s Rights became vested
upon his Attainder; containing the same extensive
Jurisdictions, Royalties, Privileges, Franchises, and
Pre-eminences, and the same Powers to establish a civil
Government in the Colony, as had been granted to Sir
<hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> with an express Clause of Exemption for
ever from all Taxes or Impositions upon their Import
and Export Trade.</p>
            <p>Under these Charters the Proprietors effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted,
and happily succeeded, in planting a Colony
upon that Part of the Continent which is now called
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010244_0016_0F7E263E5CEA67A0"/>
               <hi>Virginia.</hi> This Colony, after struggling through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Difficulties, without receiving the least Assistance
from the <hi>English</hi> Government, attained to such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Perfection that in the Year 1621 a General
Assembly, or legislative Authority, was established in
the Governour, Council, and House of Burgesses, who
were elected by the Freeholders as their Representatives;
and they have continued from that Time to exercise the
Power of Legislation over the Colony.</p>
            <p>But upon the 15th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1624, King <hi>Iames</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
the Company by Proclamation, and took the
Colony under his immediate Dependence; which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
much Confusion, and created mighty Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
in the Colony lest they should be deprived of
the Rights and Privileges granted them by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
according to the Powers contained in their
Charters.</p>
            <p>To put an End to this Confusion, and to conciliate
the Colony to the new System of Government the Crown
intended to establish among them, K. <hi>Charles</hi> the First,
upon the Demise of his Father, by Proclamation the
13th of <hi>May,</hi> 1625, declared <q>that <hi>Virginia</hi> should
be immediately dependent upon the Crown; that
the Affairs of the Colony should be vested in a
Council, consisting of a few Persons of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Quality, to be subordinate and attendant to
the Privy Council in <hi>England;</hi> that he was resolved
to establish another Council in <hi>Virginia,</hi> to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to the Council in <hi>England</hi> for the Colony;
and that he would maintain the necessary Officers,
Ministers, Forces, Ammunition, and Fortifications
thereof, at his own Charge.</q> But this Proclamation
had an Effect quite different from what was intended;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010244_0017_0F7E263F1014A748"/>
instead of allaying, it increased the Confusion of the
Colony; they now thought their regular Constitution
was to be destroyed, and a Prerogative Government
established over them; or, as they express themselves
in their Remonstrance, that <q>their Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
were to be assaulted.</q> This general Disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and Dissatisfaction continued until they received a
Letter from the Lords of the Privy Council, dated
<hi>Iuly</hi> the 22d, 1634, containing the Royal Assurance
and Confirmation that <q>all their Estates, Trade,
Freedom, and Privileges, should be enjoyed by them
in as extensive a Manner as they enjoyed them before
the recalling the Company's Patent;</q> whereupon
they became reconciled, and began again to exert
themselves in the Improvement of the Colony.</p>
            <p>Being now in full Possession of the Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of <hi>Englishmen,</hi> which they esteemed more than
their Lives, their Affection for the Royal Government
grew almost to Enthusiasm; for upon an Attempt to
restore the Company's Charter by Authority of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
the General Assembly, upon the 1st of <hi>April,
1642,</hi> drew up a Declaration or Protestation, in the
Form of an Act, by which they declared <q>they never
would submit to the Government of any Company
or Proprietor, or to so unnatural a Distance as a
Company or other Person to interpose between the
Crown and the Subjects; that they were born under
Monarchy, and would never degenerate from the
Condition of their Births by being subject to any
other Government; and every Person who should
attempt to reduce them under any other Government
was declared an Enemy to the Country, and his
Estate was to be forfeited.</q> This Act, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the King at his Court at <hi>York, Iuly</hi> 5th, 1644,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010244_0018_0F7E26403538AA10"/>
drew from him a most gracious Answer, under his
Royal Signet, in which he gave them the fullest As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances
that they should be always immediately depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
upon the Crown, and that the Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should never be changed. But after the King's
Death they gave a more eminent Instance of their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
to Royal Government, in their Opposition
to the Parliament, and forcing the Parliament Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
who were sent over with a Squadron of Ships
of War to take Possession of the Country, into Articles
of Surrender, before they would submit to their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
As these Articles reflect no small Honour upon
this Infant Colony, and as they are not commonly
known, I will give an Abstract of such of them as relate
to the present Subject.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Plantation of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and all the Inhabitants
thereof, shall be and remain in due Subjection to the
Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> not as a conquered
Country, but as a Country submitting by their own
voluntary Act, and shall enjoy such Freedoms and
Privileges as belong to the free People of <hi>England.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The General Assembly as formerly shall convene,
and transact the Affairs of the Colony.</item>
               <item>3. The People of <hi>Virginia</hi> shall have a free Trade, as
the People of <hi>England,</hi> to all Places, and with all
Nations.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Virginia</hi> shall be free from all Taxes, Customs,
and Impositions whatsoever; and none shall be
imposed on them without Consent of the General
Assembly; and that neither Forts nor Castles be
erected, or Garrisons maintained, without their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Upon this Surrender of the Colony to the Parliament,
Sir <hi>W. Berkley,</hi> the Royal Governour, was removed,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010244_0019_0F7E26409FC18058"/>
and three other Governours were successively elected by
the House of Burgesses; but in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1659 Sir
<hi>William Berkeley</hi> was replaced at the Head of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by the People, who unanimously renounced
their Obedience to the Parliament, and restored the
Royal Authority by proclaiming <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d King
of <hi>England, Scotland, France, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Virginia;</hi>
so that he was King in <hi>Virginia</hi> some Time before he
had any certain Assurance of being restored to his
Throne in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Detail of the Charters, and other Acts of
the Crown, under which the first Colony in <hi>North
America</hi> was established, it is evident that <q>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonists
were not a few unhappy Fugitives who had
wandered into a distant Part of the World to enjoy
their civil and religious Liberties, which they were
deprived of at home,</q> but had a regular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
long before the first Act of Navigation, and were
respected as a distinct State, independent, as to their
<hi>internal</hi> Government, of the original Kingdom, but
united with her, as to their <hi>external</hi> Polity, in the
closest and most intimate LEAGUE AND AMITY, under
the same Allegiance, and enjoying the Benefits of a
reciprocal Intercourse.</p>
            <p>But allow me to make a Reflection or two upon the
preceding Account of the first Settlement of an <hi>English</hi>
Colony in <hi>North America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>America</hi> was no Part of the Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi>
it was possessed by a savage People, scattered through
the Country, who were not subject to the <hi>English</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
nor owed Obedience to its Laws. This inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Country was settled by <hi>Englishmen</hi> at their own
Expense, under particular Stipulations with the Crown:
These Stipulations then must be the sacred Band of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010244_0020_0F7E2641506D3B10"/>
Union between <hi>England</hi> and her Colonies, and cannot
be infringed without Injustice. But you Object that
<q>no Power can abridge the Authority of Parliament,
which has never exempted any from the Submission
they owe to it; and no other Power can grant such
an Exemption.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will not dispute the Authority of the Parliament,
which is without Doubt supreme within the Body of
the Kingdom, and cannot be abridged by any other
Power; but may not the King have Prerogatives which
he has a Right to exercise without the Consent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?
If he has, perhaps that of granting License
to his Subjects to remove into a <hi>new</hi> Country, and to
settle therein upon particular Conditions, may be one.
If he has no such Prerogative, I cannot discover how
the Royal Engagements can be made good, that <q>the
Freedom and other Benefits of the <hi>British</hi> Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</q>
shall be secured to those People who shall
settle in a new Country under such Engagements; the
Freedom, and other Benefits of the <hi>British</hi> Constitution,
cannot be secured to a People without they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from being taxed by any Authority but that of
their Representatives, chosen by themselves. This is
an essential Part of <hi>British</hi> Freedom; but if the King
cannot grant such an Exemption, in Right of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
the Royal Promises cannot be fulfilled; and
all Charters which have been granted by our former
Kings, for this Purpose, must be Deceptions upon the
Subjects who accepted them, which to say would be a
high Reflection upon the Honour of the Crown. But
there was a Time when some Parts of <hi>England</hi> itself
were exempt from the Laws of Parliament: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the County Palatine of <hi>Chester</hi> were not
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010244_0021_0F7E2643F6917F68"/>
subject to such Laws<note n="*" place="bottom">Petyt's Rights of the Commons. Kings Vale Royal of England.</note> 
               <hi>ab antiquo,</hi> because they did not
send Representatives to Parliament, but had their own
<hi>Commune Concilium;</hi> by whose Authority, with the
Consent of their Earl, their Laws were made. If this
Exemption was not derived originally from the Crown,
it must have arisen from that great Principle in the
<hi>British</hi> Constitution by which the Freemen in the Nation
are not subject to any Laws but such as are made by
Representatives elected by themselves to Parliament;
so that, in either Case, it is an Instance extremely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to the Colonies, who contend for no other
Right but that of directing their <hi>internal</hi> Government
by Laws made with their own Consent, which has been
preserved to them by repeated Acts and Declarations of
the Crown.</p>
            <p>The Constitution of the Colonies, being established
upon the Principles of <hi>British</hi> Liberty, has never been
infringed by the immediate Act of the Crown; but
the Powers of Government, agreeably to this Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
have been constantly declared in the King's
Commissions to their Governours, which, as often as
they pass the Great Seal, are <hi>new</hi> Declarations and
Confirmations of the Rights of the Colonies. Even in
the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, a Time by no Means
favourable to Liberty, these Rights of the Colonies
were maintained inviolate; for when it was thought
necessary to establish a permanent Revenue for the
Support of Government in <hi>Virginia,</hi> the King did not
apply to the <hi>English</hi> Parliament, but to the General
Assembly, and sent over an Act, under the Great Seal
of <hi>England,</hi> by which it was enacted <q>by the King's
Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Consent
of the General Assembly,</q> that two Shillings per
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010244_0022_0F7E26446FFE6C38"/>
Hogshead upon all Tobacco exported, one Shilling
and Threepence per Tun upon Shipping, and Sixpence
per Poll for every Person imported, not being actually
a Mariner in Pay, were to be paid for ever as a Revenue
for the Support of the Government in the Colony.</p>
            <p>I have taken Notice of this Act, not only because
it shows the proper Fountain from whence all Supplies
to be raised in the Colinies ought to flow, but also as
it affords an Instance that Royalty itself did not disdain
formerly to be named as a Part of the Legislature of
the Colony; though now, to serve a Purpose destructive
of their Rights, and to introduce Principles of Despotism
unknown to a free Constitution, the Legislature of the
Colonies are degraded even below the Corporation of
a petty Borough in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be admitted that after the Restoration the
Colonies lost that Liberty of Commerce with foreign
Nations they had enjoyed before that Time.</p>
            <p>As it became a fundamental Law of the other States
of <hi>Europe</hi> to prohibit all foreign Trade with their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,
<hi>England</hi> demanded such an exclusive Trade
with her Colonies. This was effected by the Act of
25th <hi>Charles</hi> 2d, and some other subsequent Acts;
which not only circumscribed the Trade of the Colonies
with foreign Nations within very narrow Limits, but
imposed Duties upon several Articles of their own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory
exported from one Colony to another. These
Acts, which imposed severer Restrictions upon the
Trade of the Colonies than were imposed upon the
Trade of <hi>England,</hi> deprived the Colonies, so far as
these Restrictions extended, of the Privileges of <hi>English</hi>
Subjects, and constituted an unnatural Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Men under the same Allegiance, born equally
free, and entitled to the same civil Rights. In this
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010244_0023_0F7E264522D30A00"/>
Light did the People of <hi>Virginia</hi> view the Act of 25th
<hi>Charles 2d,</hi> when they sent Agents to the <hi>English</hi> Court
to represent against <q>Taxes and Impositions being laid
on the Colony by any Authority but that of their
General Assembly.</q> The Right of imposing <hi>internal</hi>
Duties upon their Trade by Authority of Parliament
was then disputed, though you say it was never called
into Question; and the Agents sent from <hi>Virginia</hi> upon
this Occasion obtained a Declaration from <hi>Charles 2d</hi>
the 19th of <hi>April</hi> 1676, under his Privy Seal, that
Impositions or <q>Taxes ought not to be laid upon the
Inhabitants and Proprietors of the Colony but by the
common Consent of the General Assembly, except
such Impositions as the Parliament should lay on
the Commodities imported into <hi>England</hi> from the
Colony:</q> And he ordered a Charter to be made out,
and to pass the Great Seal, for securing this Right,
among others, to the Colony.</p>
            <p>But whether the Act of 25th <hi>Charles 2d,</hi> or any of
the other Acts, have been complained of as Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Rights of the Colonies or not, is imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial;
for if a Man of superiour Strength takes my
Coat from me, that cannot give him a Right to my
Cloak, nor am I obliged to submit to be deprived of
all my Estate because I may have given up some Part
of it without Complaint. Besides, I have proved irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably
that the Colonies are not represented in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and consequently, upon your own Position, that
no new Law can bind them that is made without the
Concurrence of their Representatives; and if so, then
every Act of Parliament that imposes <hi>internal</hi> Taxes
upon the Colonies is an Act of <hi>Power,</hi> and not of
<hi>Right.</hi> I must speak freely, I am considering a Question
which affects the <hi>Rights</hi> of above two Millions of as
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010244_0024_0F7E2645D166DD50"/>
loyal Subjects as belong to the <hi>British</hi> Crown, and must
use Terms adequate to the Importance of it; I say that
<hi>Power</hi> abstracted from <hi>Right</hi> cannot give a just Title
to Dominion. If a Man invades my Property, he
becomes an Aggressor, and puts himself into a State
of War with me: I have a Right to oppose this Invader;
If I have not Strength to repel him, I must submit,
but he acquires no Right to my Estate which he has
usurped. Whenever I recover Strength I may renew
my Claim, and attempt to regain my Possession; if I
am never strong enough, my Son, or his Son, may,
when able, recover the natural Right of his Ancestor
which has been unjustly taken from him.</p>
            <p>I hope I shall not be charged with Insolence, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
the Sentiments of an honest Mind with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
I am speaking of the <hi>Rights</hi> of a People; <hi>Rights</hi>
imply <hi>Equality</hi> in the Instances to which they belong,
and must be treated without Respect to the Dignity of
the Persons concerned in them. If <q>the <hi>British</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in <hi>Europe</hi> and in <hi>America</hi> is the same <hi>Power,</hi>
               </q>
if the <q>Subjects in both are the same People, and all
equally participate in the Adversity and Prosperity
of the Whole,</q> what Distinctions can the Difference
of their Situations make, and why is this Distinction
made between them? Why is the Trade of the Colonies
more circumscribed than the Trade of <hi>Britain?</hi> And
why are Impositions laid upon the one which are not
laid upon the other? If the Parliament <q>have a <hi>Right</hi>
to impose Taxes of <hi>every Kind</hi> upon the Colonies,</q>
they ought in Justice, as the same People, to have the
same Sources to raise them from: Their Commerce
ought to be equally free with the Commerce of <hi>Britain,</hi>
otherwise it will be loading them with Burthens at the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010244_0025_0F7E264690E14A00"/>
same Time that they are deprived of Strength to sustain
them; it will be forcing them to make Bricks without
Straw. I acknowledge the Parliament is the sovereign
legislative Power of the <hi>British</hi> Nation, and that by a
full Exertion of their Power they can deprive the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonists
of the Freedom and other Benefits of the <hi>British</hi>
Constitution which have been secured to them by our
Kings; they can abrogate all their civil Rights and
Liberties; but by what <hi>Right</hi> is it that the Parliament
can exercise such a Power over the Colonists, who have
as natural a Right to the Liberties and Privileges of
<hi>Englishmen</hi> as if they were actually resident within the
Kingdom? The Colonies are subordinate to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Parliament; subordinate I mean in Degree,
but not absolutely so: For if by a Vote of the <hi>British</hi>
Senate the Colonists were to be delivered up to the
Rule of a <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Turkish</hi> Tyranny, they may refuse
Obedience to such a Vote, and may oppose the Execution
of it by Force. Great is the Power of Parliament,
but, great as it is, it cannot, constitutionally, deprive
the People of their <hi>natural</hi> Rights; nor, in Virtue of
the same Principle, can it deprive them of their <hi>civil</hi>
Rights, which are founded in Compact, without their
own Consent. There is, I confess, a considerable
Difference between these two Cases as to the Right of
Resistance: In the first, if the Colonists should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
from the Nation by Act of Parliament, and
abandoned to another Power, they have a natural Right
to defend their Liberties by open Force, and may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
resist; and, if they are able, repel the Power to
whose Authority they are abandoned. But in the other,
if they are deprived of their civil Rights, if great and
manifest Oppressions are imposed upon them by the
State on which they are dependent, their Remedy is to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010244_0026_0F7E2647A951E568"/>
lay their Complaints at the Foot of the Throne, and
to suffer patiently rather than disturb the publick Peace,
which nothing but a Denial of Justice can excuse them
in breaking. But if this Justice should be denied, if
the most humble and dutiful Representations should be
rejected, nay not even deigned to be received, what is
to be done? To such a Question <hi>Thucydides</hi> would make
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> reply, that if <q>a decent and condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
Behaviour is shown on the Part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,
it would be base in the Mother State to press
too far on such Moderation:</q> And he would make
the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> answer, that <q>every Colony, whilst
used in a proper Manner, ought to pay Honour and
Regard to its Mother State; but, when treated with
Injury and Violence, is become an Alien. They
were not sent out to be the Slaves, but to be the
Equals of those that remain behind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, according to your Scheme, the Colonies are to
be prohibited from uniting in a Representation of their
general Grievances to the common Sovereign. This
Moment <q>the <hi>British</hi> Empire in <hi>Europe</hi> and in <hi>America</hi>
is the same Power; its Subjects in both are the same
People; each is equally important to the other, and
mutual Benefits, mutual Necessities, cement their
Connexion.</q> The next Moment <q>the Colonies
are unconnected with each other, different in their
Manners, opposite in their Principles, and clash in
their Interests and in their Views, from Rivalry in
Trade, and the Jealousy of Neighbourhood. This
happy Division, which was effected by Accident,
is to be continued throughout by Design; and all
Bond of Union between them</q> is excluded from
your vast System. <hi>Divide et impera</hi> is your Maxim in
Colony Administration, lest <q>an Alliance should be
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010244_0027_0F7E26481179A200"/>
formed dangerous to the Mother Country.</q> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
Insinuation! detestable Thought! abhorrent
to every Native of the Colonies! who, by an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Conduct, have ever demonstrated the deepest
Loyalty to their King, as the Father of his People, and
an unshaken Attachment to the Interest of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
But you must entertain a most despicable Opinion of
the Understandings of the Colonists to imagine that they
will allow Divisions to be fomented between them about
inconsiderable Things, when the closest Union becomes
necessary to maintain in a constitutional Way their dearest
Interests.</p>
            <p>Another Writer<note n="*" place="bottom">The Administration of the Colonies by Governour Pownall.</note>, fond of his new System of placing
<hi>Great Britain</hi> as the Centre of Attraction to the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
says that <q>they must be guarded against having
or forming any Principle of Coherence with each
other above that whereby they cohere in the Centre;
having no other Principle of Intercommunication
between each other than that by which they are in
joint Communication with <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as the
common Centre of all. At the same Time that they
are each, in their respective Parts and Subordinations,
so framed as to be acted by this first Mover, they
should always remain incapable of any Coherence,
or of so conspiring amongst themselves as to create
any other equal Force which might recoil back on
this first Mover; nor is it more necessary to preserve
the several Governments subordinate within their
respective Orbs than it is essential to the Preservation
of the Empire to keep them disconnected and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
of each other.</q> But how is this <q>Principle
of Coherence,</q> as this elegant Writer calls it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Colonies, to be prevented? The Colonies
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010244_0028_0F7E2648CF8CBA68"/>
upon the Continent of <hi>North America</hi> lie united to each
other in one Tract of Country, and are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to maintain their common Liberty. If he will
attend then to the Laws of Attraction in natural as well
as political Philosophy, he will find that Bodies in
Contact, and cemented by mutual Interests, cohere
more strongly than those which are at a Distance, and
have no common Interests to preserve. But this natural
Law is to be destroyed; and the Colonies, whose <hi>real</hi>
Interests are the same, and therefore ought to be united
in the closest Communication, are to be disjoined, and
all Intercommunication between them prevented. But
how is this System of Administration to be established?
Is it to be done by a military Force, quartered upon
private Families? Is it to be done by extending that
Jurisdiction of Courts of Admiralty, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
the Colonists of legal Trials in the Courts of
common Law? Or is it to be done by harassing the
Colonists, and giving overbearing Taxgatherers an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ruining Men, perhaps better Subjects than
themselves, by dragging them from one Colony to
another, before Prerogative Judges, exercising a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potick
Sway in Inquisitorial Courts? Oppression has
produced very great and unexpected Events: The
<hi>Helvetick</hi> Confederacy, the States of the <hi>United Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
are Instances in the Annals of <hi>Europe</hi> of the
glorious Actions a petty People, in Comparison, can
perform when united in the Cause of Liberty. May
the Colonies ever remain under a constitutional Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to <hi>Great Britain!</hi> It is their Interest to live
under such a Subordination; and it is their Duty, by
an Exertion of all their Strength and Abilities, when
called upon by their common Sovereign, to advance
the Grandem and the Glory of the Nation. May the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010244_0029_0F7E264B931CCAB0"/>
Interests of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and her Colonies be ever united,
so as that whilst they are retained in a legal and just
Dependence no unnatural or unlimited Rule may be
exercised over them; but that they may enjoy the
Freedom, and other Benefits of the <hi>British</hi> Constitution,
to the latest Page in History!</p>
            <p>I flatter myself, by what has been said, your Position
of a <hi>virtual</hi> Representation is sufficiently refuted; and
that there is really no such Representation known in
the <hi>British</hi> Constitution, and consequently that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
are not subject to an <hi>internal</hi> Taxation by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Parliament.</p>
            <p>I could extend this Inquiry to a much greater Length,
by examining into the Policy of the late Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which impose heavy and severe Taxes, Duties,
and Prohibitions, upon the Colonies; I could point
out some very disagreeable Consequences, respecting
the Trade and Manufactures of <hi>Britain,</hi> which must
necessarily result from these Acts; I could prove that
the Revenues arising from the Trade of the Colonies,
and the Advantage of their Exports to <hi>Great Britain</hi> in
the Balance of her Trade with foreign Nations, exceed
infinitely all the Expense she has been at, all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
she can be at, in their Protection; and perhaps
I could show that the Bounties given upon some Articles
exported from the Colonies were not intended, prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
as Instances of Attention to their Interest, but arose
as well from the Consideration of the disadvantageous
Dependence of <hi>Great Britain</hi> upon other Nations for
the principal Articles of her naval Stores, as from her
losing Trade for those Articles; I could demonstrate
that these Bounties are by no Means adequate to her
Savings in such foreign Trade, if the Articles upon
which they are given can be procured from the Colonies
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010244_0030_0F7E264C0B24AD28"/>
in Quantities sufficient to answer her Consumption; and
that the Excess of these Savings is so much clear Profit
to the Nation, upon the Supposition that these Bounties
are drawn from it; but, as they will remain in it, and
be laid out in its Manufactures and Exports, that the
whole Sum which used to be paid to Foreigners for the
Purchase of these Articles will be saved to the Nation.
I say I could extend my Inquiry, by examining these
several Matters; but as the Subject is delicate, and
would carry me to a great Length, I shall leave them
to the Reader's own Reflection.</p>
