            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>JOHN vi. 44.</bibl>
                  <p>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him.</p>
               </q>
            </head>
            <p>OUR SAVIOUR, in the preceeding parts of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had repreſented <hi>himſelf</hi> as the bread of life; and ſaid: <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> This repreſentation gave umbrage to the Jews becauſe it inſinuated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of the rites and ſacrifices of <hi>their law,</hi> to purge the conſcience; and contained a tacit reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them, for the undue confidence they had placed in the Moſaic offerings and inſtitutions. The <hi>manna,</hi> the bread which Moſes gave them in the wilderneſs, they conſidered as a teſtimony from Heaven that their religion was from GOD; and, that a careful compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the forms and modes of their worſhip, was ſufficient to bring them into the divine favour, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to them eternal life. And this teſtimony in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their religion, in feeding the <hi>whole congregation</hi> of the Jews, not only <hi>once</hi> but <hi>forty years,</hi> they viewed as more convincing and irrefragable, than any of the miracles which had been wrought by CHRIST. Our LORD lets them know, that whatever they might think of the <hi>manna</hi> that was rained down in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>HE</hi> was the true bread which came down from Heaven: And although, from a vain and proud confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb facs="unknown:012616_0003_0F8B6CF644AAFA10"/>
in their conformities to the Jewiſh ritual, <hi>they</hi> might reject him; yet all that the Father gave him ſhould come to him and believe on him, and <hi>he</hi> would give them <hi>eternal life.</hi> This brought into view the ſovreignty of GOD, in the ſalvation of ſinners, and therefore more effectually ſtung the pride of the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon which they immediately fell to murmuring, upon hearing him repreſent himſelf in the light of ſo much importance. The clearneſs of our SAVIOUR's reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the excellency of his doctrine, together with the mighty miracles which he wrought, being inſufficient to convince the obſtinate Jews, naturally brought into view the neceſſity of divine, almighty power, in order to bring men cordially to embrace him, and believe on him. Therefore he ſays, <hi>murmur not among yourſelves. No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> They were to know that the ſalvation which he offered, was all of GOD: That, as the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf was of GOD, ſo alſo was the <hi>heart</hi> to comply with the offers and propoſals of it: That, <hi>it was not of man nor in man to receive and embrace him, unleſs it were given him of</hi> GOD. This ſeems to be the import of our SAVIOUR's reaſoning, and this the true import of the text.</p>
            <p>BUT, as the terms which are here uſed to denote the neceſſity and importance of ſpecial divine influence, in order to bring men to believe on CHRIST, and embrace him, imply <hi>ſome kind of impotency</hi> in men with reſpect to <hi>coming</hi> and <hi>believing</hi>; many find it difficult to reconcile them with other parts of ſcripture, which repreſent <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence</hi> and <hi>infidelity</hi> as the <hi>greateſt of ſins.</hi> If, <hi>no man can</hi> come to CHRIST except the FATHER draw him, people cannot diſcern the <hi>criminality</hi> of remaining <hi>unbelievers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE deſign of the preſent diſcourſe is to obviate this ſeeming difficulty; and to ſhew, that <hi>the impotency there is in natural</hi> MEN <hi>to believe on</hi> CHRIST, <hi>is altogether conſiſtent with the infinite criminality of unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN order to illuſtrate the ſubject, it will be neceſſary to enquire,

                  <item>I. WHAT That impotency is in ſinners, with reſpect to coming to CHRIST, which is expreſſed by the terms <hi>no man can come to me, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. WHETHER <hi>this impotency</hi> affords any reaſonable excuſe to the ſinner, for remaining in impenitency and unbelief.</item>
                  <item>III. WHENCE ariſeth the neceſſity of divine and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, the <hi>ſpecial influences of the ſpirit of</hi> GOD, in order to bring men to repent, and believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. WE are to enquire what that <hi>impotency</hi> is, in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with reſpect to coming to CHRIST, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the terms, <hi>no man can come, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN order to right apprehenſions of the nature of that impotency, which is in fallen men, to that holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to which men are univerſally called in the word of GOD; it may be proper for us to examine into the meaning of the terms <hi>can</hi> and <hi>cannot,</hi> and enquire in what ſenſe they are generally uſed, both in the holy ſcriptures and in common language.</p>
            <p>THESE terms are ſometimes uſed in common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and I apprehend alſo in the ſacred writings, to denote only <hi>natural conſiſtency and poſſibility in the nature of things,</hi> or the reverſe. Thus we ſay an effect <hi>cannot</hi> exiſt without its cauſe; a part <hi>cannot</hi> be greater than the whole; nor the whole greater than all its parts. In a ſenſe ſimilar to this, are the terms often uſed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus <hi>Bildad</hi> ſays, <q>
                  <hi>Can</hi> the ruſh grow up without mire? <hi>Can</hi> the flag grow without water?</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job viii. 11</note> Our Saviour alſo ſays, "<hi>No man can</hi> ſerve two maſters."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Matt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i 24</note>
So James ſays, <q>
                  <hi>Can</hi> the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries, either a vine figs? So <hi>can no</hi> fountain both yield ſalt water and freſh.</q>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">James iii. 12.</note> In like manner, it is unqueſtionably true, that the ſinner's coming to Chriſt is an effect which <hi>can ariſe from no other cauſe</hi> than the drawings of the Father; and it is in vain to look to <hi>any other ſource</hi> for ſuch an effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:012616_0005_0F8B6CFA0CC81458"/>BUT the terms <hi>can</hi> and <hi>cannot,</hi> in ſuch an application of them, have no reference <hi>to moral characters and actions,</hi> in determining them to be either virtuous or vicious. Becauſe a man <hi>cannot</hi> ſerve <hi>two</hi> maſters, it doth not from thence follow that he <hi>ought</hi> not to ſerve <hi>one</hi>: Becauſe no fountain <hi>can</hi> both yield ſalt water and freſh, and virtuous and vicious actions <hi>cannot</hi> proceed from the ſame principle; it by no means <hi>from thence</hi> follows, that men are not <hi>obliged</hi> to holy and virtuous action. And, becauſe coming to Chriſt is the effect of no other cauſe than the <hi>drawings of the Father,</hi> it would be very odd from thence to infer, that no man is under <hi>obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to come to him. Such reaſoning as this would, at once, annul the whole law and goſpel; and, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that moral obligation lies upon no Being but God. It would ſuppoſe that the neceſſary dependence of creatures, on the Creator, was inconſiſtent with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligation, and deſtroyed it.</p>
            <p>The terms <hi>can</hi> and <hi>cannot</hi> therefore, in <hi>this</hi> uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of them, having no reference to moral characters and qualities, in determining them to be either good or bad; we have no further concern with them in the preſent diſcourſe; the deſign of which is to ſhew that the <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> there is in mankind, with reſpect to coming to Chriſt, and believing on him, affords no one any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able excuſe for neglecting it.</p>
            <p>Our buſineſs now, therefore is, to enquire into the uſe which is made of theſe terms, both in the holy ſcriptures, and in common language, as far as they reſpect the <hi>characters</hi> of men; and, wherein they relate to thoſe powers of moral beings which are eſſential to virtue and vice, praiſe and blame.</p>
            <p>And, here let it be obſerved,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the terms <hi>can</hi> and <hi>cannot,</hi> often refer to the <hi>natural abilities, ſtrength</hi> or <hi>opportunity</hi> any man hath, for doing or performing any action that is propoſed to him. We ſay men <hi>can</hi> or <hi>cannot</hi> perform any action, or do any deed, according as they have, or have not

ſtrength, talents, or oppo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="6 letters">
                  <desc>••••••</desc>
               </gap>y for it. Thus men <hi>cannot</hi> ſoar above the clouds, nor overturn the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. So, the blind <hi>cannot</hi> ſee, nor the deaf hear. Men <hi>cannot</hi> bind the ſweet influences of Pleiades, nor looſe the bands of Orion. <note n="†" place="bottom">Job xxxviii. 31.</note> Men <hi>have not</hi> an arm like God, nor can they thunder with a voice like him. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Job xl. 9.</note> So, men <hi>cannot</hi> reaſon with the power and ſtrength of angels, nor <hi>can</hi> any creature comprehend God. Some things it may be ſaid men <hi>cannot</hi> perform, only for want of opportunity. Thus many <hi>cannot</hi> underſtand the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and arts, the reaſonings of <hi>Newton,</hi> or the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of <hi>Euclid,</hi> becauſe they have not had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſtudy and acquaint themſelves with them. To denote ſuch a kind of impotency as this is the term <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> often uſed in the ſacred ſcriptures. Thus we are told that <q>When <hi>Iſaac</hi> was old, and his eyes were dim, ſo that he <hi>could not</hi> ſee, he called <hi>Eſau,</hi> his eldeſt ſon,</q> &amp;c. <note n="§" place="bottom">Gen. xxvii. 1.</note> And that
<q>when <hi>Eli</hi> was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he <hi>could not</hi> ſee</q>
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">1 Sam. iii. 2.</note> So, in the ſtorm which befel the ſhip in which <hi>Jonah</hi> was, when he fled from the preſence of the Lord, after the ſailors had caſt lots, and it had fallen upon <hi>Jonah</hi>; it is ſaid
<q>The men rowed hard to bring the ſhip to land, but they <hi>could not.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jonah i. 3.</note> And the prophet Daniel, tacitly blames the king Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar for requiring it of the magicians and aſtrologers to reveal his dreams to him, and ſays,
<q>The ſecret which the king hath demanded, <hi>cannot</hi> the wiſe men, the aſtrologers, the magicians, the ſoothſayers ſhew unto the king?</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Dan. ii. 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH a kind of impotency to any thing as this, is always ſuppoſed to excuſe from the performance: This ſort of <hi>cannot,</hi> is inconſiſtent with every idea of moral obligation. Moral obligation lies upon <hi>that which is,</hi> not upon <hi>that which is not.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<q>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012616_0007_0F8B6CFD8CB9D7D0"/>
to that a man <hi>hath,</hi> and not according to that he hath not.</q>

It is eaſy to ſee that perſons may be ſo indiſpoſed to certain objects and things, as that they <hi>cannot</hi> deſire, or ſeek them; but, when this diſaffection of heart, this averſion of the will to the propoſed object, is removed; every one will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily confeſs that the perſon's impotency, his <hi>cannot</hi> with reſpect to deſiring, aſking and ſeeking it, is, alſo, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually removed.

            <p n="2">II. WHETHER this impotency affords any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excuſe to the ſinner, for continuing in impenitency and unbelief.</p>
            <p>THIS impotency, it is to be kept in mind, conſiſteth in a real <hi>averſion of the will</hi> from the law of GOD, from holineſs, from the character of the LORD JESUS. It
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012616_0015_0F8B6D0C14E91A88"/>
doth not conſiſt in ſuch a <hi>want</hi> of affection and love as is to be found in inanimate nature, or in the brutal creation: Nor does it conſiſt in ſuch a want of love, as we often expreſs by the term <hi>indifference.</hi> Many times the ſtate and diſpoſition of the mind is ſuch, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain objects and things, as that it is difficult to determine which way it preponderates, and whether the mind be pleaſed or diſpleaſed with them; if there is a preponderancy of the affections, it is, nevertheleſs, ſo ſmall as to be ſcarcely diſcernable.</p>
            <p>SUCH a ſtate of mind as this, is never, in common language, expreſſed by the term <hi>cannot</hi>; but, to denote ſuch an indifferency as this, we always uſe ſome more ſoft and gentle term—ſome word or epithet which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a ſtate of mind conſiderably removed from every thing to which the ideas of <hi>impotency</hi> are wont to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed by mankind.</p>
            <p>BUT, when the <hi>averſion of the will</hi> is ſuch that no arts of perſwaſion will overcome it, and no motives or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will ſubdue and conquer it; then common language affords a term which denotes a certain kind of impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and, to expreſs this exceeding ſtrength of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the will, common ſenſe adopts it, and, we ſay we <hi>cannot</hi> comply with ſuch precepts or propoſals.</p>
            <p>IT being then remembered that the impotency ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of in our text, denoted by the terms <hi>no man can come to me,</hi> &amp;c. implies a <hi>real and exceedingly ſtrong averſion of the will,</hi> in the ſinner, from coming unto CHRIST; it is to be enquired whether <hi>this impotency</hi> with reſpect to his coming, affords him any reaſonable excuſe for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN human affairs this ſort of impotency is never eſteemed any excuſe. The parent never excuſes his child, nor the maſter his ſervant, nor the prince his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, upon ſaying that he <hi>cannot</hi> ſubmit to his righteous authority, and government.

And obſtinacy and perverſeneſs, according to all the dictates of reaſon and common ſenſe, and all the methods of <hi>human</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration and government, the higher they riſe, are the more cenſurable and inexcuſable. For the child to ſay that he <hi>cannot</hi> love and honor his parents, is ſo far from ſuggeſting an <hi>excuſe</hi> for his undutifulneſs, that, <hi>above all things,</hi> it ſhews his need of chaſtiſement and correction, and much more ſo doth the like plea for undutifulneſs to GOD: For, our obligations of love and duty to the ſupreme GOD, ariſing from the infinite perfection and purity of his nature, and the relation which we ſtand in to him, are infinitely ſuperior to thoſe of filial duty and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And, therefore, a perverſeneſs, an obſtinacy of will <hi>in this caſe,</hi> which ariſes to ſuch a height as to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe the uſe of the term <hi>cannot</hi> for denoting and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing it, muſt ſurely <hi>highly</hi> merit the juſt judgment and righteous indignation of GOD.</p>

            <p>BUT, had it been the ſenſe of HIM in whom <hi>are hid the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> who is perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our frame, and knowing to all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and frailties of our nature; that there was any impotency in fallen man, which rendered the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of true ſpiritual ſervice, not a matter of real duty and obligation; ſurely, we never ſhould have heard him dooming thoſe to everlaſting ruin for their impenitency and unbelief, who laboured under that ſame impotency with reſpect to coming to him, and believing on him, which is urged by ſinners, in our day, as an excuſe for their abominable neglect. Much leſs, ſhould we find him conſidering the ſtrength and greatneſs of this impotency, as rendering thoſe who laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, worthy of a peculiarly aggravated deſtruction. The impotency of the inhabitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> to repent, really never roſe to the height to which it did, in the inhabitants of <hi>Chorazin, Capernaum, &amp;c.</hi> And yet, the impenitency of the latter, was far more criminal than that of the former. Therefore, in the view of infinite wiſdom and juſtice, that impotency in ſinners of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, with reſpect to holy ſpiritual ſervice, whereby they <hi>cannot</hi> come to CHRIST, is ſo far from excuſing their wickedneſs, that it is its peculiar aggravation. AND, to this repreſentation of the matter, the reaſon
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012616_0018_0F8B6D0E98874430"/>
of men perfectly correſponds. For, when a child doth not love a wiſe and tender parent, he is univerſally judged to be criminal: But, when his averſion from his parent has ariſen to ſuch a height, that all means and methods to bring him to a ſenſe of his duty, prove ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and he plainly declares that he cannot love him, his wickedneſs is univerſally judged to be exceedingly great.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It would be very abſurd to ſuppoſe that diſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of heart to the true character of the LORD JHSUS, is excuſeable on account of its ſtrength and greatneſs. It has been already obſerved that the term <hi>cannot,</hi> as it is often uſed in ſcripture, and the phraſe <hi>no man can,</hi> as uſed in our text, as far as it relates to the character of the ſubject, is deſigned to expreſs <hi>an exceeding ſtrength of oppoſition of will,</hi> to certain objects or propoſals. That degree of diſaffection and diſlike, which is ſo weak and low, as not to admit of the term <hi>cannot</hi> for expreſſing it; and which doth not generally ſuggeſt the idea of any ſort of <hi>impoſſibility</hi>; by the common conſent of mankind, is univerſally thought to partake of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of either virtue or vice, according to the ſeveral natures and qualities of its object. And, if ſuch a low degree of backwardneſs with reſpect to coming to CHRIST, as we ſhould not expreſs by a term that ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted any impoſſibility in the caſe, yet, according to the dictates of common reaſon, and by the univerſal conſent of mankind is deemed criminal: it would be very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that this ſame backwardneſs of heart with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to coming, when it has ariſen to ſuch height, and exiſteth in ſuch ſtrength, as that, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe of language, it may with propriety be ſaid thta the ſubject of it <hi>cannot</hi> come; ſhould <hi>then</hi> be deemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and excuſeable. Such a method of reaſoning and infering as this, at once confounds all human rules of computation reſpecting different degrees of vice, and the ſeveral alleviations or aggravations of crimes. If a low degree of diſaffection to CHRIST is criminal, a higher degree of it muſt be proportionably more ſo;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012616_0019_0F8B6D0F0D550E30"/>
and when the diſaffection ariſes to ſuch a height as to render it impracticable for the ſubject of it to come to him, and is of ſuch a ſtrength and malignity as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the term <hi>cannot</hi> fully and properly to expreſs it; neither the dictates of ſcripture, nor of common reaſon, would heſitate a moment to pronounce it far more vile and criminal. When the diſaffection of any one, to CHRIST, is ſuch as that he <hi>cannot</hi> come to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, was not his conſcience amazingly ſtupid and blind, inſtead of drawing any excuſe from <hi>this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency,</hi> he would <hi>feel it to be</hi> his own wickedneſs, and that it conſtituted the very eſſence of it, and would, in his <hi>conſcience,</hi> condemn himſelf to an everlaſting hell for it, when he is endued with reaſon and underſtanding to diſcern the fitneſſes of things; when the infinitely excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent character of the LORD JESUS is exhibited ſenſibly to his obſervation and view; when his judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience approve, and pronounce it excellent and perfect in every part: <hi>Then</hi> to feel ſuch ſtrength of averſion of will from CHRIST, as that he <hi>cannot</hi> come to him and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him in his proper character; the ſinner would at once know, was an <hi>impotency</hi> of a moſt horrid nature, a crime of the deepeſt dye, which <hi>of itſelf</hi> rendered him a veſſel of wrath fit for nothing but deſtruction.</p>
            <p>IT is, indeed, nothing but abominable ſtupidity of conſcience, and of heart, that ever ſuggeſted <hi>that impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in the ſinner</hi> with reſpect to coming to CHRIST, which is meant to be expreſſed by the terms, <hi>no man can come unto me, &amp;c.</hi> as an excuſe for not repenting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on the LORD JESUS. And <hi>this excuſe,</hi> as well as every other that can be invented, the ſinner may aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly know, like the thin cloud and vapour, before the beams of the riſing ſun, will immediately vaniſh and ſlee before the clear, full ſight which will break in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his conſcience at the laſt day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IF this impotency, in the ſinner, with reſpect to coming to CHRIST, affords any excuſe for his impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and unbelief, it muſt be becauſe averſion of will
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012616_0020_0F8B6D0FDB80F848"/>
from the LORD JESUS, and diſaffection to his true and real character, are not ſinful. For any one to ſay this, is the ſame as to ſay that it is not in itſelf ſinful for us to feel heartily oppoſed to the character and work of CHRIST, to exerciſe <hi>voluntary oppoſition</hi> to the true GOD.</p>
            <p>THERE is, in fact, <hi>no impotency in ſinners</hi> under the Goſpel, to repentance and faith, (which at all affects their moral characters, or has any relation to their praiſe worthineſs, or criminality) beſide what is <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> and conſiſts eſſentially in the oppoſition of their <hi>wills.</hi> And to plead <hi>this impotency</hi> as an excuſe, is to plead wickedneſs itſelf as its own excuſe.</p>
            <p>IF voluntary oppoſition to GOD is ſinful; the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's impotence to repent and believe is ſinful; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the very <hi>impotence itſelf</hi> conſiſteth in voluntary op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And, if voluntary oppoſition to GOD is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the point of controverſy is certainly determined; for <hi>ſinfulneſs itſelf</hi> cannot be excuſeable.</p>
            <p>THE ſinner who pleads this impotency, when the duty and obligation of repentance and faith are urged upon him, it may be preſumed, is not yet become ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he is an enemy to GOD: He is not yet convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the feelings, the voluntary affection of his own heart toward GOD are ſinful, or ſuch as deſerve cenſure and blame. Was the ſinner once effectually convinced of this, his conſcience would at once feel the real obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of repentance; and, this conviction muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſarm him of every excuſe. For,</p>
            <p n="5">5. IF, voluntary oppoſition to GOD is not ſinful; if real, actual unwillingneſs to come to CHRIST, is not cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, it muſt be <hi>becauſe we are not in reaſon anſwerable to</hi> GOD—<hi>becauſe he hath no right to command our wills,</hi> and call upon us to love him. To ſay that we are not blameable for perſiſting in impenitency, <hi>becauſe</hi> GOD doth not give us <hi>a heart, a will</hi> to repent; is the ſame as to ſay, that GOD hath no right to command us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of ſin and love him, unleſs at the ſame time he
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012616_0021_0F8B6D12317A0FB8"/>
gives us hearts to comply. And this, every one muſt ſee, is the ſame as to ſay, that GOD's commands are not binding upon any but thoſe to whom he gives hearts to obey. According to ſuch reaſoning as this, it is very obvious, that <hi>impenitent ſinners</hi> cannot righteouſly be commanded to repent and believe on the LORD JESUS. And this indeed is the grand object which the ſinner has in view; the darling point to which all his pleas and excuſes tend.</p>
            <p>IF the ſinner is abſolved from the obligation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith, by the conſideration that GOD hath not given him a heart to repent and believe the goſpel, it is then manifeſt, of courſe, that all impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are freed from moral obligation. And, if this is a conſideration that diſſolves moral obligation; it muſt be becauſe GOD hath no right to enjoin any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creature, beſide what he is diſpoſed and hath a heart to perform. But, was this the truth, it would be obvious that the <hi>diſpoſition and will</hi> of the creature, muſt be the only rule and meaſure of the divine commands; and therefore the only rule and meaſure of his duty. <hi>This</hi> every one may ſee, is a rule and method of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which at once cancels all moral obligation; mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the will of the creature</hi> his own and only law; and denying all authority which the Deity hath over men. Such reaſonings as theſe are the ſuggeſtions of a heart impatient of every reſtraint, and fruitful in inventions for eaſing the conſcience from every ſenſe of moral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</p>
            <p>IF the ſinner is indeed under <hi>obligations</hi> of repentance toward GOD, and faith toward our LORD JESUS CHRIST, it is utterly in vain to urge any conſideration whatever in excuſe of impenitence and unbelief. If GOD, who judgeth righteous judgment, conſiders a rejection of CHRIST as being blameworthy and criminal; it is plain that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his view, there is no <hi>cannot</hi> in the ſinner, with reſpect to his coming to him, that takes off the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. The ſinner ought to feel and know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012616_0022_0F8B6D1339EDF4C0"/>
that all his excuſes for remaining impenitent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his impatience of the obligation of the divine law; and, undoubtedly have their origin in a real diſpoſition of heart to annul the judgments of GOD, and break his bands aſunder.</p>
            <p n="6">6. TO urge that there cannot be obligation on a creature to love GOD, unleſs where the DEITY gives a heart, or diſpoſition to comply with the precepts of love, is the ſame as to ſay that we cannot conſent to be <hi>creatures, dependent</hi> on GOD, and yet accountable to him. To urge an indiſpoſition of mind to comply with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precepts, as an excuſe for oppoſition to them; is to deny the mutual conſiſtency of <hi>dependence</hi> and <hi>moral obligation.</hi> To lay the blame of an indiſpoſition to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, at GOD's door, <hi>becauſe</hi> a heart or diſpoſition to obey, is only from GOD; is to urge the conſideration of the <hi>dependence</hi> of the creature on GOD, as an argument againſt the <hi>obligation of obedience.</hi> For, if the ideas of <hi>entire dependence,</hi> and of <hi>moral obligation,</hi> are no ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with each other; the conſideration of our being <hi>creatures abſolutely dependent</hi> on GOD, is certainly no manner of excuſe for our being and continuing enemies to him.</p>
            <p>THE excuſe, therefore, of <hi>cannot,</hi> ſo often urged by the ſinner, and ſo difficultly yielded up, when the duty of repenting and believing the goſpel is brought into view, really terminates here; and betrays the ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the latent wiſhes of his heart, after <hi>independence on God.</hi> Would we conſent to be <hi>creatures,</hi> and, in the diſpoſitions and affections of our minds, <hi>take our place</hi> accordingly; every difficulty in the way of our coming to CHRIST, would at once ſubſide, and be removed; and we ſhould then find no <hi>cannot</hi> with reſpect to coming that would be any bar in the way of it, or, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, keep us at a diſtance from him.</p>
            <p>IT is of the utmoſt importance, therefore, that the ſinner ſhould <hi>know</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> that <hi>this excuſe</hi> is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inſignificant, and infinitely vain: and, that we ſhould all be effectually perſuaded and convinced that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012616_0023_0F8B6D158C0072E0"/>
our <hi>impotency</hi> to love ſo exalted and glorious a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is ſo far from excuſing us, that it is the <hi>very thing</hi> which conſtitutes our wickedneſs, and renders us ſo infinitely vile and odious in the pure eyes of the holy GOD. <hi>This impotency</hi> is ſo far from being a reaſon why the impenitent ſinner <hi>ſhould not be damned</hi>; that it is the very thing, above all others, on account of which he deſerves everlaſting burnings. <hi>However</hi> the powers and faculties of the human mind may be ſuppoſed to be impaired by the fall; or, <hi>whatever debility and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> may be derived to mankind from <hi>Adam</hi>; ſtill, there can be no reaſonable objection to our employing all the powers and faculties <hi>which remain,</hi> in the ſervice of GOD: However our powers may be impaired, the duty and obligation of a faithful improvement of thoſe which are <hi>left us,</hi> remain ſtill in full force. And, when we are aſſured, that <hi>if there be firſt a</hi> willing mind, <hi>it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted according to that a</hi> man hath, <hi>and not according to that which he</hi> hath not; <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. viii. 12.</note> we have, certainly, no reaſon to complain if we are condemned and puniſhed for miſimproving and abuſing the powers and talents of which we are actually poſſeſſed. While we have <hi>reaſon to diſcern and apprehend</hi> the character of the LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, as it is exhibited in his wonderful and glorious work; and judgment and conſcience to approve and decide wholly in its favor; it is, in the nature of things, impoſſible that we ſhould not be under obligation to love him with <hi>all our hearts, with all the powers and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have</hi>; and no impotency, in the ſinner, to <hi>this,</hi> can poſſibly exiſt, beſide a diſaffection of heart and will to ſo pure and holy a character: which, by the terms, is the very reverſe of <hi>duty</hi> (what is <hi>duty</hi> for the ſinner) and therefore is the very eſſence of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs—the thing itſelf for which he deſerves the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſpleaſure of the infinite GOD.</p>
            <p>THIS brings us to enquire,</p>
            <p n="3">III. WHENCE ariſeth the neceſſity of divine and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, the <hi>ſpecial influences of the ſpirit of God,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:012616_0024_0F8B6D160C1166B8"/>
in order to bring men to repent, and believe on the Lord JESUS CHRIST. Our text ſays, "No man can come to me, <hi>except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi>" In order to underſtand the true ground of the neceſſity of ſpecial divine influences in bringing men to CHRIST, we may obſerve the following things. Such as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. No effect ever takes place without ſome ſufficient and adequate cauſe. It is an acknowledged maxim, that every <hi>effect</hi> requires a <hi>cauſe</hi>; and <hi>that</hi> ſuch an one as is adequate to it, and ſufficient for the production of it. If <hi>this</hi> point be given up, almoſt all principles of reaſoning are, at once unhinged; and we are ſet at looſe from all certainty reſpecting the moſt important and acknowledged truths. All <hi>created</hi> exiſtence is the effect of divine and almighty power; <hi>an effect</hi> to the production of which nothing ſhort of omnipotence is adequate. It is the prerogative of GOD, proper and peculiar to him, to <hi>create</hi> and, out of nothing produce exiſtence. So that wherever we behold <hi>created exiſtence,</hi> we have an infallible, never failing proof of <hi>divine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power.</hi> No exiſtence, either in whole or in part, <hi>creates itſelf.</hi> In this ſenſe every thing, every effect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires almighty power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſinner's coming to</hi> CHRIST is an effect to which nothing is adequate, as a cauſe, beſide the drawings of the FATHER: This is an effect only of the <hi>ſpecial influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the ſpirit of</hi> GOD. <hi>That divine power</hi> whereby GOD effecteth meer creation—whereby he produced the material ſyſtem, our natural world into exiſtence: is wholly inadequate to ſuch an effect. Yea, <hi>that divine power</hi> whereby GOD alone formeth moral nature, brings men into being and upholds them in exiſtence, is not a cauſe equal to the production of <hi>holineſs in a ſinner's heart.</hi> This power alone, in however high a meaſure it is exerted will not bring a ſinner to repent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the LORD JESUS. The peculiar glory even of the <hi>power</hi> of GOD, appears in the new creation: And, this <hi>new creation</hi> never takes place otherwiſe than as an
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012616_0025_0F8B6D18438E9948"/>
effect of the <hi>ſpecial influences of the ſpirit of</hi> GOD. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they who receive CHRIST and believe on him, are repreſented as being born <hi>not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of</hi> GOD. John i. 13. And our SAVIOUR ſaith that <hi>except a man be born of water</hi> and the ſpirit, <hi>he cannot enter into the kingdom of</hi> GOD. John iii, 5. GOD, in bringing men to CHRIST, draws them <hi>with the cords of a man, with bands of love.</hi> Hoſea xi. 4. And it is not in the heart of man to come to CHRIST, unleſs he is thus drawn of GOD.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That,</hi> on the ſinner's part, which alone renders the ſpecial influences of the ſpirit of GOD, neceſſary and eſſential to his coming to CHRIST, is <hi>obſtinacy of will and diſaffection of heart.</hi> When we ſpeak of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the exertion of ſome ſpecial influence on a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>who is every way furniſhed with abilities and powers for moral action,</hi> in order to bring him to a compliance with the dictates of reaſon and right; with <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; it naturally awakens an apprehenſion of <hi>ſomething in the ſinner himſelf, lying as an obſtacle or bar in the way of his compliance with his duty.</hi> There is nothing <hi>in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> which lies as a bar in the way of his repenting and believing the goſpel, beſide this <hi>enmity and obſtinacy of will. Enmity of heart, therefore, againſt</hi> GOD, <hi>oppoſite of will to the</hi> LORD JESUS, to his character and work; are what alone, on the ſinner's part, render ſpecial, divine, <hi>ſpiritual</hi> influences neceſſay to his being brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance toward GOD, and faith toward our LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST. Such is the enmity and wickedneſs of the hearts of ſinners, as that <hi>it is not in them</hi> to come to CHRIST unleſs the Father draws them.</p>
            <p>GOD, by his <hi>almighty power,</hi> continually upholds eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us in being: He gives us reaſon and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſee and underſtand, and know that we ought to love him; but we will not. Therefore his <hi>almighty, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual power</hi> muſt be put forth in order to bring us to it. For <hi>this reaſon</hi> it is that no man can come to CHRIST, except the Father draw him. Man hath ſuch an <hi>aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012616_0026_0F8B6D18B9C35A80"/>
of will</hi> from coming, that it <hi>is not in him</hi> to come. And when our SAVIOUR ſaith that <hi>no man can come, &amp;c.</hi> he is ſo far from deſigning to furniſh the ſinner with an excuſe for impenitency and unbelief, that his words are excellently calculated to bring the wickedneſs of the impenitent ſinner very fully and ſenſibly into his view. Nothing gives us ſo ſtriking a view of the exceeding ſtrength of oppoſition there is, in ſinners hearts, to CHRIST, as to hear it repreſented by <hi>him</hi> who is the true and faithful witneſs, as being ſuch that, according to the common uſe of terms, it may properly be ſaid that he <hi>cannot</hi> come unto him: For this teacheth us, that there is not only ſome degree of oppoſition, but an exceeding ſtrength of enmity, in the carnal heart againſt the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>

               <p>IN a perſon who is ſo oppoſed to CHRIST as that he <hi>cannot</hi> come to him, it is in vain to expect any <hi>aſking</hi> or <hi>ſeeking</hi> after him. We never aſk or ſeek after that which is wholly diſagreeable to us; much leſs, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, after that which is freely offered to us without money and without price, to which we have ſuch an exceeding ſtrength of averſion and oppoſition of will, as that we cannot accept and embrace it. To teach and exhort, therefore, impenitent ſinners, to ſeek and pray for converting, regenerating grace, <hi>under an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that they are rather inclined to comply with ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, than actually to repent and believe the goſpel,</hi> muſt certainly ariſe from a wrong apprehenſion of the nature
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012616_0027_0F8B6D1C6E7AED00"/>
of that impotency there is in ſinners reſpecting repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and faith. And not only ſo, but ſuch kind of directions muſt alſo, exceedingly tend to blind the ſinner both with reſpect to his own character and duty, and keep out of view the real oppoſition and enmity of his heart againſt GOD.</p>
               <p>TO encourage ſinners to hope that there are any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the word of GOD, to any aſkings or ſeekings which are not of faith, is to encourage them to truſt in a refuge of lies: For, when we are directed to <hi>aſk,</hi> we are, at the ſame time, directed to aſk in faith, nothing wavering, and told that <hi>he that wavereth, is like a wave of the ſea, driven with the wind and toſſed</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And then, to let us know how vain all <hi>ſuch aſking is,</hi> the Apoſtle adds, <hi>let not that man think</hi> that he ſhall receive any thing of the LORD. James i. 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. WE ſee, in what has been ſaid on this ſubject, a reaſon why the divine law ſhould looſe none of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on ſinners; and why there ſhould be no relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its binding force and authority. If the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and impotency of ſinners were ſuch as that reaſon would plead a relaxation of its demands upon us ſince the fall, and <hi>common ſenſe</hi> dictate the propriety and importance of it; it would be exceedingly difficult for us to diſcern the neceſſity or wiſdom of the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or, ſee it to be <hi>even conſiſtent</hi> for CHRIST to come <hi>to magnify the law and make it honourable</hi>: For, on the other hand, <hi>this deſign</hi> of the coming of CHRIST directly combats the principle which urgeth the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of a relaxation, in the demands of the law, on account of the impotency there is in fallen men to comply with them.</p>
               <p>If the demands of the divine law were above what in reaſon, could be required of <hi>fallen creatures</hi>; the eſſential righteouſneſs and goodneſs of GOD, would have been ſufficient ſecurity for all reaſonable abatements, without the death of CHRIST, or any price paid as a ranſom from the power of too ſevere and rigid a law. But, now all
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012616_0028_0F8B6D1C97DB6048"/>
the original demands of the law upon mankind are kept up, becauſe we have loſt no powers of obedience, which can, in the leaſt meaſure, excuſe us from the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it.</p>
               <p>SOME ſeem to imagine that the right which the Deity hath to bind us to real holineſs and the perfection of it according to our meaſure, in our preſent fallen ſtate, ariſeth from the conſideration of the ſufficiency of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with which human nature was <hi>originally endowed,</hi> without any regard to the nature and extent of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> powers of mankind. Accordingly we often hear it ſaid, that GOD <hi>hath not loſt his right to command, though man hath his power to obey</hi>; than the which few ſentences have ever been invented that were more directly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to relieve and ſtupify the conſcience of the ſecure ſinner. For, in the firſt place, though reaſon teaches us that for any one voluntarily to deprive himſelf of his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal powers of obedience, is <hi>in itſelf</hi> criminal, and deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of puniſhment; yet <hi>this</hi> is a crime which, on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuppoſition, is chargeable on no one of mankind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the firſt of the race. <hi>This</hi> therefore is a crime from which every one of the <hi>fallen</hi> race of men are taught, by the ſentence under conſideration, to conſider themſelves as entirely free. And, in the ſecond place, it is utterly impracticable, even by all the arts of ſubtilty of which the moſt practiſed critic is poſſeſſed, ever to convict the conſcience of ſin, for not exerting and employing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of which the perſon was never in any measſure poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. For, reaſon teaches us that the ſervant is not criminal for neglecting to run, at the maſter's command after he has diſlocated his joints or broken his bones; though he may be for his careleſsneſs, or violence offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to himſelf, in breaking his legs. And, although, in the third place, the ſinner ſhould be perſuaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that, by ſome certain law or conſtitution of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he is holden to <hi>puniſhment</hi> for not exerting powers of which he never was poſſeſſed, and of which <hi>Adam alone,</hi> was guilty of the crime of depriving him;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012616_0029_0F8B6D1E0110C808"/>
yet, he never will feel himſelf deſerving of it: And, his conſciouſneſs of innocence will be as balm to the ſoul, molifying and healing every wound that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him.</p>
               <p>IS it poſſible for any one who conſiders this as the ground of his expoſedenesſs to future puniſhment, to feel his need of an infinite atonement, and be brought to look only to boundleſs mercy, and ſovereign grace, for relief? Is <hi>this</hi> that ſenſe of ſin and conviction of guilt, which prepares the mind for diſcerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the goſpel, and the glory of the mediatorial work and character? And are theſe the doctrines adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by infinite wiſdom, and awaken the conſciences of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and bring their own characters, in all their pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deformity, into their view? Certainly no: But, on <hi>this</hi> ſuppoſition, the goſpel can only be, as it was heretofore to the Jews, a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks, fooliſhneſs. Under the influence of ſuch inſtructions and apprehenſions as theſe, it will be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impracticable for the ſinner ever to attain to ſuch a ſenſe of ſin as is altogether neceſſary to his heartily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the goſpel.</p>
               <p>GOD's law, and his right to command, remain in full force becauſe nothing is now required of us but what it is infinitely fit and reaſonable that we ſhould perform. This, and this only, is the true ground and criterion of <hi>right,</hi> on GOD's part, and <hi>obligation</hi> on our's. The Deity now requires nothing more than a rational, faithful improvement of the powers, opportunities and talents which we actually have; and all this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>Adam.</hi> And the whole difference, in a moral view, between <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, and his fallen race is, that the former was <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to this proper improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his talents and powers, but the latter <hi>are not.</hi> By an <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> to obey, every conſideration concurs to evince, that GOD doth not loſe his right to command; much leſs, if poſſible, when the oppoſition of the will to obedience, ariſeth to ſuch a height as to authoriſe the uſe of the term <hi>cannot</hi> in order fully and properly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:012616_0030_0F8B6D1ED8E65808"/>However the <hi>natural force and vigor</hi> of the human mind may be abated by the fall, no reaſon can be given why we ſhould not be required to love the LORD our GOD with all <hi>our heart, and ſoul, and ſtrength and mind.</hi> No reaſonable objection can be made againſt the law which requires us to love the DEITY in proportion to the views under which he is actually exhibited to <hi>our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,</hi> and the dictates of our <hi>own conſciences</hi> reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his worthineſs of love. And this is all that the divine law now requires, or that it did originally require of man, nor is it to be ſuppoſed that any one, without this conviction of his own obligation, and his real crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for neglecting to comply with it, can ever diſcern the glory of the goſpel, or behold the beauty, and reliſh the character of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. And that perſon, whoever he is, that is ſettled down in a hope of his own good eſtate, and yet never hath been convinced that even now, in his fallen ſtate, he is under all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable obligation actually to love GOD with his whole ſoul; and, that the real criminality and ſinfulneſs of every exerciſe of his own affection and heart which is, in its nature and tendency, oppoſed to ſuch a love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an infinite atonement to make it conſiſtent for even <hi>goodneſs itſelf</hi> to forgive him, has only the hope of he hypocrite, which will ſoon periſh; and all his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will vaniſh before the light of eternity, like the thin cloud and vapour before the beams of the riſing ſun.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IF the ſinner's impotency to holy duty conſiſteth in the obſtinacy of his will, the averſion of his heart from the commands of the word of GOD, it is manifeſt that there is no reaſon why he ſhould not be called to <hi>immediate repentance and faith.</hi> When there is no other reaſon of the ſinner's impenitence, than his voluntary oppoſition to it, there can, ſurely, be no reaſon why the calls, invitations and directions of the goſpel, ſhould ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate on any thing ſhort of true, hearty ſubmiſſion and repentance. And, for the Deity to give directions to any thing ſhort of repentence and faith, as a term or medium whereby to obtain his favour and his farther gracious
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012616_0031_0F8B6D1F8BCC08E8"/>
aſſiſtance, <hi>in conſideration of human impotency to real repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith,</hi> would be <hi>at leaſt</hi> a tacit acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the validity and juſtice of the hardened, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſinner's plea; and would therefore ſuppoſe it an unrighteous thing for ſinners to be damned for impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and unbelief.</p>
               <p>WHEN we ſee the righteous commands of a parent diſregarded by the rebellious child, and hear the fond mother, in order to ſave appearances, and preſerve at leaſt the air of authority, lowering her demands till ſhe brings them down to a level with the perverſe diſpoſition and inclination of the child; it fills us with a juſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And what better or more honorable do <hi>they</hi> think of the DEITY who imagine that his original demands of true and ſupreme love, are abated, on account of the <hi>perverſe diſpoſition and inclinations of the ſinner,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> calls and directions now ſoftened and lowered down to the level of the ſinner's <hi>preſent diſpoſition</hi>; ſo that GOD <hi>now, immediately</hi> requires nothing of the <hi>impenitent</hi> ſinner but what it may comport with his <hi>impenitent diſpoſition</hi> to perform. Nothing is more grateful to the impenitent ſinner, than to hear himſelf directed to ſome exerciſes and doings ſhort of real repentence as <hi>a means or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of finding favor</hi> with GOD; becauſe he feels that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch direction evidently juſtifies the excuſe which he makes for remaining impenitent, drawn from his impotence reſpecting true repentence: And it incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges him to hope for <hi>peace of conſcience</hi> upon ſuch doings and performances as may comport with his preſent ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indiſpoſition to the love of GOD, and averſion from it. And, if peace of conſcience, and hope of ſecurity, are to be obtained at ſo eaſy a rate as this; the ſinner will naturally think that the urgency of the caſe is not very great and preſſing; but, even <hi>theſe</hi> doings and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances may be deferred to ſome more convenient opportunity. And yet, how often do we hear impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners directed to a tedious round of ungracious doings and duties, as the preſcribed means of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the condition of GOD's beſtowing converting
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012616_0032_0F8B6D20498EAF90"/>
grace upon them: while the reaſon alledged for ſuch directions, is the preſent weak and impotent ſtate of human nature with reſpect to truly gracious exerciſes and holy duties.</p>
               <p>WHAT can be more reproachful to the holy and juſt GOD, than to ſuppoſe either that he required an infinite price paid to him, before he would ſuffer himſelf to be prevailed on to abate any thing of thoſe demands which nevertheleſs, <hi>could not with reaſon be kept up upon depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, fallen men, on account of their impotence to comply with them</hi>; or, that the influence of the atonement upon the divine mind was ſuch, as to diſpoſe the DEITY to yield a little in his demands, <hi>on account of the extreme back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and indiſpoſition of the ſinner to obey?</hi> And, yet, it is abundantly evident that either the one or the other of theſe ſuppoſitions, or ſomething ſimilar to them, is certainly implied in the opinion that any of the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the word of GOD to ſinners, have, for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, any thing ſhort of true, genuine, cordial love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. WE may infer, from what has been ſaid on this ſubject, that the ſinner who feels, and is really convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this impotency to come to CHRIST, is <hi>his own fault, his crime,</hi> will never mention it as an excuſe. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are never wont to mention the crime itſelf as it's own excuſe: Such ſort of pleas are proſcribed by common ſenſe, and the univerſal conſent of mankind. When we plead an excuſe of a <hi>crime,</hi> it is ſomething diſtinct from the crime itſelf. If the ſinner's impotency to come to CHRIST is his own wickedneſs, it is an affront to the great GOD, to his law, and to his ſon, JESUS CHRIST, for him to mention it in any other view than as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning himſelf for it. What would the parent think of the child who ſhould ſay that he <hi>could not</hi> ſubmit to the wholſome rules and regulations of the family—that he <hi>could not</hi> be ſubject to parental authority? He would be ſo far from conſidering this as any tolerable excuſe, that he would <hi>infer from it,</hi> the child's need of ſevere diſcipline and correction. What, then, muſt the DEITY, the juſt and holy GOD, think of the ſinner, when he
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012616_0033_0F8B6D22754803C0"/>
hears him ſay that he <hi>cannot</hi> repent of his ſins, and <hi>cannot</hi> love the LORD JESUS? For the ſinner to ſay that he <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> repent of his ſins, is to expreſs the exceeding ſtrength of his love to ſin, and the amazing attachment of his own heart to his luſts. And to ſay that he <hi>cannot</hi> love the LORD JESUS CHRIST, it to expreſs the ſtrong, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable averſion of his mind and will from him.</p>
               <p>DID ſinners themſelves view the matter in this light, (as they certainly would do, were not their conſciences exceedingly ſtupid and blind) we never ſhould hear them hold ſuch a language as this, or talk in a ſtrain ſo exceedingly daring and provoking. To ſay that we <hi>cannot</hi> repent of our ſins, and <hi>cannot</hi> come to CHRIST; and plead <hi>this</hi> at the ſame time, as an excuſe for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and believing; is directly to fly in the face of the GREAT GOD, of his law, and of the glorious SAVIOUR of ſinners. He that can talk in ſuch a ſtrain as this, and derive peace and quiet from <hi>this excuſe,</hi> we may rely upon it, has never yet been convinced, <hi>even in conſcience,</hi> that he is a ſinner. For, if it is not our own fault, our wickedneſs, that we do not repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the goſpel, where can wickedneſs be found? If it is not our own fault that we do not repent and believe, we are certainly not <hi>ſinful,</hi> on account of impenitence and unbelief: that is, our impenitence and unbelief are not <hi>our ſin.</hi> And, if we are not ſinners <hi>in this reſpect,</hi> certainly we are not in any other. And it cannot be that <hi>in this reſpect we are ſinners,</hi> if that impotency with reſpect to repentence and faith, which is uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the term <hi>cannot,</hi> be a reaſonable excuſe for impenitence and unbelief.</p>
               <p>THUS doth this excuſe of <hi>cannot,</hi> ſo often in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's mouth, inſtead of manifeſting any degree of awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, reſpecting the things of religion, or any juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of things, diſcover the exceeding ſtupidity of his conſcience, and a very high degree of carnal eaſe and ſecurity. The danger of ſuch, and the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their condition, is greater and more dreadful than can be imagined. And, unleſs it ſhall pleaſe GOD to ſtrike ſuch light and conviction into their deluded
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012616_0034_0F8B6D229C0055C0"/>
minds, their blinded conſciences, as ſhall make them feel and know that this <hi>cannot,</hi> with reſpect to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and believing, is their own ſin and infinite wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; and, in this way, effectually ſhut their mouths, ſo that they dare not open them in ſuch an excuſe, they will infallibly periſh, and be ſealed over to eternal deſtruction.</p>
               <p>HOW muſt the ſinner appear in the eyes ef that GOD who weigheth every thing in an even ballance, whoſe commandments are all holy and juſt and good, when HE requires him to love that which is, in itſelf, infinitely lovely and excellent, and moſt perfectly worthy of our love; yet freely declaring and proteſting that he <hi>cannot</hi> love him, that it is <hi>not in his power</hi> to do it; and urging <hi>this cannot,</hi> at the ſame time, as an <hi>excuſe for remaining an enemy to God</hi>! Certainly, ſuch wickedneſs as this can be equalled by nothing but the patience and goodneſs of GOD, on the other hand, in ſparing, forgiving and ſaving ſinners.</p>
               <p n="5">5. FOR ſinners to be directed to any thing ſhort of repentance toward GOD, and faith toward our Lord JESUS CHRIST; or any thing to be done, or duty to be performed, any otherwiſe than in the exerciſe of a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, penitent and broken heart; evidently encourageth his vain confidence, and manifeſtly implieth that his <hi>impotency</hi> affords him ſome degree of reaſonable excuſe. <hi>Paul</hi> conſiders all mankind as being <hi>without excuſe</hi> for not glorifying GOD as GOD. <hi>He</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the inviſible things of Him, from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead</hi>; ſo that they are without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. Rom. i. 20. <hi>Paul</hi> was, by no means, unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the impotency of human nature, and, no man was more deeply and effectually convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſpecial, divine and almighty power, in order to bring ſinners to repent and believe the goſpel; and yet we find that <hi>he</hi> conſiders even the heathen themſelves as being <hi>without excuſe</hi> in their oppoſition to GOD. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, in <hi>his</hi> preaching, we find no directions to any thing ſhort of real hatred to ſin, and love to CHRIST; or, which can be complied with, without the exerciſe of ſupreme love to GOD.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:012616_0035_0F8B6D23516C9628"/>WHENEVER ſinners find themſelves directed to any thing which may be performed in the exerciſe of their preſent impenitent tempers, they immediately looſe ſight of the obligation of repentence and faith. And, when any doings or performances ſhort of repenting and believing, are directed to <hi>as the appointed way and means of obtaining God's favor</hi>; the direction naturally dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſheth the importance of repentence and faith; and makes the ſinner leſs ſenſible of the obligation and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of true, cordial ſubmiſſion to a ſovereign GOD.</p>
               <p>FOR a ſinner to be adviſed and directed to any thing, as a means of obtaining GOD's favour, or converting grace, or any thing with which the favour of GOD is connected, ſhort of a hearty turning from ſin to GOD; will naturally give him to think that he is excuſed from the obligation of immediate repentance and turning unto GOD: He muſt, in ſuch a caſe, ſurely, think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf excuſed from the obligation of repenting, <hi>until</hi> he has done ſomething elſe, And, when, or where ſuch directions will land him upon the duty of <hi>immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> is extremely uncertain. The ſinner will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally conclude that his adviſer doth not conſider real repentance as his <hi>preſent</hi> duty, or matter of <hi>preſent</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, if he does, why doth he adviſe, direct or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort to ſomething elſe,—ſomething entirely ſhort of it, and of a quite different nature from it? If there were any ſuch directions as theſe, in the bible, ſinners would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and neceſſarily feel themſelves encouraged and countenanced in preſent impenitence; and be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in their apprehenſions of the reaſonableneſs of urging their impotency to repent and believe, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. Whenever, therefore, the preachers of the goſpel give ſuch directions as have for their object ſomething ſhort of a hearty repentance and turning to GOD, they really countenance and encourage the vain and idle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes of the ſinner; and ſo long as any thing ſhort of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial ſubmiſſion and love, is pointed out <hi>as the way of duty; and an appointed means of the recovery and ſalvation of the ſinner</hi>; it will be impoſſible for the ſinner to find <hi>his own way</hi> on every ſide hedged up, and himſelf abſolutely
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012616_0036_0F8B6D23FA9FDBB8"/>
dependent on a <hi>ſovereign</hi> GOD. Nothing can more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tend to keep the true and real character, both of the DEITY, and of the ſinner, out of view, than ſuch kind of directions and exhortations as theſe. They naturally repreſent the holy GOD as conſidering it but a fit and reaſonable thing that ſome kind of allowance ſhould be made on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the impotency and weakneſs under which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind labour ſince the fall; and his <hi>mercy</hi> to be of ſuch a nature and quality, as to incline him to look with a favourable eye, upon thoſe doings, exerciſes and ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſinner, which are wholly deſtitute of every degree of love, and wholly void of every thing that partakes, even in the loweſt meaſure, of any ſubmiſſion to GOD, or concern for his honour and glory. Thus is the grace of GOD made an excuſe for continuing in ſin. And not only ſo, but they alſo teach the ſinner to conſider himſelf as complying with preſent obligation, and fulfilling it, without hearty repentance and turning to GOD. And, ſo long as a perſon views himſelf in this favourable point of light, how is it poſſible he ſhould ſee himſelf a loſt, miſerable, undone ſinner? Under the influence of ſuch doctrines and directions as theſe, how is it poſſible that ſinners ſhould ever be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their voluntary enmity againſt GOD, and oppoſition of heart to the propoſals and invitations of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>HOW can the ſinner under an apprehenſion that he complieth with his preſent duty, by ſomething ſhort of repentance and a hearty turning to GOD, <hi>becauſe of the impotence brought upon him by the fall,</hi> ever embrace the ſacrifice of CHRIST in any other view than as an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>that impotence,</hi> and not, <hi>for his own perſonal ſin and wickedneſs.</hi> And, were this in fact the caſe, (which ſuch kind of exhortations and directions as are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, are admirably adapted to encourage the ſinner to hope and believe that it is) what a view would it exhibit of the nature of the <hi>law and government</hi> of GOD, of the character of the ſinner, and of the deſign and end of the death and ſufferings of CHRIST! a view
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012616_0037_0F8B6D24C7B7FB90"/>
ſhocking indeed to every friend to CHRIST, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous and hazardous to the ſinner.</p>
               <p n="6">6. WE may infer, from what hath been ſaid on this ſubject, the great importance of ſinner's being effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally convinced that their impotency to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the goſpel, is <hi>really their own fault, their wickedneſs.</hi> When <hi>this impotency</hi> is alledged by ſinners as an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt their being urged and called upon to <hi>real ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and nothing elſe,</hi> it is obvious that they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it is any crime in them to be totally impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as to holy, ſpiritual love. And, ſo long as this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence to repent is conſidered only in the light of a <hi>cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> not as a <hi>crime,</hi> it is abundantly manifeſt, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can never feel himſelf deſerving of eternal damnation for his impenitency; or, that it would be a juſt and equit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing in GOD, eternally to damn him for his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence and unbelief. So long, therefore, as <hi>this</hi> is the view he entertains of the matter, he will neceſſarily feel his heart oppoſed to that GOD, whoſe fixt purpoſe it is eternally to puniſh ſinners for impenitency and unbelief.</p>
               <p>UNDER ſuch views as theſe, and in ſuch a ſtate of mind as this, how unprepared is the ſinner to embrace the goſpel, or to behold its glory! How unprepared to truſt in the mercy of GOD, and <hi>that</hi> through a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our who came not to deſtroy the law, but to fulfil. Very low and degrading muſt the ſinner's apprehenſion be of the divine <hi>mercy,</hi> while he entertains ſuch views as theſe: and very diſhonourable and ſhocking, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and end of the undertaking and coming of CHRIST. To <hi>ſuch</hi> are moſt applicable the words of our bleſſed LORD, to the proud, ſelf righteous Phariſees; <hi>They that are whole have no need of a phyſician, but they that are ſick; I came not to call the righteous but ſinner to repentance.</hi> Mark ii. 17. If their eyes are not opened to ſee themſelves to be ſinners in a very different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from what they now do, they have no relief to expect for themſelves, from the LORD JESUS CHRIST. Duty, therefore, to GOD, a concern for the proſperity and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Redeemer's kingdom, and love to the ſouls of men, all concur to urge the vaſt importance and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012616_0038_0F8B6D271AB15020"/>
of preſſing continually and inceſſantly upon the ſinner, the <hi>indiſpenſible and abſolute neceſſity</hi> of repentance toward GOD, and faith toward our LORD JESUS CHRIST, as <hi>the only term or condition</hi> upon which the word of GOD gives him the <hi>leaſt encouragement</hi> to hope for GOD's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable notice and regards.</p>
               <p n="7">7. IS it ſo, indeed, that nothing but divine and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power ever doth, or can, bring the ſinner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe the goſpel; hence let impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſee the dreadful, undone ſtate and condition in which they are really involved. You are, in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect under that divine law which requires you immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and perpetually to love the LORD your GOD <hi>with all your heart</hi>; and <hi>that</hi> on pain of eternal damnation. The obligation of <hi>this law</hi> is perpetually binding upon you, and inceſſantly urging and preſſing and purſuing you, and this <hi>with the whole weight</hi> of the authority of the GREAT GOD—with all the binding force and obligation that the authority of JEHOVAH himſelf can give it: And you, at the ſame time, under the power of ſuch an invincible obſtinacy, ſuch an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable averſion of will, from even the leaſt degree of compliance, as nothing but <hi>divine power itſelf,</hi> can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and overcome! O ſinner, how dreadfully wretched and dangerous indeed is your condition! How inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly evil and odious is your character in the ſight of GOD! Surely you are in the hands of an abſolutely ſovereign GOD. On <hi>his</hi> pleaſure alone is your eternal ſtate ſuſpended: And on <hi>him</hi> alone doth it depend, whether you ſhall be brought to dwell with him, in Heaven; or, be ſent to an eternal hell. <hi>His</hi> decree, <hi>his</hi> pleaſure, will fix your fate for eternity. Oh! that you might ſee and feel this; as until then, there can be no hope of you! Come, then, and bow to his glorious ſovereign; acknowledge <hi>your own offence, and ſeek his face.</hi> Do not any longer, juſtify yourſelves and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with GOD: But <hi>kiſs the ſon leſt he be angry, and ye pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi>
