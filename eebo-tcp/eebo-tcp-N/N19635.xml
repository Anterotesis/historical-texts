            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE upon the Slave-Trade, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE members of this reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Society, by whom I have been invited to deliver a diſcourſe before them, at this their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual meeting, on the Slave-Trade, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ſlavery of the Africans—and all thoſe who are preſent on this occaſion, will not expect that any thing <hi>new</hi> will be ſaid, on a ſubject which has been ſo much canvaſſed of late, and on which ſo many have written, and ſo fully expoſed the unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled unrighteouſneſs, inhumanity and cruelty, and the odious and horrible attendants of it; by which great light has been thrown upon it, and the attention of millions turned to it; and they have been led to execrate it, as a moſt ſhocking, outrageous violation of all the rights of man.—And there are none, or very few, now, except thoſe whoſe minds are blinded, and their hearts hardened, by cuſtom and their ſuppoſed intereſt, who do not condemn it, as contrary to the true and beſt intereſt of ſociety; and therefore think all lawful endeavours ought to be exerted to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and aboliſh it forever.</p>
            <p>BUT as it is not eaſy fully to explore this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and comprehend it in all its length and breadth, and realize all the evils included in it, it is highly proper and important often to renew our meditations upon it, and to take thoſe methods which are ſuited to impreſs our minds, and the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025631_0004_0FCE9DD9E560AA20"/>
minds of others, more and more with the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this practice, viewed in every different light, and in all the evil conſequences of it.</p>
            <p>IN this view, and to promote ſuch a deſign, the attention, patience and candour of this reſpectable audience are aſked to the following obſervations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſhall be introduced by ſome of the laſt words of the benevolent REDEEMER OF MAN, who came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave—which he ſpake to his diſciples, when he was about to leave the world, and aſcend to heaven, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Evangeliſt Mark, 16th chapter, and 15th verſe, of his goſpel:</p>
            <p>GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD, AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE.</p>
            <p>THIS direction and command is an expreſſion of the greateſt benevolence to man. When the Son of God had become incarnate, and taken upon him the form of a ſervant, and was obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs, in order to make atonement for the ſins of men, and bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, that God might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus, and had riſen from the dead, he ordered that this good news ſhould be publiſhed through the whole world, and the offer of this ſalvation be made to all mankind, of whatever nation or complexion, whether Jews or Gentiles; the more civilized or barbarians, rich or poor, white or black: this being the only remedy for loſt man, ſuited to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him from that ſtate of darkneſs, ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, in which the world of mankind lay, and muſt periſh forever, were it not for this ſalvation.—"Neither is there ſalvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby they can be ſaved."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:025631_0005_0FCE9E22DA3CBC60"/>
AND as this is an infinitely kind and benevolent injunction, it points out and commands a duty, an employment, which muſt be moſt agreeable and pleaſing to every benevolent mind, whatever la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and expence it may require. And they may reaſonably think themſelves highly favoured and honoured, to whom ability and opportunity are given to preach the goſpel, the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, to any of their fellow-men; or who are under advantage to promote this deſign, by any exertion in their power.</p>
            <p>As the goſpel affords the only relief for fallen man, ſo it is a ſufficient and complete one, where the ſpirit of it is cordially imbibed, and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly improved for the purpoſes which it is ſuited to promote. It raiſes ſinners from the greateſt moral depravity, guilt and miſery, to a ſtate of light, pardon and peace, and brings them finally to the enjoyment of complete and endleſs felicity.</p>
            <p>THIS inſtitution of heaven, when properly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, underſtood, and cordially embraced, turns men from darkneſs to marvellous light. If it finds them in a ſtate of ſavage ignorance and barbarity, it civilizes them, and forms them to be intelligent and good members of ſociety. It ſubdues the ſelfiſhneſs, pride and worldly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, and all their inordinate luſts; and "teaches them to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world." It raiſes the mind to the ſight and contemplation of the moſt ſublime, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and entertaining objects, and manifeſts thoſe truths, and gives that light, which are receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pleaſing love and admiration; which make men truly wiſe, and animate them to the practice of every perſonal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſocial and religious duty. It forms
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025631_0006_0FCE9E2406561200"/>
men to uprightneſs, and the practice of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to univerſal benevolence and goodneſs, teaching them to love their neighbour as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to do to other men as they would that others ſhould do unto them. So far as it ſpreads, and has influence on the hearts and lives of men, it baniſhes the manifold evils under which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have groaned in all ages, and introduces peace, love and harmony, among men, and unites them together into a happy ſociety, in which every one puts on bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, meekneſs and long-ſuffering, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing one another, and forgiving each other in love: each one ſtudying and exerting himſelf to do good to all men, according to his ability and opportunity. At the ſame time, it forms men to the moſt ſincere uniform and rational piety, in the exerciſe of love to God and the Redeemer, and to all his friends and ſervants; and they have joy and peace in believing, and ſerving Jeſus Chriſt; and their hope of eternal life in the kingdom of Chriſt is built and flouriſhes on the beſt and moſt ſure foundation.</p>
            <p>THIS command of Chriſt, to preach the goſpel to all the nations in the world, reſpects not only the Apoſtles and diſciples who then heard him ſpeak, and the miniſters of the goſpel in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who have ſince been, or are now, or ſhall be appointed to that work; but is extended to all Chriſtians in every age of the church, requiring them in all proper ways, according to their ability, ſtations and opportunities, to promote this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent deſign, and exert themſelves for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the goſpel; that, if poſſible, all may hear, and ſhare in the happy effects of it. They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ho are not called to be preachers of the goſpel,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025631_0007_0FCE9E27A69073A8"/>
may in many ways aſſiſt thoſe who are ſent forth to this work, and do much to forward the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and ſpreading of Chriſtianity; not only helping by their prayers, but by liberal contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their ſubſtance, and by many other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and exertions. Every true diſciple of Chriſt, who underſtands the goſpel, and prizes it above ſilver and gold, and whoſe heart is expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with love to Chriſt, and benevolence to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-men, muſt not only wiſh and pray that all nations may enjoy the bleſſings of it, and come to the knowledge of this ſaving truth; but conſiders it as an unſpeakable privilege to be in any way, and in the leaſt degree, an inſtrument of promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this deſign, whatever labour and expence it may require. And it is owing to the great and inexcuſable wickedneſs of men, that the goſpel did not ſoon ſpread all over the world, after the reſurrection and aſcenſion of Chriſt, and was not embraced by all men from that day down to this time; which would have prevented the many and dreadful evils which have reigned in the world in all this period, and introduced a glorious ſcene, and ſeries of happy events, which exceed our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conception. Therefore it can be attributed to nothing but the depravity of mankind, that the command of the Saviour has not been obeyed, and all men have not been made to ſhare in the ſaving bleſſings of the goſpel; but that it has been, and ſtill is, ſo unſucceſsful in the world.</p>
            <p>WOULD we know the nature and excellence of Chriſtianity, and the happy tendency of it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the good of mankind, both temporal and eternal, we muſt not expect to learn it from the general appearance of it in what is called the Chriſtian part of the world, and the effect it now
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025631_0008_0FCE9E9006938860"/>
has on the greateſt part of thoſe who enjoy the light of it. But we muſt look into our Bibles, where it is properly and to the beſt advantage deſcribed, and all the doctrines and precepts which it contains are plainly written by the pen of inſpiration. And there we are taught the effect it had on thoſe who cordially embraced the goſpel in the days of the Apoſtles, and to what an excellent character it formed thoſe who became true Chriſtians. And we are informed by credible hiſtorians what a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effect it had in the world, where it ſpread and was embraced for the firſt two or three centuries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the aſcenſion of Chriſt, until the adminiſtration of it was perverted by wicked men, who, with all their worldlineſs and pride, crept into the church, and perverted Chriſtianity in its very nature and deſign, both in doctrine and practice, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate it to their ſelfiſhneſs and pride, and ſo as to anſwer their own worldly ends. And there have been numbers, who in all ages ſince, in the midſt of the general apoſtacy and corruption, have held faſt the form of found doctrine contained in divine revelation; and in their life and practice have been the humble, harmleſs followers of Chriſt, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation, among whom they have ſhone as lights in the world, exhibiting an amiable example of faith, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, righteouſneſs and benevolence, of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent character, we truſt, there is a number now in the Chriſtian world, and among us.</p>
            <p>AMONG many other evil things which have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in this apoſtate world, are tyranny and ſlavery, introduced and practiſed by the luſts, the ſelfiſhneſs, pride and avarice of men; which have been the ſource of unſpeakable unhappineſs and miſery. The goſpel is ſuited to root theſe evils
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025631_0009_0FCE9E93ED849A68"/>
out of the world, and wholly aboliſh ſlavery; and will have this effect where it is fully and faithfully preached, and cordially received and obeyed. For where this takes place, no one will forfeit his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and therefore muſt have a right to it; and no man will make a ſlave of another, were it in his power, who has not forfeited his liberty by the ſentence of proper judges; for in ſo doing he would act contrary to the precepts of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>THE following precept of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, "All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them," which is included in loving our neighbour as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, will ſet at liberty every ſlave who has not forfeited his freedom, or to whom ſlavery can be conſidered as undeſirable, and a calamity, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is properly regarded, and reduced to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY being, in the nature and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of it, and the particular precepts which it contains, thus oppoſed to ſlavery, did gradually, even in its moſt corrupt ſtate, root it out among the nations in the Chriſtian world, ſo that it was almoſt if not wholly aboliſhed for ſome centuries, until it took place again, in a manner and degree which was never known before among any nation or people, ſince the world began, in the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Slave-Trade with the Africans, and their conſequent ſlavery. That this buſineſs, which is ſuch a groſs and open violation not only of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and precepts of Chriſtianity, but of the rights and feelings of humanity, ſhould be undertaken and carried on by nations who call themſelves Chriſtians, and by individuals who bear that name, is truly aſtoniſhing! It is impoſſible fully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, or to have an adequate conception of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025631_0010_0FCE9E954A45F1A0"/>
crimes which have been committed in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the evils which have attended it. If a man of obſervation, diſcernment and humanity, had attended this trade many years, and ſpent the reſidue of his life in the Weſt-Indies, under the beſt advantage to ſee the inhumanity and cruelty, and the various crimes which take place in the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the haves, and the innumerable miſeries which they ſuffer, he would after all have but a very partial idea and conception of the whole; and know but little, compared with all of this kind which takes place. How low and ſaint, then, are our conceptions of this enormous evil! The Great Omnipotent alone, who will bring every work of man into judgment, with every ſecret thing, has a full, clear and perfect knowledge of the whole of this great evil.</p>
            <p>SUFFICE it now, in a few words, to ſay, that by this trade in the bodies and ſouls of men, millions have been violently torn from their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and from every thing dear to them; in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of which, fire and ſword, war and deſolation, and ſlaughter of numbers exceeding ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> reckoning, have taken place through a vaſt extent of country; and multitudes have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to betray, ſteal and ſell their countrymen and neighbours. Many thouſands of theſe, thus taken from their country, and all the enjoyments of life and liberty, and all their deareſt connexions, have died on board the ſhips, in their paſſage to the Weſt-Indies, or to other countries; and the reſt have been ſold like brute beaſts into perpetual ſlavery, with their poſterity after them; where the moſt of them are treated in a manner beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription inhuman and cruel, by owners, maſters and overſeers, many, if not the moſt of whom, are
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025631_0011_0FCE9E99084D2710"/>
hardened againſt all the ſettings of humanity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ſlaves, and are themſelves a nuiſance and burden to the earth, ſo that the Weſt-India iſlands in general are become the greateſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the infernal regions that can be found in this world.</p>
            <p>IN this general, but very ſuperficial and ſcanty view of the Slave-Trade, and the ſlavery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with it, who can forbear pronouncing, that they who have encouraged, proſecuted or ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this traffic in their fellow-men, though ſome of them may have done it in ignorance and unbelief, have really been the emiſſaries of ſatan, and agents for him who delights in the wickedneſs and miſery of mankind? And though they live in Chriſtian lands, and call themſelves Chriſtians, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever plauſible pretences they may make, they have all been really acting moſt contrary to the nature and precepts of Chriſtianity, and doing the works of the devil: and nothing can be more diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the goſpel, and the author of it, than to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reconcile this practice with Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>THIS indeed has been attempted by ſome; and, among other things, it has been pretended, that this treatment of the Africans was right and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, as it was the way to chriſtianize them, by bringing them from a heathen to a Chriſtian land. But is this obedience to the command of the Saviour, "Go into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature?" Is it not directly contrary to this command? Does this direct men to go into heathen lands, and take men by force from their own country, and deſtroy a great part of them, and reduce the reſt to the moſt abject ſlavery, in order to make Chriſtians of them? Does it not rather command us to carry the goſpel to them; and to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025631_0012_0FCE9E97A80A7530"/>
take all proper pains, in the moſt friendly manner, to inſtruct and perſuade them to embrace it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any force or compulſion, that they may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and while they live, and be ſaved from ſin and miſery forever? Do the dealers in ſlaves make any attempts to carry the goſpel to Africa, and propagate it there? Do they ſay a word to their ſlaves about the goſpel, or do any thing that tends to lead them to embrace it? Has not their whole conduct, in their treatment of the Africans, a direct and ſtrong tendency to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? The Slave-Trade, in the manner in which it has been carried on, tends to beget the ſtrongeſt prejudices againſt Chriſtianity in the inhabitants of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And how do thoſe who are brought from that country, and put into a ſtate of ſlavery, and treated as the ſlaves general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are in the Weſt-Indies, naturally and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably look upon theſe dealers in ſlaves, who are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> Is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> poſſible they ſhould look upon them in a better light than we do the ſavages, not to ſay the inhabitants of the infernal regions? What then muſt they think of Chriſtianity? Is this the way to perſuade them to be Chriſtians? What could be done more to prevent it? Many millions of theſe poor creatures have doubtleſs lived and died with the greateſt averſion from Chriſtianity, and even the name of a Chriſtian, from the treatment they have received from thoſe who have called themſelves Chriſtians. And if any

And can it be believed, that theſe deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in ſlaves have carried on this unchriſtian, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human and cruel buſineſs, with a view to chriſtianize thoſe whom they thus injure and oppreſs, or from any motives of benevolence or humanity? This ſeems impoſſible. But if this were poſſible, the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe ſlaves demonſtrates that no ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives exiſt, while no proper methods are taken to inſtruct them in Chriſtianity; and in moſt inſtances there has been not only no care taken to inſtruct them, but conſtant care and exertions to prevent it, added to the prejudices againſt Chriſtianity which have been mentioned. And there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conſider thoſe many millions of ſlaves, who have been made ſo by this trade, as under any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantages for inſtruction, or to become Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, than if they had lived and died in their own country, a few inſtances only excepted. No! this buſineſs has been begun, and carried on, from that ſordid ſelfiſhneſs and avarice, which fortify men's hearts againſt the truths and precepts of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and will lead them to do the work of the evil one, in order to get money, and promote what they conſider to be their worldly intereſt.</p>
            <p>HAD all thoſe who have had a hand in this anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian buſineſs, by which ſo many millions of our fellow-men have been murdered, or treated as brutes, or both, been diſpoſed to take as much pains, and be at as great coſt, to ſend the goſpel

to Africa, and inſtruct and chriſtianize the many nations in that part of the world, as they have taken, and expended, to enſlave and deſtroy them, and thus prejudice them againſt Chriſtianity, they would probably have been the means of ſpreading the goſpel over that vaſt continent, of civilizing thoſe barbarous nations and of the ſalvation of millions; and would have prevented the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and miſery of which they have been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and inſtruments; and would have had the reward of ſuch a benevolent work, and eſcaped the guilt which now lies upon them, and the awful conſequence!</p>
            <p>THIS obſervation opens a ſcene to our view, which is enough to overwhelm the attentive, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind, and muſt therefore be now only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. A future judgment, an eternity to come, will unfold the whole, of which we can now have but a tranſient glimpſe.</p>
            <p>THIS enormous iniquity, and wide-ſpreading evil, the Slave-Trade, with its conſequences, which has been carried on and advanced to ſuch a degree for more than a century, by kings and their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Chriſtian world, is an evidence, among many others, and ſerves to confirm the opinion, that the ſixth vial, mentioned in the ſixteenth chapter of the Revelation, has been running dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time. It is there predicted, that under this vial three unclean ſpirits, the ſpirits of devils, working miracles, or wonderful things, ſhould go forth to the whole world, to gather them together to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</p>
            <p>THE work of theſe ſpirits is to excite men, eſpecially in the Chriſtian world, to extraordinary and wonderful degrees of wickedneſs, by which they unite in arming themſelves againſt heaven,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025631_0015_0FCE9EA08E3C1AA0"/>
and are prepared for the judgments which will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Who can attend to the Slave-Trade, in the manner in which it has been proſecuted, with the extent and conſequences of it, and not be convinced that the hand and power of ſatan has been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> extraordinary degree exerted and manifeſted in it, ſtirring men up to a kind and degree of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſchief, which was not known before?</p>
            <p>AND ſhall this ſhameful practice, this evil, which has got ſuch deep root, and is ſpread ſo far and wide, never have an end? Can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be put to thoſe wicked men, who are devouring their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-men, who are more righteous than they? Muſt this groſs and open violation of the rights of man, of the laws of God, and the benevolent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Saviour, continue forever? Shall the horrid ſcene of unrighteouſneſs, violence, cruelty and miſery, which has ſo long taken place in the Weſt-Indies and Africa, never be aboliſhed?</p>
            <p>THANKS be to God! He has aſſured us, that all theſe works of the devil ſhall be deſtroyed; and that the time is haſtening on, when all the people ſhall be righteous and benevolent, and there ſhall be none to deſtroy or hurt in all the earth. And what has taken place of late, gives reaſon of hope and confidence that this ſore evil will ſoon be made to ceaſe. The attention of thouſands and millions has been awakened, and turned to this ſubject; much has been written upon it, and light and conviction have had a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and extenſive circulation. Numerous ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have been voluntarily formed, wholly to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this evil; and there is reaſon to conclude, that this light and conviction, and theſe exertions, will continue and increaſe, till the Slave-Traders ſhall be utterly deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:025631_0016_0FCE9EA2079FEB68"/>
BUT why is this work ſtill oppoſed or neglected by any? Why are not the cries of the millions of Africans in bondage heard by all? Why do they make no more impreſſion on the public mind, and rouſe all to feel for the wretchedneſs of ſo great a part of their fellow-men, and to exertions for their relief? Why is the Britiſh Parliament ſo ſlow to aboliſh the Slave-Trade, and no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the evidence laid before them of the cruelties and murders which attend this traffic, and of the moral and political evils produced by it; and by the repeated, earneſt and powerful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications made to them?</p>
            <p>AND as to ſome of us Americans, what ſhall we ſay? We have reaſon to reflect with painful ſhame upon the hand we have had in this iniquity; by which ſo many thouſands of our fellow-men, as good by nature as we are, have been deſtroyed, or put into a ſtate of the moſt abject ſlavery, in the Weſt-Indies, or brought to this continent, and ſold like cattle, and in moſt inſtances treated as if they were not men!</p>
            <p>IN the year 1774, when Britain appeared to threaten a war with us, and diſpoſed to deny to us ſome part of the liberty which we claimed, and we had a proſpect of entering into a bloody con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in defence of our own rights, the Slave-Trade, which had been practiſed by us, appeared ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with our contending for our own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that a Congreſs, which then repreſented theſe now United States, made a ſolemn reſolution, in the name of all the people whom they repreſented, in the following words: "We will neither import nor purchaſe any ſlaves imported, after the firſt day of December next, after which time <hi>we will wholly diſcontinue</hi> the Slave-Trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025631_0017_0FCE9EA60F8C6478"/>
be concerned in it ourſelves, nor will we hire our veſſels, or ſell our commodities or manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to thoſe who are concerned in it." And all the people appeared to acquieſce in this reſolution, as reaſonable, important and neceſſary, in order to act a conſiſtent part, while contending for their own liberties, and to have any ground of hope in the protection and ſmiles of a righteous God, and ſucceſs in the ſtruggle into which we were e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. With this reſolution we entered the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; and God appeared to be on our ſide, and wrought wonders in our favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſappointed thoſe who roſe up againſt us, and eſtabliſhed us a free and independent nation.</p>
            <p>AFTER all this, could it have been expected, would it have been believed, if predicted, that ſuch a reſolution, ſo reaſonable and important, on which the hope of ſucceſs was in a great meaſure grounded, and which was doubtleſs one mean of it, ſhould be ſo far forgotten and counteracted, that a Convention, met to form a conſtitution, could not agree upon one, unleſs it did ſecure the continuance of the importation of ſlaves, for a number of years at leaſt? That the Congreſs of the United States ſhould ſo long neglect to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this trade, ſo far as it is acknowledged they have authority to do it, through the oppoſition made to ſuch a meaſure by a ſmall minority? That notwithſtanding laws have been made, by a number of theſe States, prohibiting this trade in human fleſh, it is yet carried on openly <hi>(horreſco referens)</hi> eſpecially in this State, and yet the law be eluded, and cannot be executed? That there are hundreds of thouſands of ſlaves in theſe States, and no effectual meaſures are taken, where the moſt of them are, to give them a proper education, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025631_0018_0FCE9EA74BFD0010"/>
emancipate them, as ſoon as it may be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their beſt good, and that of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>?</p>
            <p>WHEN all this is taken into view by the truly pious, who fear God, and believe his word, is it to be wondered at, that their fleſh trembleth for fear of the righteous judgments of God? Are they to be condemned as ſuperſtitious enthuſiaſts? Have we not all reaſon to fear that the vengeance of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will fall upon us, as a people, in ways per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps which are not now thought of, unleſs we repent and reform?</p>
            <p>BUT may we not hope for better things? That this evil practice will be better inveſtigated, and ſoon utterly ſuppreſſed? That benevolence and compaſſion toward the miſerable Africans will be ſo ſenſibly, and with ſuch ſtrength, exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, by the people in general, that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaſures will be taken to make them a free and happy people? And if it be neceſſary, in order to this, that they ſhould return to Africa, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent which ſeems to be beſt ſuited to their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, may we not wiſh and hope that ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to compenſate them, as far as we may, for the injuries we have done them, and ſuch a ſpirit of benevolence will be excited, that we ſhall with cheerfulneſs contribute every thing neceſſary to anſwer this end?</p>
            <p>WE may hope, that all this dark and dreadful ſcene will not only have an end, but is deſigned by the Moſt High to be the mean of introducing the goſpel among the nations in Africa: that thoſe who have embraced the goſpel, while among us, with all who have been or may be in ſome good meaſure civilized and inſtructed, will, by our aſſiſtance, return to Africa, and ſpread the light
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025631_0019_0FCE9EA8F0804280"/>
of the goſpel in that now dark part of the world; and propagate thoſe arts, and that ſcience, which ſhall recover them from that ignorance and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity which now prevail, to be a civilized, Chriſtian and happy people, making as great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in all uſeful knowledge, and in the practice of righteouſneſs, benevolence and piety, as has yet been done by any people on earth, and much greater. Thus all this paſt and preſent evil which the Africans have ſuffered by the Slave-Trade, and the ſlavery to which ſo many of them have been reduced, may be the occaſion of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balancing good: and it may hereafter appear, as it has in the caſe of Joſeph being ſold a ſlave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egypt, and the oppreſſion and ſlavery of the Iſraelites by the Egyptians, that though the Slave-Traders have really meant and done that which is evil, yet God has deſigned it all for good, the good of which all this evil ſhall be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>OUGHT not this proſpect to animate us earneſtly to pray for ſuch an happy event, and to exert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the utmoſt to promote it? Can we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and negligent in this matter, without ſlighting and diſobeying the command of Chriſt, to go into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature? And will not ſuch an attempt to ſend the goſpel to Africa, being willing to ſpare no expence or labour thus to ſpread the knowledge of the Saviour among the nations there, be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per expreſſion of our love and regard to this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent, important injunction?</p>
            <p>To this end, let us be firm, wiſe and active, in purſuing every proper meaſure to aboliſh the Slave-Trade, and put an end to the ſlavery of the Africans, which is ſo contrary to the goſpel,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025631_0020_0FCE9EAB07B4E298"/>
and has oppoſed and is now a hindrance to the propagation of it in Africa, and is ſo injurious to the ſpiritual and temporal intereſt of all who have any connexion with it.</p>
            <p>MAY none of this reſpectable Society, from ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and ſiniſter views, or from fear of man, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial favour and affection to any, or from indolence and neglect, act a part inconſiſtent with the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent deſign of it, or unworthy of a member of it: but may every one, with the utmoſt care, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, fidelity and fortitude, act a conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent part, and perſevere in conſtant endeavours to promote the important end of this inſtitution, whatever may be the oppoſition from ignorant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted men; knowing that he is engaged in the cauſe of God and human nature.</p>
            <p>LET us conſult and determine what we may do in favour of the blacks among us, eſpecially thoſe who are free; in protecting them from oppreſſion and injuries; by encouraging and aſſiſting them to induſtry, and a prudent management of their worldly affairs; attempting to reform the vicious, to inſtruct the ignorant, and promote morality, virtue and religion, among them; and provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the education of their children in uſeful learning, that they may be raiſed to an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged equality with the white people; and ſome of them, of the moſt promiſing abilities and piety, be fitted to preach the goſpel to their brethren in Africa; and that numbers may be the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to move to that region, and ſettle there, and ſet an example of induſtry and wiſdom in cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the land of that fertile country; and of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Chriſtianity; which will have the beſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to civilize thoſe now barbarous nations, to

How happy, if we, as a people and nation, ſhould cheerfully unite in this, from motives of juſtice and benevolence, and a deſire that the goſpel may be preached to every creature! How unhappy, if we ſhould be forced to part with the ſlaves in theſe States, and ſend them away, from the motives of fear and diſtreſs, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Egyptians to part with their deareſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, in order to thruſt out and ſend the Iſraelites from them, whom they had injured and abuſed!

IF the former, and we ſhould cheerfully agree to do this injured people all the juſtice, and ſhew them all the kindneſs in our power, we ſhould not only take the moſt probable method to avert the divine judgments, and obtain the ſmiles of heaven, and take, perhaps, the beſt method in our reach to promote the propagation of the goſpel; but we, eſpecially ſome of the ſouthern States in the Union, would be delivered from the ſin and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of the ſlavery which now takes place, which is a great moral and political evil, however inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they may now be of it. And ſuch a ſettlement in Africa, properly conducted and ſupported, might be greatly beneficial to the commercial intereſt both of this nation and of thoſe in Africa; and in the end produce a temporal good and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, which might, as far as is now practicable, atone for the evils of the Slave-Trade and ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>BUT, be this as it may, we may be aſſured that we are engaged in a cauſe which will finally proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The Slave-Trade, and all ſlavery, ſhall be totally aboliſhed, and the goſpel ſhall be preached to all nations; good ſhall be brought out of all the evil which takes place, and all men ſhall be united into one family and kingdom under Chriſt the Saviour, and the meek ſhall inherit the earth, and delight themſelves in the abundance of peace. In the proſpect of this, we may rejoice in the midſt of the darkneſs and evils which now ſurround us; and think ourſelves happy, if we may be, in any way, the active inſtruments of haſtening on this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable predicted event.

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>THE propoſal of aſſiſting the blacks among us to go and make a ſettlement in Africa, which has been mentioned in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe, I have thought to be of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as to require a more particular explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be laid before the public, with the reaſons for it, for their conſideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hoping that, if it be generally approved, it will excite thoſe united generous exertions which are neceſſary, in order to effect it.</p>
            <p>THERE are a conſiderable number of free blacks in New-England, and in other parts of the United States, ſome of whom are induſtrious, and of a good moral character; and ſome of them appear to be truly pious, who are deſirous to remove to Africa, and ſettle there. They who are religious, would be glad to unite as Chriſtian brethren, and move to Africa, having one inſtructor, or more, and cultivate the land which they may obtain there, and maintain the practice of Chriſtianity in the ſight of their now heathen brethren; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to inſtruct and civilize them, and ſpread the knowledge of the goſpel among them.</p>
            <p>IN order to effect this in the beſt manner, a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel muſt be procured, and proper ſailors provided, to go to Africa, with a number of perſons, both white and black, perhaps, who ſhall be thought equal to the buſineſs, to ſearch that country, and find a place where a ſettlement may be made with the conſent of the inhabitants there; the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="unknown:025631_0024_0FCE9EB3A6304A78"/>
given by them, or purchaſed of them, and ſo as beſt to anſwer the ends propoſed. If ſuch a place can be found, as no doubt it may, they muſt return, and the blacks muſt be collected who are willing to go and ſettle there, and form themſelves into a civil ſociety, by agreeing in a conſtitution, and a code of laws, by which they will be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
            <p>AND they muſt be furniſhed with every thing neceſſary and proper to tranſport and ſettle them there, in a ſafe and comfortable manner; with ſhipping and proviſions, till they can procure them in Africa, by their own labour; and with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and utenſils neceſſary to cultivate the land, build houſes, &amp;c. and have all the protection and aſſiſtance they will need, while ſettling, and when ſettled there. And, if neceſſary, a number of white people muſt go with them; one or more to ſuperintend their affairs, and others to ſurvey and lay out their lands—build mills and houſes, &amp;c. But theſe muſt not think of ſettling there for life; and the blacks are to be left to themſelves, when they ſhall be able to conduct their own affairs, and need no farther aſſiſtance; and be left a free, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent people.</p>
            <p>THIS appears to be the beſt and only plan to put the blacks among us in the moſt agreeable ſituation for themſelves, and to render them moſt uſeful to their brethren in Africa, by civilizing them, and teaching them how to cultivate their lands, and ſpreading the knowledge of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion among them. The whites are ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated, by education and cuſtom, to look upon and treat the blacks as an inferior claſs of beings, and they are ſunk ſo low by their ſituation, and the treatment they receive from us, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="unknown:025631_0025_0FCE9EB70B66D6A8"/>
can be raiſed to an equality with the whites, and enjoy all the liberty and rights to which they have a juſt claim; or have all the encouragements and motives to make improvements of every kind, which are deſirable. But if they were removed to Africa, this evil would ceaſe, and they would enjoy all deſirable equality and liberty, and live in a climate which is peculiarly ſuited to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. And they would be under advantages to ſet an example of induſtry, and the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of cultivating the land, of civil life, of morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and religion, which would tend to gain the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the inhabitants of that country, and perſuade them to receive inſtruction, and embrace the goſpel.</p>
            <p>THESE United States are able to be at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of proſecuting ſuch a plan, of which theſe hints are ſome of the outlines. And is not this the beſt way that can be taken to compenſate the blacks, both in America and Africa, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries they have received by the Slave-Trade and ſlavery, and that which righteouſneſs and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence muſt dictate? And even ſelfiſhneſs will be pleaſed with ſuch a plan as this, and excite to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to carry it into effect, when the advantages of it to the public and to individuals are well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and realized. This will gradually draw off all the blacks in New-England, and even in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and ſouthern States, as faſt as they can be ſet free, by which this nation will be delivered from that which, in the view of every diſcerning man, is a great calamity, and inconſiſtent with the good of ſociety; and is now really a great injury to moſt of the white inhabitants, eſpecially in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern States.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:025631_0026_0FCE9EB889DBDD60"/>
AND by the increaſe and flouriſhing of ſuch a plantation of free people in Africa, where all the tropical fruits and productions, and the articles which we fetch from the Weſt-Indies, may be raiſed in great abundance, by proper cultivation, and many other uſeful things procured, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce may take place, and be maintained, between thoſe ſettlements and the United States of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, which will be of very great and increaſing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to both.</p>
            <p>AND this will have the greateſt tendency wholly to aboliſh the abominable trade in human fleſh, and will certainly effect it, if all other attempts prove unſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>THAT ſuch a plan is practicable, is evident from the experiment which has lately been made in forming a ſettlement of blacks at Sierra-Leona. Above a thouſand blacks were tranſported from Nova-Scotia to that place laſt year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, by the aſſiſtance of a ſmall number of whites, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from England, have formed a town and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which by the lateſt accounts is now in a flouriſhing condition, the inhabitants living in peace and amity with the neighbouring nations, and with a promiſing proſpect of being a great advantage to them, by teaching them to cultivate their lands, and civilizing them, and ſhewing them the advantages of peace and of induſtry, and trade in the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their country, and ſpreading the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtianity among them. This will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually put an end to the Slave-Trade and to ſlavery in that part of the continent. And from this ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement there is a rational proſpect of a commerce, in the productions of that climate, with Britain, which will be ſo profitable as more than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate
<pb facs="unknown:025631_0027_0FCE9EBA09EED4D8"/>
the latter for all the expence of forming and carrying it on, and will be greatly advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to both nations.</p>
            <p>THERE is reaſon to believe that a ſettlement may be made by the blacks now in the United States in ſome part of Africa, either on the river Sierra-Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, or in ſome other place, which will be as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to thoſe who ſhall ſettle there, and to the adjacent nations, as this which has been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with much leſs expence; and which will be a greater benefit to this nation, than that may be to Britain.</p>
            <p>ARE there not, then, motives ſufficient to induce the Legiſlature of this nation to enter upon and proſecute this deſign, to form a plan, and execute it, as wiſdom ſhall direct? And is there not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that it would meet with general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation? But if this cannot be, may not this be effected by the ſocieties in theſe States, who are formed with a deſign to promote the beſt good of the Africans? Would not this be anſwering the end of their inſtitution, in the beſt way that can be deviſed, and in imitation of that which has been formed in Great-Britain, for the ſame purpoſe?</p>
            <p>IS there not reaſon to believe, that, if ſuch a plan was well digeſted, and properly laid before the public, and urged, with the reaſons which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and a company or committee formed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the affair, there might be a ſum collected ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to carry it into effect?</p>
            <p>THE General Court in the Commonwealth of Maſſachuſetts did ſome time ago make a reſolve to the following purpoſe, that when a place can be found in Africa where the blacks in that State may ſettle to their advantage, they would furniſh them
<pb facs="unknown:025631_0028_0FCE9EBDB702BBB0"/>
with ſhipping and proviſions ſufficient to tranſport them there, and with arms ſufficient to defend them, and farming utenſils ſufficient to cultivate their lands. If all the States in the Union, or moſt of them, would take the ſame meaſure, ſuch a deſign might be ſoon and eaſily carried into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Nothing appears to be wanting but a proper, moſt reaſonable <hi>zeal,</hi> in ſo good a cauſe.</p>
