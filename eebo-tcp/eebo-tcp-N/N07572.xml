            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Apology was unneceſſary. It will be no <hi>Trouble,</hi> but a <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> if I can give you the Satisfaction you deſire. I ſhall therefore immediately communicate to you my Motives for approving the Propoſal of endeavouring to obtain a <hi>Royal Government,</hi> in Exchange for this of the Proprietaries; with ſuch Anſwers to the Objections you mention, as, in my Opinion, fully obviate them.</p>
            <p>I do not purpoſe entering into the Merits of the Diſputes between the Proprietaries and the People: I only obſerve it as a Fact known to us all, that ſuch Diſputes there are, and that they
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009664_0003_0F77882EDEA7F620"/>
have long ſubſiſted, greatly to the Prejudice of the Province, clogging and embarraſſing all the Wheels of Government, and exceedingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the publick Defence, and the Meaſures wiſely concerted by our Gracious Sovereign, for the common Security of the Colonies. I may add it as another Fact, that <hi>we are all heartily tired of theſe Diſputes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very remarkable, that Diſputes of the ſame Kind have ariſen in ALL Proprietary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and ſubſiſted till their Diſſolution; All were made unhappy by them, and found no Relief but in recurring finally to the immediate Government of the Crown. <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland,</hi> are the only Two of the Kind remaining, and both at this Inſtant agitated by the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions between Proprietary Intereſt and Power, and Popular Liberty. Thro' theſe Contentions the good People of that Province are rendered equally unhappy with our ſelves, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary, perhaps, more ſo than our's; for he has no <hi>Quakers</hi> in his Aſſembly to ſaddle with the Blame of thoſe Contentions, nor can he juſtify himſelf with the Pretence, that turning to the Church has made his People his Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had ſcarce been ſettled Twenty Years, when theſe Diſputes began between the firſt Proprietor and the original Settlers; they continued, with ſome Intermiſſions, during his whole Life;— his Widow took them up, and continued them after his Death. Her Sons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009664_0004_0F77882F9AAF5450"/>
them very early, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See their Meſſage to the Aſſembly, in which the Right of ſitting on their own Adjournments is denied.</note> and they ſtill ſubſiſt. —Miſchievous and diſtreſſing as they have been found to both Proprietors and People, it does not appear that there is any Proſpect of their being extinguiſh'd, till either the Proprietary Purſe is unable to ſupport them, or the Spirit of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo broken, that they ſhall be willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to any Thing, rather than continue them. The firſt is not very likely to happen, as that immenſe Eſtate goes on increaſing.</p>
            <p>Conſidering all Circumſtances, I am at length inclin'd to think, that the Cauſe of theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Contentions is not to be ſought for merely in the Depravity and Selfiſhneſs of human Minds. For tho' it is not unlikely that in theſe, as well as in other Diſputes, there are <hi>Faults on both Sides,</hi> every glowing Coal being apt to inflame its Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite; yet I ſee no Reaſon to ſuppoſe that all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary Rulers are worſe Men than other Rulers, nor that all People in Proprietary Governments are worſe People than thoſe in other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I ſuſpect therefore, that the Cauſe is radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, interwoven in the Conſtitution, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the very Nature, of Proprietary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and will therefore produce its Effects, as long as ſuch Governments continue.—And, as ſome Phyſicians ſay, every Animal Body brings into the World among its original Stamina, the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009664_0005_0F7788305EC51B10"/>
Seeds of that Diſeaſe that ſhall finally produce its Diſſolution; ſo the Political Body of a Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Government, contains thoſe convulſive Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that will at length deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>I may not be Philoſopher enough to develop thoſe Principles, nor would this Letter afford me Room, if I had Abilities, for ſuch a Diſcuſſion. The <hi>Fact</hi> ſeems ſufficient for our Purpoſe, and the <hi>Fact</hi> is notorious, that ſuch Contentions have been in all Proprietary Governments, and have brought, or are now bringing, them all to a Concluſion.— I will only mention one Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular common to them all. Proprietaries muſt have a Multitude of private Accounts and Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with almoſt all the People of their Provinces, either for Purchaſe-money or Quit-rents. Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings often occaſion Differences, and Differences produce mutual Opinions of Injuſtice. If Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries do not inſiſt on ſmall Rights, they muſt on the Whole loſe large Sums; and if they do inſiſt on ſmall Rights, they ſeem to deſcend, their Dignity ſuffers in the Opinion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with it the Reſpect neceſſary to keep up the Authority of Government.—The People, who think themſelves injured in Point of Property, are diſcontented with the Government, and grow tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent; and the Proprietaries uſing their Powers of Government to procure for themſelves what they think Juſtice in their Points of Property, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thoſe Powers odious.— I ſuſpect this has had no ſmall Share in producing the Confuſions inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009664_0006_0F7788310EB31B78"/>
to thoſe Governments.—They appear, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to be, <hi>of all others,</hi> the moſt unhappy.</p>
            <p>At preſent we are in a wretched Situation. The Government that ought to keep all in Order is itſelf weak, and has ſcarce Authority enough to keep the common Peace. Mobs aſſemble and kill (we ſcarce dare ſay <hi>murder</hi>) Numbers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent People in cold Blood, who were under the Protection of the Government. Proclamations are iſſued to bring the Rioters to Juſtice. Thoſe Proclamations are treated with the utmoſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity and Contempt. Not a Magiſtrate dares wag a Finger towards diſcovering or apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Delinquents,</hi> (we muſt not call them <hi>Murderers</hi>). They aſſemble again, and with Arms in their Hands, approach the Capital.— The Government truckles, condeſcends to cajole them, and drops all Proſecution of their Crimes; whilſt honeſt Citizens, threatened in their Lives and Fortunes, flie the Province, as having no Confidence in the Publick Protection. We are daily threatened with more of theſe Tumults; and the Government, which in its Diſtreſs call'd aloud on the ſober Inhabitants to come with Arms to its Aſſiſtance, now ſees thoſe who afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Aſſiſtance daily libell'd, abus'd, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac'd by its Partizans for ſo doing; whence it has little Reaſon to expect ſuch Aſſiſtance on another Occaſion:—In this Situation, what is to be done? By what Means is that Harmony between the two Branches of Government to be obtain'd, without which the internal Peace of the Province can not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009664_0007_0F778831DA2924C0"/>
be well ſecured? One Project is, to turn all <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> out of the Aſſembly; or, by obtaining more Members for the Back Counties, to get a Majority in, who are not <hi>Quakers.</hi>—This, perhaps, is not very difficult to do; and more Members for thoſe Counties may, on other Accounts, be proper; but I much queſtion if it would anſwer this End, as I ſee among the Members, that thoſe who are not <hi>Quakers,</hi> and even thoſe from the Back Counties, are as hearty and unanimous in oppoſing what they think Proprietary Injuſtice, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> themſelves, if not more ſo.—Religion has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily nothing to do with our preſent Differences, tho' great Pains is taken to lug it into the Squab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.—And even were the <hi>Quakers</hi> extirpated, I doubt whether the Proprietaries, while they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the ſame Meaſures, would be a Whit more at their Eaſe.—Another Project is, to chuſe none for Aſſembly-men but ſuch as are Friends to the Proprietaries.—The Number of Members is not ſo great, but that I believe this Scheme may be practicable, if you look for Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives among Proprietary Officers and Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. Undoubtedly it would produce great Harmony between Governor and Aſſembly: But how would both of them agree with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Their Principles and Conduct muſt greatly change, if they would be elected a ſecond Year. But that might be needleſs. Six Parts in Seven agreeing with the Governor, could make the Houſe perpetual. This, however, would not
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009664_0008_0F7788329427B6B8"/>
probably eſtabliſh Peace in the Province. The Quarrel the People now have with the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, would then be with both the Proprietaries and Aſſembly. — There ſeems to remain then but one Remedy for our Evils, a Remedy approved by Experience, and which has been tried with Succeſs by other Provinces; I mean that of an immediate ROYAL GOVERNMENT, without the Intervention of Proprietary Powers, which, like unneceſſary Springs and Movements in a Machine, are ſo apt to produce Diſorder.</p>
            <p>It is not to be expected that the Propoſal of a Change like this, ſhould meet with no Objections. —Thoſe you have mention'd to me concerning Liberty of Conſcience and the Privileges of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, are, however, not difficult to anſwer; as they ſeem to ariſe merely from want of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or Acquaintance with the State of other Colonies, before and after ſuch Changes had been made in their Government. <hi>Carolina</hi> and the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> were formerly Proprietary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but now immediately under the Crown; and their Caſes had many Circumſtances ſimilar to ours.—Of the Firſt we are told,</p>
            <p>
               <q>There was a natural Infirmity in the Policy of their Charter, which was the Source of many of the Misfortunes of the Colony, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Imputation on the noble Families con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. For the Grantees, [the Proprietors] being eight in Number, and not incorporated, and no Proviſion being made to conclude the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009664_0009_0F7788335B64EC98"/>
whole Number by the Voices of the Majority, there could not be timely Meaſures always agreed on, which were proper or neceſſary for the good Government of the Plantation. In the mean Time the Inhabitants grew unruly and quarrelled about Religion and Politicks, and while there was a mere Anarchy among them, they were expos'd to the Attacks and Inſults of their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Neighbours, whom they had imprudently provok'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd;— and as if they had conſpir'd againſt the Growth of the Colony, they repealed their Laws for Liberty of Conſcience, though the Majority of the People were Diſſenters, and had reſorted thither under the publick Faith for a compleat Indulgence, which they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Part of their <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>— With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe four Years an End was put to their Sorrows; for about that Time, the Lords Proprietors and the Planters, (who had long been heartily tir'd of each other) were, by the Interpoſition of the Legiſlature, fairly divorc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever, and the Property of the Whole veſted in the Crown <note n="*" place="bottom">New and accurate Account of <hi>Carolina,</hi> p. <hi>14.</hi> Printed at <hi>London, 1733.</hi>

immediate Protection of the Crown.— Nor is there exiſting in any of the <hi>American</hi> Colonies, any <hi>Teſt</hi> impoſed by <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to exclude <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from Offices. In ſome Colonies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, where the Epiſcopalians and in others the Diſſenters, have been predominant, they have made partial Laws in favour of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Sects, and lay'd ſome Difficulties on the others; but thoſe Laws have been, generally, on Complaint, repealed at home.</p>
            <p>It is farther objected, you tell me, that <hi>if we have a Royal Government, we muſt have with it a Biſhop, and a Spiritual Court, and muſt pay Tythes to ſupport an Epiſcopal Clergy.</hi> A Biſhop for <hi>America</hi> has been long talk'd of in <hi>England,</hi> and probably from the apparent Neceſſity of the Thing, will ſooner or later be appointed; becauſe a Voyage to <hi>England</hi> for Ordination is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconvenient and expenſive to the young Clergy educated in <hi>America;</hi> and the Epiſcopal Churches and Clergy in theſe Colonies cannot ſo conveniently be governed and regulated by a Biſhop reſiding in <hi>England,</hi> as by one reſiding among theſe committed to his Care. But this Event will happen neither ſooner nor later for our being, or not being, under a Royal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the Spiritual Court, if the Biſhop ſhould hold one, can have Authority only with his own People, if with them, ſince it is not likely that any Law of this Province will ever be made to ſubmit the Inhabitants to it, or oblige them to pay Tithes; and without ſuch
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009664_0016_0F7788389206AF60"/>
Law, Tithes can no more be demanded here than they are in any other Colony; and there is not a ſingle Inſtance of <hi>Tithes</hi> demanded or paid in any Part of <hi>America.</hi> A Maintenance has, indeed, been eſtabliſhed in ſome Colonies, for the Epiſcopal Clergy; as in <hi>Virginia,</hi> a Royal Government; and in <hi>Maryland,</hi> a Proprietary Government: But this was done by Acts of their own, which they were not oblig'd to make if they did not chuſe it.</p>
            <p>That <hi>we ſhall have a ſtanding Army to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> is another Bugbear rais'd to terrify us from endeavouring to obtain a King's Government. It is very poſſible that the Crown may think it neceſſary to keep Troops in <hi>America</hi> hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to maintain its Conqueſts, and defend the Colonies; and that the Parliament may eſtabliſh ſome Revenue ariſing out of the American Trade to be apply'd towards ſupporting thoſe Troops. It is poſſible too, that we may, after a few Years Experience, be generally very well ſatisfy'd with that Meaſure, from the ſteady Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection it will afford us againſt Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the Security of internal Peace among ourſelves without the Expence or Trouble of a Militia. But aſſure yourſelf, my Friend, that whether we like it or not, our continuing under a Proprietary Government will not prevent it, nor our coming under a Royal Government promote and forward it, any more than they would prevent or procure Rain or Sunſhine.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:009664_0017_0F77883956D1C818"/>The other Objections you have communicated to me, are, that <hi>in caſe of a Change of Proprietary for Royal Government, our Judges and other Officers will be appointed and ſent us from</hi> England; <hi>we muſt have a Legiſlative Council; our Aſſembly will loſe the Right of Sitting on their own Adjournments, we ſhall loſe the Right of chuſing Sheriffs, and annual Aſſemblies, and of voting by Ballot.</hi> I ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Queſtion, whether Judges from <hi>England</hi> would probably be of Advantage or Diſadvantage to our Law Proceedings. It is needleſs, as the Power of appointing them is given to the Governor here, by a Law that has receiv'd the Royal Aſſent, the <hi>Act for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing Courts.</hi> The King's Governor only comes in Place of a Proprietary Governor; he muſt (if the Change is made) take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he finds it. He can alter nothing. The ſame Anſwer ſerves for all the ſubſequent Objections. A Legiſlative Council under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Regulations might perhaps be an Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Conſtitution, but it cannot take Place without our Conſent, as our Conſtitution is otherwiſe eſtabliſh'd; nor can our Aſſembly loſe the <hi>Right of Sitting on their own Adjournments;</hi> nor the People that of <hi>chuſing Sheriffs, and annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Aſſemblies,</hi> or of <hi>Voting by Ballot.</hi> Theſe Rights being all confirm'd by Acts of Aſſembly aſſented to by the Crown.

both paſt in the 4th of Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> I know it has been aſſerted, to intimidate us, that thoſe Acts, ſo far from being approved by the Crown, were never preſented. But I can aſſure you, from good Authority, that they, with forty-eight others. (all paſs'd at the ſame Time by Governor <hi>Evans,</hi>) were duly laid before the Queen in Council; who on the 28th of <hi>April</hi> 1709 referred the ſame to the Board of Trade. The Board on the 8th of <hi>September</hi> 1709, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported upon the ſaid Fifty Acts, that they had conſidered the ſame, and had taken the Opinion of the Attorney General upon ſeveral of them in point of Law; and they repreſented againſt Six of them, as unfit to be continued in force; but as to the other forty-four, the Titles of which are given at large, and among them the two <hi>material Acts</hi> above mentioned, they had <hi>no Objection</hi> to the ſame. Whereupon there iſſued two Orders of the Queen in Council both dated at the Court at <hi>Windſor,</hi> the 24th of <hi>October</hi> 1709, one repealing the Six Laws objected to; and the other, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the remaining Forty-four. This is a Fact that you may depend upon. There is therefore nothing now that can deprive us of thoſe Privileges but an Act of Parliament; and we may rely on the united Juſtice of King, Lords, and Commons, that no ſuch Act will ever paſs, while we continue loyal and dutiful Subjects. An Act of Aſſembly, indeed may give them up; but I truſt, urgent as they are
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009664_0019_0F77883E77CF5E68"/>
for Admiſſion, we ſhall never ſee Proprietary Friends enow in the Houſe, to make that deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>In fine, it does not appear to me, that this <hi>Change of Government</hi> can poſſibly hurt us; and I ſee many Advantages that may flow from it. The Expreſſion, <hi>Change of Government,</hi> ſeems, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to be too extenſive; and is apt to give the Idea of a general and total Change of our Laws and Conſtitution. It is rather and only a <hi>Change of Governor,</hi> that is, inſtead of ſelf-intereſted Proprietaries, a gracious King! His Majeſty who has no Views but for the Good of the People will thenceforth appoint the Governor, who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhackled by Proprietary Inſtructions, will be at Liberty to join with the Aſſembly in enacting wholeſome Laws. At preſent, when the King requires Supplies of his faithful Subjects, and they are willing and deſirous to grant them, the Proprietaries intervene and ſay, <hi>unleſs our private Intereſts in certain Particulars are ſerved,</hi> NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THING SHALL BE DONE. This inſolent Tribuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial VETO, has long encumbered all our Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Affairs, and been productive of many Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. By the Meaſure propoſed, not even the Proprietaries can juſtly complain of any Injury. The being oblig'd to fulfill a fair Contract is no Injury. The Crown will be under no Difficulty in compleating the old Contract made with their Father, as there needs no Application to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the neceſſary Sum, ſince half the Quit-Rents

            <p>On the whole, I cannot but think, the more the Propoſal is conſidered, of <hi>an humble Petition to the</hi> KING, <hi>to take this Province under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's immediate Protection and Government,</hi> the more unanimouſly we ſhall go into it.
