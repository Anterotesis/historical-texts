            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And <hi>firſt</hi> then, I am to endeavour to explain what is meant by this Expreſſion in the Text, <hi>If any Man be in CHRIST.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now a Perſon may be ſaid to be <hi>in CHRIST</hi> two Ways. Firſt, only by an outward Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And in this Senſe, every one that is called a Chriſtian, or baptized into CHRIST's Church, may be ſaid to be <hi>in CHRIST.</hi> But that this is not the ſole Meaning of the Apoſtle's Phraſe now before us, is evident, becauſe then <q>every one that names the Name of CHRIST,</q> or is baptized into his viſible Church, would be a <hi>new Creature.</hi> Which is notoriouſly falſe, it being too plain, beyond all Contradiction, that comparatively but few of thoſe that are <hi>"born "of Water,"</hi> are <hi>born of the Spirit"</hi> likewiſe; or, to uſe another Scriptural way of ſpeaking, Many are baptized with Water, which were never, effectually at leaſt, baptized with the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>To be <hi>in CHRIST</hi> therefore, in the full Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Word, muſt certainly mean ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a bare outward Profeſſion, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called after his Name. For, as this ſame Apoſtle tells us, <q>All are not <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that are of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     </q> i. e. when applied to Chriſtianity,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004650_0007_100DDA6C5A9DDBA8"/>
all are not <hi>real</hi> Chriſtians that are <hi>nominally</hi> ſuch. Nay, that is ſo far from being the Caſe, that our Bleſſed LORD himſelf informs us, That many that have propheſied or preached in his Name, and in his Name caſt out Devils, and done many wonderful Works, ſhall notwithſtanding be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed at the laſt Day with <q>a Depart from me, I know you not, ye Workers of Iniquity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It remains therefore, that this Expreſſion, <hi>If any Man be in CHRIST,</hi> muſt be underſtood in a ſecond and cloſer Signification, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>in him</hi> ſo as to partake of the Benefits of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. To be <hi>in him</hi> not only by an outward Profeſſion, but by an inward Change and Purity of Heart, and Cohabitation of his holy Spirit. To be <hi>in him</hi> ſo as to be myſtically united to him by a true and lively Faith, and thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſpiritual Virtue from him, as the Members of the natural Body do from the Head, or the Branches from the Vine. To be <hi>in him</hi> in ſuch a Manner as the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of himſelf, acquaints us he knew a Perſon was, <hi>I know a Man in</hi> CHRIST, ſays he, <hi>i. e.</hi> a true Chriſtian; or, as he himſelf deſires to be <hi>in</hi> CHRIST, when he wiſhes, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that he might be found <hi>in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is undoubtedly the full Purport of the Apoſtle's Expreſſions in the Words of the Text; ſo that what he ſays in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> about Circumciſion, may very well be applied to the preſent Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is not a <hi>real</hi> Chriſtian who is only one <hi>outwardly;</hi> nor is that true Baptiſm, which is only outward in the <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004650_0008_100DDA6E9A81B888"/>
But he is a true Chriſtian, who is one <hi>inwardly,</hi> whoſe Baptiſm is that of the <hi>Heart,</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not merely in the <hi>Water,</hi> whoſe Praiſe is not of Man but of GOD. Or, as he ſpeaketh in another Place, Neither Circumciſion or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion availeth any thing of itſelf, but a <hi>new Creature.</hi> Which amounts to what he here declares in the Verſe now under Conſideration, that if any Man be truly and properly <hi>in</hi> CHRIST, he is a <hi>new Creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What we are to underſtand by being a <hi>New Creature,</hi> was the next and <hi>ſecond</hi> general Thing to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>And here it is evident at the firſt View, that this Expreſſion is not to be ſo explained as tho' there was a Phyſical Change required to be made in us, <hi>i. e.</hi> as tho' we were to be reduced to our primitive <hi>Nothings,</hi> and then created and formed again. For, ſuppoſing we were, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ignorantly imagined, to enter a "ſecond Time into our Mother's Womb, and be born," alas! what would it contribute towards rendring us ſpiritually <hi>new Creatures?</hi> ſince that which was born of Fleſh would be Fleſh ſtill, <hi>i. e.</hi> we would be the ſame carnal Perſons as ever, being derived from carnal Parents, and conſequently receiving the Seeds of all Manner of Sin and Corruption from them. No, it only means, that we muſt be ſo altered as to the Qualities and Tempers of our Minds, that we muſt intirely forget what Manner of Perſons we once were. As it may be ſaid of a Piece of Gold that was in the Ore, after it has been cleanſed, purified and poliſhed,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004650_0009_100DDA729D105E60"/>
that it is a new Piece of Gold; As it may be ſaid of a bright Glaſs that has been covered over with Filth, when it is wiped, and ſo become tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and clear, that it is a new Glaſs: Or, as it might be ſaid of <hi>Naaman,</hi> when he recovered of his Leproſy, and his Fleſh returned unto him like the Fleſh of a young Child, that he was a new Man; ſo our Souls, tho' ſtill the ſame as to Eſſence, yet are ſo purged, purified and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from their natural Droſs, Filth and Leproſy, by the bleſſed Influences of the Holy Spirit, that they may properly be ſaid to be <hi>made anew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How this glorious Change is wrought in the Soul, cannot eaſily be explained. For no One knows the Ways of the Spirit, ſave the Spirit of GOD Himſelf. Not that this ought to be any Argument againſt this Doctrine; for, as our Bleſſed LORD obſerved to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> when he was diſcourſing on this very Subject, <hi>The</hi> Wind, ſays he, <hi>bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the Sound thereof, but knoweſt not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth;</hi> and if we are told of natural Things, and we underſtand them not, how much leſs ought we to wonder, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not immediately account for the inviſible Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Holy Spirit? The Truth of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is this: The Doctrine of our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or <hi>New Birth</hi> in CHRIST JESUS, is "dark and hard to be underſtood" by the natural Man. But that there is really ſuch a Thing, and that each of us muſt be ſpiritually born again, before we can enter into the Kingdom of GOD; or, to keep to the Terms made uſe of in the Text, muſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004650_0010_100DDA75927DEEB8"/>
be <hi>new Creatures</hi> before we can be <hi>in</hi> CHRIST, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew under my</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third</hi> general Head, in which I was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome Arguments to prove, <hi>Why</hi> we muſt be <hi>new Creatures,</hi> in order to qualify us for being ſavingly in CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>And here one would think it ſufficient to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that GOD himſelf, in his holy Word, hath told us ſo. For, not to mention many Texts that might be produced out of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> to prove this Point, (and indeed, by the way, one would wonder how <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who was a <hi>Teacher in Iſrael,</hi> and who was therefore to inſtruct the People in the ſpiritual Meaning of the Law, ſhould be ſo ignorant of this grand Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, as we find he really was, by his aſking our Bleſſed LORD, when he was preſſing on him this Topick, "How can theſe Things be?" Surely, he could not forget how often the Pſalmiſt had begg'd of GOD, to make him a <hi>new Heart,</hi> and <hi>renew</hi> a <hi>right Spirit</hi> within him; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how frequently the Prophets had warned the People to make them <hi>new Hearts,</hi> and <hi>new Minds,</hi> and ſo turn unto the LORD their GOD. But not to mention theſe and ſuch like Texts out out of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi>) this Doctrine is ſo plainly and often repeated in the <hi>New,</hi> that, as I obſerved before, "He that runs may read." For what ſays the great Prophet and Inſtructor of the World himſelf? <hi>Except a Man (i. e.</hi> every one that is naturally engendred of the Offspring of <hi>Adam</hi>) <hi>be born again of Water and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004650_0011_100DDA78513C8190"/>
And leſt we ſhould be apt to ſlight this Aſſertion, and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> - like, reject the Doctrine, becauſe becauſe we cannot immediately explain, How this Thing can be; our bleſſed Maſter therefore affirms it, as it were, by an Oath, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> or, as it may be read, I the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> I, who am Truth itſelf, ſay unto you, that it is the unalterable Appointment of my heavenly Father, <hi>that unleſs a Man be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Agreeable to this are thoſe many Paſſages we meet with in the Epiſtles, where we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be <hi>renewed in the Spirit, i. e.</hi> as was before explained, in the inmoſt Faculties of our Minds; to put off the <hi>Old Man,</hi> which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; and to put on the <hi>New Man,</hi> - which is created after GOD, in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs; That <hi>Old Things</hi> muſt paſs away, and that all Things muſt become <hi>New;</hi> That we are to be ſaved by the <hi>Waſhing</hi> of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and the <hi>Renewing</hi> of the HOLY GHOST. Or, methinks, was there no other Paſſage to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced beſides the Words of the Text, it would be full enough, ſince the Apoſtle therein poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirms, that <hi>If any Man be in CHRIST, I muſt be a new Creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what can be underſtood by all thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Terms of being <hi>born again, of putting off the Old Man,</hi> and <hi>putting on the New,</hi> of being <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our <hi>Minds,</hi> and becoming <hi>new Creatures;</hi> but that Chriſtianity requires a <hi>thorough, real, inward</hi> Change of Hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>? Do we think theſe, and ſuch-like Forms of ſpeaking,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004650_0012_100DDA7A0DCCA378"/>
are mere Metaphors, Words of a bare Sound, without any real ſolid Signification? Indeed, it is to be feared, ſome Men would have them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted ſo; but alas! unhappy Men! they are not to be envied their Metaphorical Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It will be well. if they do not interpret themſelves out of their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Multitudes of other Texts might be produced to confirm this ſame Truth; but thoſe already quoted are ſo plain and convincing, that one would imagine no one ſhould deny it; were we not told, <q>There are ſome, who having Eyes, ſee not, and Ears hear not, and that will not underſtand with their Hearts, or hear with their Ears, leſt they ſhould be converted, and CHRIST ſhould heal them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I proceed to a ſecond Argument to prove, <hi>Why</hi> we muſt be <hi>new Creatures,</hi> in order to be rightly in CHRIST. And that ſhall be taken from the Purity of GOD, and the preſent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and polluted State of Man.</p>
                  <p>Now GOD is deſcribed in Holy Scripture (and I ſpeak to thoſe who profeſs to know the Scripture) as a <hi>Spirit;</hi> as a Being of ſuch infinite Sanctity, as to be of <hi>purer Eyes</hi> than to <hi>behold Iniquity;</hi> as to be ſo tranſcendently <hi>Holy,</hi> that it is ſaid the <hi>very Heavens are not clean in his Sight;</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

under Sin;</hi> nay, as having a Mind which is <hi>Enmity with</hi> GOD, and ſuch like. And ſince then there is ſuch an infinite Diſparity, can any one conceive how ſuch a filthy, corrupted, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Wretch can dwell with an infinitely pure and holy GOD, before he is changed, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in ſome Meaſure, like him? Can He, that is of purer Eyes than to <hi>behold</hi> Iniquity, <hi>dwell</hi> with it? Can He, in whoſe Sight the <hi>Heavens</hi> are not clean, delight to dwell with <hi>Uncleanneſs</hi> itſelf? No; we might as well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Light</hi> to have Communion with <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> or CHRIST to have Concord with <hi>Belial.</hi> But I paſs on to a</p>
                  <p>Third Argument to make good the Apoſtle's Aſſertion in the Text, which ſhall be founded on the Conſideration of the Nature of that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs GOD has prepared for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>To enter indeed on a minute and particular Deſcription of Heaven, would be vain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, ſince we are told, that <hi>Eye</hi> hath not <hi>ſeen,</hi> nor <hi>Ear heard,</hi> neither hath it entred into the <hi>Heart of Man</hi> to <hi>conceive,</hi> the Things that are there prepared for the <hi>ſincere Followers</hi> of the Holy JESUS. However, this we may venture to affirm in the general, that as GOD is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſo the Happineſs he has laid up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or his People is <hi>ſpiritual</hi> likewiſe; and conſequently, unleſs our <hi>carnal</hi> Minds are <hi>changed,</hi> and become <hi>ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized,</hi> we can never be made meet to partake of that Inheritance with the Saints in Light.</p>

                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004650_0014_100DDA7EBB7C9F58"/>
It is true, we may flatter ourſelves, that, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing we continue in our natural corrupt Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and carry all our Luſts along with us, we ſhould, notwithſtanding, reliſh Heaven, was GOD to admit us therein. And ſo we might, was it a <hi>Mahometan Paradiſe,</hi> wherein we were to take our full Swing in ſenſual Delights. But ſince its Joys are only <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Thing can poſſibly enter thoſe bleſſed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, there is an abſolute Neceſſity of our being <hi>changed,</hi> and undergoing a total <hi>Renovation</hi> of our depraved Natures, before we can have any Taſte or Reliſh of thoſe heavenly Pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>It is, doubtleſs, for this Reaſon, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle declares it to be the irrevocable Decree of the Almighty, that <hi>without Holineſs, i. e.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being made pure by <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Image of GOD thereby reinſtamped upon the Soul, <hi>no Man living ſhall ſee the LORD.</hi> And it is very obſervable, that our Divine Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the famous Paſſage before referred to, concerning the abſolute Neceſſity of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> does not ſay, unleſs a Man be born again, he SHALL NOT, but unleſs a Man be born again, he CANNOT enter into the Kingdom of GOD. For it is founded in the very Nature of Things, that unleſs we have Diſpoſitions wrought in us ſuitable and anſwerable to the Objects that are to entertain us, we can take no Manner of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency or Satisfaction in them.

Palate reliſh the richeſt Dainties, or a filthy Swine be pleaſed with the fineſt Garden of Flowers? No: And what Reaſon can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for it? An Anſwer is ready; Becauſe they have neither of them any Tempers of Mind correſpondent or agreeable to what they are to be diverted with. And thus it is with the Soul hereafter. For Death makes no more Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Soul, than as it inlarges its Faculties, and makes it capable of receiving deeper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions either of Pleaſure or Pain. If it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to converſe with GOD here, it will be tranſported with the Sight of his glorious Majeſty hereafter.

we ſhould have as little Reaſon to rejoice in it, as a poor condemned Criminal that is ready to periſh by ſome fatal Diſeaſe, would have in receiving a Pardon from his Judge. For Chriſtians would do well to conſider, that there is not only a legal Hindrance to our Happineſs, as we are Breakers of GOD's Law, but alſo a moral Impurity in our Natures, which renders us incapable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Heaven, (as hath been already prov'd) 'till ſome mighty Change hath been wrought in us. It is neceſſary therefore, in order to make <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Redemption complete, that we ſhould have a Grant of GOD's Holy Spirit to change our Natures, and ſo prepare us for the Enjoyment of that Happineſs our Saviour has purchaſed by his precious Blood.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly the holy Scriptures inform us, that whom CHRIST <hi>juſtifies, i. e.</hi> (as we ſaid before) whoſe Sins he <hi>forgives,</hi> thoſe he alſo <hi>ſanctifies, i. e.</hi> purifies and cleanſes, and totally changeth their corrupted Natures. Nay, in one Place of Scripture, <hi>Sanctification</hi> is put before <hi>Juſtification,</hi> on purpoſe, as it were, to convince us that there is no Salvation to be had without it. But ye are <hi>waſhed,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, but ye are <hi>ſanctified;</hi> and <hi>then</hi> follows, but ye are <hi>juſtified.</hi> As the Scripture alſo ſpeaketh in another Place, CHRIST <hi>is to us Juſtification, Sanctification and</hi> then <hi>Redemption.</hi> Let this therefore be admitted as another indiſputable Argument why we <hi>muſt</hi> be new Creatures, e'er we can be <hi>in</hi> CHRIST, becauſe without it CHRIST is dead in vain.</p>

Proceed we now to the next general Thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To draw ſome Inferences from what has been delivered.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt</hi> then, if he that is in CHRIST muſt be a <hi>new Creature,</hi> this may ſerve as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof for ſome, who reſt in a bare Performance of <hi>outward</hi> Duties, without perceiving any real <hi>inward</hi> Change of Heart.</p>
                  <p>We may obſerve a great many Perſons to be very punctual in the regular Returns of publick and private Prayer, as likewiſe of receiving the Holy Communion, and perhaps, now and then too in keeping a Faſt. And ſo far we grant they do well. But then here is the Misfortune, they reſt barely in the Uſe of the Means, and think all is over, when they have juſt complied with theſe ſacred Inſtitutions; Whereas, were they rightly informed, they would conſider, that all the inſtituted <hi>Means</hi> of Grace, as Prayer, Faſting, Hearing and Reading the Word of GOD, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Bleſſed Sacrament, and ſuch like, are no further ſerviceable to us, than as they are found to make us <hi>inwardly</hi> better, and to carry on the ſpiritual Life in the Soul.</p>
                  <p>It is true, they are <hi>Means,</hi> and <hi>Eſſential</hi> ones too; but then they are <hi>only</hi> Means, they are <hi>Part,</hi> but not the <hi>Whole</hi> of Religion: For if ſo, Who more religious than the <hi>Phariſee?</hi> who faſted twice in the Week, and gave Tythes of all that he poſſeſſed, and yet was not juſtified, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf informs us, in the Sight of GOD.</p>
                  <p>You perhaps, like the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> may faſt often, and make long Prayers; you may, with <hi>Herod,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004650_0018_100DDA8C44B41A00"/>
hear good Sermons gladly; or as <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf, in all Probability, did, receive the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But yet, if you continue vain and trifling, immoral or worldly-minded in your Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and differ from the reſt of your Neighbours barely in going to Church, or in complying with ſome outward Performances, are you better than they? No, in no wiſe; You are by far much worſe, becauſe thoſe that wholly neglect the Means, are anſwerable only for omitting the Uſe of GOD's Ordinances; whereas if you uſe them, and at the ſame Time abuſe them, by not letting them produce their intended Effect, you thereby encourage others to think there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, and therefore muſt expect to <hi>receive the greater Damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> If he that is <hi>in</hi> CHRIST muſt be a <hi>new Creature,</hi> then this may check the groundleſs Preſumption of another Claſs of Profeſſors, who reſt in the Attainment of ſome Moral Virtues, and falſely imagine they are good Chriſtians, if they are juſt in their Dealings, are temperate in their Diet, and do Hurt or Violence to no Man.</p>
                  <p>But if this was all that is requiſite to make us Chriſtians, Why might not the Heathens of old be good Chriſtians, who were remarkable for theſe Virtues? Or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> before his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, who tells us, That then he lived in all good Conſcience, and was, touching the Law. blameleſs; and yet, after his Converſion, we find he renounces all Dependance on Works of this Nature, and only deſires to be found <hi>in</hi> CHRIST,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004650_0019_100DDA9035C08368"/>
and to know the Power of his Reſurrection, <hi>i. e.</hi> to have an experimental Proof of receiving the HOLY GHOST, purchaſed for him by the <hi>Death,</hi> and enſured and applied to him by the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of the Matter is this: Chriſtianity includes Morality, as Grace does Reaſon; but if we are only mere <hi>Moraliſts,</hi> if we are not <hi>inwardly</hi> wrought upon, and changed by the powerful Operations of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and our Moral Actions, proceed from a Principle of a <hi>new Nature,</hi> however we may call ourſelves Chriſtians, it is to be feared we ſhall be found naked at the Great Day, and in the Number of thoſe, who vainly depend on their own Righteouſneſs, and not on the Righteouſneſs of JESUS CHRIST, imputed to and inherent in them, as neceſſary to their eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Nor, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> will this Doctrine leſs condemn thoſe, who reſt in a partial Amendment of themſelves, without going on to Perfection, and experiencing a thorough, real, inward Change of Heart.</p>
                  <p>A little Acquaintance with the World will furniſh us with Inſtances of no ſmall Number of Perſons, who, perhaps, were before openly profane; but ſeeing the ill Conſequences of their Vice, and the many worldly Inconveniencies it has reduced them to, on a ſudden, as it were, grow civilized: and thereupon flatter themſelves that they are very religious, becauſe they differ a little from their former Selves, and are not ſo ſcandalouſly wicked as once they were; Whereas

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly.</hi> If he that is <hi>in</hi> CHRIST muſt be a <hi>new Creature,</hi> then this may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as an infallible Rule for every Perſon of whatever Denomination, Age, Degree or Quality, to judge himſelf by; this being the only ſolid Foundation, whereon we <hi>can</hi> build a well grounded Aſſurance of Pardon, Peace and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>We may indeed depend on the broken Reed of an external Profeſſion; we may think we have done enough, if we lead ſuch ſober, honeſt, moral Lives, as many Heathens did. We may imagine we are in a ſafe Condition, if we attend on the public Offices of Religion, and are conſtant in the Duties of our Cloſets. But unleſs all theſe tend to reform our Lives, and change our Hearts,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004650_0021_100DDA95983A6C50"/>
and are only uſed as ſo many Channels of Divine Grace; as I told you before, ſo I tell you again, Chriſtianity will profit us nothing.</p>
                  <p>Let each of us therefore ſeriouſly put this Queſtion to our Hearts: Have we received the HOLY GHOST ſince we believed? Are we <hi>new Creatures</hi> in CHRIST, or no? At leaſt, if we are not ſo <hi>yet,</hi> is it our daily Endeavour to <hi>become</hi> ſuch? Do we make a conſtant and conſcientious Uſe of all the Means of Grace required thereto? Do we faſt, watch and pray? Do we not only lazily ſeek, but laboriouſly ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate? In ſhort, Do we <hi>renounce</hi> our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, take up our Croſſes and follow CHRIST? If ſo, we are in that narrow Way which leads to Life: We are, at leaſt ſhall in Time, become <hi>new Creatures in CHRIST.</hi> The good Seed is ſown in our Hearts, and will, if duly water'd and nouriſh'd by a regular perſevering Uſe of <hi>all</hi> the Means of Grace, grow up to eternal Life. But on the contrary if we have only <hi>heard,</hi> and know not <hi>experimentally,</hi> whether there be any HOLY GHOST; if we are Strangers to Faſting, Watching and Prayer, and all the other ſpiritual Exerciſes of Devotion; if we are content to go in the broad Way, merely becauſe we ſee moſt other People do ſo, without once reflecting whether it be the right one or not; in ſhort, if we are Strangers, nay Enemies to the Croſs of CHRIST, by leading Lives of Softneſs, Worldly-mindedneſs, and ſenſual Pleaſure, and thereby make others think, that Chriſtianity is but an empty Name, a bare formal Profeſſion; if this
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004650_0022_100DDA98A9A5BA58"/>
be the Caſe, I ſay, then CHRIST is as yet dead in vain as to <hi>us;</hi> we are yet under the Guilt of our Sins; we are unacquainted with that true and thorough Converſion, which alone can intitle us to the Salvation of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Beloved,</hi> I am perſuaded better Things of you, and Things that accompany Salvation, tho' we thus ſpeak; and humbly hope, that you are fully and heartily convinced, that nothing but the Wedding Garment of a <hi>new Nature,</hi> can gain Admiſſion for you at the Marriage Feaſt of the Supper of the Lamb; that you are ſincerely perſuaded, that he that hath not the Spirit of CHRIST is none of his; and that, unleſs the SPIRIT, which raiſed JESUS from the Dead, dwell in you here, neither will your mortal Bodies be quickned by the ſame SPIRIT to dwell with him hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Let me therefore (as was propoſed in the laſt Place) earneſtly exhort you, in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, to act ſuitable to thoſe Convictions, and to live as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that are <hi>commanded</hi> in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> to put off their former Converſation concerning the <hi>Old Man,</hi> and to put on the <hi>New Man,</hi> which is created after GOD in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be owned indeed, that this is a great and difficult Work; but bleſſed be GOD, it is not impoſſible. Many Thouſands of happy Souls have been aſſiſted by a Divine Power to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

He not the GOD of their <hi>Children</hi> alſo? Yes, doubtleſs, of their Children alſo. It is a Task likewiſe that will put us to ſome Pain; it will oblige us to part with ſome Luſt, to break with ſome Friend, to mortify ſome beloved Paſſion, which may be exceeding dear to us, and perhaps as hard to leave, as to cut off a <hi>right Hand,</hi> or pluck out a <hi>right Eye.</hi> But what of all this? Will not the being made a real living Member of CHRIST, a Child of GOD, and an Inheritor of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> abundantly make Amends for all this Trouble? Undoubtedly it will. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Setting about and carrying on this great and neceſſary Work, perhaps may, nay, aſſuredly will expoſe us to the Ridicule of the unthinking part of Mankind, who will wonder, that we run not into the ſame Exceſs of Riot with themſelves; and becauſe we <hi>may deny</hi> our ſinful Appetites, and are not conformed to this World, being commanded in Scripture to do the one, and to have our Converſation in Heaven in Oppoſition to the other, they <hi>may</hi> count our Lives Folly, and our End to be without Honour. But will not the being numbered among the Saints, and ſhining as the Stars for ever and ever, be a more than ſufficient Recompence for all the Ridicule, Calumny, or Reproach, we can poſſibly meet with here?</p>
                  <p>Indeed, was there no other Reward attended a thorough Converſion, but that Peace of GOD, which is the unavoidable Conſequence of it, and which, even in this Life, <hi>paſſeth all Underſtanding,</hi> we ſhould have great Reaſon to rejoice. But

                  <p>It was an Eye to this Objection, joined with the Agreeableneſs and Delightfulneſs of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (for who can but delight to talk of that which the bleſſed Angels deſire to look into?) that induced me to diſcourſe a little on that great and fundamental Article of our Faith; namely, our being freely juſtified from all our Sins by the precious Blood of JESUS CHRIST. <hi>But ye are waſhed,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and by the Spirit of our GOD.</hi>

                  <p>But <hi>ye are juſtified,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle; which is all the ſame as though he had ſaid; You have your Sins forgiven, and are looked upon by GOD, as though you never had offended him at all: For that is the Meaning of the Word <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> in almoſt all the other Paſſages of Holy Scripture where this Word is mentioned. Thus when this ſame Apoſtle writes to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he tells them, that whom GOD calls, thoſe he alſo <hi>juſtifies;</hi> that is, forgives them their Sins: And again, ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Faith, he tells them, that <hi>Abraham believed on</hi> HIM <hi>that juſtifies the Ungodly:</hi> That is, who forgives the ungodly Man his Sins: Which Expreſſion the Apoſtle himſelf explains by a Quotation out of the <hi>Pſalms; Bleſſed is the Man, ſays he, to whom the LORD i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004650_0029_100DDAAA5B7DF6C0"/>
is evident, that being <hi>juſtified,</hi> or having our Sins forgiven, are the ſame as to Signification: So that what the Apoſtle here affirms of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Converts, namely, that they were <hi>juſtified,</hi> amount to what all of us profeſs to hold when we juſt now repeated our <hi>Creed,</hi> and each of us declared in his own Perſon, <hi>I believe the Forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> Which leads me directly to the</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Second</hi> Thing propoſed, namely, To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove that all Mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and every individual Perſon in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſtands in need of being thus <hi>juſtified,</hi> or having his Sins forgiven.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the Apoſtle ſuppoſes this in the Words of the Text: <hi>But ye are juſtified,</hi> ſays he, thereby implying, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (and conſequently all Mankind, there being no Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as will be ſhewn hereafter) ſtood in need of being thus <hi>juſtified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, not to reſt in bare Suppoſitions, in my farther Enlargement on this Second Head, I ſhall endeavour to prove that we all ſtand in need of being <hi>juſtified,</hi> on two Accounts: Firſt, as we ſtand chargeable with Original—Secondly, as we have been guilty of Actual Sin.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I affirm that we all ſtand in need of being <hi>juſtified,</hi> as we are chargeable with Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin: Which, though a Propoſition that might be denied by a ſelf-juſtifying Infidel, who <hi>will not come to</hi> CHRIST <hi>that he may have Life,</hi> and ſtoop to thoſe Terms GOD has gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſettled for his Salvation; yet can never be
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004650_0030_100DDAADCA463020"/>
denied by any one who believes that St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles were written by Divine Inſpiration, where we are told, that <hi>in Adam all die;</hi> that is, <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin was imputed to all: And leſt we ſhould forget to make a particular Application, it is farther added in another Place, that <hi>there is none that doeth good</hi> (that is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Nature) <hi>no, not one:</hi> That we <hi>are all gone out of the Way;</hi> namely, of Original Righteouſneſs; and are by Nature the Children of Wrath. And even <hi>David,</hi> who was the Man after GOD's own Heart, and if any one could, might ſurely plead an Exemption from this univerſal Corruption, yet he confeſſes, that he was <hi>ſhapen in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and</hi> that <hi>in Sin did his Mother conceive him.</hi> And, to mention but one more Text, as immediately applicable to the preſent Purpoſe, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſays, that <hi>Death came upon all Men, for the Diſobedience of one Man,</hi> namely, <hi>of Adam, even upon thoſe</hi> ſays he, (that is, little Children) <hi>who had not ſinned after the Similitude of Adam's Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> or, had not been guilty of actual Sin, and therefore could not be puniſhed with temporal, Death (which came into the World, as this ſame Apoſtle elſewhere informs us, only by Sin) had not the Diſobedience of our firſt Parents been imputed to them. So that what has been ſaid on this Point, ſeems to be excellently ſummed up in that Article of our Church, where ſhe declares, <q>That <hi>Original Sin</hi> ſtandeth not in the following of <hi>Adam,</hi> but it is the Fault and Corruption of the Nature of every Man, that naturally is
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004650_0031_100DDAB160A77388"/>
ingendred of the Offspring of <hi>Adam;</hi> whereby Man is very far gone from Original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and is of his own Nature inclined to Evil, ſo that the Fleſh luſteth always contrary to the Spirit; and therefore in every Perſon born into this World it deſerveth GOD's Wrath and Damnation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have been the more particular in treating of this Point, becauſe it is the very Foundation of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion: For I am verily perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it is nothing but a Want of being well grounded in the Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and of the helpleſs, nay, I may ſay damnable, Condition each of us comes into the World in, that makes ſo many Infidels oppoſe, and ſo many that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo very Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm in their Love and Affections to JESUS CHRIST. It is this, and I could almoſt ſay this only, that makes Infidelity abound amongſt us ſo much as it does: For alas! we are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if we imagine that Men <hi>now</hi> commence or continue Infidels, and ſet up corrupted Reaſon, in Oppoſition to Revelation, merely for want of Evidence, (for I believe it might eaſily be proved, that a modern Unbeliever is the moſt credulous Creature living;) No, it is only for want of an humble Mind, of a Senſe of their Original Depravity, and an Unwillingneſs to own themſelves ſo depraved, that makes them ſo obſtinately ſhut their Eyes againſt the Light of the Glorious Goſpel of CHRIST. Whereas, on the contrary, were they but once pricked to the Heart with a due and lively Senſe of their
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004650_0032_100DDAB3E369CBC0"/>
natural Corruption and Liableneſs to Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſhould have them no more ſcoffing at Divine Revelation, and looking on it as an idle Tale; but they would cry out with convicted <hi>Paul,—LORD, what wouldſt thou have me to do?</hi> Or, with the trembling Jailor, on a like Occaſion, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> It was an Error in this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Point, that made ſo many reſiſt the Evidence the Son of GOD himſelf gave of his Divine Miſſion, when he tabernacled amongſt us. Every Word he ſpake, every Action he did, every Miracle he wrought, proved that he came from GOD. And why then did ſo many harden their Hearts, and would not believe his Report? Why, He himſelf informs us, when he tells us, <hi>They will not come to me that they may have Life:</hi> They will obſtinately ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Means GOD had appointed for their Salvation: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>if the Goſpel he hid, it is hid to them that are loſt: In whom the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them which believe not, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But to return from this Digreſſion, which I could not very well avoid making; if it be asked, How it ſuits with the Divine Goodneſs, to impute the Guilt of one Man's Sin, to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Poſterity? I ſhould think it ſufficient, to make uſe of the Apoſtle's Words: <hi>Nay, but O Man; Who art thou that replied againſt GOD?
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004650_0033_100DDAB60F4C0400"/>
Shall the Thing formed ſay to him that formed it' Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> But, to come to a more direct Reply,—Perſons would do well to conſider, that in this firſt Covenant GOD made with Man, <hi>Adam</hi> acted as a Publick Perſon, as the common Repreſentative of all Mankind, and conſequently we muſt ſtand or fall with him. Had he continued in his Obedience, and not eaten the forbidden Fruit, the Benefits of that Obedience would doubtleſs have been imputed to us: But ſince he did not perſiſt in it, but broke the Covenant GOD made with him, and us in him; who dares charge the righteous Judge of all the Earth with Injuſtice, for imputing that to us alſo? But I ſhall have an Occaſion by and by, to vindicate the Divine Proceeding in this Point more particularly, and therefore I chuſe to wave all farther Conſideration of it in this Place, and proceed to the other Thing propoſed under this Second general Head, namely,</p>
                  <p>II. To endeavour to prove, That we all ſtand in need of being <hi>juſtified,</hi> not only as we are chargeable with <hi>Original</hi> but as we ſtand convicted of <hi>Actual Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That GOD, as he made Man, has a Right alſo to demand his Obedience, I ſuppoſe, is a Truth no one will deny: That He hath alſo given us both a natural and a written Law, whereby we are to be judged, cannot be queſtioned by any one who believes St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> to be of Divine Authority: For in this we are told of a Law written in the Heart, and a Law given by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that each of us hath broken theſe
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004650_0034_100DDAB9DAA01210"/>
Laws, is too evident from our own ſad and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Experience. Accordingly the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inform us that <hi>there is no Man which liveth and ſinneth not;</hi> that <hi>in many things we offend all;</hi> that <hi>if we ſay we have no Sin we deceive ourſelves,</hi> and ſuch like. And if we are thus found Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders againſt GOD, it follows that we ſtand in need of Forgiveneſs for thus Offending Him; unleſs we ſuppoſe GOD ſhould enact Laws, and at the ſame Time not care whether they are obeyed or no; which is as abſurd as to ſuppoſe that a Prince ſhould eſtabliſh Laws for the proper Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Country, and yet let every Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later of them come off with Impunity, But GOD has not dealt ſo fooliſhly with his Creatures: No, as he gave us a Law, he demands our Obedience to that Law, and has obliged us univerſally to obey it, under no leſs a Penalty than incurring his Curſe and eternal Death for every Breach of it. For thus ſpeaks the Scripture: <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all Things that are written in this Book to do them;</hi> as the Scripture alſo ſpeaketh in another Place, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> Now it has already been proved that we have all of us ſinned, and therefore, unleſs ſome Means can be found out to ſatisfy GOD'S Juſtice, we muſt periſh eternally.</p>
                  <p>Let us here then ſtand a while, and ſee in what a deplorable Condition each of us comes into the World, and ſtill continues, till we are put into a State of Grace. For ſurely nothing can well be ſuppoſed more deplorable than to be born under the Curſe of GOD; to be charged with <hi>Original
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004650_0035_100DDABCB9442BE8"/>
Guilt;</hi> and not only ſo, but to be convicted as actual Breakers of GOD'S Law, the leaſt Breach of which juſtly deſerves Eternal Damnation. Surely this can be but a melancholy Proſpect to view ourſelves in, and muſt put us upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving ſome Means whereby we may ſatisfy and appeaſe our offended Judge. But what muſt thoſe Means be? Shall we Repent? Alas! there is not one Word mentioned about Repentance in the firſt Covenant: <hi>The Day that thou eateſt thereof,</hi> ſays GOD, <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> So that if GOD be true, unleſs there be ſome Way found out to ſatisfy his Juſtice, we muſt periſh, and there is no room left for us to expect a Change of Mind in GOD, though we ſhould ſeek it with Tears. Well then, if Repentance will not do, ſhall we plead the Law of Works? Alas! <hi>By the Law ſhall no Man living be juſtified: For by the Law comes the Knowledge of Sin.</hi> It is that which convicts and condemns, and therefore can by no means acquit, much leſs juſtify us. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with then ſhall we come before the LORD, and bow down before the Moſt High GOD;</hi> in order to procure the Forgiveneſs of our Sins? <hi>Shall we come before him with Calves of a Year old, with Thouſands of Rams, or ten Thouſands of Rivers of Oil?</hi> Alas! <hi>GOD has ſhewed thee, O Man, that this will not avail.</hi> For he hath declared, <hi>I will take no Bullock out of thy Houſe, nor He-Goat out of thy Fold: For all the Beaſts of the Foreſt are mine, and ſo are the Cattle upon a Thouſand Hills. Will</hi> not <hi>the LORD then be pleaſed to accept our Firſt-born for our

Tranſgreſſion, the Fruit of our Bodies for the Sin of our Souls?</hi> Even this will not purchaſe our Pardon: For He has declared that <hi>the Children ſhall not bear the Iniquities of their Parents.</hi> Beſides, they are Sinners, and therefore, being under the ſame Condemnation, equally ſtand in need of Forgiveneſs with ourſelves. They are impure, and will the LORD accept the Blind and Lame for Sacrifice? <hi>O wretched Men that we are! Who ſhall deliver us from this. Body of Death?</hi> Why, <hi>I thank GOD, our Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST. Which naturally leads me to the <hi>Third general Thing</hi> propoſed, which was to endeavour to prove,</p>
                  <p>III. That there is no Poſſibility of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this <hi>Juſtification,</hi> which we ſo much want, but by the <hi>precious Blood</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST: <hi>But ye are juſtified in the Name of our Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>But this having been in ſome Meaſure, proved by what has been ſaid under the foregoing Head, wherein I have ſhewn that neither our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Works or Sacrifices could poſſibly take away, or make Attonement for our Sins; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains for me to do under this Head, but to ſhew that the Death of JESUS CHRIST has done it for us.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſhall ſtill have Recourſe <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony.</hi> For after all the moſt ſubtle Diſputations on either ſide, nothing but the lively Oracles of GOD can give us any Satisfaction in this momentous Point: It being ſuch an inconceivable Myſtery, that the Eternal,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004650_0037_100DDAC16581D650"/>
only begotten Son of GOD ſhould die for ſinful Man, that we durſt not have preſumed ſo much as to have thought of it, had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> GOD revealed it in his Holy Word. It is true, Reaſon may ſhew us the Wound, but Revelation only can lead us to the Means of our C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re. And though the Method God has been pleaſed to take to put us in a Way of being happy, may be to the Infidel <hi>a Stumblick-block,</hi> and to the wiſe Opiniator and Diſputer of this World <hi>Fooliſhneſs;</hi> yet <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that is, the Diſpenſation of our Redemption, <hi>will be juſtified,</hi> or approved of, and ſubmitted to <hi>by all her</hi> truly wiſe and holy <hi>Children,</hi> by every ſincere and honeſt <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to come more directly to the Point before us. Two Things, as was before obſerved, we wanted, in order to make our Peace with GOD.</p>

                     <item>1. To be freed from the Guilt of <hi>Original Sin.</hi> And,</item>

                  <p>And both theſe (<hi>Thanks be to GOD for this unſpeakable Gift</hi>) are abundantly ſecured to us by the Death and Paſſion of JESUS CHRIST. For what ſays the Scripture?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, or our being freed from the Guilt of <hi>Original Sin.</hi>—It informs us, that <hi>as in Adam all die, even ſo in</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſhall all be made alive.</hi> And again, <hi>As by the Diſobedience of one Man,</hi> or by one Traſgreſſion, namely, that of <hi>Adam, many were made Sinners, ſo by the Obedience of one,</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>many were made righteous.</hi> And again, <hi>As by the

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> us, (namely, his Juſtice and Mercy) and wholly takes off that Imputation of Injuſtice, which wicked and ungodly Men would blaſphemouſly caſt upon the <hi>Righteous Judge of all the Earth.</hi> Had GOD indeed imputed <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin to his innocent Poſterity, and left them to periſh in it: Had he looked upon and puniſhed them all as Sinners, without providing them a Saviour, we might perhaps have had ſome Pretence to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his Severity, though we could not even then but acknowledge his Juſtice in the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin. But ſince <hi>He has not dealt with us after our Deſerts, nor rewarded us according to our Iniquity;</hi> ſince the ſame Revelation acquaints us, that <hi>As in Adam all die, even ſo in</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſhall all be made alive:</hi> Since the ſame GOD that informs us that <hi>Death came even upon thoſe who had not ſinned after the Similitude of Adam's Tranſgreſſion,</hi> declares likewiſe, that <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> or put into a State of Salvation: I ſay ſince theſe Things are ſo, What Reaſon have ſuch Worms as we to quarrel with the moſt High GOD? Doubtleſs no more than a condemned Criminal has to find
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004650_0039_100DDAC84E900AE8"/>
fault with his Judge for condemning him for breaking the Law, only that he might give him the Pleaſure of a Reprieve. No; as for GOD, his Ways are perfect, and his Dealings with his Creatures are <hi>holy, juſt and good;</hi> and as in all his Diſpenſations, ſo more eſpecially in our Recovery from our fallen Eſtate by the Death of JESUS, we may juſtly ſay, <hi>Mercy and Truth have met together, Righteouſneſs and Peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Pardon for our <hi>actual Tranſgreſſion</hi> of GOD'S Law was another Thing which we wanted to have ſecured to us, before we could be at Peace with GOD. And this the Holy Scriptures inform us is abundantly done by the Death of JESUS CHRIST. The Evangelical Prophet foretels that the promiſed Redeemer ſhould be <hi>wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our Iniquities;</hi> that <hi>the Chaſtiſement of our Peace ſhould be upon him;</hi> and that <hi>by his Stripes we ſhould be healed; Iſaiah</hi> liii. 6.

And in

another Place the ſame Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other; for there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved, but the Name of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 12. How GOD will be pleaſed to deal with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who yet <hi>ſit in Darkneſs and in the ſhadow of Death,</hi> and on whom <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> never yet aroſe, is not for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. <hi>What have we to do to judge thoſe that are without?</hi> To God's Mercy let us recommend them, and wait for a Solution of this Point till the Great Day of Accounts, when all GOD's Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, both of Providence and Grace, will be fully cleared up, by Methods to us, it may be, at preſent unknown, becauſe unrevealed.

                  </p>
                  <p>But it is Time for me to draw towards a Concluſion:</p>
                  <p>I have now then, <hi>Brethren,</hi> by the Bleſſing of GOD, diſcourſed on the Words of the Text in the Method I propoſed; and have in as plain a Manner as I could, ſhewn you what is meant by the Word <hi>Juſtified,</hi> that it ſignifies our having our Sins forgiven: And have alſo in ſome meaſure proved that we all ſtand in need of being thus <hi>juſtified,</hi> as we are chargeable with <hi>Original,</hi> and have been guilty of <hi>Actual Sin:</hi> And laſtly, that nothing but the <hi>Precious Blood</hi> of JESUS CHRIST has, or can procure this ineſtimable Priviledge for us.</p>
                  <p>Many uſeful Inferences might be drawn from what has been delivered; but as I have detained
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004650_0041_100DDACCD176FA50"/>
you, I fear, too long already, permit me only to make a Reflection or two on what has been ſaid, and I have done.</p>
                  <p>If then we are <hi>freely juſtified</hi> by the Death of JESUS CHRIST, let us here pauſe a while; and as before we reflected on the <hi>Miſery,</hi> let us now turn aſide and admire the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Man. But alas! how am I loſt to think that GOD the Father, when we were in a State of Enmity by <hi>Original,</hi> and of Rebellion by our <hi>Actual Sins,</hi> ſhould notwithſtanding yearn in his Bowels towards us his fallen, his apoſtate Creatures: And becauſe nothing but an infinite Ranſom could ſatisfy an infinitely offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſhould ſend his only and dear Son JESUS CHRIST (who is GOD, bleſſed for ever, and who had lain in his Boſom from all Eternity) to die a curſed, painful, ignominious Death, for us and for our Salvation! O who can avoid crying out, on the Conſideration of this great Myſtery of Godlineſs,—<hi>Oh the Depth of the Riches of GOD's Love</hi> to us his wretched, miſerable, undone Creatures! <hi>How unſearchable is his Mercy, and his Loving Kindneſs paſt finding out!</hi> Now know we of a Truth, O GOD, that thou haſt loveſt us, <hi>ſince thou haſt not with-held thy Son, thy only Son</hi> JESUS CHRIST, from thus dying for us.</p>
                  <p>But as we admire the FATHER ſending, let us likewiſe humbly and thankfully adore the SON coming, when ſent to die for Man. But alas! what Thoughts can conceive, what Words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the infinite Greatneſs of that unparalleled

                  <p>THE Amiableneſs of Religion in itſelf, the innumerable Advantages that flow from it to Society in general, as well as each ſincere Profeſſor of it in particular, cannot but recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the Choice of every conſiderate Perſon, and make even wicked Men, as they wiſh to die the Death, ſo, in their more ſober Intervals, envy the Life of the Righteous. And indeed we muſt do the World ſo much Juſtice as to confeſs, that the Queſtion about Religion does not <hi>uſually</hi> ariſe from a Diſpute whether it be neceſſary or not (for moſt Men ſee the Neceſſity of doing ſomething for the Salvation of their Souls) but when is the beſt Time to ſet about it: Perſons are convinc'd by univerſal Experience, that the firſt Eſſays or Endeavours towards the Attainment of Religion are attended with ſome Difficulty and Trouble, and therefore they would willingly defer the beginning ſuch a ſeemingly ungrateful Work as long as they can.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004650_0044_100DDAD4D29A3118"/>
The wanton Prodigal, that is ſpending his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in riotous Living, cries, A little more pleaſure, a little more Senſuality, and then I'll be ſober in Earneſt. The covetous Worldling, that employs all his Care and Pains in <hi>heaping up Riches, tho' he cannot tell who ſhall gather them,</hi> does not flatter himſelf that this will do always; but hopes, with the rich Fool in the Goſpel, to lay up Goods for a few more Years on Earth, and then he'll begin to lay up Treaſures in Heaven. And, in ſhort, thus it is that moſt People are convinced of the Neceſſity of being religious ſome Time or another; but then, like <hi>Felix,</hi> they put off the acting ſuitably to their Convictions, till (what they imagine) a more convenient Seaſon: Whereas, would we be ſo humble as to be guided by the Experience and Counſel of the wiſeſt of Men, we ſhould learn that Youth is the fitteſt Seaſon for Religion; <hi>Remember now thy Creator,</hi> ſays Solomon, <hi>in the Days of thy Youth.</hi> By which Word Remember, we are not to underſtand a bare ſpeculative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, or calling to Mind, (for that, like a dead Faith, will profit us nothing) but ſuch a Remembrance as will conſtrain us to Obedience, and oblige us out of Gratitude to perform all that the LORD our GOD ſhall require of us. For as forgetting GOD, in Scripture Language, implies a total Neglect of our Duty, in like Manner remembring him ſignifies a perfect Performance of it: So that, when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth,</hi> it is the ſame as if he had ſaid, keep GOD's
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004650_0045_100DDAD89B86A950"/>
Commandments; or in other Words, Be religious in the Days of thy Youth; thereby implying that Youth is the moſt proper Seaſon for it.</p>

                     <item>I ſhall in the following Diſcourſe, <hi>Firſt,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make good the Wiſe Man's Propoſition imply'd in the Words of the Text, and to ſhew that Youth is the fitteſt Seaſon for Religion.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By way of Motive, I ſhall conſider the many unſpeakable Advantages that will ariſe from remembring our Creator in the Days of our Youth.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I am to make good the Wiſe Man's Propoſition implied in the Words of the Text, and to ſhew that Youth is the fitteſt Seaſon for Religion: <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth.</hi>—But in Order to proceed more clearly in this Argument, it may not be improper, firſt, to explain what I mean by the Word <hi>Religion.</hi> By this Term, then, I would not be underſtood to mean a bare outward Profeſſion or naming the Name of CHRIST; for we are told, that many that have even propheſied in his Name, and in his Name caſt out Devils, ſhall notwithſtanding be rejected by him at the laſt Day: Nor would I underſtand by it barely being admitted into CHRIST'S Church by Baptiſm; for then <hi>Simon Magus, Arius,</hi> and the Hereſiarchs of old might paſs for religious Perſons, for theſe
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004650_0046_100DDADC32059290"/>
were baptized; nor yet the receiving the other Seal of the Covenant, for then <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf might be canoniz'd for a Saint; nor indeed do I mean any or all of theſe together, conſider'd by themſelves; but a thorough, real, inward Change of Nature, wrought in us by the powerful Operations of the Holy Ghoſt, convey'd to and nouriſh'd in our Hearts, by a conſtant Uſe of all the Means of Grace, evidenc'd by a good Life, and bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The attaining this real, inward Religion, is a Work of ſo great Difficulty, that <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a learned Doctor and Teacher in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thought it altogether impoſſible, and therefore ignorantly asked our Bleſſed LORD, <hi>how this Thing could be?</hi> And <hi>truly</hi> to rectify a diſorder'd Nature, to mortify our corrupt Paſſions, to turn Darkneſs to Light, to put off the old Man, and put on the new, and thereby to have the Image of GOD reinſtamp'd upon the Soul, or in one Word, to <hi>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed, CHRIST'S Yoke is ſaid to be an eaſy or a gracious Yoke, and his Burthen light; but then it is to thoſe only who have been accuſtomed to bear and draw in it. For as the wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> obſerves, <hi>At firſt Wiſdom walketh with her Children in crooked Ways, and brings them into Fear; and torments them with her Diſcipline, and does not turn to comfort and rejoyce them, till ſhe has try'd them and proved their Judgment.</hi>—No; we muſt not flatter ourſelves, that our depraved Natures can
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004650_0047_100DDADDB603FCD8"/>
be renewed, unleſs we ſubmit to a great many Difficulties. The ſpiritual Birth is attended with its Pangs, as well as the natural: For they that have experienc'd it (and they only are the proper Judges) can acquaint you, that frequent Acts of Self-denial muſt be exerciſed, a conſtant regular Diſcipline kept up, left, after all, when we come to the Birth, we ſhould want Strength to bring forth.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>theſe Things are ſo;</hi> if there are Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Pangs attending our being born again, and Diſcipline muſt be called in, what Seaſon more proper than that of Youth; when, if ever, our Bodies are robuſt and vigorous, and our Minds active and courageous, and conſequently we are then the beſt qualified to endure Hardneſs as good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>We find in ſecular Matters People commonly obſerve this Method, and ſend their Children abroad among the Toils and Fatigues of Buſineſs, in their younger Years, as well knowing they are then fitteſt to undergo them. And why do they not act with the ſame Conſiſtency in the grand Affair of Religion? Becauſe, as our Saviour has told us, <hi>the Children of this World are wiſer in their Generation, than the Children of Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> if pure Religion and undefiled conſiſts in the total Renewal of our corrupted Natures, then 'tis not only a Work of Difficulty, but of Time: For, as the old was not, ſo neither is the new Creation compleated in a Day. No, good Men know, by certain Experience, that it is a long while e'er <hi>old Things</hi> can <hi>paſs away,</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:004650_0048_100DDAE08DCC1EA8"/>
and <hi>all Things become new</hi> in them. The ſtrong Man arm'd has gotten too great Poſſeſſion of their Hearts to be quickly driven out, and they are obliged to combat many a weary Hour, e'er their Corruptions, which is the Armour in which the ſtrong Man truſted, be wholly taken from him. Nay, they find their whole Lives ſhort enough to perfect the Work of Regeneration, which they were ſent into the World to do, and never expect to ſay 'tis finiſh'd, till, with their bleſſed Maſter, they bow down their Heads, and give up the Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>And, if this be the Caſe, if the Renovation of our Nature be not only difficult, but requires ſo long a Space to compleat it in; then, it highly concerns every one to ſet about it betimes, and to <hi>work their Work while it is Day, before the Night cometh, when no Man can work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Could we, indeed, live to the Age of <hi>Methuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi> and had but little Buſineſs to employ ourſelves in, we might then be more excuſable, if we made no other Uſe of this World, than, what too many do, <hi>take our Paſtime therein;</hi> but ſince our Lives are ſo very ſhort, and the working out our Salvation requires ſo much Time, we have no Room left for trifling, leſt we ſhould be ſnatched away while our Lamps are untrimmed, and we are entirely unprepared to meet the Bridegroom.</p>
                  <p>Did we know a Friend or Neighbour, who had a long Journey of the utmoſt Importance to make, and yet ſhould ſtand <hi>all the Day idle,</hi> neglecting to ſet out till the Sun was about to go down, we could not but pity and condemn his
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004650_0049_100DDAE217358740"/>
egregious Folly: And yet it is to be feared moſt Men are juſt ſuch Fools; they have a long Journey to take, nay, a Journey to Eternity, a Journey of infinite Importance, and which they are obliged to diſpatch before the Sun of their natural Life be gone down; and yet they loiter away their Time allotted them to perform their Journey in, till Sickneſs or Death ſurprizes them; and then they cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do to inherit eternal Life?</hi> But, alas! is this a proper Seaſon to ask ſuch a Queſtion? Is this a Time to <hi>begin</hi> their Journey, when they ſhould be at the <hi>End</hi> of it; or to enquire what they muſt do, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they have hardly any Strength or Ability left to do any Thing to the Purpoſe, and when they ſhould be waiting with humble Patience, in hopes of ſpeedily receiving their Wages for Work already done? <hi>O fooliſh People and unwiſe! If you offer the Blind for Sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the Lame and Sick, is it not evil? Offer it now unto thy Governor, will he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy Perſon? ſaith the LORD of Hoſts.</hi> But leaving ſuch to the Mercies of GOD, I paſs on to</p>
                  <p>The Second general Thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew the Advantages that will ariſe from <hi>Remembring our Creator in the Days of our Youth;</hi> which may ſerve as ſo many Motives to excite and quicken all Perſons immediately to ſet about it.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>firſt</hi> Benefit reſulting from thence is, that it will bring moſt Honour and Glory to GOD. This, I ſuppoſe, every ſerious Perſon
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004650_0050_100DDAE4C35B8710"/>
will grant, ought to be the Point in which all our Actions ſhould centre; for to this End were we born; to this End were we redeemed by the precious Blood of JESUS CHRIST, that we ſhould promote GOD'S Eternal Glory. And as the Glory of GOD is moſt advanced by paying Obedience to his Precepts, they that begin ſooneſt to walk in his Ways, act moſt to his Glory: For the common Objection againſt the divine Laws in general, and the Doctrines of the Goſpel in particular, is, that they are not practicable, that they are contrary to Fleſh and Blood, and that all thoſe Precepts concerning Self-Denial, Renunciation of and Deadneſs to the World, are but ſo many arbitrary Reſtraints impoſed upon human Nature. But when we ſee mere Striplings not only practiſing, but delighting in ſuch religious Duties, and in the Days of their Youth, when, if ever, they have a Reliſh for ſenſual Pleaſures, ſubduing and deſpiſing the <hi>Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</hi>—This, this is acceptable with GOD; this vindicates his injur'd Honour; this ſhews that his Service is perfect Freedom, <hi>that his Yoke is eaſy, and his Burden light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> as an early Piety redounds moſt to the Honour of GOD, ſo it will bring moſt Honour to ourſelves: For thoſe that honour GOD, GOD will honour. We find it therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd to the Praiſe of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> that he ſerved the LORD from his Youth: Of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that he ſtood, when young, before GOD in a linnen Ephod: Of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that from a Child he had
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004650_0051_100DDAE90FF4CB08"/>
known the Holy Scriptures: Of St. <hi>John,</hi> that he was the youngeſt and moſt beloved Diſciple; and of our Bleſſed LORD himſelf, that at Twelve Years old he went up to the Temple, and ſat among the Doctors, both hearing and asking them Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>Nor, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> will an early Piety afford us leſs Comfort than Honour, not only becauſe it renders Religion habitual to us, but alſo becauſe it gives us a well-grounded Aſſurance of the Sincerity of our Profeſſions. Was there no other Argument againſt a Death-bed Repentance but the Unſatisfactorineſs and Anxiety of ſuch a State, that would be ſufficient to deter all thinking Perſons from deferring the moſt important Buſineſs of their Life to ſuch a dreadful Period of it. For ſuppoſing a Man be ſincere in his Profeſſions of Repentance on a Death-bed (which is very much to be doubted) yet he can take no great Comfort in them, becauſe he is uncertain whether his Convictions and Remorſe proceed from a true Sorrow for Sin, or a ſervile Fear of Puniſhment. But a young Saint need fear no ſuch Perplexity; he knows that he loves GOD for his own Sake, and is not driven to him by a Dread of impending Evil: He does not decline the Gratifications of Senſe, becauſe he can no longer <hi>bear the Voice of Singing-Men and Singing-Women;</hi> but willingly takes up his Croſs, and follows his bleſſed Maſter in his Youth; and therefore muſt have great Confidence of his Sincerity towards GOD. But farther, as an early Piety ſhews the Heart of its Sincerity, ſo likewiſe it brings its preſent
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004650_0052_100DDAEA950155A8"/>
Reward with it, as it renders Religion, and all its Duties, habitual and eaſy. A young Saint, was you to aſk him, would joyfully tell you the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Comfort of beginning to be good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: As for his Part, he knows not what Men mean by talking of Mortification, Self-Denial, and Retirement, as hard and rigorous Duties; for he has ſo accuſtomed himſelf to them, that they are now become even natural, and he takes infinitely more Pleaſure in practiſing the ſevereſt Precepts of the Goſpel, than a luxurious <hi>Dives</hi> in a Bed of State, or an ambitious <hi>Haman</hi> at a Royal Banquet. And, oh! how happy muſt that Youth be, whoſe Duty is become a ſecond Nature, and to whom thoſe Things, which ſeem terrible to others, are grown both eaſy and delightful!</p>
                  <p>But the greateſt Advantage of an early Piety is ſtill behind, <hi>viz.</hi> That it lays in the beſt Proviſion of Comfort and Support againſt ſuch Times as we ſhall ſtand moſt in Need thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> all Times of our Tribulation, and in particular againſt the Time of old Age, the Hour of Death and the Day of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>This is the Argument the Wiſe Man make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Uſe of in the Words immediately following the Text: <hi>Remember now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth, while the evil Days come not, nor the Years draw nigh, wherein thou ſhalt ſay, I have no Pleaſure in them.</hi> Obſerve the Time of old Age is an evil Time, Years wherein there is no Pleaſure; and ask thoſe that are grown old, and they will inform you ſo. Cordials ſurely then moſt be exceeding proper to ſupport our
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004650_0053_100DDAEE85071430"/>
drooping Spirits: And, oh! What Cordial comparable to the grateful Review of a well-ſpent Life? When the Eyes, like <hi>Iſaac'</hi>s, are grown dim with Age; when <hi>the Keepers of the Houſe,</hi> i. e. the Hands, ſhall tremble; as the Wiſe Man goes on to deſcribe the Infirmities of old Age; when <hi>the ſtrong Men bow themſelves,</hi> i. e. when the Legs grow feeble; and <hi>the Grinders,</hi> i. e. the Teeth, ſhall ceaſe to do their proper Office, becauſe they are few; for a Perſon then to hear the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel read over to him, and to be able to lay his Hand on his Heart, and to ſay ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my Youth:</hi> This muſt fill him with ſuch unſpeakable Comfort, that I want Words to expreſs, &amp; Thoughts to conceive it. But, ſuppoſing it was poſſible for us to eſcape the Inconveniencies of old Age, yet ſtill Death is a Debt we all muſt pay; and what is worſe, it generally comes attended with ſuch dreadful Circumſtances, that it will make even a <hi>Felix</hi> tremble. But as for the Godly, that have ſerved the LORD from their Youth, it is not ſo with them; no, they look upon Death not as a <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> but as a welcome Meſſenger, that is come to conduct them to their wiſh'd-for Home. All the Days of their appointed Time have they waited, and it has been the Buſineſs of their whole Lives to prepare themſelves for the coming of their great Change; and therefore they rejoyce to hear, that they are called to meet the heavenly Bridegroom. Thus die the early (I mean the early, if perſevering) pious; whoſe <hi>Path has been as the ſhining Light that ſhineth mere and more,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004650_0054_100DDAF13417AD98"/>
unto the perfect Day.</hi> But follow him beyond the Grave, and ſee with what an holy Triumph he enters into his Maſter's Joy; with what an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Boldneſs he ſtands at the dreadful Tribunal of JESUS CHRIST; and can you then forbear to cry out, <hi>Let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let my latter End, and future State, be like his?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Need I then, after having ſhewn ſo many Advantages to ariſe from an early Piety, uſe any more Arguments to perſuade the younger Part of this Audience, to whom in the Third and laſt Place I addreſs myſelf, to <hi>remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What! will not a Deſire of bringing Glory to GOD, Honour and Comfort to themſelves; will not the Pleaſure of an habitual Piety, and the comfortable Aſſurance of being ſincere; above all, will not the Hopes of an honourable old Age, a peaceful Death, and a glorious Appearance at the tremendous Day of Judgment; will not theſe, I ſay, prevail with them to leave their Huſks, and return home to eat of the fatted Calf? What will they thus requite their Saviour's Love? That be far from them! Did he come down and ſhed his <hi>precious Blood</hi> to deliver them from the Power of Sin; and will they ſpend their youthful Strength and Vigour in the Service of it, and <hi>then</hi> think to ſerve CHRIST, when they can follow their Luſts no longer? Is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> fit, that many who are endowed with excellent Gifts, and are thereby qualified to be Supports and Ornaments of our ſinking Church, ſhould notwithſtanding forget the GOD that gave them, and employ them in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004650_0055_100DDAF3C3C0D4A8"/>
Things that will not profit? O why will they not ariſe, and, like ſo many <hi>Phineas'</hi>s, be zealous for the Lord of Hoſts? Doubtleſs, when Death overtakes them, they will wiſh they had: And what hinders them, but that they may live as well now, as they will wiſh they had when they leave the World? Think you that any one yet ever repented that they began to be good too ſoon? But how many, on the contrary, have repented that they began to be good too late? May we not well imagine, that young <hi>Samuel</hi> now rejoices that he waited ſo ſoon at the Tabernacle of the LORD? Or young <hi>Timothy,</hi> that from a Child he knew the Holy Scriptures? And if you wiſh to be Partakers of their Joy, let me perſuade you to be Partakers of their Piety.</p>
                  <p>I could ſtill go on to fill my Mouth with Arguments; but the Circumſtances and Piety of thoſe amongſt whom <hi>I am now preaching the Kingdom of God,</hi> remind me to change my Style; and inſtead of urging any more Diſſuaſives from Sin, to fill up what is behind of this Diſcourſe, with Encouragements to perſevere in Holineſs.</p>

The many Souls that are nouriſhed weekly by the ſpiritual Body and Blood of JESUS CHRIST by your Means; the weekly and monthly Lectures that are preached by your Contributions; the daily Incenſe of Thankſgiving and Prayer which is publickly ſent up to the Throne of Grace by your Subſcriptions; the many Children which are trained up <hi>in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD,</hi> by your Charities; and laſtly, the commendable and pious Zeal you exert in promoting and encouraging divine Pſalmody, are ſuch plain and apparent Proofs of the Benefit of your Religious Societies, that they call for a publick Acknowledgement of Praiſe and Thankſgiving to our bleſſed Maſter, who has not only put into your Hearts ſuch good Deſigns, but enabled you alſo to bring the ſame to good Effect.</p>

which the Paſſions of the King began to work ſo ſtrongly, that he was obliged, in open Court, to own himſelf affected by the Priſoner's Preaching, and ingenuouſly to cry out,—<hi>Paul, almoſt thou perſuadeſt me to be a Chriſtian.</hi>

                  <p>If you conſider him in reſpect to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he is one that is ſtrictly juſt to all; but then this does not proceed from any Love to GOD or Regard to Man, but only out of a Principle of Self-Love; becauſe he knows Diſhoneſty will ſpoil his Reputation, and conſequently hinder his Thriving in the World.</p>
                  <p>He is one that depends much on being Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively good, and contents himſelf with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of having done no one any Harm; though he reads in the Goſpel, that <hi>the unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servant was caſt into outer Darkneſs,</hi> and the barren Fig-tree curſed and <hi>dried up</hi> from the Roots, not for bearing <hi>bad,</hi> but <hi>no</hi> Fruit.</p>

And then ſhall He ſay unto them on his Left Hand, Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels: For I was an Hungred, and ye gave me no Meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me no Drink; I was a Stranger, and ye took me not in; Naked, and ye cloathed me not; Sick and in Priſon, and ye viſited me not. Then ſhall they alſo ſay, Lord, when ſaw we Thee an hungred, or a-thirſt, or a Stranger, or naked, or ſick, or in Priſon, and did not miniſter unto thee? Then ſhall he anſwer them, Verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye have not done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye did it not unto me: And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi> I thought proper to give you this whole Paſſage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at large, becauſe our Saviour lays ſuch a particular Streſs upon it; and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo little regarded, that were we to judge by the Practice of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> one ſhould be tempted to think there were no ſuch Verſes in the <hi>Bible.</hi>

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004650_0066_100DDB1334FC25E0"/>
then it is not out of Obedience to the Laws of GOD, but either becauſe his Conſtitution will not away with Intemperance; or rather becauſe be is cautious of forfeiting his Reputation, or unfitting himſelf for temporal Buſineſs. But though he is ſo prudent as to avoid Intemperance and Exceſs, for the Reaſons before mentioned; yet he always goes to the Extremity of what is lawful. It is true, he is no Drunkard; but then he has no <hi>Chriſtian Self-Denial</hi> to plead for him. He cannot think our Saviour to be ſo auſtere a Maſter, as to deny us to indulge our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſome Particulars: And ſo by this Means he is kept out of a Senſe of true Religion, as much as if he lived in Debauchery, or any other Crime whatever. As to ſettling his Principles as well as Practice, he is guided more by the World, than by the Word of GOD. As for his Part, he cannot think the Way to Heaven ſo narrow as ſome would make it: And therefore conſiders not ſo much what Scripture requires, as what ſuch and ſuch a good Man does, or what will beſt ſuit his own corrupt Inclinations.

                     <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian:</hi> Not that I can ſay, I have fully deſcribed him to you; but from theſe Out-lines and Sketches of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, if your Conſciences have done their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Offices, and made a particular Application of what has been ſaid to your own Hearts, I cannot but fear that ſome of you may obſerve ſome Features in his Picture, odious as it is, too near reſembling your own; and therefore cannot but hope, at the ſame Time, that you join with the Apoſtle in the Words immediately following the Text, and wiſh yourſelves <hi>not only almoſt, but altogether Chriſtians.</hi>

                  <p>II. But it is Time for me to proceed to the <hi>Second general Thing</hi> propoſed; namely, to conſider the Reaſons why ſo many are no more than <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. And the firſt Reaſon I ſhall mention is, becauſe ſo many ſet out with falſe Notions of Religion; and though they live in a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Country, yet know not what <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is. This perhaps may be eſteemed a hard Saying, but Experience ſadly evinces the Truth of it; For ſome place Religion in being of this or that Communion; more in Morality; moſt in a Round of Duties, and a Model of Performances; and few, very few acknowledge it to be, what it really is, a thorough inward Change of Nature, a Divine Life, a Vital Participation of JESUS CHRIST, an Union of the Soul with GOD; which the Apoſtle expreſſes by ſaying, <hi>He that is joined to the LORD is one Spirit.</hi> Hence it happens that ſo many, even of the moſt knowing
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:004650_0068_100DDB18B48B3F88"/>
Profeſſors, when you come to converſe with them concerning the Eſſence, the Life, the Soul of Religion, I mean our <hi>New Birth</hi> in JESUS CHRIST, confeſs themſelves quite ignorant of the Matter, and cry out with <hi>Nicodemus, How can this Thing be?</hi> And no wonder then, that ſo many are only <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> when ſo many know not what <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is: No Marvel ſo many take up with the <hi>Form,</hi> when they are quite Strangers to the <hi>Power of Godlineſs;</hi> or content themſelves with the Shadow, when they know ſo little about the Subſtance of it. And this is one Cauſe why ſo many are <hi>almoſt,</hi> why ſo few are <hi>altogether Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Second Reaſon that may be aſſigned why ſo many are no more than <hi>almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> is a ſervile Fear of Man: Multitudes there are and have been, who, though awakened to a Senſe of the Divine Life, and <hi>have taſted and felt the Powers of the World to come;</hi> yet out of a baſe ſinful Fear of being counted ſingular, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by Men, have ſuffered all thoſe good Impreſſions to wear off again. It is true they have ſome Eſteem for JESUS CHRIST; but then, like <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> they would <hi>come to him</hi> only <hi>by Night:</hi> They are willing to ſerve him; but then they would do it <hi>ſecretly, for Fear of the Jews:</hi> They <hi>have a Mind to ſee JESUS,</hi> but then <hi>they cannot come to him, becauſe of the Preſs,</hi> for fear of being laughed at, and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed by thoſe with whom they uſed to ſit at Meat. But well did our Saviour propheſy of ſuch Perſons, <hi>How can ye love me which receive
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:004650_0069_100DDB1B552E1E80"/>
Honour one of another?</hi> Alas! have they never read, that <hi>the Friendſhip of this World is Enmity with GOD;</hi> and that our LORD himſelf has threatned, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me or of my Words, in this wicked and adulterous Generation, of him ſhall the Son of Man be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father and of his Holy Angels?</hi> But no Wonder that ſo many are no more than <hi>almoſt Chriſtians</hi> ſince ſo many <hi>love the Praiſe of Men more than the Honour which cometh of GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third Reaſon why ſo many are no more than <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> is a reigning Love of Money. This was the pitiable Caſe of that forward young Man in the Goſpel, who came running to our Bleſſed LORD, and kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, enquired what <hi>He muſt do to inherit Eternal Life;</hi> to which our bleſſed Maſter replied, <hi>Thou knoweſt the Commandments, Do not Kill, Do not commit Adultery, Do not Steal:</hi> To which the young Man replied (Oh that every young Man here preſent could do ſo too) <hi>All theſe I have kept from my Youth.</hi> But when our LORD proceeded to tell him, <hi>Yet lackeſt thou one Thing, Go ſell all that thou haſt and give to the Poor,—he was grieved at that Saying, and went away ſorrowful, for he had great Poſſeſſions!</hi> Poor Youth! he had a good Mind to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and to inherit Eternal Life, but thought it too dear, if it could be purchaſed at no leſs an Expence than of his whole Eſtate! And thus many, both Young and Old, now-a-days come running to worſhip our bleſſed LORD in publick,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004650_0070_100DDB1D07C12350"/>
and kneel before him in private, and enquire at his Goſpel, what they muſt do to inherit Eternal Life: But when they find they muſt renounce the Self-Enjoyment of Riches, and forſake <hi>all</hi> in Affection <hi>to follow Him,</hi> they cry, <hi>The LORD pardon us in this Thing!—We pray Thee, have us excuſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is Heaven ſo ſmall a Trifle in ſuch Men's Eſteem, as not to be worth a little gilded Earth? Is Eternal Life ſo mean a Purchaſe, as not to deſerve the Temporary Renunciation of a few tranſitory Riches? Surely it is. But however inconſiſtent ſuch a Behaviour may be, this inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Love of Money is too evidently the common and fatal Cauſe why ſo many are no more than <hi>Almoſt Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor is the reigning Love of Pleaſure a leſs uncommon, or a leſs fatal Cauſe why ſo many are no more than <hi>almoſt Chriſtians.</hi> Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten Thouſands there are, who deſpiſe Riches, and would willingly be true Diſciples of JESUS CHRIST, would parting with their Money make them ſo; but when they are told that our Bleſſed LORD has laid it down as an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Condition, that <hi>Whoſoever will come after Him muſt deny himſelf;</hi>—like the pitiable young Man before mentioned, <hi>they go away ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful:</hi> For they have too great a Love for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſures. They will, like <hi>Herod,</hi> perhaps ſend for the Miniſters of CHRIST, as he did for <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>hear them gladly:</hi> But touch them in their <hi>Herodias,</hi> tell them they muſt part with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> or ſuch a darling Pleaſure; and with wicked
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004650_0071_100DDB2113483010"/>
                     <hi>Ahab</hi> they cry out, <hi>Haſt thou found us, O our Enemy?</hi> Tell them of the Neceſſity of <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Faſting</hi> and <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> and it is as difficult to them to hear, as if you was to bid them <hi>cut off a Right Hand or pluck out a Right Eye:</hi> They cannot think our Bleſſed LORD requires ſo much at their Hands, though an inſpired Apoſtle has commanded us to <hi>mortify our Members which are upon the Earth:</hi> And he himſelf, even after he had converted Millions, and was very near arrived to the End of his Race, yet profeſſed that it was his daily Practice to <hi>keep under his Body, and bring it into Subjection, leſt after he had preached to others, he himſelf ſhould be a Caſt-away!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome Men would be wiſer than this great Apoſtle, and chalk out to us what they falſely imagine an eaſier Way to Happineſs. They would flatter us we may go to Heaven without offering Violence to our ſenſual Appetites; and <hi>enter into the ſtrait Gate</hi> without <hi>ſtriving</hi> againſt our carnal Inclinations. And this is another Reaſon why ſo many are only <hi>almoſt,</hi> and not <hi>altogether Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth and laſt Reaſon I ſhall aſſign why ſo many are only <hi>almoſt Chriſtians,</hi> is a Fickleſs and Inſtability of Temper.</p>
                  <p>It has been, no doubt, the Misfortune that many a Miniſter and ſincere <hi>Chriſtian</hi> has met with, to weep and wail over Numbers of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Converts, who <hi>ſeemingly</hi> began in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but after a while have fell away, and <hi>baſely</hi> ended in the Fleſh; and this not for want of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004650_0072_100DDB2331EE12F0"/>
right Notions in Religion, nor out of a ſervile Fear of Man, nor out of Love of <hi>Money</hi> or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſure, but out of an Inſtability and Fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper. They looked upon Religion merely for Novelty, as ſomething which pleaſes them for a while; but after their Curioſity was ſatisfied, they have laid it aſide again: Like the young Man that came to ſee JESUS with a Linnen Cloth about his naked Body, they have followed him for a Seaſon, but when Temptations have come to take hold on them, for want of a little more Reſolution, they have been ſtripped of all their good Intentions, and fled <hi>away naked.</hi> They at firſt, <hi>like a Tree planted by the Water-ſide,</hi> grew up and flouriſhed for a while; but <hi>having no Root of themſelves,</hi> no inward Principle of Holineſs and Piety, like <hi>Jonah'</hi>s Gourd, were ſoon <hi>dried up, cut down and withered.</hi> Their good Intentions are but too like the violent Motions of the Animal Spirits of a Body newly beheaded, which tho' impetuous, are not laſting. In ſhort, they ſet out well in their Journey to Heaven, but finding the Way either narrower or longer than they expected,—through an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteadineſs of Temper, they have made an eternal Halt, and ſo <hi>returned like the Dog to his Vomit, or like the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I tremble to pronounce the Fate of ſuch unſtable Profeſſors, <hi>who having put their Hands to the Plow,</hi> for want of a little more Reſolution, ſhamefully <hi>look back.</hi> How ſhall I repeat to them that dreadful Threatning, <hi>If any Man
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004650_0073_100DDB26C46B4960"/>
draw back, my Soul ſhall have no Pleaſure in him:</hi> And again, <hi>It is impoſſible,</hi> that is, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficult at leaſt, <hi>for thoſe that have been once enlightened, and have taſted the good Gift of GOD's</hi> Holy Spirit, <hi>and the Powers of the World to come, if they ſhould fall away, to be renewed again unto Repentance.</hi> But notwithſtanding the Goſpel is ſo ſevere againſt Apoſtates, yet many that begun well, through a Fickleneſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (Oh that none of us here preſent may ever be ſuch) have been by this means of <hi>the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that turn back unto Perdition.</hi> And this is the fifth and laſt Reaſon I ſhall give, why ſo many are only <hi>almoſt,</hi> and not <hi>altogether Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>you, Brethren, have not ſo</hi> learned CHRIST. GOD forbid that a Fear of a little Contempt, a love of a little worldly Gain, or a Fondneſs for a little ſenſual Pleaſure, or want of ſteady Reſolution, ſhould hinder you from entring into Eternal Life, or make you ſo ſottiſh as to think you may compound Matters between GOD and your Souls.</p>
                  <p>III. Proceed we therefore now to the <hi>Third General Thing</hi> propoſed, namely, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Folly of being no more than an <hi>almoſt Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the firſt Proof I ſhall give of the Folly of ſuch a Proceeding is,—that it is ineffectual to Salvation. It is true, ſuch Men are almoſt good, but <hi>almoſt</hi> to hit the Mark, is <hi>really</hi> to miſs it. GOD requires us to <hi>love him with all our Hearts, with all our Souls, and with all our Strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="unknown:004650_0074_100DDB297B696D48"/>
He loves us too well to admit any Rival; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo far as our Hearts are empty of GOD, ſo far muſt they be unhappy. The Devil, indeed, like the falſe Mother that came before <hi>Solomon,</hi> would have our Hearts divided, as ſhe would have had the Child; but GOD, like the true Mother, will have all or none. <hi>My Son give me thy Heart,</hi> thy whole Heart, is the general Call to all: And if we do not perform this Condition, we never can expect the Divine Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Perſons may indeed flatter themſelves, that a partial Obedience will ſerve their Turn; but GOD at the Great Day will ſtrike them dead, as he did <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> by the Mouth of his Servant <hi>Peter,</hi> for pretending to offer him all their Hearts, when they <hi>keep back</hi> from him the greateſt <hi>Part.</hi> They may perhaps impoſe upon their fellow Creatures for a while, but He that enabled <hi>Elijah</hi> to cry out, <hi>Come in thou Wife of Jeroboam,</hi> when ſhe came diſguiſed to enquire about her ſick Son, will alſo diſcover them thro' their moſt artful Diſſimulations, and if <hi>their Hearts are not whole with him—appoint them their Portion with Hypocrites and Unbelievers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> What renders an half-way Piety more inexcuſable is, that it is not only inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to our own Salvation, but alſo moſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to that of others.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004650_0075_100DDB2C1EEE9058"/>
the Way to Heaven is broader than it really is; and thereby, as it was obſerved before, <hi>enter not into the Kingdom of GOD themſelves, and thoſe that are entring in they hinder.</hi> Theſe, theſe are the Men that turn the World into a lukewarm <hi>Laodicean</hi> Spirit; that hang out falſe Lights, and ſo ſhipwreck unthinking benighted Souls in their Voyage to the Haven where they would be. Theſe are they that are greater Enemies to the Croſs of CHRIST, than Infidels themſelves: For of an Unbeliever every one will be aware; but an <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian,</hi> through his ſubtle Hypocriſy, <hi>draws away many after him;</hi> and therefore muſt expect to <hi>receive the greater Damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>thirdly,</hi> as it is moſt prejudicial to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and hurtful to others, ſo it is the greateſt Piece of Ingratitude we can expreſs towards our Lord and Maſter JESUS CHRIST. For did he come down from Heaven, and ſhed his precious Blood, to purchaſe theſe Hearts of ours, and ſhall we only give him half of them? Oh how can we ſay we love him, when our Hearts are not wholly with him? How can we call him our Saviour, when we will not endeavour ſincerely to approve ourſelves to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo let him ſee the Travail of his Soul, and be ſatisfied!</p>
                  <p>Had any of us purchaſed a Slave at a moſt expenſive Rate, that was before involved in the utmoſt Miſeries and Torments, and ſo muſt have continued for ever, had we ſhut up our Bowels of Compaſſion from him; and was this Slave afterwards to grow rebellious, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

giving us but half his Service: How, how ſhould we exclaim againſt his baſe Ingratitude! And yet this baſe ungrateful Slave thou art, O Man, who acknowledgeſt thyſelf to be redeemed from infinite unavoidable Miſery and Puniſhment by the Death of JESUS CHRIST, and yet wilt not give thyſelf wholly to him. But ſhall we deal with GOD our Maker in a manner we would not be dealt with by a Man like ourſelves? ſhall we mete out a leſs Meaſure of Love to our Saviour, than we would have dealt to ourſelves? GOD forbid!</p>
                  <p>IV. No, (that I may come to the <hi>laſt Thing</hi> propoſed, namely, to add a Word or two of Exhortation to be not only <hi>almoſt,</hi> but <hi>altogether Chriſtians)</hi> let us ſcorn all ſuch baſe and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Treatment of our King and Saviour, nay our GOD. Let us not take ſome Pains all our Lives to go to Heaven, and yet plunge ourſelves into Hell at laſt. Let us give GOD our whole Hearts, and no longer <hi>halt between two Opinions: If the World be GOD let us ſerve</hi> That; <hi>If Pleaſure be a GOD let us ſerve</hi> That; but <hi>if the LORD He be GOD,</hi> let us, Oh <hi>let us ſerve Him alone.</hi> Alas! why, why ſhould we ſtand out any longer? Why ſhould we be ſo in Love with Slavery, as not wholly to renounce the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, which, like ſo many ſpiritual Chains, bind down our Souls, and hinder them from flying up to GOD. Alas! what are we afraid of? Is not GOD able to reward our entire Obedience? If he is, as the <hi>almoſt Chriſtian'</hi>s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004650_0077_100DDB3216B487D0"/>
then will we not ſerve him entirely? For the ſame Reaſon we do ſo much, why do we not do more? Or do you think that being only half Religious will make you happy, but that going farther will render you miſerable and uneaſy? Alas! this, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> is Deluſion all over: For what is it but this <hi>half Piety,</hi> this wavering between GOD and the World, that makes ſo many that are ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly well diſpoſed, ſuch utter Strangers to the Comforts of Religion? They chuſe juſt ſo much of Religion as will diſturb them in their Luſts, and follow their Luſts ſo far as to deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Comforts of Religion. Whereas on the Contrary, would they ſincerely <hi>leave all</hi> in Affection, and <hi>give their Hearts</hi> wholly <hi>to GOD,</hi> they would then (and they cannot till then) expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the unſpeakable Pleaſure of having a Mind at unity with itſelf, and enjoy ſuch a <hi>Peace of God,</hi> which even in this Life, <hi>paſſes all Underſtanding,</hi> and which they were entire Strangers to before. It is true, if we will devote ourſelves entirely to GOD, we muſt meet with Contempt; but then it is becauſe Contempt is neceſſary to heal our Pride. We muſt renounce ſome ſenſual Pleaſure; but then it is becauſe thoſe unfit us for Spiritual ones, which are infinitely better. We muſt renounce the Love of the World; but then it is that we may be filled with the Love of GOD: And when that has once enlarged our Hearts, we ſhall like <hi>Jacob</hi> when he ſerved for his beloved <hi>Rachel,</hi> think nothing too difficult to undergo, no Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips too tedious to endure, becauſe of the Love we ſhall then have for our dear Redeemer. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

eaſy, thus delightful will be the Ways of GOD even in this Life: But when once we throw off theſe Bodies, and our Souls are <hi>filled with all the Fullneſs of GOD,</hi> Oh! what Heart can conceive, what Tongue can expreſs, with what unſpeakable Joy and Conſolation we ſhall then look back on our paſt ſincere and hearty Services, which have procured us ſo invaluable a Reward! Think you then, my dear Hearers, we ſhall repent we had done too much; or rather think you not we ſhall be aſhamed that we did no more; and bluſh we were ſo backward to give up all to GOD; when He intended hereafter to give us Himſelf?</p>
                  <p>Let me therefore, to conclude, exhort you, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> to have always the unſpeakable Reward of an entire Obedience ſet before you: And think withal, that every degree of Holineſs you neglect, every Inſtance of Piety you paſs by, is a Jewel taken out of your Crown, a degree of Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs loſt in the Viſion of GOD. Oh! do but always think and act thus, and you will no longer be labouring to compound Matters between GOD and the World; but on the contrary, be daily endeavouring to give up yourſelves more and more unto him; you will be always Watching, always praying, always aſpiring after farther degrees of Purity and Love, and ſo conſequently always preparing yourſelves for a fuller Light and Enjoyment of that GOD, in whoſe Preſence there is Fulneſs of Joy, and at whoſe Right Hand there are Pleaſures for ever more. <hi>Amen!

Reaſon to the Light of of Divine Revelation: For there are Myſteries in Religion, which are above, though not contrary to, our natural Reaſon: And therefore we ſhall never become <hi>Chriſtians</hi> unleſs we caſt down Imaginations, <hi>and every high Thing that exalteth itſelf againſt the Knowledge of GOD, and bring into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity every Thought to the Obedience of</hi> CHRIST.

and capable of no Reward. For we muſt not only do the Will of GOD, but do it <hi>becauſe</hi> it is his Will; ſince we pray that GOD's <hi>Will may be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> And no doubt, the bleſſed Angels not only do every Thing that GOD willeth, but do it chearfully, out of this Principle, becauſe GOD willeth it: And if we would live as we pray, we muſt <hi>go and do likewiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But farther; as we muſt renounce our own Wills in <hi>doing,</hi> ſo likewiſe muſt we renounce them in <hi>ſuffering</hi> the Will of GOD. Whatſoever befals us, we muſt ſay with good old <hi>Eli, It is the LORD, let Him do what ſeemeth him good;</hi> or with one that was infinitely greater than <hi>Eli, Father, not my Will, but thine be done.</hi>—O JESU, thine was an innocent Will, and yet tho renouncedſt it: Teach us, even us alſo, O our Saviour! to ſubmit our Wills to thine, in all <hi>the Evils</hi> which ſhall be <hi>brought upon us;</hi> and <hi>in every Thing</hi> enable us to <hi>give Thanks,</hi> ſince it <hi>is thy</hi> bleſſed <hi>Will concerning us!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly, we muſt <hi>deny</hi> ourſelves, as in our Underſtandings and Wills, ſo likewiſe in our Affections. More particularly we muſt <hi>deny</hi> ourſelves the pleaſurable Indulgence and Self-Enjoyment of Riches: <hi>If any Man will come after me,</hi> ſays our bleſſed LORD, <hi>he muſt forſake all and follow me.</hi> And again (to ſhew the utter Inconſiſtency of the Love of the Things of this World with the Love of the Father) he tells us, that <hi>unleſs a Man forſake all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>
                  </p>

Far be it from me to think that theſe Texts are to be taken in a literal Senſe, as though they obliged rich Perſons to go ſell all that they have and give to the Poor, (for that would put it out of their Power to be ſerviceable to the Poor for the future) but however they certainly imply thus much, That we are to ſit looſe to, ſell and forſake all in Affection, and be willing to part with every Thing, when GOD ſhall require it at our Hands: That is, as the Apoſtle obſerves, we muſt <hi>uſe the World as though we uſed it not;</hi> and tho' we are <hi>in the World,</hi> we muſt not be <hi>of it.</hi> We muſt look upon ourſelves as Stewards and not Proprietors of the manifold Gifts of GOD; provide firſt what is neceſſary for ourſelves and for our Houſholds, and expend the reſt, not in Indulgences and ſuperfluous Ornaments, forbidden by the Apoſtle, but in cloathing, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and relieving the naked, hungry, diſtreſſed Diſciples of JESUS CHRIST. This is what our Bleſſed LORD would have us underſtand by <hi>forſaking all,</hi> and in this Senſe muſt each of us <hi>deny himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible that this will ſeem <hi>an hard Saying</hi> to many, who will be offended becauſe they are covetous, and <hi>Lovers of Pleaſure more than Lovers of God:</hi> But <hi>if I yet pleaſed</hi> ſuch <hi>Men, I ſhould not be the Servant of</hi> CHRIST. No, we muſt not, like <hi>Ahab'</hi>s falſe Prophets, have a <hi>lying Spirit in our Mouths,</hi> nor fail to <hi>declare</hi> (with St. <hi>Paul) the whole Will of God;</hi> and like honeſt <hi>Micajah,</hi> out of Pity and Compaſſion, tell Men the Truth, tho' they may falſely think <hi>we prophecy not Good, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But to proceed: As we muſt renounce our Affection for Riches, ſo likewiſe our Affections for our Relations when they ſtand in Oppoſition to our Love of, and Duty to GOD: For thus ſaith the Saviour of the World: <hi>If any Man will come after me, and hateth not his Father and Mother, his Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea and his own Life alſo, he cannot be a Diſciple.</hi>—Strange Doctrine this! What, hate our own Fleſh! What hate the Father that begat us, the Mother that bare us! <hi>How can theſe Things be?</hi> Can GOD contradict himſelf? Has he not bid us honour our Father and Mother? And yet we are here commanded to hate them. How muſt theſe Truths be reconciled? Why, by interpreting the Word <hi>hate,</hi> not in a rigorous and abſolute Senſe, but <hi>comparatively:</hi> Not as implying a total Alienation, but a leſs degree of Affection. For thus our bleſſed Saviour himſelf (the beſt and ſureſt Expoſitor of his own Meaning) explains it in a parallel Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> x. 37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me: He that loveth Son or Daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</hi> So that when the Perſuaſions of ſuch our Friends (as for our Trial they may be permitted to be) are contrary to the Will of GOD, we muſt ſay with <hi>Levi, we have not known them;</hi> or, agreeably to our bleſſed LORD'S Rebuke to <hi>Peter, Get you behind me,</hi> my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; <hi>for you ſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ur not the Things that be of GOD, but the Things that be of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this Head: We muſt <hi>deny ourſelves</hi> in Things indifferent: For it might eaſily be ſhewn
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:004650_0086_100DDB488A2E1828"/>
that as many, if not more, periſh by an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Uſe of Things in themſelves indifferent as by any groſs Sin whatever. A prudent <hi>Chriſtian</hi> therefore will conſider not only what is <hi>lawful</hi> but what is <hi>expedient</hi> alſo: Not ſo much what degrees of <hi>Self-denial</hi> beſt ſuit his Inclinations here, as what will moſt <hi>effectually</hi> break his Will, and fit him for greater degrees of <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But is this the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtianity?</hi> and is not the Chriſtian World then aſleep? If not, whence the Self-indulgence, whence the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love of Riches which we every where meet with? Above all, whence that predominant Greedineſs of ſenſual Pleaſure, that has ſo over-run this ſinful Nation, that was a pious Stranger to come amongſt us, he would be tempted to think ſome Heathen <hi>Venus</hi> was worſhipped here; and that Temples were dedicated to her Service. But we have the Authority of an inſpired Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to affirm, that <hi>they who live in ſuch a Round of Pleaſure, are dead while they live:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſhall give thee Light.</hi> But the power of raiſing the ſpiritual Dead belongeth only unto GOD.—Do Thou therefore, O Holy JESUS, who by thy almighty Word commandedſt <hi>Lazarus</hi> to come forth, tho' he had lain in the Grave <hi>ſo many</hi> Days, ſpeak alſo as effectually to theſe ſpiritually dead Souls, whom <hi>Satan</hi> for theſe <hi>many</hi> Years has ſo faſt bound by ſenſual Pleaſures, that they are not ſo much as able to lift up their Eyes or Hearts to Heaven.</p>

the Sum and Subſtance of Religion conſiſts in our Recovery from our fallen Eſtate in <hi>Adam,</hi> by a <hi>New Birth</hi> in CHRIST JESUS, there is an abſolute Neceſſity for us to embrace and practiſe the <hi>Self-denial</hi> before recommended.

                  <p>When JESUS CHRIST was <hi>about</hi> to make his publick Appearance, and to preach the glad Tidings of Salvation to a benighted World, his Harbinger <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was ſent <hi>to prepare his Way before him.</hi> In like Manner, when this ſame JESUS is about to take Poſſeſſion of a converted Sinner's Heart, <hi>Self-denial,</hi> like <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> muſt prepare the Way before him: For we muſt <hi>mourn</hi> before we are capable of being <hi>comforted;</hi> we muſt undergo the <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> in order to be made meet to receive <hi>the Spirit of Adoption.</hi>

                  <p>Were we indeed in a State of Innocence, and had we, like <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, the Divine Image fully ſtamped upon our Souls, we then ſhould have no need of <hi>Self-denial;</hi> but ſince we are fallen, ſickly, diſordered Creatures, and this <hi>Self-ſuffering,</hi> this <hi>Self-renunciation,</hi> is the <hi>indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Means</hi> of <hi>recovering</hi> our primitive <hi>Glory;</hi> methinks, in that Caſe, to endeavour to ſhake off and reject ſuch a ſalutary Practice, on account of the Difficulty attending it at firſt, is but too like

But our Souls, by Nature, are in an infinitely more deplorable Condition than the Bodies of <hi>Job</hi> or <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when full of Ulcers and Boils: For, alas! <hi>our whole Head is ſick, and our whole Heart faint, from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, we are full of Wounds and Bruiſes and putrifying Sores, and there is no Health in us.</hi> And JESUS CHRIST, like a good Phyſician, in the Goſpel-Doctrine of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> preſents <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Even <hi>Naaman'</hi>s Servants could ſay, when he refuſed, purſuant to <hi>Eliſha'</hi>s Orders, to waſh in the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> that he might cure his Leproſy, <hi>Father, if the Prophet had bid thee do ſome great Thing, wouldſt thou not have done it?

How much rather then, when he ſaith to thee, Waſh and be clean?</hi> And may not I very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly addreſs myſelf to you in the ſame Manner, my Brethren?—If JESUS CHRIST, our great Prophet, had bid you to do ſome great and very difficult Thing, would you not have done it? Much more then ſhould you do it, when he only bids you <hi>deny yourſelves</hi> what would certainly hurt you if enjoyed, and behold, you ſhall be <hi>made perfectly whole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to illuſtrate this by another Compariſon: In the 12th Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we read, that St. <hi>Peter was kept in Priſon, and was ſleeping between two Soldiers, bound with two Chains: And behold an Angel of the LORD came upon him, and ſmote</hi> Peter <hi>on the Side, ſaying, Ariſe up quickly: And his Chains fell off from his Hands.</hi> But had this great Apoſtle, inſtead of riſing up quickly, and doing as the bleſſed Angel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, hugged his Chains and begged that they might not be let fall from his Hands, would not any one think that he was in love with Slavery, and deſerved to be <hi>executed</hi> next Morning? And does not the Perſon who refuſes to <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> act as inconſiſtently as this Apoſtle would have done if he had neglected the Means of his Deliverance? For our Souls, by Nature, are in a ſpiritual Dungeon, ſleeping and faſt bound between the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, not with Two but Ten Thouſand Chains of Luſts and Corruptions. Now JESUS CHRIST, like St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s good Angel, by his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel comes and opens the Priſon Door, preſcribes

                  <p>Indeed I will not affirm that this Doctrine of <hi>Self-Denial</hi> appears in this juſt Light to every one.

                  <p>III. Proceed we therefore now to the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>laſt general Thing</hi> propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To offer ſome Conſiderations, which may ſerve as ſo many Motives to reconcile us to, and <hi>quicken us</hi> in the Practice of this Duty of <hi>Self-Denial.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. And the firſt Means I ſhall recommend to you, in order to reconcile you to this Doctrine is, to meditate frequently on the Life of our bleſſed Lord and Maſter JESUS CHRIST. Oh! may we <hi>often</hi> think on Him our grand Exemplar! Follow him from his Cradle to the Croſs, and ſee what a <hi>ſelf-denying Life</hi> He led! And ſhall not <hi>we drink of the Cup that he drank of, and be baptized with the Baptiſm that He was baptized with?</hi> Or think we that JESUS CHRIST did and ſuffered every Thing in order to have us excuſed, and exempted from Sufferings? No, far be it from any ſincere <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to judge after this Manner: For St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>He ſuffered for us, leaving us an Example that we ſhould follow his Steps.</hi> Had CHRIST, indeed, like <hi>thoſe that ſat in</hi> Moſes'<hi>s Chair, laid heavy Burthens of Self-Denial</hi> upon us, (ſuppoſing they were heavy, which they are not) and refuſed to <hi>touch them himſelf with one of his Fingers;</hi> we might have had ſome Pretence to complain: But ſince he has enjoined us nothing but what he has firſt

put in Practice himſelf, <hi>Thou art inexcuſeable,</hi> O Diſciple, <hi>whoever thou art,</hi> who wouldſt be above thy perſecuted <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> Maſter: And thou art no good and faithful Servant, who art unwilling to ſuffer and ſympathize with thy mortified, heavenly-minded LORD.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Next to the Pattern of our bleſſed Maſter, think often on the Lives of the glorious Company of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the goodly Fellowſhip of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the noble Army of <hi>Martyrs;</hi> who by a conſtant <hi>looking to the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, have fought the good Fight, and are gone before us to inherit the Promiſes.</hi> View again and again, how holily, how ſelf-denyingly, how unblameably they lived: And if <hi>Self-denial</hi> was neceſſary for them, why not for us alſo? Are we not Men of like Paſſions <hi>with them?</hi> Do we not live in the ſame wicked World as they did? Have we not the ſame good Spirit to aſſiſt, ſupport, and purify us, as they had? And is not the ſame eternal Inheritance reached out, as a Reward of our <hi>Self-denial</hi> and the <hi>Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World,</hi> as was offered to them? And if we have the ſame Nature to change, the ſame wicked World to withſtand, the ſame good Spirit to help, and the ſame Eternal Crown to reward our Obedience; why ſhould not we lead the ſame Lives as they did? Do we think they did Works of Supererogation? If not, why don't we do as they did? Or why does the Church ſet a part Feſtivals to commemorate the Deaths and Sufferings of the Saints, but in order to excite us to <hi>follow them as they did</hi> CHRIST.</p>

And think withal that this, this muſt be our own Caſe ſhortly, unleſs we are wiſe in Time, and ſubmit to thoſe eaſy Conditions our Saviour has preſcribed us, in order to avoid it. Think you they now imagine JESUS CHRIST to be an hard Maſter; or rather think you not they would give ten thouſand times ten thouſand Worlds, could they but return to Life again, and take CHRIST'S eaſy Yoke upon them? and can <hi>we</hi> dwell with everlaſting Burnings more than <hi>they?</hi> No, if we cannot bear this Precept, <hi>Come, deny yourſelves, take up your Croſſes;</hi> how ſhall we bear this irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable Sentence, <hi>Depart from me, ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels?</hi> But I hope thoſe, amongſt whom I am now preaching the Kingdom of GOD, are not ſo diſingenuous as to need to be driven to their Duty by the Terrors of the LORD, but rather deſire to be drawn by the Cords of Love.</p>

                  <p>Obſerve, GOD ſaid, <hi>It is not good,</hi> thereby implying that the Creation would have been imperfect, <hi>in ſome ſort,</hi> unleſs an <hi>Help</hi> was found out <hi>meet for Adam.</hi> And if this was the Caſe of Man before the Fall; if an <hi>Help</hi> was <hi>meet</hi> for him in a State of Perfection, ſurely ſince the Fall, when we come naked and helpleſs out of our Mother's Womb, when our Wants increaſe with our Years, and we can ſcarcely ſubſiſt a Day without the mutual Aſſiſtance of each other, well may we ſay, <hi>It is not good for Man to be alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Society then, we ſee, is abſolutely neceſſary in reſpect to our <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>perſonal</hi> Wants. If we carry our View farther, and conſider Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as divided into different Cities, Countries,

and Nations, the Neceſſity of it will appear yet more evident. For how can Communities be kept up, or Commerce carried on, without <hi>Society?</hi> Certainly not at all, ſince Providence ſeems wiſely to have aſſigned a particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to almoſt each particular Country, on Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as it were, to oblige us to be ſocial; and hath ſo admirably mingled the Parts of the whole Body of Mankind together, <hi>that the Eye cannot ſay to the Hand, I have no Need of Thee; nor again, the Hand to the Foot, I have no Need of Thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many other Inſtances might be given of the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Society,</hi> in Reference to our <hi>bodily, perſonal,</hi> and <hi>national</hi> Wants. But what are all theſe when <hi>weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> in Compariſon of the infinite greater Need of it, with reſpect to the <hi>Soul?</hi> It was chiefly in regard to this better Part, no doubt, that GOD ſaid, <hi>It is not good for the Man to be alone.</hi> For, let us ſuppoſe <hi>Adam</hi> to be as happy as may be, placed as the Lord of the Creation in the <hi>Paradiſe of</hi> GOD, and ſpending all his Hours in adoring and praiſing the bleſſed Author of his Being; yet as his Soul was the very Copy of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> whoſe peculiar Property it is to be communicative, <hi>without the Divine All-Sufficiency,</hi> he could not be compleatly happy, becauſe he was alone and incommunicative, nor even Content in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> for want of a <hi>Partner</hi> in his Joys. GOD knew this, and therefore ſaid, <hi>It is not good that the Man ſhould be alone, I will make a Help meet for him.</hi> And though this
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:004650_0102_100DD791E241BEB0"/>
proved a fatal Means of his falling; yet that was not owing to any natural Conſequence of <hi>Society;</hi> but partly to that curſed Apoſtate, who <hi>craftily lies in wait to deceive;</hi> partly to <hi>Adam's</hi> own Folly, in rather chuſing to be miſerable with one he loved, than truſt in GOD to raiſe him up another Spouſe.</p>
                  <p>If we reflect indeed on that familiar Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe our firſt Parents could carry on with Heaven, in a State of Innocence, we ſhall be apt to think he had as little Need of <hi>Society,</hi> as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Soul,</hi> as before we ſuppoſed him to have, in reſpect to his <hi>Body.</hi> But yet, as GOD and the Holy Angels were ſo far above him on the one Hand, and the Beaſts ſo far beneath him on the other, there was nothing like having one to converſe with, who was <hi>Bone of his Bone, and Fleſh of his Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Man, then, could not be fully happy, we ſee even in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> without a Companion of his own Species, much leſs now he is driven out. For, let us view him a little in his natural Eſtate now, ſince the Fall, as <hi>having his Underſtanding darkened, his Mind alienated from the Life of GOD;</hi> as no more able to ſee his Way wherein he ſhould go, than a Blind Man to deſcribe the Sun: That notwithſtanding this, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Sight e'er he can ſee GOD: And that if he never ſees him, he never can be happy. Let us view him, I ſay, in this Light (or rather this Darkneſs) and deny the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Society</hi> if we can. A Divine Revelation we find is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, we being by Nature as unable
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:004650_0103_100DDB7288C4A8D0"/>
to know, as we are to do our Duty. And how ſhall we learn except one teach us? But was GOD to do this himſelf, how ſhould we, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> exceedingly quake and fear? Nor would the Miniſtry of Angels in this Affair be without too much Terror. It is neceſſary, therefore (at leaſt GOD's Dealing with us hath ſhewed it to be ſo) that we ſhould be <hi>drawn with the Cords of a Man.</hi> And that a Divine Revelation being granted, we ſhould uſe one another's Aſſiſtance, under GOD to inſtruct each other in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to exhort one another to the Practice of thoſe Things which belong to our everlaſting Peace. This is undoubtedly the great End of Society intended by GOD ſince the Fall, and a ſtrong Argument it is, why <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> and why we ſhould <hi>not forſake the aſſembling ourſelves together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But farther, let us conſider ourſelves as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> as having this natural Veil, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, taken off from our Eyes by the Aſſiſtance of GOD's Holy Spirit, and ſo enabled to ſee what he requires of us. Let us ſuppoſe ourſelves in ſome degree to have <hi>taſted the good Word of Life,</hi> and to have felt the Powers of the World to come, influencing and moulding our Souls into a religious Frame: To be fully and heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that we are <hi>Soldiers</hi> lilted under the <hi>Banner of</hi> CHRIST, and have proclaimed open War at our <hi>Baptiſm, againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil;</hi> and have, perhaps, frequently renewed our Obligations ſo to do, by partaking of the <hi>Lord's Supper:</hi> That we are ſurrounded with
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:004650_0104_100DDB745E8E76C8"/>
Millions of Foes without, and infeſted with a Legion of Enemies within: That we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſhine as Lights in the World, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Generation: That we are travelling to a long Eternity, and need all imaginable Helps to ſhew us, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us in our Way thither. Let us, I ſay, reflect on all this, and then how ſhall each of us cry out, Brethren, what a neceſſary Thing it is to meet together in <hi>Religious Societies?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were fully ſenſible of this, and therefore we find them continually keeping up Communion with each other: For what ſays the Scripture? <hi>They continued ſtedfaſtly in the Doctrine and Fellowſhip,</hi> Acts ii. 42. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were no ſooner diſmiſſed by the Great Council, than they haſte away to their Companions. <hi>And being ſet at Liberty,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>they came to their own, and told them all theſe Things which the High Prieſt had ſaid unto them,</hi> Acts iv. 23. <hi>Paul,</hi> as ſoon as converted, <hi>tarried three Days with the Diſciples that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </hi> Damaſcus, Acts ix. 19. And <hi>Peter</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when releaſed from Priſon, immediately goes to the Houſe of <hi>Mary,</hi> where there were <hi>great Multitudes aſſembled, praying,</hi> Acts xii. 12. And it is reported of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in After-Ages, that they uſed to aſſemble together before Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, to ſing a Pſalm to CHRIST as GOD. So precious was the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> in thoſe Days.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked, what Advantage we ſhall reap from ſuch a Procedure now? I anſwer, much

every Way. <hi>Two are better than One, becauſe they have a good Reward for their Labour: For if they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow; but woe be to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up. Again, if Two lye together, then they have Heat; but how can One be warm alone? And if One prevail againſt him, Two ſhall withſtand him; and a Three-fold Cord is not quickly broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which directly leads me to my Second general Head, under which I was to aſſign ſome Reaſons why <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Religious Society.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As Man in his preſent Condition cannot always ſtand upright, but by Reaſon of the Frailty of his Nature cannot but fall; one eminent Reaſon why <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> or, in other Words, one great Advantage of <hi>Religious Society</hi> is, <hi>That when they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And an excellent Reaſon this, indeed! For alas! When we reflect how prone we are to be drawn into Error in our Judgments, and into Vice in our Practice; and how unable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> how very unwilling, to eſpy or correct our own Miſcarriages; when we conſider how apt the World is to flatter us in our Faults, and how few there are ſo kind as to tell us the Truth; what an ineſtimable Privilege muſt it be to have a Set of true, judicious, hearty Friends about us, continually watching over our Souls, to inform us where we have fallen, and warn us that we fall not again for the future. Surely it is ſuch a
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:004650_0106_100DDB7AB51318E0"/>
Privilege that (to uſe the Words of an <hi>eminent Chriſtian</hi>) we ſhall never know the Value of, till we come to Glory.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all; for ſuppoſing that we could always ſtand upright, yet whoſoever reflects on the Difficulties of Religion in general, and his own Propenſity to Lukewarmneſs and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in particular, will find that he muſt be <hi>zealous</hi> as well as <hi>ſteady,</hi> if ever he expects to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Here, then, the Wiſe Man points out to us another excellent Reaſon why <hi>Two are better than One. Again,</hi> ſays he, <hi>If Two lie together, then they have Heat; but how can One be warm alone?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which was the next Thing to be conſidered under the Second general Head, <hi>viz.</hi> to aſſign a ſecond Reaſon why <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> becauſe they can impart <hi>Heat</hi> to each other.</p>
                  <p>It is an Obſervation no leſs true than common, That kindled Coals, if placed aſunder, ſoon go out, but if heaped together, quicken and enliven each other, and afford a laſting Heat. The ſame will hold good in the Caſe now before us. If <hi>Chriſtians</hi> kindled by the Grace of GOD unite, they will quicken and enliven each other; but if they ſeparate and keep aſunder, no marvel if they ſoon grow cool or tepid. If <hi>Two or Three</hi> meet together in CHRIST'S Name, <hi>they will have Heat; but how can One be warm alone?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve; <hi>How can One be warm alone?</hi> The Wiſe Man's expreſſing himſelf by way of Queſtion, implies an Impoſſibility, at leaſt a very great Difficulty, to be warm in Religion without

Company, where it may be had. Behold here, then, another excellent Benefit flowing from <hi>Religious Society;</hi> it will keep us <hi>zealous,</hi> as well as <hi>ſteady,</hi> in the Ways of Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>But to illuſtrate this a little farther by a Compariſon or two. Let us look upon ourſelves (as was above hinted) as <hi>Soldiers</hi> lifted under CHRIST'S <hi>Banner;</hi> as going out with <hi>ten thouſand to meet One that cometh againſt us with twenty thouſand:</hi> as Perſons that are to <hi>wreſtle not only with Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Principalities, againſt Powers, and ſpiritual Wickedneſſes in high Places.</hi> And then tell me, all ye that fear GOD, if it be not an invaluable Privilege to have a Company of <hi>Fellow Soldiers</hi> continually about us, animating and exhorting each other to ſtand our ground, to keep our Ranks, and manfully to follow the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> though it be through a Sea of Blood?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let us conſider ourſelves in another View before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> as Perſons travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to a long <hi>Eternity;</hi> as reſcued by the <hi>free Grace of GOD,</hi> in ſome Meaſure, from our natural <hi>Egyptian Bondage,</hi> and marching under the Conduct of our <hi>ſpiritual Joſhua,</hi> through the <hi>Wilderneſs of this World,</hi> to the Land of our <hi>Heavenly Canaan.</hi> Let us farther reflect how apt we are to ſtartle at every Difficulty; to cry; <hi>There are Lions! There are Lions in the Way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There are the Sons of Anak</hi> to be grappled with, e'er we can poſſeſs the <hi>Promiſed Land:</hi> How prone we are, with <hi>Lot's Wife,</hi> to look wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully back on our <hi>ſpiritual Sodom,</hi> or with the

fooliſh <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to long again for the <hi>Fleſh-Pots</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to return to our former natural State of Bondage and Slavery. Conſider this, my Brethren, and ſee what a bleſſed Privilege it will be to have a Set of <hi>Iſraelites indeed</hi> about us, always reminding us of the Folly of any ſuch cowardly Deſign, and of the intolerable Miſery we ſhall run into, if we fall in the leaſt ſhort of the <hi>Promiſed Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More might be ſaid on this Particular, did not the Limits of a Diſcourſe of this Nature, oblige me to haſten,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To give a Third Reaſon, mentioned by the Wiſe Man in the Text, why <hi>Two are better than One;</hi> namely, becauſe they can ſecure each other from Enemies without. <hi>And if One prevail againſt him, yet Two ſhall withſtand him; and a Threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have conſidered the Advantages of <hi>Religious Societies,</hi> as a great Preſervative againſt falling (at leaſt dangerouſly falling) into Sin and Lukewarmneſs, and that too from our own Corruptions. But what ſays the Wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach? My Son, when thou goeſt to ſerve the Lord, prepare thy Soul for Temptation:</hi> And that not only from inward, but outward Foes; particularly from thoſe two grand Adverſaries, the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Devil:</hi> For no ſooner will thine Eye be bent Heavenward, but the former will be immediately diverting it another Way, telling thee thou needeſt not be <hi>ſingular</hi> in order to be <hi>religious;</hi> that one may be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going ſo much out of the <hi>Common Road.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:004650_0109_100DDB84427F7EF0"/>
Nor will the <hi>Devil</hi> be wanting in his <hi>artful</hi> Inſinuations, or <hi>impious</hi> Suggeſtions, to divert or terrify thee from preſſing forwards, <hi>that thou mayſt lay hold on the Crown of Life:</hi> And if he cannot prevail this Way, he will try another; and, in order to make his Temptation the more undiſcerned, but withal more ſucceſsful, he will employ, perhaps, ſome of thy neareſt Relatives, or moſt powerful Friends (as he ſet <hi>Peter</hi> on our <hi>bleſſed Maſter</hi>) who will always be bidding thee <hi>ſpare thyſelf;</hi> telling thee thou needeſt not take ſo much Pains; that it is not ſo difficult a Matter to get to Heaven as ſome People would make of it, nor the Way ſo narrow as others imagine it to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>But ſee here the Advantage of Religious Company; for ſuppoſing thou findeſt thyſelf thus ſurrounded on every Side, and unable to withſtand ſuch <hi>horrid</hi> (though ſeemingly <hi>friendly</hi>) Counſels, <hi>haſte</hi> away to thy Companions, and they will teach thee a truer and better Leſſon; they will tell thee, that thou muſt be <hi>ſingular</hi> if thou wilt be <hi>religious;</hi> and that it is as impoſſible for a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as for a City ſet upon a Hill, to be hid: That if thou wilt be an <hi>almoſt Chriſtian</hi> (and as good be none at all) thou mayſt live in the ſame idle indifferent Manner as thou ſeeſt moſt other People do: But if thou wilt be not only <hi>almoſt,</hi> but <hi>altogether a Chriſtian,</hi> they will inform thee thou muſt go a great deal farther: That thou muſt not only <hi>faintly ſeek,</hi> but <hi>earneſtly ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate:</hi> That there is but One Way now to Heaven as formerly, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="unknown:004650_0110_100DDB85C5E97168"/>
through the narrow Paſſage of a <hi>ſound Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> And that in order to bring about this mighty Work, thou muſt undergo a conſtant, but neceſſary Diſcipline of Faſting, Watching, and Prayer. And that therefore, the only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why theſe Friends give thee ſuch Advice, is, becauſe they are not willing to take ſo much Pains themſelves; or, as our Saviour told <hi>Peter</hi> on a like Occaſion, becauſe they <hi>ſavour not the Things that be of GOD, but the Things that be of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This then, is another excellent Bleſſing ariſing from <hi>Religious Society,</hi> that Friends can hereby ſecure each other from thoſe that oppoſe them. The <hi>Devil</hi> is fully ſenſible of this, and therefore he has always done his utmoſt to ſuppreſs, and put a Stop to the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> This was his grand Artifice at the firſt planting of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> to perſecute the Profeſſors of it, in order to ſeparate them. Which, though GOD, as he always will, over-ruled for the better; yet it ſhews what an Enmity he has againſt <hi>Chriſtians aſſembling themſelves together.</hi> Nor has he yet left off his old Stratagem; it being his uſual Way to entice us <hi>by ourſelves,</hi> in order to tempt us; where, by being deſtitute of one another's Helps, he hopes to lead us <hi>captive at his Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, on the contrary, knowing his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is ſtrengthened by <hi>Society,</hi> he would firſt perſuade us to neglect the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> and then bid us <hi>ſtand in the Way of Sinners,</hi> hoping thereby to put us into <hi>the Seat of the
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:004650_0111_100DDB88623EE050"/>
Scornful. Judas</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> are melancholly Inſtances of this. The former had no ſooner left his Company at Supper, but he went out and betrayed his Maſter: And the diſmal Downfal of the latter, when he would venture himſelf amongſt a Company of Enemies, plainly ſhews us what the Devil will endeavour to do, when he gets us by ourſelves. Had <hi>Peter</hi> kept his own Company, he might have kept his Integrity; but a <hi>ſingle Cord,</hi> alas, how quickly was it bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? Our bleſſed Saviour knew this full well, and therefore it is very obſervable, that he always ſent out his <hi>Diſciples Two by Two.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, after ſo many Advantages to be reaped from <hi>Religious Society,</hi> may we not very juſtly cry out with the Wiſe Man in my Text, <hi>Woe be to him that is alone; for when he falleth, he hath not another to lift him up:</hi> When he is <hi>cold,</hi> he hath not a Friend to <hi>warm</hi> him; when he is <hi>aſſaulted,</hi> he hath not a <hi>Second</hi> to help him to withſtand his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>III. I now come to my <hi>Third general Head,</hi> under which was to be ſhewn the ſeveral Duties incumbent on every Member of a <hi>Religious Society,</hi> as ſuch, which are three. 1. <hi>Mutual Reproof:</hi> 2. <hi>Mutual Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> 3. <hi>Mutual aſſiſting and defending each other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Mutual Reproof. Two are better than One: for when they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Reproof may be taken either in a more extenſive Senſe, and then it ſignifies our raiſing
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:004650_0112_100E8E6829C822F0"/>
a Brother by the gentleſt Means, when he falls into Sin and Error; or in a more reſtrained Signification, as reaching no farther than thoſe little Miſcarriages, which unavoidably happen in the moſt holy Men living.</p>
                  <p>The Wiſe Man in the Text, ſuppoſes all of us ſubject to both: <hi>For when they fall</hi> (ſays he, thereby implying that each of us may fall) <hi>the One will lift up his Fellow.</hi> From whence we may infer, that <hi>when any Brother is overtaken with a Fault, he that is ſpiritual</hi> (that is, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and knows the Corruption and Weakneſs of Human Nature) <hi>ought to reſtore ſuch a one in the Spirit of Meckneſs.</hi> And why he ſhould do ſo, the Apoſtle ſubjoins a Reaſon <hi>conſidering thyſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted; i. e.</hi> conſidering thy own Frailty, leſt thou alſo fall by the like Temptation.</p>
                  <p>We are all frail unſtable Creatures; and it is merely owing to the <hi>Free Grace and good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD,</hi> that we <hi>run not into the ſame Exceſs of Riot</hi> with other Men. Every offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brother, therefore, claims our <hi>Pity</hi> rather than our <hi>Reſentment;</hi> and each Member ſhould ſtrive who ſhould be moſt forward, as well as moſt gentle, in reſtoring him to his former State.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing a Perſon not to be <hi>overtaken,</hi> but to fall <hi>wilfully</hi> into a Crime; yet who art thou that denieſt Forgiveneſs to thy offending Brother? <hi>Let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt be fall.</hi> Take ye, Brethren, the holy Apoſtles as eminent Examples for you to learn by, how you
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004650_0113_100DDB89E5EF8C40"/>
ought to behave in this Matter. Conſider how quickly they joined the Right Hand of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>Peter,</hi> who had ſo wilfully denied his Maſter: For we find <hi>John</hi> and him together but two Days after, <hi>John</hi> xx. 2. And <hi>ver.</hi> 19, we find him aſſembled with the reſt. So ſoon did they forgive, ſo ſoon aſſociate with their ſinful, yet relenting Brother—<hi>Let us go and do likewiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is another kind of Reproof incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on every Member of a <hi>Religious Society;</hi> namely, <hi>a gentle Rebuke for ſome Miſcarriage or other, which, though not actually ſinful, yet may become the Occaſion of Sin.</hi> This indeed ſeems a more eaſy, but perhaps will be found a more difficult Point than the former: For when a Perſon has really ſinned, he cannot but own his Brethrens Reproof to be juſt; whereas, when it was only for ſome little Miſconduct, the Pride that is in our Natures, will ſcarce ſuffer us to brook it. But however ungrateful this Pill may be to our Brother, yet if we have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for his Welfare, it muſt be adminiſtred by ſome friendly Hand or other. By all Means then let it be applied; only, like a ſkilful Phyſician, <hi>gild</hi> over the ungrateful Medicine, and endeavour if poſſible, to <hi>deceive</hi> thy Brother into Health and Soundneſs. <hi>Let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Malice, and Evil-ſpeaking, be put away</hi> from it. Let the Patient know his Recovery is the only Thing aimed at, that thou delighteſt not <hi>cauſeleſly to grieve thy Brother;</hi> and then thou canſt not want Succeſs.</p>

2. <hi>Mutual Exhortation</hi> is the ſecond Duty reſulting from the Words of the Text.—<hi>Again, if Two lye together, then they have Heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve here again, the Wiſe Man ſuppoſes it as impoſſible for Religious Perſons to meet together, and not to be the Warmer for each other's Company, as for two Perſons to lie in the ſame Bed, and yet freeze with Cold. But now, how is it poſſible to communicate Heat to each other, without mutually <hi>ſtirring up the Gift of GOD</hi> which is in us, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Exhortation? Let every Member then of a <hi>Religious Society</hi> write that zealous Apoſtle's Advice on the Tables of his Heart; <hi>See that ye exhort, and provoke one another to Love, and to good Works; and ſo much the more as you ſee the Day of the LORD approaching.</hi> Believe me, Brethren, we have Need of Exhortation to rouze up our ſleepy Souls, to ſet us upon our Watch againſt the Temptations of the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil;</hi> to excite us to renounce ourſelves, to take up our Croſſes, and follow our Bleſſed Maſter, and the glorious Company of Saints and Martyrs, <hi>who through Faith have fought the good Fight, and are gone before us to inherit the Promiſes.</hi> A third Part, therefore, of the Time wherein a <hi>Religious Society</hi> meets, ſeems neceſſary to be ſpent in this important Duty: For what avails it to have our Underſtandings enlightened by pious Reading unleſs our Wills are at the ſame Time inclined, and inflamed by mutual Exhortation, to put it
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:004650_0115_100DDB8FA7AC3448"/>
in Practice? Add to this; that this is the beſt Way both to receive and impart Light, and the only Means to preſerve and increaſe that Warmth and Heat which each Perſon firſt brought with him; GOD ſo ordering this, as all other ſpiritual Gifts, that <hi>to him that hath, i. e.</hi> improves and communicates what he hath, <hi>ſhall be given; but from him that hath not, i. e.</hi> does not improve the Heat he hath, <hi>ſhall be taken away even that which he ſeemed to have.</hi> So needful, ſo eſſentially neceſſary, is Exhortation to the Good of <hi>Society.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly and laſtly, The Text points out another Duty incumbent on every Member of a <hi>Religious Society, viz.</hi> To <hi>defend each other</hi> from thoſe that do oppoſe them. <hi>And if One prevail againſt him, yet Two ſhall withſtand him; and a Threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Wiſe Man takes it for granted, that <hi>Offences will come,</hi> nay, and that they <hi>may prevail</hi> too. And this is no more than our <hi>Bleſſed Maſter</hi> has long ſince told us. Not indeed, that there is any Thing in <hi>Chriſtianity itſelf</hi> that has the leaſt Tendency to give riſe to, or promote ſuch Offences: No, on the contrary, it breathes nothing but Unity and Love.</p>
                  <p>But ſo it is, that ever ſince the fatal Sentence pronounced by GOD, after our firſt Parents Fall, <hi>viz. I will put Enmity between thy Seed and her Seed; He that is born after the Fleſh,</hi> that is, the unregenerate unconverted Sinner, has in all Ages <hi>perſecuted him that is born after
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:004650_0116_100DDB912CD00008"/>
the Spirit:</hi> And ſo it always will be. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we find an early Proof given of this in the Inſtance of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel;</hi> and of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac;</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> afterwards. And indeed, the whole <hi>Bible</hi> contains little elſe but an Hiſtory of the great and continued Oppoſition between the Children of this World and the Children of GOD. The firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were remarkable Examples of this; and though thoſe troubleſome Times, bleſſed be GOD, are now over, yet the Apoſtle has laid it down as a general Rule, and all that are ſincere can expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally prove the Truth of it. That <hi>they that will live godly in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, <hi>muſt</hi> (to the End of the World, in ſome Degree or other) <hi>ſuffer Perſecution.</hi> That therefore this may not make us deſert our Bleſſed Maſter's Cauſe, every Member ſhould unite their Forces, in order to ſtand againſt it. And for the better effecting this, each would do well, from Time to Time, to communicate his Experiences, Grievances, and Temptations, and beg his Companions (firſt asking GOD's Aſſiſtance, without which all is nothing) to adminiſter Reproof, Exhortation or Comfort, as his Caſe requires: So that <hi>if One cannot prevail againſt it, yet Two ſhall withſtand it; and a Threefold</hi> (much leſs a many-fold) <hi>Cord will not be quickly broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. But it is Time for me to proceed to the <hi>Fourth general Thing</hi> propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To draw an Inference or two from what has been ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="113" facs="unknown:004650_0117_100DDB93DB531630"/>
1. And firſt then, if <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> and the Advantages of <hi>Religious Society</hi> are ſo many and ſo great, then it is the Duty of every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to ſet on Foot, eſtabliſh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, as much as in him lies, <hi>Societies</hi> of this Nature. And I believe we may venture to affirm, that if ever a Spirit of true Chriſtianity is revived in the World, it muſt be brought about by ſome ſuch Means as this. Motives, ſurely, cannot be wanting, to ſtir us up to this commendable and neceſſary Undertaking: For granting all hitherto advanced to be of no Force, yet methinks the ſingle Conſideration that great Part of our Happineſs in Heaven will conſiſt in the <hi>Communion of Saints;</hi> or that the Intereſt as well as Piety of thoſe Sectariſts that differ from us, is ſtrengthened and ſupported by nothing more than their frequent Meetings; either of theſe Conſiderations, I ſay, one would think, ſhould induce us to do our utmoſt to copy after their good Example, and ſettle a laſting and pious <hi>Communion of the Saints</hi> on Earth. Add to this that we find the Kingdom of Darkneſs eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed daily by ſuch like Means; and ſhall not the Kingdom of CHRIST be ſet in Oppoſition againſt it? Shall the Children of <hi>Belial</hi> aſſemble and ſtrengthen each other in Wickedneſs; and ſhall not the Children of GOD unite, and ſtrengthen themſelves in Piety? Shall Societies on Societies be countenanced for Midnight Revellings, and the promoting of <hi>Vice,</hi> and ſcarcely one be found intended for the Propagation of <hi>Virtue?</hi>—Be aſtoniſhed, O Heavens at this!</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="114" facs="unknown:004650_0118_100DDB96F7D5F5E8"/>
2. But this leads me to a ſecond Inference; namely, to warn Perſons of the great Danger thoſe are in, who either by their Subſcriptions, Preſence or Approbation, promote <hi>Societies</hi> of a quite oppoſite Nature to Religion.</p>
                  <p>And here I would not be underſtood to mean only thoſe Publick Meetings which are deſigned manifeſtly for nothing elſe but Revellings and Banquetings, for Chambering and Wantonneſs, and at which a modeſt <hi>Heathen</hi> would bluſh to be preſent; but alſo thoſe ſeemingly <hi>innocent</hi> Entertainments and Meetings which the <hi>politer</hi> Part of the World are ſo very fond of, and ſpend ſo much Time in: But which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, keep as many Perſons out of a Senſe of <hi>True Religion,</hi> as Intemperance, Debauchery or any other Crime whatever. Indeed, whilſt we are in this World, we muſt have proper Relaxations, to fit us both for the Buſineſs of our Profeſſion, and Religion. But then, for Perſons who call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that have ſolemnly vowed at their Baptiſm, <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Vanities of this ſinful World;</hi> that are commanded in Scripture to <hi>abſtain from all Appearance of Evil, and to have their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in Heaven.</hi> For ſuch Perſons as theſe to ſupport Meetings, that (to ſay no worſe of them) are vain and trifling, and have a natural Tendency to draw off our Minds from GOD, is abſurd, ridiculous, and ſinful. Surely <hi>Two are</hi> not <hi>better than One</hi> in this Caſe: No; it is to be wiſhed there was not <hi>One</hi> to be found concerned in it. The ſooner we forſake the <hi>aſſembling
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:004650_0119_100DDB998D0F2F78"/>
ourſelves together</hi> in ſuch a Manner, the better; and no matter how quickly the Cord that holds ſuch <hi>Societies</hi> (was it a Thouſand-fold) is broken.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>you, Brethren, have not ſo learned</hi> CHRIST: But, on the contrary, like true Diſciples of your LORD and Maſter, have by the Bleſſing of GOD (as this Evening's Solemnity abundantly teſtifies) happily formed yourſelves into ſuch <hi>Societies,</hi> which, if duly attended on and improved, cannot but ſtrengthen you in your Chriſtian Warfare, and <hi>make you fruitful in every good Word and Work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What remains for me to do, but, as was propoſed, in the laſt Place, to cloſe up what has been ſaid, in a Word or two, by Way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation from the whole, and to beſeech you, in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST to go on in the Way you have begun; and by a conſtant conſcientious Attendance on your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective <hi>Societies,</hi> to diſcountenance Vice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Virtue, and <hi>build each other up in the Knowledge and Fear of GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Only permit me to <hi>ſtir up your pure Minds, by Way of Remembrance,</hi> and to exhort you, <hi>if there be any Conſolation in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>any Fellowſhip of the Spirit,</hi> again and again to conſider, that as all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in general, ſo all Members of <hi>Religious Societies</hi> in particular, are in an eſpecial Manner, as Houſes built upon an Hill; and that therefore it highly concerns you to <hi>walk circumſpectly</hi> towards thoſe that are without, and to <hi>take heed to yourſelves, that

                  <p>Labour, therefore, my beloved Brethren, to let your Practice correſpond to your Profeſſion: And think not that it will be ſufficient for you to plead at the laſt Day, LORD have we not aſſembled ourſelves together <hi>in thy Name,</hi> and enlivened each other, by <hi>ſinging Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs?</hi> For verily, I ſay unto you, notwithſtanding this, our bleſſed LORD will bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But GOD forbid that any ſuch Evil ſhould befal you; that there ſhould be ever a <hi>Judas,</hi> ever a Traitor amongſt ſuch diſtinguiſhed Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of our <hi>Common Maſter.</hi> No, on the contrary, the Excellency of your Rules, the Regularity of your Meetings, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially your pious Zeal in aſſembling in ſuch a publick and ſolemn Manner ſo frequently in the Year, perſuade me to think, that you are willing, not barely to <hi>ſeem,</hi> but to <hi>be</hi> in <hi>Reality, Chriſtians:</hi> and hope to be found at the <hi>Laſt Day,</hi> what you would be eſteemed

                  <p>Thus earneſt, thus importunate, are all ſincere <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in praying for themſelves: But then, not having ſo lively, laſting, and deep a Senſe of the Wants of their Chriſtian Brethren, they are for the moſt Part too remiſs and defective in their Prayers for <hi>them</hi>—Whereas, was the <hi>Love of GOD</hi> ſhed abroad in our Hearts, and did we Love our Neighbour in that Manner in which the Son of GOD our Saviour <hi>loveth us,</hi> and according to his Command and Example, we could not but be as importunate for their Spiritual and Temporal Welfare, as for our own; and as earneſtly deſire and endeavour that others ſhould ſhare in the Benefits of the Death and Paſſion of JESUS CHRIST as we ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>Let not any one think, that this is an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Degree of Charity; an high Pitch of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which every one cannot attain unto;

ſince it is no ſuch Thing:—For if we are all commanded to <hi>Love our Neighbour</hi> (that is every Man) even <hi>as ourſelves,</hi> nay to <hi>Lay down our Lives for the Brethren;</hi> then, it is the Duty of <hi>all</hi> to pray for their Neighbours as much as for themſelves, and by all poſſible Acts and Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Love and Affection towards them, at all Times, to ſhew their Readineſs even to lay down their Lives for them, if ever it ſhould pleaſe GOD to call them to it.</p>
                  <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour as He hath ſet us an Example, that we ſhould follow his Steps in every Thing elſe, ſo hath he more eſpecially in This:—For in that moſt Divine, that moſt Perfect and inimitable Prayer (recorded in the 17th of St. <hi>John</hi>) which he put up juſt before his Paſſion, we find but <hi>few</hi> Petitions for his own, though <hi>many</hi> for his Diſciples Welfare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in that moſt perfect Form which he has been pleaſed to preſcribe us, we are taught to ſay,—not <hi>My,</hi> but <hi>Our Father,</hi>—Thereby to put us in mind, that, whenever we approach the Throne of Grace, we ought to pray,—not in our own Name alone, but in the Name of all our Brethren in CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Interceſſion</hi> then is certainly a Duty incumbent upon all <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>

But you need not that any Man ſhould teach you this, ſince ye yourſelves are taught of GOD, even of</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>himſelf, to Pray, that his Kingdom may come;</hi> Part of the Meaning of which Petition is, That <hi>GOD's Ways may be known upon Earth, and his Saving Health among All Nations.</hi>

Dangers and Difficulties, to which Governors by their Station are expoſed, and the continual Temptations they lie under to Luxury and Self-Indulgence; we ſhall not only pity, but pray for them,—That He who preſerved <hi>Eſther, David,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah, unspotted from the World,</hi> amidſt the Grandeur of a Court, and gave Succeſs to their Deſigns, would alſo preſerve them Holy and Unblameable, and proſper all the Works of their Hands upon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> you ought, in a more eſpecial Manner, to pray for thoſe, whom <hi>the Holy Ghoſt hath made Overſeers over You.</hi> This is what: St. <hi>Paul</hi> begs, again and again, of the Churches to whom he writes:—<hi>Brethren,</hi> ſays he in the Text, <hi>Pray for Us;</hi> and again, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,—Praying always,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with all Manner of Supplication; and for me alſo, that I may open my Mouth boldly, to declare the Myſtery of the Goſpel.</hi> And in another Place, to expreſs his Earneſtneſs in this Requeſt, and the great Importance of their Prayers to Him,—He bids the Church <hi>Strive,</hi> (or, as the original Word ſignifies, <hi>Be in an Agony) together with Him in their Prayers.</hi> And surely, if the great St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that choſen Veſſel, that Favourite of Heaven, needed the moſt importunate Prayers of his Chriſtian Converts; much more do the ordinary Miniſters of the Goſpel ſtand in Need of the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of their reſpective Flocks.</p>
                  <p>And I cannot but in a more eſpecial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, inſiſt upon this Branch of your Duty,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:004650_0128_100DDBB1C1BDE470"/>
becauſe it is a Matter of ſuch Importance: For no doubt, much Good is frequently with-held from many, by Reaſon of their neglecting to pray for their Miniſters, which they would have received, had they prayed for them as they ought. Not to mention, that People often complain of the Want of diligent and faithful Paſtors.—But how do they deſerve Good Paſtors, who will not earneſtly pray to GOD for <hi>ſuch?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church has ſet a-part Four Seaſons in the Year for this Purpoſe, and to call down a Bleſſing on thoſe who are to be ordained to any Holy Function: But by how very few are the <hi>Ember Days</hi> obſerved! And if we will not <hi>pray to the Lord of the Harveſt,</hi> can it be expected, <hi>he will ſend forth Labourers into his Harveſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, What Ingratitude is it, not to pray for your Miniſters! For ſhall they Watch and Labour in the Word of Doctrine for you, and for your Salvation, and ſhall not you pray for them in Return? If <hi>any</hi> beſtow Favours on your Bodies, you think it right, meet, and your bounden Duty, to <hi>pray for Them;</hi> and ſhall not they be remembred in your Prayers, who daily feed and nouriſh your Souls? Add to all this, that praying for your Miniſters, will be a manifeſt Proof of your believing,—That though <hi>Paul</hi> plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> water, yet it is GOD alone who giveth the Increaſe. And you will alſo find it the beſt Means you can uſe, to promote your own Welfare: Becauſe GOD, in Anſwer to your Prayers, may impart a double

Portion of his Holy Spirit to them, whereby they will be qualified to deal out to you larger Meaſures of Knowledge in Spiritual Things, and be enabled more ſkilfully <hi>to divide the Word of Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Would Men but conſtantly obſerve this Direction, and when their Miniſters are <hi>praying</hi> in their Name to GOD,—humbly beſeech him to perform all their Petitions: Or, when they are ſpeaking in GOD's Name to them,—pray that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt may fall on all them that hear the Word;</hi> we ſhould <hi>then</hi> find a more viſible good Effect of their Doctrine, and a greater Mutual Love between Miniſters and their People. For Miniſters Hands would <hi>then</hi> be held up by the People's Interceſſions, and the People will never dare to vilify or traduce thoſe who are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subject of their Prayers.</p>

Next to our Miniſters, our <hi>Friends</hi> claim a Place in our <hi>Interceſſions;</hi> but then we ſhould not content ourſelves with Praying in general Terms for them, but ſuit our Prayers to their particular Circumſtances. When <hi>Meriam</hi> was afflicted with a Leproſy from GOD, <hi>Moſes</hi> cried and ſaid, <hi>LORD heal her:</hi> And when the Nobleman came to apply to JESUS CHRIST, in behalf of his Child, he ſaid, <hi>LORD, my little Daughter lieth at the Point of Death, I pray th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

We ſhould pray, That if it be GOD's good Pleaſure, it may not be unto Death; but if otherwiſe, That he would give him Grace ſo to take his Viſitation, that, after this painful Life ended, he may dwell with him in Life everlaſting. Is a Friend in Doubt in a Matter? We ſhould lay his Caſe before GOD, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did that of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> and pray, That GOD's Holy Spirit may lead him into all Truth. Is he in Want? We ſhould pray, That his Faith may never fail, and that in GOD's due Time he may be relieved. And in all other Caſes, we ſhould not pray for our Friends <hi>only in Generals,</hi> but ſuit our Petitions to their <hi>particular Sufferings and Afflictions;</hi> for otherwiſe, we may never ask perhaps for the Things our Friends <hi>moſt want</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that ſuch a Procedure will oblige us ſometimes to break from the Forms we uſe; but if we accuſtom ourſelves to it, and have a deep Senſe of what we ask for, the moſt illiterate <hi>Chriſtians</hi> will not want Words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves.</p>
                  <p>We have many noble Inſtances in Holy Scripture of the Succeſs of this Kind of <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interceſſion;</hi> but none more remarkable than that of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servant, in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi>—who being ſent to ſeek a Wife for his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> prays in a moſt particular Manner in his Behalf.—And the Sequel of the Story informs us how remarkably his Prayer was anſwered. And did <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now pray for their Friends in the ſame particular Manner, and with the ſame

                  <p n="5">5. But farther, as we ought thus to intercede for our Friends, ſo in like Manner muſt we alſo Pray for our <hi>Enemies. Bleſs them that Curſe you,</hi> ſays JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you.</hi> Which Commands he enforced in the ſtrongeſt Manner by his own Example, when in the very Agonies and Pangs of Death, he prayed even for his <hi>Murderers,—Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!</hi>—This, it muſt needs be confeſſed, is a difficult Duty, yet not impracticable to thoſe, who have renounced the Things of this preſent Life, (from an inordinate Love of which alone all Enmities ariſe) and who knowing the terrible <hi>Woes</hi> denounced againſt thoſe <hi>who offend</hi> CHRIST's <hi>Little Ones,</hi> can, out of real Pity, and a Senſe of their Danger, pray for <hi>thoſe by whom ſuch Offences come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, and to conclude this Head,—We ſhould <hi>Intercede</hi> for all that are any Ways af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in Mind, Body, or Eſtate;—for all who deſire, and ſtand in need of our Prayers,—and for all who do not pray for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And Oh! that all who hear me, would ſet apart ſome Time every Day for the due Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this moſt neceſſary Duty!—In Order to which,</p>

III. To ſhew the Advantages, and offer ſome Conſiderations to excite you to the Practice of <hi>Daily Interceſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> it will fill your Hearts with <hi>Love one to another.</hi>—He that every Day inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes at the Throne of Grace for all Mankind, cannot but in a ſhort Time be filled with Love and Charity to <hi>all:</hi> and the frequent Exerciſe of his Love in this Manner, will inſenſibly enlarge his Heart, and make him Partaker of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Abundance of it which is in CHRIST JESUS our LORD! Envy, Malice, Revenge, and ſuch like helliſh Tempers, can never long har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in a gracious Interceſſor's Breaſt;—But He will be filled with Joy, Peace, Meekneſs, Long Suffering, and all other Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit. By frequently laying his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Wants before GOD, He will be touched with a Fellow-Feeling of them;—He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with thoſe that do rejoice, and weep with thoſe that weep.—Every Bleſſing beſtowed on Others, inſtead of exciting Envy in him, will be looked on as an Anſwer to his particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, and fill his Soul with <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed I will not affirm, that this bleſſed Temper of Mind can be acquired all at once: No,—as other Graces, ſo muſt this Chriſtian Love be obtained by Degrees. But do you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in Acts of general and particular Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and when you hear of your Neighbour's Faults, inſtead of relating them to, and expoſing them before others,—Lay them in ſecret before
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:004650_0133_100DDBBFB9F20BA0"/>
GOD. and beg of him to correct and amend them. When you hear of a notorious Sinner, inſtead of thinking, <hi>You do well to be angry;</hi> beg of JESUS CHRIST to convert and make him a Monument of his Free Grace; and you cannot imagine what a bleſſed Alteration this Practice will make in your Heart, and how much you will increaſe Day by Day in the Spirit of Love and Meekneſs towards all Mankind!</p>
                  <p>But, further to excite you to the conſtant Practice of this Duty of Interceſſion; conſider the many Inſtances given us in Holy Scripture, of the Power and Efficacy of it. Great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Things are there recorded as the Effects of this divine Employ. It has ſtopped Plagues, it has opened and ſhut Heaven; and has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently turned away GOD's Fury from his People. How was <hi>Abimelech's</hi> Houſe freed from the Diſeaſe GOD ſent amongſt them, at the Interceſſion of <hi>Abraham!</hi> When <hi>Phineas ſtood up and prayed,</hi> how ſoon did <hi>the Plague ceaſe!</hi> When <hi>Daniel</hi> humbled and afflicted his Soul, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded for the LORD's Inheritance, how quickly was an Angel diſpatched to tell him, <hi>his Prayer was heard!</hi> And to mention but one Inſtance more, how does GOD own himſelf as it were quite overcome with the Importunity of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was interceding for his idolatrous People,—<hi>Let me alone,</hi> ſays GOD!</p>
                  <p>This ſufficiently ſhews, I could almoſt ſay the Omnipotency of Interceſſion, and how we may, like <hi>Jacob,</hi> wreſtle with GOD, and by an holy

Violence prevail both for ourſelves and others. And no doubt 'tis owing to the ſecret and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Interceſſions of the <hi>few</hi> righteous Souls who ſtill remain among us, that GOD has yet ſpared this miſerably ſinful Nation: For were there not ſome ſuch Faithful ones, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> left to ſtand in the Gap,—We ſhould ſoon be deſtroyed, even as was <hi>Sodom,</hi> and reduced to Aſhes like unto <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, to ſtir you up yet farther, to this God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Exerciſe of <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> conſider that, in all Probability, it is the frequent Employment even of the glorified Saints: For though they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Burden of the Fleſh, and reſtored to the glorious Liberty of the Sons of GOD, yet as their Happineſs cannot be perfectly conſummated 'till the Reſurrection of the laſt Day, when all their Brethren will be glorified with them,—We cannot but think they are often importunate in beſeeching our heavenly Father, ſhortly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the Number of his Elect, and to haſten his Kingdom. And ſhall not we, who are on Earth, be often exerciſed in this divine Employ with the glorious Company of <hi>the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect?</hi> Since our Happineſs is ſo much to conſiſt in the Communion of Saints in the Church Triumphant <hi>above,</hi> ſhall we not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently intercede for the Church Militant <hi>here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;</hi> and earneſtly beg, that we may all be one, even as the Holy JESUS and his Father are One; that we may alſo be made perfect in one!</p>
                  <p>To provoke you to this great Work and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Love,—Remember that it is the never
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:004650_0135_100DDBC4CCCDCD30"/>
ceaſing Employment of the holy and highly-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted JESUS himſelf, who ſits at the Right Hand of GOD to hear all our Prayers and to make continual Interceſſion for us! So that he who is conſtantly employed in interceding for others, is doing <hi>that</hi> on Earth, which the Eternal Son of GOD is always doing in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Imagine therefore, when you are lifting up holy Hands in Prayer for one another,—That you ſee the Heavens opened, and the Son of GOD in all his Glory, as the Great High Prieſt of your Salvation, offering up and pleading for you, the all-ſufficient Merit of his Sacrifice before the Throne of his heavenly Father!—Join then Your Interceſſions with his, and beſeech him, that <hi>they</hi> may through him come up as Incenſe, and be received as a Sweet-ſmelling Savour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the Sight of GOD! This Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſtrengthen your Faith, excite a holy Earneſtneſs in your Prayers, and make you wreſtle with GOD, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, when <hi>He ſaw him Face to Face and his Life was preſerved;</hi> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he pleaded for <hi>Sodom;</hi> and as JESUS CHRIST himſelf, when he prayed, being in an Agony, ſo much the more earneſtly the Night before his bitter Paſſion!</p>
                  <p>And now, Brethren, What ſhall I ſay more, ſince <hi>you are taught of</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>himſelf,</hi> to <hi>abound in Love,</hi> and in this <hi>good Work</hi> of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one for another?—However, I cannot but recommend to you one general Means in order <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Do but <hi>walk as becomes the Goſpel of</hi> JESUS CHRIST; Be but in Earneſt about <hi>Working out your own eternal Salvation;</hi> and your Interceſſions will then <hi>come forth as Incenſe before GOD, and the lifting up of your Hands be as an Evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi>—Though ever ſo mean, though as poor as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> You will <hi>then</hi> become Benefactors to all Mankind; Thouſands, and Twenty-times Ten Thouſands, will then be <hi>bleſſed for your Sakes!</hi> and after You have employed a few Years in this Divine Exerciſe <hi>here,</hi> You will be tranſlated to that happy Place, where you have ſo often wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others might be advanced; and be exalted to ſit at the Right Hand of our All-powerful, All-prevailing <hi>Interceſſor,</hi> in the Kingdom of His Heavenly Father <hi>hereafter!</hi>

                  <p>And now, Brethren, what ſhall I ſay more?—I could wiſh to continue my Diſcourſe much longer; for I can never fully expreſs the Deſire of my Soul towards you!—Finally, therefore, Brethren, <hi>Whatſover Things are Holy, whatſoever Things are Pure, whatſoever Things are Honeſt, whatſoever Things are of Good Report: if there be any Conſolation in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>if any Fellowſhip of the Spirit,</hi> if any Hopes of our appearing to the Comfort of each other at the awful Tribunal of JESUS CHRIST,—<hi>Think of the Things that you have heard,</hi> and of theſe which Your Paſtors have declared and will yet declare unto You; and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue under their Miniſtry to <hi>work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling:</hi>—So that whether I ſhould never ſee you any more, or whether it ſhall pleaſe GOD to bring me back again at any Time, I may always have the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of knowing that your Converſation is <hi>ſuch as becometh the Goſpel of</hi> CHRIST.</p>

                  <p>THESE Words contain the holy Reſolution of pious <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who having in a moſt moving, affectionate Diſcourſe recounted to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> what great Things GOD had done for them, in the Verſe immediately going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Text, comes to draw a proper Inference from what he had been delivering; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints them, in the moſt preſſing Terms, that ſince GOD had been ſo exceeding gracious unto them, they could do no leſs than out of Gratitude for ſuch uncommon Favours and Mercies, dedicate both themſelves and Families to his Service. <hi>Now therefore,</hi> ſays he, Verſe 14. <hi>fear the LORD, and ſerve him in Sincerity and Truth, and put away the Gods which your Fathers ſerved on the other Side of the Flood.</hi> And by the ſame engaging Motive does the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> afterwards enforce their Obedience

                  </p>
                  <p>A Reſolution this worthy of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and no leſs becoming, no leſs neceſſary for every true Son of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that is intruſted with the Care and Government of a Family in our Day: And, if it was ever ſeaſonable for Miniſters to preach up, or People to put in Practice <hi>Family Religion,</hi> it was never more ſo than in the preſent Age; ſince it is greatly to be feared, that out of thoſe many Houſholds that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> there are but few that ſerve GOD in their reſpective Families as they ought.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, viſit our Churches, and you may perhaps ſee ſomething of the <hi>Form of Godlineſs</hi> ſtill ſubſiſting amongſt us; but even

That is ſcarcely to be met with in private Houſes. So that were the bleſſed Angels to come, as in the patriarchal Age, and obſerve our ſpiritual Oeconomy at home, would they not be tempted to ſay as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abimelech, Surely, the Fear of GOD is not in this Place?</hi> Gen. xx. 11.</p>
                  <p>How ſuch a general Neglect of <hi>Family-Religion</hi> firſt began to overſpread the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, is difficult to determine. As for the primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I am poſitive it was not ſo with them: No, they had not ſo learned CHRIST, as falſely to imagine Religion was to be confined ſolely to their Aſſemblies for publick Worſhip; but on the contrary, behaved with ſuch Piety and exemplary Holineſs in their private Families, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> often ſtiles their Houſe a Church: <hi>Salute ſuch a One,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and the Church which is in his Houſe.</hi> And, I believe, we muſt forever deſpair of ſeeing a primitive Spirit of Piety revived in the World, till we are ſo happy as to ſee a Revival of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Family-Religion;</hi> and Perſons unanimouſly reſolving with good old <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in the Words of the Text, <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the LORD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which Words I ſhall beg Leave to inſiſt on theſe Three Things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is the Duty of every Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of a Family to take Care, that not only he himſelf, but alſo that thoſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Charge, <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="139" facs="unknown:004650_0143_100DDBDBCE72DA40"/>
II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew after what Manner a Governor and his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ought to <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> I ſhall offer ſome Motives in order to excite all Governors, with their reſpective Houſholds, to <hi>ſerve the LORD</hi> in the Manner that ſhall be recommended.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to ſhew that it is the Duty of every Governor of a Family to take Care, that not only he himſelf, but alſo that thoſe committed to his Charge, ſhould <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this will appear, if we conſider that every Governor of a Family ought to look upon himſelf as obliged to act in three Capacities: As a Prophet, to inſtruct; as a Prieſt, to pray for and with; as a King, to govern, direct, and provide for them. It is true indeed the latter of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> their kingly Office, they are not ſo frequently deficient in (nay in this they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally too ſollicitous) but as for the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>viz.</hi> their prieſtly and prophetick Office, like <hi>Gallio,</hi> they care for no ſuch Things. But however indifferent ſome Governors may be about it, yet they may be aſſured, that GOD will require a due Diſcharge of theſe Offices at their Hands. For if, as the Apoſtle argues, <hi>He that does not provide for his own Houſe,</hi> in temporal Things, <hi>has denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel;</hi> to what greater Degree of Apoſtacy muſt he have arrived, who takes no Thought to provide for the ſpiritual Welfare of his Family.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="unknown:004650_0144_100DDBDDB90CACE0"/>
But farther, Perſons are generally very liberal of their Invectives againſt the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and think they juſtly blame the Conduct of that Miniſter who does not take heed to and watch over the Flock, of which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> has made him Overſeer: But may not every Governor of a Family be in a lower Degree, liable to the ſame Cenſure, who takes no Thought for thoſe Souls that are committed to his Charge? For every Houſe is as it were a little Pariſh, every Governor (as was before obſerved) a Prieſt, every Family a Flock: And if any of them periſh through the Governour's Neglect, their Blood will GOD require at their Hands.</p>
                  <p>Was a Miniſter to diſregard teaching his People publickly, and from Houſe to Houſe, and to excuſe himſelf by ſaying, that he had enough to do to work out his own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, without concerning himſelf with that of others; would not any one be apt to think ſuch a Miniſter ro be like the unjuſt Judge, <hi>One that neither feared GOD, nor regarded Man?</hi> And yet, odious as ſuch a Character would be, it is no worſe than that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of a Family deſerves, who thinks himſelf obliged only to ſave his own Soul, without paying any Regard to the Souls of his Houſhold. For (as was above hinted) every Houſe is as it were, a Pariſh, and every Maſter is concerned to ſecure, as much as in him lies, the Spiritual Proſperity of every one under his Roof, as any Miniſter whatever is obliged to look to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Welfare of every individual Perſon under his Charge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="unknown:004650_0145_100DDBE2A3A45038"/>
What Precedents Men, who neglect their Duty in this Particular, can plead for ſuch Omiſſion, I cannot tell: Doubtleſs not the Example of holy <hi>Job,</hi> who was ſo far from imagining that he had no Concern, as Governor of a Family, with any one's Soul but his own, that the Scripture acquaints us, <hi>When the Days of his Children's Feaſting were gone about, that</hi> Job <hi>ſent and ſanctified them, and offered Burnt-Offerings according to the Number of them all; for</hi> Job <hi>ſaid, it may be that my Sons have ſinned and curſed GOD in their Hearts: Thus did</hi> Job <hi>continually.</hi> Nor can they plead the Practice of good old <hi>Joſhua,</hi> whom, in the Text, we find as much concerned for his Houſhold's Welfare as his own. Nor laſtly, that of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who <hi>feared GOD,</hi> not only himſelf, but with <hi>all his Houſe:</hi> And were <hi>Chriſtians</hi> but of the ſame Spirit of <hi>Job, Joſhua,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> Centurion, they would act as <hi>Job, Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>But, alas! if this be the Caſe, and all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of Families ought not only to ſerve the LORD themſelves, but likewiſe to ſee that their reſpective Houſholds do ſo too; what will then become of thoſe who not only neglect ſerving GOD themſelves, but alſo make it their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ridicule and ſcoff at any of their Houſe that do? Who are not content with <hi>not entring into the Kingdom of Heaven themſelves; but thoſe alſo that are willing to enter in, they hinder.</hi> Surely ſuch Men are Factors for the Devil indeed. Surely their Damnation ſlumbereth
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:004650_0146_100DDBE4281E4F38"/>
not: For altho' GOD, in his good Providence, may ſuffer ſuch Stumbling-blocks to be put in his Children's Ways, and ſuffer their greateſt Enemies to be thoſe of their own Houſholds, for a Trial of their Sincerity, and Improvement of their Faith; yet we cannot but pronounce a <hi>Woe</hi> againſt thoſe Maſters <hi>'by whom ſuch Offences come:</hi> For if thoſe that only take Care of their own Souls can ſcarcely be ſaved, where will ſuch monſtrous profane and wicked Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors appear?</p>
                  <p>But hoping there are but few of this unhappy Stamp, proceed we now to the</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Second</hi> Thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew after what Manner a Governor and his Houſhold ought to <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. And the <hi>firſt</hi> Thing I ſhall mention is reading the Word of GOD. This is a Duty incumbent on every private Perſon. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life,</hi> is a Precept given by our Bleſſed LORD indifferently to all: But much more ſo ought every Governor of a Family to think it in a peculiar Manner ſpoken to himſelf, becauſe (as hath heen already proved) he ought to look upon himſelf as a Prophet, and therefore, agreeably to ſuch a Character, as bound to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thoſe under his Charge in the Knowledge of the Word of GOD.</p>
                  <p>This we find was the Order GOD gave his peculiar People of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> For thus ſpeaks his Repreſentative <hi>Moſes, Deuteronomy</hi> vi. 6, 7. <hi>Theſe Words,</hi> that is, the Scripture Words,

                     <hi>which I command thee this Day, ſhall be in thy Heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children,</hi> that is, as it is generally explained, <hi>Servants,</hi> as well as Children, <hi>and ſhall talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy Houſe.</hi> From whence we may infer, that the only Reaſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſo many neglect to read the Words of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> if they were, out of the Abundance of the Heart their Mouth would ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Servants as well as Children are, for the Generality, very ignorant, and mere Novices in the Laws of GOD: And how ſhall they know, unleſs ſome one teach them? And what more proper to teach them by, than the lively Oracles of GOD, <hi>which are able to make them wiſe unto Salvation?</hi> And who more proper to inſtruct them by theſe lively Oracles, than Parents and Maſters, who (as hath been more than once obſerved) are as much concerned to feed them with ſpiritual as with bodily Bread, Day by Day.</p>
                  <p>But if theſe Things be ſo, what a miſerable Condition are thoſe unhappy Governors in, who are ſo far from feeding thoſe committed to their Care with the ſincere Milk of the Word, to the Intent they may grow thereby, that they neither ſearch the Scriptures themſelves, nor are careful to explain them to others? Such Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies muſt be in a happy Way indeed to do their Maſter's Will, who take ſuch prodigious Pains to know it! Would one not imagine that they
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:004650_0148_100DDBE8E881D7B0"/>
had turned Converts to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> that they thought <hi>Ignorance</hi> the Mother of <hi>Devotion;</hi> that thoſe were to be condemned as Hereticks who read their <hi>Bibles?</hi> And yet how few Families are there amongſt us, who do not act after this unſeemly Manner! But <hi>ſhall I praiſe them in this? I praiſe them not: Brethren, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Thing ought not ſo to be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Paſs we on now to the ſecond Means whereby every Governor and his Houſhold ought to ſerve the LORD, <hi>viz. Family Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a Duty, though as much neglected, yet as abſolutely neceſſary as the former. <hi>Reading</hi> is a good Preparative for <hi>Prayer,</hi> as <hi>Prayer</hi> is an excellent Means to render <hi>Reading</hi> effectual. And the Reaſon why every Governor of a Family ſhould join both theſe Exerciſes together, is plain, becauſe a Governor of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily cannot perform his <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Office (which we before obſerved he is in ſome Degree inveſted with) without performing this Duty of <hi>Family Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We find it therefore remarked, when men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel'</hi>s offering Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, that they <hi>brought</hi> them. But to whom did they bring them? Why, in all Probability to their Father <hi>Adam,</hi> who, as Prieſt of the Family, was to offer Sacrifice in their Names. And ſo likewiſe ought every ſpiritual Son of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who is intruſted with the Care of an Houſhold, to offer up the ſpiritual Sacrifices of Supplications and Thangſgivings, acceptable to GOD through JESUS CHRIST, in the Preſence
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:004650_0149_100DDBEA733D3FA0"/>
and Name of all who wait upon, or eat Meat at his Table.</p>
                  <p>Thus we read our Bleſſed LORD behaved, when he tabernacled amongſt us: For it is ſaid often, that <hi>he was alone</hi> praying with his twelve Diſciples, which was then his little Family. And he himſelf has promiſed a particular Bleſſing to joint Supplications: <hi>For whereſoever,</hi> ſays he, <hi>two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the Midſt of them.</hi> And again, <hi>If two or three are agreed touching any Thing they ſhall aſk, it ſhall be given them.</hi> Add to this, that we are commanded by the Apoſtle to <hi>pray always, with all Manner of Supplication,</hi> which doubtleſs includes <hi>Family Prayer.</hi> And holy <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when he ſet up the good Reſolution in the Text, that he and his Houſhold would <hi>ſerve the LORD,</hi> certainly reſolved withal to <hi>pray</hi> with his Family, which is one of the beſt Teſtimonies they could give of their ſerving him.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there are no Families but what have ſome common Bleſſings, of which they have been all Partakers, to give Thanks for; ſome common Croſſes and Afflictions, which they are to pray againſt; ſome common Sins which they are all to lament and bewail: But how this can be done without joining together in one common Act of Humiliation, Supplication, and Thankſgiving, is difficult to deviſe.</p>
                  <p>From all which Conſiderations put together, it is evident, that <hi>Family Prayer</hi> is a great and neceſſary Duty; and conſequently, thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors that neglect it are certainly without
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:004650_0150_100DDBED50838DE8"/>
Excuſe. And it is much to be feared, if they live without <hi>Family Prayer,</hi> they live without <hi>GOD in the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet ſuch an hateful Character as this is, it is to be feared, that was GOD to ſend out an Angel to deſtroy us, as he did once to deſtroy the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Firſt-born, and withal give him a Commiſſion, <hi>as then,</hi> to ſpare no Houſes but where they ſaw the Blood ſprinkled on the Lintel and Door-poſts, ſo <hi>now</hi> to let no Families eſcape but thoſe that called upon him in Morning and Evening Prayer; few would remain unhurt by his avenging Sword. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> ſhall I term ſuch Families, or <hi>Heathens?</hi> Doubtleſs they deſerve not the Name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> will ſurely riſe up in Judgment againſt ſuch profane Families of this Generation: For they had always their Houſhold Gods, whom they worſhipped, and whoſe Aſſiſtance they frequently invoked. And a pretty Paſs thoſe Families ſurely are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at, who muſt be ſent to School to <hi>Pagans.</hi> But will not the LORD be avenged on ſuch profane Houſholds as theſe? Will he not pour out his Fury upon thoſe that call not upon his Name?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But it is Time for me to haſten to the third and laſt Means I ſhall recommend, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every Governor ought with his Houſhold to <hi>ſerve the LORD, viz.</hi> by <hi>catechizing</hi> and <hi>inſtructing</hi> their Children and Servants, and bringing them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD.</p>

I know,</hi> ſayes the Moſt High, <hi>that He will command his Children and his Houſhold after him to keep the Way of the LORD, to do Juſtice and Judgment.</hi> And indeed ſcarce any Thing is more frequently preſſed upon us in Holy Writ, than this Duty of <hi>Catechizing.</hi> Thus ſays God in a Paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited, <hi>Thou ſhalt teach theſe Words diligently unto thy Children.</hi> And Parents are commanded in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to <hi>breed up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD.</hi> The Holy Pſalmiſt acquaints us, that one great End why GOD did ſo great Wonders for his People was, <hi>to the Intent that when they grew up they ſhould ſhew their Children or Servants, the ſame.</hi> And in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> Chap. vi. at the 20th and following Verſes, GOD ſtricty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his People to inſtruct their Children in the true Nature of the Ceremonial Worſhip, when they ſhould enquire about it, as he ſuppoſed they would do in Time to come. And if Servants and Children were to be inſtructed in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites, much more ought they <hi>now</hi> to be initiated and grounded in the Doctrine and firſt Principles of the Goſpel of CHRIST: Not only becauſe it is a Revelation which has brought Life and Immortality to a fuller and clearer Light, but alſo becauſe many Seducers are gone abroad into the World, who do their utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſtroy not only the Superſtructure,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:004650_0152_100DDBF72C7C6D80"/>
but likewiſe to ſap the very Foundation of our moſt Holy Religion.</p>
                  <p>Would then, the preſent Generation have their Poſterity be true Lovers and Honourers of GOD, Maſters and Parents muſt take <hi>Solomon'</hi>s good Advice, and train up and catechize their reſpective Houſholds in the Way wherein they ſhould go.</p>
                  <p>I am aware but of one Objection that can, with any Shew of Reaſon, be urged againſt what has been advanced; which is, That ſuch a Procedure as this will take up too much Time, and hinder Families too long from their Worldly Buſineſs. But it is much to be queſtioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons that ſtart ſuch an Objection are not of the ſame hypocritical Spirit as the Traytor <hi>Judas,</hi> who had Indignation againſt devout <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> for being ſo profuſe of her Ointment, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing our Bleſſed Lord, and asked Why it might not be ſold for Two Hundred Pence, and given to the Poor. For has GOD given us ſo much Time to work for Ourſelves, and ſhall we not allow ſome ſmall Pittance of it, Morning and Evening, to be devoted to his more immediate Worſhip and Service? Have not People read, That it is GOD who gives Men Power to get Wealth, and therefore that the beſt Way to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the World is to ſecure His Favour? And has not our bleſſed Lord himſelf promiſed, That if we ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, all outward Neceſſaries ſhall be added unto us.</p>

                     <hi>Abraham,</hi> no doubt, was a Man of as great Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs as ſuch Objectors may be; but yet he would find Time, to command his Houſhold to <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi> Nay, <hi>David,</hi> was a King, and conſequently had a great deal of Buſineſs upon his Hands; yet notwithſtanding, He profeſſes that he would walk in his Houſe with a perfect Heart. And, to inſtance but one more, Holy <hi>Joſhua</hi> was a Perſon certainly engaged very much in Temporal Affairs; and yet He ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares before all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> That, as for him and his Houſhold, they would <hi>ſerve the</hi> LORD. And did Perſons but redeem their Time, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, David,</hi> or <hi>Joſhua</hi> did, they would no longer complain that Family Duties kept them too long from the Buſineſs of the World.</p>
                  <p>III. But my <hi>Third</hi> and laſt General Head, under which I was to offer ſome Motives, in order to excite all Governors with their reſpective Houſholds, to <hi>ſerve the LORD</hi> in the Manner before recommended, I hope, will ſerve inſtead of a Thouſand Arguments, to prove the Weakneſs and Folly of any ſuch Objection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And the firſt Motive I ſhall mention is the Duty of Gratitude, you that are Governors of Families owe to GOD.—Your Lot, every one muſt confeſs, is caſt into a fair Ground: Providence hath given you a goodly Heritage, above many of your Fellow-Creatures, and therefore, out of a Principle of Gratitude, you ought to endeavour, as much as in you lies, to make every Perſon of your reſpective Houſholds
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:004650_0154_100DDBFA785203B8"/>
to call upon him as long as they live: (Not to mention that the Authority, with which GOD has inveſted you as Parents and Governors of Families, is a Talent committed to your Truſt, and which you are bound to improve to your Maſter's Honour.) In other Things we find Governors and Parents can exerciſe Lordſhip over their Children and Servants readily, and frequently enough can ſay to one <hi>Go,</hi> and he goeth; and to another <hi>Come,</hi> and he cometh; to a third, <hi>Do this,</hi> and he doeth it. And ſhall this Power be ſo often employed in your own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and never exerted in the Things of GOD? Be aſtoniſhed, O Heavens, at this.</p>
                  <p>Thus did not faithful <hi>Abraham;</hi> No, GOD ſays, that He knew <hi>Abraham</hi> would <hi>command his Servants and Children after him.</hi> Thus did not <hi>Joſhua:</hi> No, he was reſolved not only to walk with GOD himſelf, but to improve his Authority in making all about him do ſo too: <hi>As for me and my Houſhold we will ſerve the LORD.</hi> Let us go and do likewiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But, Secondly, if <hi>Gratitude</hi> to GOD will not, methinks <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi> to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould move you, with your reſpective Families, to <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt People expreſs a great Fondneſs for their Children; nay ſo great, that very often their own Lives are wrapped up in thoſe of their Offspring. <hi>Can a Woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have Compaſſion on the Son of her Womb?</hi> ſays GOD by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> He ſpeaks of it as a monſtrous Thing,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:004650_0155_100DDBFE4814D130"/>
and ſcarce credible. But the Words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following affirm it to be poſſible, <hi>Yea, They may forget;</hi> and Experience alſo aſſures us they may. <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> may both <hi>forſake their Children:</hi> For what greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Forgetfulneſs can they expreſs towards them, than to neglect the Improvement of their better Part, and not bring them up in the Knowledge and Fear of GOD.</p>
                  <p>It is true, indeed, Parents ſeldom forget to provide for their Children's Bodies, (though, it is to be feared, ſome Men are ſo far ſunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Beaſts that periſh, as to neglect even that;) but then how often do they forget, or rather when do they remember, to ſecure the Salvation of their immortal Souls? But is this their Way of expreſſing their Fondneſs for the Fruit of their Bodies? Is this the beſt Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they can give of their Affection to the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their Hearts? Then was <hi>Daltlah</hi> fond of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when ſhe delivered him up into the Hands of the <hi>Philiſtines:</hi> Then were thoſe Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians well-affected to <hi>Daniel,</hi> when they threw him into a Den of Lions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But, Thirdly, if neither <hi>Gratitude</hi> to GOD, nor <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi> to your Children, will prevail on you; yet let a Principle of common <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> move you to ſet up the holy Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Text.</p>
                  <p>This is a Principle which all Men would be thought to act upon. But certainly, if any may be truly cenſured for their Injuſtice, none can be more liable to ſuch Cenſure than thoſe who think
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:004650_0156_100DDC010D449F28"/>
themſelves injured if their Servants withdraw themſelves from their bodily Work, and yet they in return take no Care of their ineſtimable Souls. For is it juſt that Servants ſhould ſpend their Time and Strength in their Maſter's Service, and Maſters not at the ſame time give them what is juſt and equal for their Service.</p>
                  <p>It is true, ſome Men may think they have done enough when they give unto their Servants Food and Rayment, and ſay, Did not I bargain with thee for ſo much a Year? But if they give them no other Reward than this, What do they leſs for their very Beaſts; But are not Servants better than they? Doubtleſs they are: And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Maſters may put off their Convictions for the preſent, they will find a Time will come, when they ſhall know they ought to have given them ſome Spiritual, as well as Temporal Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and the Cry of thoſe that have mowed down their Fields will enter into the Ears of the LORD of <hi>Sabaoth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But, Fourthly, If neither <hi>Gratitude</hi> to GOD, <hi>Pity</hi> to Children, nor a Principle of common <hi>Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> to Servants, are ſufficient to balance all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; yet let that darling, that prevailing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>Self-Intereſt</hi> turn the Scale, and engage you with your reſpective Houſholds to <hi>ſerve the</hi> LORD.</p>
                  <p>This weighs greatly with you in other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Be then perſuaded to let it have a due and full Influence on you in this, and if it has, if you have but Faith as a Grain of Muſtard-Seed, how can you avoid believing that promoting <hi>Family-Religion</hi> would be the beſt Means to promote
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:004650_0157_100DDC0437F879D8"/>
your own temporal as well as eternal Welfare? For <hi>Godlineſs has the Promiſe of the Life that now is, as well as that which is to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, you all, doubtleſs, wiſh for honeſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and pious Children: And to have them prove otherwiſe, would be as great a Grief to you as it was to <hi>Eliſha</hi> to have a treacherous <hi>Gehazi,</hi> or <hi>David</hi> to be troubled with a rebellious <hi>Abſalom.</hi> But how can it be expected they ſhould learn their Duty, except thoſe ſet over them take Care to teach it them? Is it not as reaſonable to expect you ſhould reap where you had not ſown, or gather where you had not ſtrawed?</p>
                  <p>Did <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> indeed, give any Countenance to Children and Servants to diſregard their <hi>Parents and Maſters according to the Fleſh,</hi> or repreſent their Duty to them as inconſiſtent with their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Obedience to their <hi>Father and Maſter which is in Heaven,</hi> there might then be ſome Pretence to neglect inſtructing them in the Principles of ſuch a Religion. But ſince the Precepts of this pure and undefiled Religion are all of them holy, juſt and good; and the more they are taught their Duty to GOD, the better they will perform their Duties to you; methinks then to neglect the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their Souls, out of a dread of ſpending too much Time in religious Duties, is acting quite contrary to your own Intereſt as well as Duty.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Fifthly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> If neither <hi>Gratitude</hi> to GOD, <hi>Love</hi> to your Children, <hi>common Juſtice</hi> to your Servants, nor even that moſt prevailing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Self-Intereſt,</hi> will excite; yet let a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Terrors of the Lord</hi> perſuade you to
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:004650_0158_100DDC05EEA7DCE8"/>
put in Practice the pious Reſolution in the Text. Remember the Time will come, and that perhaps very ſhortly, when we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST; where we muſt give a ſolemn and ſtrict Account how we have had our Converſation, in our reſpective Families in this World. How will you endure to ſee your Children and Servants (who ought to be your Joy and Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of our Lord JESUS CHRIST) coming out as ſo many ſwift Witneſſes againſt you; curſing the Father that begot them, the Womb that bare them, the Paps which they have ſucked, and the Day they ever entered into your Houſes? Think you not the Damnation which Men muſt endure for their own Sins will be ſufficient, that they need load themſelves with the additional Guilt of being acceſſary to the Damnation of others alſo? Oh conſider this, all ye that forget to ſerve the LORD with your reſpective Houſholds, <hi>leſt he pluck you away, and there be none to deliver you!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But GOD forbid, Brethren, that any ſuch Evil ſhould befal you: No, rather will I hope that you have been in ſome Meaſure, convinced by what has been ſaid of the great Importance of <hi>Family Religion;</hi> and therefore are ready to cry out, in the Words immediately following the Text, <hi>God forbid that we ſhould forſake the LORD;</hi> and again, Verſe 21, <hi>Nay but we will,</hi> with our ſeveral Houſholds, <hi>ſerve the LORD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that there may be always ſuch a Heart in you, let me, to conclude, exhort all Governors of Families, in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:004650_0159_100DDC09B72A8B18"/>

Animadverſions are ſo neglected amongſt us, that where ſhall we find a common Swearer puniſhed as the Laws direct? And as for private Admonition, Men are now ſo <hi>hardened through the Deceitfulneſs of Sin,</hi> that to give them ſober and pious Advice, and to ſhew them the Evil of their Doings, is but like <hi>caſting Pearls before Swine, they only turn again and rent you.</hi> Since Matters then are come to this Paſs, all that we can do is this, that as we are appointed Watchmen and Ambaſſadors of the LORD, it is our Duty from Time to Time to <hi>ſhew the People their Tranſgreſſion, and warn them of their Sin;</hi> ſo that <hi>whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, we</hi> however <hi>may deliver our own Souls.</hi> That I therefore may diſcharge my Duty in this Particular, give me Leave, in the Name of GOD, humbly to offer to your moſt ſerious Conſideration, ſome few Obſervations on the Words of the Text, in order to ſhew the Heinouſneſs of <hi>profane Curſing and Swearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I proceed directly to the Proſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Point, it will be proper to clear this Precept of our LORD from a Miſinterpretation that has been put on it by a Set of Men, who heedleſly infer from hence, that our Saviour prohibits <hi>Swearing</hi> before a Magiſtrate, when required on a ſolemn and proper Occaſion. But that all <hi>Swearing</hi> is not abſolutely unlawful for a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is evident from the Writings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom we often find upon ſome ſolemn Occaſions uſing ſeveral Forms of Imprecation
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:004650_0162_100DDC13838E2418"/>
and Swearing, as, <hi>I call GOD to Witneſs,—GOD is my Judge,—By your rejoicing in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, and ſuch like. And that our Saviour does by no Means forbid <hi>Swearing</hi> before a Magiſtrate, in the Words now before us, is plain, if we conſider the Scope and Deſign he had in View, when he gave his Diſciples this Command. Permit me to obſerve to you then, that our Bleſſed Maſter had ſet himſelf, from the 27th Verſe of this Chapter, out of which the Text is taken, to vindicate and clear the Moral Law from the corrupt Gloſſes and Miſconſtruction of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who then ſate in <hi>Moſes'</hi>s Chair, but were notoriouſly faulty in adhering too cloſely to the literal Expreſſion of the Law, without ever conſidering the due Extent and ſpiritual Meaning of it. Accordingly they imagined, that becauſe GOD had ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery,</hi> that therefore, ſuppoſing a Perſon was not guilty of the very Act of <hi>Adultery,</hi> he was not chargeable with the Breach of the Seventh Commandment. And likewiſe in the Matter of <hi>Swearing,</hi> becauſe GOD had forbidden his People in the Books of <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> to take his Name in vain, or to <hi>Swear falſely</hi> by his Name; they therefore judged it lawful to <hi>Swear</hi> by any Creature in common Diſcourſe, ſuppoſing they did not directly mention the Name of GOD. Our Bleſſed Saviour therefore in the Words now before us, rectifies this their Miſtake about <hi>Swearing,</hi> as he had done in the Verſes immediately foregoing that concerning <hi>Adultery,</hi> and tells the People,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:004650_0163_100DDC162454A4D8"/>
that whatever Allowances the <hi>Phariſees</hi> might give to <hi>ſwear</hi> by any Creature, yet he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it abſolutely unlawful for any of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to do ſo. <hi>You have heard,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that it has been ſaid by them of old Time</hi> (namely by the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and Teachers of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law) <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſwear thyſelf, but perform unto the LORD thine Oaths: But I ſay unto you,</hi> (I who am appointed by the Father to be the great Prophet and true Law-giver of his Church) <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> in your common Converſation <hi>neither by Heaven, for it is GOD's Throne;</hi> and therefore to ſwear by That, is to ſwear by Him that ſits thereon; <hi>neither by the Earth, for it is his Foot-ſtool; nor by</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for it is the City of the Great King; neither ſhalt thou ſwear by thy Head, becauſe thou canſt not make one Hair white or black: But let your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications</hi> (which plainly ſhews that CHRIST is here ſpeaking of <hi>Swearing,</hi> not before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but in common Converſation, let your Communications) ſays he, <hi>be Yea, yea; Nay, nay,</hi> a ſtrong Affirmation or Negation at the moſt; <hi>for whatever is more than this cometh of Evil;</hi> that is, cometh from an evil Principle, from the Evil One, the Devil, the Author of all Evil.</p>
                  <p>Which by the Way, methinks, ſhould be a Caution to all ſuch Perſons, who, though not guilty of <hi>Swearing</hi> in the groſs Senſe of the Word, yet atteſt the Truth of what they are ſpeaking of, though ever ſo trifling, by ſaying, <hi>Upon my Life,—As I live,—By my Faith,—By
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:004650_0164_100DDC17A9701010"/>
the Heavens,</hi> and ſuch like: Which Expreſſions, however harmleſs and innocent they may be eſteemed by ſome ſorts of People, yet are the very Oaths which our Bleſſed LORD condemns in the Words immediately following the Text; and Perſons who uſe ſuch unwarrantable Forms of ſpeaking, muſt expect to be convicted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as <hi>Swearers,</hi> at our Saviour's ſecond Coming to judge the World.</p>
                  <p>But to return: It appears then from the whole Tenor of our Saviour's Diſcourſe, that in the Words of the Text he does by no Means diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annul or forbid <hi>Swearing</hi> before a Magiſtrate (which, as might eaſily be ſhewn, is both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary) but only <hi>profane Swearing</hi> in common Converſation; the Heinouſneſs and Sinfulneſs of which I come now, as was above propoſed, more immediately to lay before you.</p>
                  <p>And here, not to mention that it is a direct Breach of our Bleſſed Maſter's and great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver's Command in the Words of the Text, as likewiſe of the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <list>
                     <item>I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe there is no Temptation in Nature to this Sin, nor does the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it afford the Offender the leaſt Pleaſure or Satisfaction.</item>
                     <item>II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe it is a Sin which may be ſo often repeated.</item>
                     <item>III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe it hardens Infidels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and muſt give great Offence, and occaſion much Sorrow and Concern to every true Diſciple of JESUS CHRIST.</item>
                     <item>IV. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe it is an Extremity of Sin, which can only be matched in Hell.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I. The <hi>Firſt</hi> Reaſon then, why <hi>Swearing</hi> in common Converſation is ſo heinous in GOD's Sight, and why we ſhould not ſwear at all, is, becauſe it has no Temptation in Nature; nor does the Commiſſion of it, unleſs a Man be a Devil incarnate, afford the Offender the leaſt Pleaſure or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>Now here, I preſume, we may lay it down as a Maxim univerſally agreed on, that the Guilt of any Crime is increaſed or leſſened in Proportion to the Weakneſs or Strength of the Temptation by which a Perſon is carried out to the Commiſſion of it. It was this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that extenuated and diminiſhed the Guilt
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:004650_0166_100DDC1CD65DB540"/>
of <hi>Saul'</hi>s taking upon him to offer Sacrifice before the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> came, and of <hi>Uzza'</hi>s touching the Ark, becauſe it was in Danger of falling: As, on the contrary, what ſo highly aggravated the Diſobedience of our firſt Parents and <hi>Lot'</hi>s Wife, was, becauſe the former had ſo little Reaſon to eat the forbidden Fruit, and the latter ſo ſmall a Temptation to look back on <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now if this be granted, ſurely the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Swearer</hi> muſt of all Sinners be the moſt without Excuſe, ſince there is no Manner of Temptation in Nature to the Commiſſion of his Crime. In moſt of the other Commands, Perſons perhaps may plead the Force of Natural Inclination in Excuſe for the Breach of them: One, for Inſtance, may alledge his ſtrong Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to Anger, to excuſe his breaking of the Sixth: Another, his Proneneſs to Luſt, for his Violation of the Seventh. But now ſurely the <hi>common Swearer</hi> has nothing of this kind to urge in his Behalf: For though he may have a natural Inclination to this or that Crime, yet no Man, it is to be preſumed, can ſay, he is born of a <hi>ſwearing Conſtitution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But farther, as there is no Temptation to it, ſo there is no Pleaſure or Profit to be reaped from the Commiſſion of it. Ask the Drunkard why he riſes up early to follow ſtrong Drink, and he will tell you, becauſe it affords his ſenſual Appetite ſome kind of Pleaſure and Gratification, though it be no higher an one than that of a Brute. Enquire of the covetous Worldling,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:004650_0167_100DDC1F82580578"/>
why he defrauds and over-reaches his Neighbour, and he has an Anſwer ready,—To enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to lay up Goods for many Years. But it muſt certainly puzzle the <hi>profane Swearer</hi> himſelf, to inform you what Pleaſure he reaps from <hi>Swearing:</hi> For alas! it is a fruitleſs, taſteleſs Thing, that he ſells his Soul for. But indeed he does not ſell it at all: In this Caſe he prodigally gives it away (without Repentance) to the Devil; and parts with a bleſſed Eternity, and runs into everlaſting Torment, merely for nothing!</p>
                  <p>II. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> what increaſes the Heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>profane Swearing,</hi> is, that it is a Sin which may ſo often be repeated.</p>
                  <p>This is another Conſideration which always ſerves to leſſen or increaſe the Guilt and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of any Sin. It was ſome Excuſe for the Drunkenneſs of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the Adultery of <hi>David,</hi> that they committed theſe Crimes but once: As, on the contrary, of the Patriarch <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Diſtruſt of GOD, that he repeated the Diſſembling of <hi>Sarah</hi> to be his Wife two ſeveral Times. And if this be admitted as an Aggravation of other Perſons Crimes, ſurely much more ſo of the Guilt of <hi>common Swearing,</hi> becauſe it is a Sin which may be and is for the generality often repeated. In many other groſs Sins it cannot be ſo: If a Man be overcome in Drink, there muſt be a conſiderable Time e'er he can recover his Debauch, and return to his Cups again: Or if he be accuſtomed to profane the Sabbath, he cannot do it every Day, but only
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:004650_0168_100DDC22483380A8"/>
one in ſeven. But alas! the <hi>profane Swearer</hi> is ready for another Oath almoſt before the Sound of the firſt is out of our Ears: Yea, ſome double and treble them in one Sentence, even ſo as to confound the Senſe of what they ſay, by an horrid Din of Blaſphemy! Now if the great and terrible <hi>Jehovah</hi> has expreſly declared that he <hi>will not hold him guiltleſs,</hi> that is, will aſſuredly puniſh him, <hi>that taketh his Name</hi> but once <hi>in vain:</hi> What a vaſt Heap of theſe heinous Sins lies at every <hi>common Swearer'</hi>s Door! It would be apt to ſink him into an intolerable Deſpair, did he but ſee the whole Sum of them. And Oh! what a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eared Conſcience muſt that Wretch have, that does not feel this prodigious Weight!</p>
                  <p>III. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> what makes the Sin of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Swearing</hi> appear yet more exceeding ſinful, is, that it hardens Infidels againſt the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Advice to the married Perſons of his Time, that they ſhould walk as became the Goſpel of CHRIST, that thoſe that were without, might be won to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> by ſeeing and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their pious Converſation coupled together with Fear. And what the Apoſtle preſſes on married Perſons we find elſewhere enjoined each particular Member of the Church. Accordingly we are commanded by our Bleſſed LORD to <hi>let our Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee our good Works, and glorify our Father which is in Heaven:</hi> And the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us <hi>walk circumſpectly towards them that are without,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:004650_0169_100DDC24D300A3A8"/>
redeeming the Time,</hi> that is embracing all Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to do them good, <hi>becauſe the Days are evil.</hi> But alas! in what a direct Contradiction does the <hi>profane Swearer</hi> live to this and ſuch Precepts, who inſtead of gaining Proſelytes to CHRIST from the unbelieving Part of the World, does all he can to oppoſe it! For how can it be expected, that Infidels ſhould honour our GOD, when <hi>Chriſtians</hi> themſelves deſpiſe him; or that any ſhould embrace our Religion, when Profeſſors of it themſelves make ſo light of one of its ſtricteſt Commands? No, to our Grief and Shame be it ſpoken, it is by reaſon of ſuch Impieties as theſe that our <hi>holy Religion</hi> (the beſt and pureſt in itſelf) is become a By word among the Heathen; that the ſacred Authority of the Holy JESUS and his Doctrine is deſpiſed; and <hi>GOD's Name,</hi> as it is written, <hi>blaſphemed among the Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe cannot but be ſad Blocks and Offences in the Way of our Brethren's Converſion: <hi>But woe be to thoſe Men by whom ſuch Offences come:</hi> We may ſay of them, as our bleſſed LORD did of <hi>Judas, It had been better for ſuch Men that they had never been born:</hi> Or, as he threatens in another Place, <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the Day of Judgment than for ſuch Sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is not all; as <hi>prophane Swearing</hi> muſt undoubtedly harden thoſe in their Infidelity that are without, ſo muſt it no leſs grieve and give great Offence to thoſe honeſt and ſincere Perſons that are within the Church. We hear of <hi>David'</hi>s complaining and crying out, <hi>Woe is me that I
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:004650_0170_100DDC27974FBA48"/>
am conſtrained to dwell with Meſech, and to have my Habitation amongſt the Tents of Kedar:</hi> That is, that he was obliged to live and converſe with a People exceedingly wicked and profane. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that <hi>Lot's righteous Soul was grieved day by day, whilſt he ſaw and obſerved the ungodly Converſation of the Wicked.</hi> And no doubt it was one great Part of our bleſſed Maſter's Sufferings whilſt on Earth, that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to converſe with a wicked and perverſe Generation, and to hear his heavenly Father's ſacred Name profaned and ſcoffed at by unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and wicked Men. And ſurely it cannot but pierce the Heart of every true and ſincere <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> of every one that does in any Meaſure partake of the Spirit of his Maſter, to hear the Multitude of Oaths and Curſes which proceed daily and hourly out of the Mouths of many People, and thoſe too whoſe liberal Education and ſeeming Regard for the Welfare of Religion, one would think, ſhould teach them a more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Behaviour. To hear the great and terrible Name of GOD polluted by Men, which is adored by Angels; and to conſider how often that ſacred Name is profaned in common Diſcourſe, which we are not worthy to mention in our Prayers: This, I ſay, cannot but make each of them cry out with holy <hi>David, Woe is me that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to dwell with Meſech, and to have my Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation amongſt the Tents of Kedar.</hi> And though the blaſphemous and profane Diſcourſes of others will not be imputed to ſincere Perſons for Sin, ſo long as they <hi>have no Fellowſhip with ſuch helliſh
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:004650_0171_100DDC2A153A9200"/>
Fruits of Darkneſs, but rather reprove them;</hi> nay, rather will be imputed to them for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for thus lamenting the Wickedneſs of <hi>Sion:</hi> yet it will greatly enhance the preſent Guilt, and ſadly increaſe the future Puniſhment of every <hi>profane Swearer,</hi> by whom ſuch Offences come. For if, as our Saviour tells us, <hi>it had been better for a Man to have a Mill-ſtone tied about his Neck, than that he ſhould offend one of his little ones,</hi> that is, the weakeſt of his Diſciples, <hi>how much ſorer Puniſhment will they be thought worthy of,</hi> who not only cauſe GOD's Name to be blaſphemed among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Religion of our dear Redeemer to be abhorred; but who make his Saints to weep and mourn, and <hi>vex their righteous Souls from day to day,</hi> by their ungodly, profane and blaſphemous Converſation? Surely as GOD will put the Tears of <hi>one</hi> into his Bottle, and recompenſe them with eternal Glory at the great Day of Retribution, ſo it will be juſt in him to puniſh the <hi>other</hi> with eternal Sorrow for all their ungodly and hard Speeches, and caſt them into a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, where they ſhall be glad of a Drop of Water to cool thoſe Tongues with which they have ſo often blaſphemed the LORD of Hoſts, and grieved the People of our GOD.</p>
                  <p>IV. But it is Time for me to proceed to give my <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt Reaſon, why <hi>common Swearing</hi> is ſo exceeding ſinful. And that is, becauſe it is ſuch an Extremity of Sin, that can only be matched in Hell, where all are deſperate, and without Hope of Mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="unknown:004650_0172_100DDC2CCE849550"/>
The damned Devils and damned Souls of Men in Hell, may be ſuppoſed to rave and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme in their Torments, becauſe they know that the Chains wherein they are held can never be knocked off: But for Men that ſwim in the River of GOD's Goodneſs, <hi>whoſe Mercies are renewed to them every Morning,</hi> and who are viſited with freſh Tokens of his infinite unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Loving-kindneſs every Moment: For theſe favourite Creatures to <hi>ſet their Mouths againſt Heaven,</hi> and to blaſpheme a gracious, patient, all-bountiful GOD <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a Height of Sin which exceeds the Blackneſs and Impiety of Devils and Hell itſelf.</p>
                  <p>And now, after what has been here offered, to ſhew the Heinouſneſs of <hi>profane Curſing</hi> and <hi>Swearing</hi> in common Converſation, may I not very juſtly addreſs myſelf to you in the Words of the Text, <hi>Therefore I ſay unto you, ſwear not at all;</hi> ſince it is a Sin that has no Temptation in Nature, nor brings any Pleaſure or Profit to the Committer of it; ſince it hardens Infidels in their Infidelity, and affords ſad Cauſes of Grief and Lamentation to every honeſt <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> ſince it is a Sin that generally grows into a Habit; and laſtly, ſuch a Sin that can only be matched in Hell.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt then, if theſe Things be ſo, and the Sin of <hi>profane Swearing,</hi> as hath been in ſome Meaſure ſhewn, is ſo exceeding ſinful, what ſhall we ſay to ſuch unhappy Men, who think it not only allowable, but faſhionable and polite, to <hi>take the Name of GOD in vain;</hi> who imagine
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:004650_0173_100DDC2E5361C2F0"/>
that <hi>Swearing</hi> makes them look big among their Companions, and really think it a Piece of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to abound in it? But alas! little do they think that ſuch a Behaviour argues the greateſt Degeneracy of Mind and Fool-hardineſs that can poſſibly be thought of: For what can be more baſe than one Hour to pretend to adore GOD in publick Worſhip, and the very next Moment to blaſpheme his Name: Indeed ſuch a Behaviour from Perſons who deny the Being of a GOD (if any ſuch Fools there be) is not altogether ſo much to be wondered at: But for Men, who not only ſubſcribe to the Belief of a Deity, but likewiſe acknowledge him to be a GOD of infinite Majeſty and Power; for ſuch Men, I ſay, to blaſpheme his holy Name by <hi>profane Curſing</hi> and <hi>Swearing,</hi> and at the ſame Time confeſs, that this very GOD has expreſsly declared He <hi>will not hold him guiltleſs,</hi> that is, will certainly and eternally puniſh (without Repentance) him <hi>that taketh his Name in vain;</hi> is ſuch an Inſtance of Fool-hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as well as Baſeneſs, that can ſcarcely be parallel'd. This is what they preſume not to do in other Caſes of leſs Danger: They dare not revile a General at the Head of his Army, nor rouſe a ſleeping Lion when within reach of his Paw. And is the Almighty GOD, the Great <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> the Everlaſting King, who can conſume them by the Breath of his Noſtrils, and frown them to Hell in an Inſtant; is He, I ſay, the only contemptible Being in their Account that may be provoked without Fear, and offended without Puniſhment? No, though GOD bear
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:004650_0174_100DDC3367660F40"/>
long, he will not bear always: Time will come, and that too perhaps much ſooner than ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may expect, when GOD will vindicate his injured Honour, when he will lay bare his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Arm, and make thoſe Wretches feel the eternal Smart of his Juſtice, whoſe Power and Name they have ſo often vilified and blaſphemed. Alas! what will become of all their Bravery then? Will they then wantonly ſport with the Name of their Maker, and call upon the King of all the Earth to damn them any more in Jeſt? No, their Note will then be changed; indeed they ſhall call, but, alas! it will be for <hi>the Rocks to fall on them, and the Hills to cover them from the Wrath of him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and from the Lamb forever.</hi> It is true, Time was when they prayed, though without Thought perhaps, for Damnation both for themſelves and others: And now they will find their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers anſwered.—<hi>They delighted in Curſing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall it happen unto them; they loved not Bleſſing, therefore ſhall it be far from them; they cloathed themſelves with Curſing like as with a Garment, and it ſhall come into their Bowels like Water, and like Oil into their Bones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But farther, if the Sin of <hi>Swearing</hi> is ſo exceeding heinous and withal ſo common, then it is every particular Perſon's Duty, eſpecially thoſe that are in Authority, to do their utmoſt towards diſcountenancing and ſuppreſſing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant a Crime. The Duty we owe both to GOD and our Neighbour requires this at our Hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By the one we are obliged to aſſert our
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:004650_0175_100DDC34EC72A598"/>
Maker's Honour; by the other to prevent our Neighbour's Ruin: Not to mention that it is the greateſt Proof we can give of our undiſſembled Love to our Maſter, and is but <hi>doing as we would be done by,</hi> and as we ourſelves act in Caſes of leſſer Conſequence. Were we to hear either our own or our Friend's good Name vilified and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, we ſhould think it our bounden Duty to vindicate the wronged Reputation of each: And ſhall the great, terrible and holy Name of our beſt and only Friend, our King, our Father, nay our GOD: Shall this, I ſay, be daily, nay every Moment defied and blaſphemed; and will no one dare to ſtand up in Defence of his Honour and Holineſs? <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O Heavens,</hi> at this! No, let us ſcorn all ſuch baſe and treacherous Treatment: Let us, for once at leaſt, reſolve to ſupport the Cauſe of Religion, and with a becoming prudent Courage manifeſt our Zeal for the Honour of the LORD of Hoſts. Men in Authority have dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Advantages of ordinary <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> Their very Office ſhews they are intended for the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of Evil Doers: And ſuch is the Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of Mankind, that the generality of them will be more influenced by the Power of Perſons in Authority, than by the moſt laboured Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the Pulpit. To ſuch therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if there are any here preſent, I humbly addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, beſeeching them in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, to do their utmoſt to put a ſtop to, and reſtrain <hi>profane Curſing</hi> and <hi>Swearing.</hi> And though it muſt be confeſſed that this is a Work which requires a great deal of Courage
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:004650_0176_100DDC37FAA630D0"/>
and Pains, yet they would do well to conſider it is for GOD they undertake it, who certainly will ſupport and bear them out in a due Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Office here, and reward them with an exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But it is Time to draw towards a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let me therefore once more addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to every Perſon here preſent, in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST; and if any amongſt them have been any way guilty of this notorious Sin of <hi>Swearing,</hi> let me intreat them by all that is near and dear to them, that they would neither give the Magiſtrate the Trouble to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, nor their Friends any Reaſon for the future to warn them againſt committing the Crime; but keep a conſtant and careful <hi>Watch over the Door of their Lips,</hi> and withal implore the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance (without which all is nothing) that <hi>they offend no more</hi> ſo ſcandalouſly <hi>with their Tongues.</hi> Let them ſeriouſly lay to Heart what with great Plainneſs and Simplicity has here been delivered: And if they have any Regard for themſelves as Men, or their Reputation as <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> if they would not be a publick Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to their Profeſſion, or a Grief to all that know or converſe with them: In ſhort, if they would not be Devils Incarnate here, and provoke GOD to puniſh them eternally hereafter,—I ſay unto them in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi>

                  <p>NUMBERLESS Marks does Man bear in his Soul, that he is fallen and eſtranged from GOD; but no one gives a greater Proof of it, than that Backwardneſs, which every one finds within himſelf, to the Duty of Praiſe and Thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p>When GOD placed the firſt Man in Paradiſe, his Soul, no doubt, was ſo filled with a Senſe of the Riches of the Divine Love, that he was continually employing that <hi>Breath of Life</hi> the Almighty had not long before <hi>breathed</hi> into him, in bleſſing and magnifying that all-bountiful, all-gracious GOD, in whom he lived, moved, and had his Being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="unknown:004650_0178_100DDC3C593CFFA0"/>
And the brighteſt Idea we can form of the Angelical Hierarchy above, and the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, is, that they are continually ſtanding round the Throne of GOD, and ceaſe not Day and Night, ſaying, <hi>Worthy art thou, O Lamb, that was ſlain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſſing,</hi> Rev. v. 12.</p>
                  <p>That then, which was Man's Perfection when Time firſt began, and will be his Employment when Death is ſwallowed up in Victory, and Time ſhall be no more, without Controverſy, is part of our Perfection, and ought to be our frequent Exerciſe on Earth: And I doubt not but thoſe bleſſed Spirits, who are ſent forth to miniſter to them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation, often ſtand aſtoniſhed when they encamp around us, to find our Hearts ſo rarely enlarged, and our Mouths ſo ſeldom opened, to ſhew forth the loving Kindneſs of the LORD, or to ſpeak of all his Praiſe.</p>
                  <p>Matter for Praiſe and Adoration can never be wanting to Creatures redeemed by the Blood of the Son of GOD; and who have ſuch continual Scenes of his infinite Goodneſs preſented to their View, that were their Souls duly affected with a Senſe of his univerſal Love, they could not but be continually calling on Heaven and Earth, Men and Angels, to join with them in praiſing and bleſſing that HIGH <hi>and</hi> LOFTY ONE, <hi>who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth Eternity, who maketh his Sun to ſhine on the Evil and on the Good, and daily pours down his Bleſſing on the whole Race of Mankind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="unknown:004650_0179_100DDC4182D39648"/>
But few are arrived to ſuch a Degree of Charity, as to rejoice with thoſe that do rejoice, and to be as thankful for others Mercies as their own. This Part of Chriſtian Perfection, though begun on Earth, will be conſummated only in Heaven; where our Hearts will glow with ſuch fervent Love towards GOD and one another, that every freſh degree of Glory communicated to our Neighbour, will alſo communicate to us a freſh degree of Thankfulneſs and Joy.</p>
                  <p>That which has a greater Tendency to excite the Generality of us fallen Men to Praiſe and Thankſgiving, is a Senſe of GOD's private Mercies and particular Benefits beſtowed upon ourſelves. For as theſe come nearer our own Hearts, ſo they muſt be more affecting; and as they are peculiar Proofs, whereby we may know that GOD does in a more eſpecial Manner favour us above others, ſo they cannot but ſenſibly touch us; and if our Hearts are not quite frozen, like Coals of a Refiner's Fire, muſt melt us down into Thankfulneſs and Love. It was a Conſideration of the diſtinguiſhing Favours GOD had ſhewn to his choſen People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the frequent and remarkable Deliverances wrought by him in Behalf of <hi>thoſe who go down to the Sea in Ships, and occupy their Buſineſs in great Waters,</hi> that made the holy Pſalmiſt break out ſo frequently as he does in this Pſalm, into this moving, pathetical Exclamation, <hi>O that Men would therefore praiſe the LORD for his Goodneſs, and declare the Wonders that he doeth for the Children of Men!</hi>

His expreſſing himſelf in ſo paſſionate, fervent a Manner, implies both the Importance and Neglect of the Duty. As when <hi>Moſes</hi> or another Occaſion cries out, <hi>Oh that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they woull</hi> practically <hi>conſider their latter End?</hi> Deut xxxii. 29.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, Importance and Neglect of the Duty for out of thoſe many Thouſands that receive Bleſſings from the LORD, how few give Thanks in Remembrance of his Holineſs? The Account given us of the ungrateful Lepers, is but too lively a Repreſentation of the Ingratitude of Mankind in general; who like them, perhaps, when under any humbling Providence, can cry, JESUS <hi>Maſter, have Mercy on us,</hi> Luke xvii. 13. but when healed of their Sickneſs, or delivered from their Diſtreſs, ſcarce one in ten can be <hi>found returning to give Thanks to GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet as common as this Sin of Ingratitude is, there is nothing we ought more earneſtly to pray againſt. For what is more abſolutely condemned in Holy Scripture than Ingratitude? Or what more peremptorily required than the contrary Temper? Thus ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Rejoyce evermore, in every Thing give Thanks,</hi> 1 Thef. v. 16—18. <hi>Be careful for nothing: But in every Thing by Prayer and Supplication, with Thankſgiving, let your Requeſts be made known unto GOD,</hi> Phil. iv. 6.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the Apoſtle mentions it as one of the higheſt Crimes of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they were not <hi>thankful. Neither were they
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:004650_0181_100DDC461EC647D8"/>
thankful,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Romans</hi> i. 21. As alſo in another Place, he numbers the <hi>Unthankful,</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 2. amongſt thoſe <hi>unholy,</hi> profane Perſons who are to have their Portion in the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone.</p>
                  <p>As for our Sins, GOD puts them behind his Back; but his Mercies he will have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. There <hi>is Vertue gone out of me,</hi> ſays JESUS CHRIST, Luke viii.46. And the Woman who was cured of her bloody Iſſue, muſt <hi>confeſs</hi> it: And we generally find, when GOD ſent any remarkable Puniſhment upon any particular Perſon, he reminded him of the Favours he had received, as ſo many Aggravations of his Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Thus when GOD was about to viſit <hi>Eli's</hi> Houſe, he thus expoſtulates with him by his Prophet, <hi>Did I plainly appear unto the Houſe of thy Fathers, when they were in</hi> Egypt, <hi>in</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>Houſe? And did I chuſe him out of all the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to be my Prieſt, to offer upon my Altar, to burn Incenſe, and to wear an Ephod before me? Wherefore kick ye at my Sacrifice, and at mine Offering which I have commanded in my Habitation, and honoureſt thy Sons above me, to make yourſelves fat with the chiefeſt of all the Offerings of</hi> Iſrael <hi>my People? Wherefore the LORD GOD of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaith, I ſaid indeed, that thy Houſe, and the Houſe of thy Father ſhould walk before me for ever; but now the LORD ſaith, Be it far from me, for them that honour me will I honour, and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> I Sam. ii. 27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="unknown:004650_0182_100DDC48381CB730"/>
It was this and ſuch like Inſtances of GOD's Severity againſt the Unthankful, that inclined me to chuſe the Words of the Text as the moſt proper Subject I could diſcourſe on at this Time.</p>
                  <p>For theſe four Months, my good Friends, we have now been upon the Sea in this Ship, and have <hi>occupied our Buſineſs in the great Waters.</hi> At GOD Almighty's <hi>Word,</hi> we have ſeen the <hi>ſtormy Wind ariſe, which hath lifted up the Waves thereof. We have been carried up to the Heaven and down again to the Deep, and ſome of our Souls melted away, becauſe of the Trouble; but I truſt we cried earneſtly unto the LORD, and he delivered us out of our Diſtreſs. For he made the Storm to ceaſe; ſo that the Waves thereof were ſtill. And now we are glad becauſe we are at Reſt, for GOD hath brought us to the Haven where we would be Oh that you would therefore praiſe the LORD for his Goodneſs, and declare the Wonders that</hi> he hath <hi>done for</hi> us, the unworthieſt of the Sons <hi>of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> thus <hi>Joſhua</hi> behaved. For when they were about to take their Leaves of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they recounted to them what great Things GOD had done for them, as the beſt Arguments and Motives they could urge to engage them to Obedience. And how can I copy after better Examples? What fitter, what more noble Motives to Holineſs and Purity of Living can I lay before you than they did?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="unknown:004650_0183_100DDC4C1176B400"/>
Indeed I cannot ſay, that we have ſeen <hi>a Pillar of a Cloud by Day,</hi> or <hi>a Pillar of Fire by Night,</hi> going viſibly before us to guide our Courſe; but this I can ſay, that the ſame GOD who was in that Pillar of a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire, which departed not from the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and who has made the Sun to rule the Day, and the Moon to rule the Night, has by his good Providence directed us in our right Way, or elſe the Pilot had ſteered us in vain.</p>
                  <p>Neither can I ſay, that we have ſeen the <hi>Sun ſtand ſtill,</hi> as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in the Days of <hi>Joſhua.</hi> But ſurely GOD, during part of our Voyage, has cauſed it to with-hold ſome of that Heat which it uſually ſends forth in theſe warmer Climates, or elſe it had not failed but ſome of you muſt have periſhed in the Sickneſs that has been, and does yet continue among us.</p>
                  <p>We have not ſeen the Waters ſtand purpoſely on a Heap, that we might paſs through, neither have we been purſued by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt, and delivered out of their Hands; but we have been led through the Sea as through a Wilderneſs, and were once remarkably preſerved from being run down by another Ship; which, had GOD permitted, the Waters, in all Probability, would immediately have overwhelmed us, and like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt, we ſhould have ſunk as Stones into the Sea.</p>
                  <p>We may indeed, Atheiſt like, aſcribe all theſe Things to natural Cauſes, and ſay, our own Skill and Foreſight has brought us hither in

Safety. But as certainly as JESUS CHRIST, that Angel of the Covenant, in the Days of his Fleſh walked upon the Water, and ſaid to his ſinking Diſciples, <hi>Be not afraid, it is I,</hi> ſo ſurely has the ſame everlaſting <hi>I AM, who decketh himſelf with Light as with a Garment, who ſpreadeth out the Heavens like a Curtain,</hi> who claſpeth the Winds in his Fiſt, who holdeth the Waters in the Hollow of his Hands, and guided the Wiſe Men by a Star in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> ſo ſurely, I ſay, has he ſpoken, and at his Command the Winds have blown us where we are now arrived. For his Providence ruleth all Things, <hi>Winds and Storms obey his Word;</hi> He ſaith to it at one Time <hi>Go,</hi> and it goeth; at another, <hi>Come,</hi> and it cometh, and at a Third Time, <hi>Blow this Way,</hi> and it bloweth.</p>
                  <p>It is he, my Brethren, and not we ourſelves, that has of late ſent us ſuch proſperous Gales, and made us ride, as it were on the Wings of the Wind, into the Haven where we would be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O that you would therefore praiſe the LORD for his Goodneſs,</hi> and by your Lives declare, that you are truly thankful for the Wonders he hath ſhewn to us, who are leſs than the leaſt of the Sons of Men.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, declare it by your Lives. For to give him Thanks barely with your Lips, while your Hearts are far from him, is but a mock Sacrifice, nay, an Abomination unto the LORD.</p>
                  <p>This was the End, the Royal Pſalmiſt ſays, GOD had in view, when he ſhewed ſuch Wonders
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:004650_0185_100DDC51ED4591B0"/>

                  <p>O then, let me beſeech you, give GOD your Hearts, your whole Hearts, and ſuffer yourſelves to be drawn by the Cords of infinite Love to honour and obey him.</p>
                  <p>Aſſure yourſelves you never can ſerve a better Maſter, for his Service is perfect Freedom, is Yoke, when worn a little while, exceeding eaſy, his Burthen light; and in keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there is great Reward, Love, Peace, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt here, and a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away hereafter.</p>
                  <p>You may indeed let other Lords have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over you, and Satan may promiſe to give you all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them, if you will fall down and worſhip him; but he is a Liar, and was ſo from the Beginning; and has not ſo much to give you, as you may tread on with the Sole of your Foot; or could he give you the whole World, yet that could not make you happy without GOD. It is GOD alone, my Brethren, whoſe we are, in whoſe Name I now ſpeak, and who has of late ſhewed us ſuch Mercies in the Deep, that can give ſolid laſting Happineſs to your Souls; and he for this Reaſon only deſires your Hearts, becauſe without him they muſt be miſerable.</p>
                  <p>

Suffer me not then to go away without my Errand; as it is the laſt Time I ſhall ſpeak to you, let me not ſpeak in vain; but let a Senſe of the Divine Goodneſs lead you to Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Even <hi>Saul,</hi> that abandoned Wretch, when <hi>David</hi> ſhewed him his Skirt, which he had cut off, when he might have taken his Life, was ſo melted down with his Kindneſs, that he lifted up his Voice and wept. And we muſt have Hearts harder than <hi>Saul'</hi>s, nay harder than the nether Milſtone, if a Senſe of GOD's late loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, notwithſtanding he might ſo often have deſtroyed us, does not even compel us to lay down our Arms againſt him, and become his faithful Servants and Soldiers unto our Lives End.</p>
                  <p>If they have not this Effect upon us, we ſhall of all Men be moſt miſerable; for GOD is juſt, as well as merciful; and the more Bleſſings we have received here, the greater Damnation, if we do not improve them, ſhall we incur hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But GOD forbid that any of thoſe ſhould ever ſuffer the Vengeance of eternal Fire, amongſt whom I have for theſe Four Months been preaching the Goſpel of CHRIST, but yet thus muſt it be, if you do not improve the Divine Mercies; and inſtead of your being my Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, I muſt appear as a ſwift Witneſs againſt you.</p>
                  <p>But, Brethren, I am perſuaded better Things of you, and Things that accompany Salvation, though I thus ſpeak.</p>

Bleſſed be GOD, ſome Marks of a partial Reformation at leaſt, have been viſible amongſt all you that are Soldiers. And my weak, tho' ſincere Endeavours, to build you up in the knowledge and Fear of GOD, have not been altogether in vain in the LORD.</p>
                  <p>Swearing, I hope, is in a great Meaſure abated with you; and GOD I truſt has bleſſed his late Viſitations by making them the Means of awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening your Conſciences, to a more ſollicitous Enquiry about the Things which belong to your everlaſting Peace.</p>
                  <p>Fulfil you then my Joy, by continuing thus minded, and labour to go on to Perfection. For I ſhall have no greater Pleaſure than to ſee, or hear that you walk in the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, my good Friends, you are now, as it were, entring on a new World, where you will be ſurrounded with Multitudes of Heathens; and if you take not heed to <hi>have your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation honeſt amongſt them, and to walk worthy the Holy Vocation wherewith you are called,</hi> you will act the Helliſh Part of <hi>Herod's</hi> Soldiers over again; and cauſe CHRIST's Religion, as they did his Perſon, to be had in Deriſion of thoſe that are round about you.</p>

                  <p>Indeed I cannot ſay I have diſcharged my Duty towards you as I ought.

To You, my Companions and familiar Friends, who came over with me to ſojourn in a ſtrange Land, do I in the next Place addreſs myſelf.

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member then the End of your coming hither, and you can never do amiſs.—Be Patterns of Induſtry, as well as Piety, to thoſe who ſhall be around you; and above all Things let us have ſuch a fervent Charity amongſt ourſelves, that it may be ſaid of us, as of the Primitive Chriſtians, See how the Chriſtians love one another.</p>
                  <p>And now I have been ſpeaking to others particularly, I have one general Requeſt to make to all, and that with Reference to myſelf.</p>
                  <p>You have heard, my dear Friends, how I have been exhorting every one of you to ſhew forth your Thankfulneſs for the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not only with your Lips, but in your Lives: But <hi>Phyſician heal thyſelf,</hi> may juſtly be retorted on me, For (without any falſe Pretences to Humility) I find my own Heart

ſo little inclined to this Duty of Thankſgiving for the Benefits I have received, that I had need fear ſharing <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Fate, who, becauſe he was lifted up by, and not thankful enough for the great Things GOD had done for him, was given up a Prey to the Pride of his own Heart. I need therefore, and beg your moſt importunate Petitions at the Throne of Grace, that no ſuch Evil may befal me,—that the more GOD exalts me, the more I may debaſe myſelf,—and that after I have preached to others, I myſelf may not be a Caſt-away.</p>
                  <p>And now, Brethren, into GOD's Hands I commend your Spirits, who, I truſt, through his infinite Mercies in CHRIST JESUS, will preſerve you blameleſs, till his ſecond Coming to judge the World.</p>
                  <p>Excuſe my detaining you ſo long, it is the laſt Time I ſhall ſpeak to you perhaps; my Heart is full, and out of the abundance of it, I could continue my Diſcourſe till Midnight.—But I muſt away to your new World,—may GOD give you new Hearts, and enable you to put in Practice what you have heard from Time to Time to be your Duty, and I need not wiſh you any Thing better. For then GOD will ſo bleſs you, that <hi>you</hi> will <hi>build you Cities to dwell in;</hi> then will you <hi>ſow your Lands and plant Vineyards,</hi> which will <hi>yield you Fruits of Increaſe,</hi> Pſal. cvii. 36, 37.

In ſhort, then ſhall the LORD be your GOD; and as ſurely as he has now brought us to this Haven, where we would be, ſo ſurely, after we have paſſed through the Storms and Tempeſts of this troubleſome World, will he bring us to the Haven of eternal Reſt, where we ſhall have nothing to do but to praiſe him for ever for his Goodneſs, and declare in never-ceaſing Songs of Praiſe, the Wonders he has done for us, and all the other Sons of Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which bleſſed Reſt,</hi> GOD <hi>of his infinite Mercy bring us all, through</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our LORD; to whom with the</hi> FATHER, <hi>and the</hi> HOLY GHOST, <hi>he all Honour and Glory, Might, Majeſty and Dominion, now, henceforth, and for evermore.</hi>

                     </gap>penſation is evidenced by nothing more, than thoſe Sanctions of Rewards and Puniſhments, which it offers to the Choice of all its Profeſſors, in order to invite or compel them to be obedient to its Precepts.—For it promiſes no leſs than Eternal Happineſs to the Good, and denounces no ſlighter a Puniſhment than Everlaſting Miſery againſt the Wicked. On the one Hand, <hi>it is a Savour of Life unto Life,</hi> on the other, <hi>a Savour of Death unto Death.</hi> And though one would imagine the bare mentioning of the former would be ſufficient to draw Men to their Duty, yet Miniſters in all Ages have found it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary frequently to remind their People of the latter, and to ſet before them the Terrors of the LORD, as ſo many powerful Diſſuaſives from Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="unknown:004650_0198_100DDC757A115370"/>
But whence is it that Men are ſo diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous?—Why, the Reaſon ſeems to be this.—The Promiſe of Eternal Happineſs on our Well-doing, is ſo agreeable to the Inclinations and Wiſhes of Mankind, that all that call themſelves Chriſtians, univerſally and willingly ſubſcribe to the Belief of it. But then there is ſomething ſo ſhocking in the Conſideration of Eternal <hi>Torments,</hi> and ſeemingly ſuch an infinite Diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an endleſs Duration of Pain, and a ſhort Life ſpent in Pleaſure, that Men (ſome at leaſt of them) can ſcarcely be brought to confeſs it as an Article of their Faith, that an Eternity of Miſery awaits the Wicked in a future State.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore at this Time beg Leave, to inſiſt on the Proof of this Part of one of the Articles of our Creed; and endeavour <hi>to make good</hi> what our bleſſed LORD has here threatned in the Words of the Text, that <hi>Theſe,</hi> that is, the <hi>Wicked, ſhall go away into Everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Accordingly, without conſidering the Words as they ſtand in Relation to the Context, I ſhall reſolve all I have to ſay into this one general Propoſition,—<q>That the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are eternal.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I proceed to make good this, I muſt inform you that I take it for granted,</p>
                  <p>All here preſent ſtedfaſtly believe, <q>They have ſomething within them, which we call a Soul, and which is capable of ſurviving the Diſſolution of the Body, and of being miſerable or happy to all Eternity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="unknown:004650_0199_100DDC780CDEFF88"/>
I take it for granted farther, <q>That you believe a Divine Revelation; that thoſe Books, emphatically called <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> were written by the Inſpiration of GOD, and that the Things therein contained, are founded upon Eternal Truth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I take it for granted laſtly, <q>That you believe, that the Son of GOD came down to die for Sinners; that there is but one Mediator between GOD and Man, even the Man CHRIST JESUS.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Things being granted (and they were neceſſary to be premiſed) proceed we now <hi>to make good</hi> the one general Propoſition men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, and aſſerted in the Text, that <q>The Torments reſerved for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after are Eternal.</q>—<hi>Theſe,</hi> ſays <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> LORD, <hi>ſhall go away into Everlaſting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt Argument I ſhall advance to prove that the Torments reſerved for the Wicked here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after are eternal (for I have taken it for granted, that you believe thoſe Books, emphatically called <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> were written by the Inſpiration of GOD, and that the Things contained therein are founded upon Eternal Truth) is, That the Word of GOD himſelf, aſſures us, Line upon Line, that it will be ſo.</p>
                  <p>To quote all the Texts that might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Proof of this, would be endleſs,—Let it ſuffice to inſtance only in a few.—In the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. xii. ver. 2. we are told, that <hi>Some ſhall awake
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:004650_0200_100DDC7B27A805F8"/>
to Everlaſting Life, and others to Everlaſting Contempt.</hi>—In the Book of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>The Worm of thoſe that have tranſgreſſed GOD's Law, ſhall not die, nor their Fire be quenched.</hi>—And in another Place, the Holy Prophet, ſtruck, no doubt, with Aſtoniſhment and Horror at the Proſpect of the Continuance of the Torments of the Damned, breaks out into this moving Expoſtulation, <hi>Who can dwell with Everlaſting Burnings?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is ſtill fuller as to this Point, it being a Revelation which brought this and ſuch-like Particulars to a clear Light.—The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> tells us of the profane Deſpiſers of Dignities in his Days, that <hi>for them was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever.</hi>—And in the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> it is written, that <hi>The Smoke of the Torments of the Wicked aſcendeth for ever and ever</hi>—And if we believe the Witneſs of Men inſpired, the Witneſs of the Son of GOD, who had the Spirit given him, as he was a Mediator, without Meaſure, is ſtill far greater.—And he, in St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats this ſolemn Declaration three ſeveral Times. <hi>It is better for Thee to enter into Life maimed;</hi> that is, it is better to forego the Gratification of thy Luſt, or incur the Diſpleaſure of a Friend, which may be as dear to thee as a Hand, or as uſeful as a Foot, <hi>than having two Hands and Feet,</hi> that is, for indulging the one, or diſobeying GOD to oblige the other, <hi>to be caſt into Hell, where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="unknown:004650_0201_100DDD691CB672D8"/>
And here again, in the Words of the Text, <hi>Theſe,</hi> that is, the Wicked, ſays he, <hi>ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know it has been objected by ſome who have denied the Eternity of Hell Torments, <q>That the Words <hi>Everlaſting</hi> and <hi>Ever and Ever,</hi> are often uſed in the Holy Scriptures, (eſpecially in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi>) when they ſignify not an endleſs Duration, but a limited Term of Time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this we readily grant. But then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <q>That when the Words are uſed with this Limitation, they either manifeſtly appear to be uſed ſo from the Context</q>—or are put in Oppoſition to ſome occaſional Types which <hi>GOD</hi> gave his People on ſome ſpecial Occaſions, as when it is ſaid, <hi>it ſhall be a perpetual or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Statute,</hi> or <hi>a Statute for ever,</hi> that is, a ſtanding Type, and not merely tranſient or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional, as was the <hi>Pillar of Cloud,</hi> the <hi>Manna,</hi> or ſuch like—Or laſtly, they have a Relation, to that Covenant GOD made with his ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which, if underſtood in a ſpiritual Senſe, will be everlaſting, though the Ceremonial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation be aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it ought to be obſerved, that, ſome of the Paſſages juſt now referred to, have neither of theſe Words ſo much as mentioned in them, and cannot poſſibly be interpreted ſo as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note only a limited Term of Years.</p>
                  <p>But let that be as it will, it is evident even to a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>onſtration, that the Words of the Text however, will not admit of ſuch a reſtrained
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:004650_0202_100DD79B133A5D00"/>
Signification, as appears from their being direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed to the Words immediately following, <hi>viz.  That the Righteous ſhall go into Life eternal.</hi> From which Words, all are ready to grant, that the Life promiſed to the Righteous will be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and why the Puniſhment threatned to the Wicked ſhould not be underſtood to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal likewiſe, when the very ſame Word in the Original, is uſed to expreſs the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of each, no Shadow of a Reaſon can be given.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> There cannot be one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment urged, why GOD ſhould reward his Saints with everlaſting Happineſs, which will not equally prove that he ought to puniſh Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with Eternal Miſery.</p>
                  <p>For, ſince we know nothing (at leaſt for a Certainty) how he will deal with either, but by a Divine Revelation; and ſince, as was proved by the foregoing Argument, he hath as poſitively threatned eternally to puniſh the Wicked, as to reward the Good; it follows that his Truth will be as much impeached and called in Queſtion, did he not inflict his Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as it would be, if he did not confer his Rewards.</p>
                  <p>To this alſo it has been objected, <q>That though GOD is obliged by his Promiſe to give his Rewards, yet his Veracity could not be called in Queſtion, ſuppoſing he ſhould not execute his Threatnings, as he actually did not in the Caſe of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> which GOD ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declared by his Prophet <hi>Jonah, ſhould
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:004650_0203_100DD79D83644558"/>
be deſtroyed in Forty Days;</hi> notwithſtanding the Sequel of the Story informs us, that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh</hi> was ſpared.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in anſwer to this Objection we affirm, <q>That GOD's Threatnings, as well as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, are without Repentance.</q>—And for this Reaſon, becauſe they are both founded on the eternal Laws of right Reaſon.—According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we always find, that where the Conditions were not performed, on the Non-performance of which the Threatnings were denounced, GOD always executed the Puniſhment threatned.—The driving <hi>Adam</hi> out of <hi>Eden,</hi>—The Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old World by a Deluge of Water, and the Overthrow of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> are, and will be always ſo many ſtanding Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of GOD's executing his Threatnings when denounced, though, to our weak Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, the Puniſhment may ſeem far to exceed the Crime.</p>
                  <p>It is true, GOD did ſpare <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and that becauſe the Inhabitants did actually repent, and therefore performed the Conditions upon which it was ſuppoſed by the Prophet's being ſent to warn them, the threatned Puniſhment ſhould be with-held.</p>
                  <p>And ſo likewiſe in reſpect to Goſpel Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. If Men will ſo far conſult their own Welfare as to live <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to the Goſpel Terms, GOD certainly will not puniſh them, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary confer upon them his Rewards,—But to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> that HE will not puniſh, and that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> too, impenitent, obſtinate Sinners, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:004650_0204_100DDC7E51DB4618"/>
as he hath threatned, if they do not perform the Terms of the Goſpel, what is it, in Effect, but to make GOD like a Man, that he ſhould lie, or the Son of Man that he ſhould repent?</p>
                  <p>But the Abſurdity of ſuch an Opinion will appear ſtill more evident from</p>
                  <p>The next and <hi>Third</hi> Argument I ſhall offer to prove, <hi>that the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are eternal, viz.</hi> From the Nature of the Chriſtian Covenant.</p>
                  <p>And here I muſt again obſerve, that it was taken for granted at the Beginning of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that, <q>You believe the Son of GOD came down to ſave Sinners; that there is but one Mediator between GOD and Man, even the Man CHRIST JESUS.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I take it for granted farther (unleſs you believe the abſurd and unwarrantable Doctrine of Purgatory) that you are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that this Life is the only Time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted by Almighty GOD for working out our Salvation, and that after a few Years are paſſed over, there will remain no more Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Sin.</p>
                  <p>And if this be granted (and who dares deny it) it follows that if a wicked Man dieth in his Wickedneſs, and under the Wrath of GOD, he muſt continue in that State to all Eternity.—For, ſince there is no Poſſibility of his being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of ſuch a Condition but by and thro' CHRIST; and ſince, at the Hour of Death, the Time of CHRIST'S Mediation and Interceſſion
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:004650_0205_100DDC81315643A8"/>
for him is irrecoverably gone; the ſame Reaſon that may be given, why GOD ſhould puniſh a Sinner that dieth under the Guilt of his Sins for a ſingle Day, will equally hold good, why he ſhould continue to puniſh him for a Year, an Age, nay, to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>But I haſten to the <hi>Fourth,</hi> and laſt Argument, to prove, <hi>That the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal,</hi> viz. <hi>Becauſe the Devil's Puniſhment is to be ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there is ſuch a Being whom we call the <hi>Devil,</hi> that he was once an Angel of Light, but for his Pride and Rebellion againſt GOD was caſt down from Heaven, and is now permitted with the reſt of his ſpiritual Wickedneſſes, to walk to and fro, ſeeking whom they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.—That there is a Place of Torment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for them, or, to uſe the Apoſtle's Words, <hi>that they are reſerved in everlaſting Chains under Darkneſs unto the Judgment of the Great Day,</hi> are Truths all here preſent were ſuppoſed to be convinced of, when it was taken fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> granted under the ſecond Propoſition at the Beginning of this Diſcourſe, that you believed the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> to be written by the Inſpiration of GOD, wherein theſe Truths are delivered.</p>
                  <p>But then if we allow all this, and think it no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in GOD to puniſh thoſe Glorious Spirits for their Rebellion, how can we think it unjuſt in him, to puniſh wicked Men for their Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to all Eternity?</p>
                  <p>You will ſay perhaps, that they have ſinned againſt greater Light, and therefore deſerve a
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:004650_0206_100DDC82B3BAFF08"/>
greater Puniſhment. And ſo we grant that the Puniſhment of the fallen Angles m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> be greater as to Degree, than that of wicked Men. But then we affirm, it will be equal as to the Eternal Duration of it. For in that Day, as the lively Oracles of GOD inform us, ſhall the Son of Man ſay to them on his left Hand, <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed into Everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>—Where we find that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners are to be caſt into the ſame <hi>Everlaſting Fire,</hi> With the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Angels,—And that too very juſtly.—For though they may have ſinned againſt greater Light, yet Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſin againſt greater Mercy. Since CHRIST took not hold of, did not die for the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for Men and for our Salvation. So that if GOD ſpared not thoſe Excellent Beings, aſſure thyſelf, O obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sinner, whoever thou art, he will by no means ſpare thee.</p>
                  <p>From what then has been ſaid it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that verily <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But before I proceed to a practical Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, permit me to draw an Inference or two from what has been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>If the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal,</hi> what ſhall we ſay to thoſe, who make an open Profeſſion in their
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:004650_0207_100DDC8696E73C48"/>
Creed to believe a Life Everlaſting, <hi>i. e.</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>e of Happineſs as well as Miſery, and yet dare to live in the actual Commiſſion of thoſe Sins which will unavoidably, without Repentance, bring them into that Place of Torment? Thou believeſt the Puniſhments of the impenitently wicked in another Life, are Eternal: Thou doeſt well, <hi>The Devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi> But know, O vain Man, unleſs this Belief doth influence thy Practice, and makes thee bid Adieu to thy Sins, every Time thou repeateſt thy Creed, thou doeſt in Effect ſay, I believe I ſhall be undone for ever.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> if the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal, then let this ſerve as a Caution to ſuch Perſons (and it is to be fear'd there are ſome ſuch) who go about to diſſuade others from the Belief of ſuch an important Truth. There being no ſurer Way, in all Probability, to encourage and promote Infidelity and Prophaneneſs, than the broaching or maintaining ſuch an unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrine—For if the poſitive Threats of GOD concerning the Eternity of Hell Torments are already found inſufficient to deter Men from Sin, what a higher Pitch of Wickedneſs may we imagine they will quickly arrive at, when they are taught to entertain any Hopes of a Future Recovery out of them, or, what is ſtill worſe, that their Souls are hereafter to be annihilated, and become like the Beaſts that periſh?—But Woe unto ſuch blind Leaders of the Blind. No Wonder if they both fall
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:004650_0208_100DDC88469E7D10"/>
into the Ditch.—And let ſuch Corrupters of GOD's Word know, that I teſtify unto every Man that heareth me this Day, that if any one ſhall add unto, or take away from the Words that are written in the Book of GOD, GOD ſhall take his Part out of the Book of Life, and ſhall add unto him all the Plagues that are in that Book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> if the Torments reſerved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal, then this may ſerve as a Reproof for thoſe who quarrel with GOD, and ſay it is inconſiſtent with his Juſtice, to puniſh a Perſon to all Eternity, only for enjoying the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon. But ſuch Perſons muſt be told, that it is not their thinking or calling GOD unjuſt, will make him ſo, no more than a condemned Priſoner's ſaying the Law or Judge is unjuſt, will render either duly chargeable with ſuch an Imputation.—But knoweſt thou, O Worm, what Blaſphemy thou are guilty of, in charging GOD with Injuſtice?—<hi>Shall the Thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> And wilt thou preſume to arraign the Almighty at the Bar of thy ſhallow Reaſoning? And call him unjuſt, for puniſhing thee Eternally, only becauſe thou wiſheſt it may not be ſo? But hath GOD ſaid it; and ſhall he not do it? He hath ſaid it: And let GOD be true, tho' every Man be a Liar.—<hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> Aſſuredly he will. And if Sinners will not own his Juſtice in his
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:004650_0209_100DDC8BE6694080"/>
Threatnings here, they will be compell'd e'er long to own and feel them when tormented by him hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But to come to a more practical Application of what has been deliver'd.</p>
                  <p>You have heard, Brethren, the Eternity of Hell-Torments plainly proved, from the expreſs Declarations of Holy Scriptures, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences naturally drawn from them.—And now there ſeems to need no great Art of Rhetorick to perſuade any underſtanding Perſon to avoid and abhor thoſe Sins, which without Repentance will certainly plunge him into thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Eternal Gulph.—The Diſproportion between the Pleaſure and the Pain (if there be any Pleaſure in Sin) is ſo infinitely great, that ſuppoſing it was only poſſible, though not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Wicked would be everlaſtingly puniſhed, no one that has the Reaſon of a Man, for the Enjoying a little momentary Pleaſure, would, one would imagine, run the Hazard of enduring Eternal Pain.—But ſince the Torments of the Damned are not only poſſible, but certain, (ſince GOD himſelf, who cannot lye, has told us ſo) for Men, notwithſtanding to perſiſt in their Diſobedience, and then flatter themſelves that GOD will not make good his Threatnings, is a moſt egregious Inſtance of Folly and Preſumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dives</hi> himſelf ſuppoſed, that if one roſe from the Dead, his Brethren would amend their Lives; but Chriſtians, it ſeems, will not repent, though the SON OF GOD has died

and roſe again, and told them what they muſt expect, if they ſtill continue obſtinate in Evil Doing.</p>
                  <p>Would we now and then draw off our Thoughts from ſenſible Objects, and by Faith meditate a while on the Miſeries of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I doubt not but we ſhould, as it were, hear many an unhappy Soul venting his fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sorrows in ſome ſuch piteous Moans as theſe.</p>

Firſt to delude me with pretended Promiſes of Happineſs, and after ſeveral Years Drudgery in his Service, thus to involve me in Eternal Woe.—Oh that I had never hearkened to his beguiling Inſinuations! Oh that I had rejected his very firſt Suggeſtions with the utmoſt Deteſtation and Abhorrence! Oh that I had taken up my Croſs and followed CHRIST! Oh that I had never ridiculed ſerious Godlineſs; and out of a falſe Politeneſs, condemned the truly Pious, as too Severe, Enthuſiaſtick, or Superſtitious! For I then had been happy

indeed, happy beyond Expreſſion, happy to all Eternity yonder in thoſe bleſſed Regions where they ſit, cloathed with unſpeakable Glory, and chanting forth their Seraphick Hallelujahs to the Lamb that ſitteth upon the Throne, for ever.—But, alas! theſe Reflections come now too late: Theſe Wiſhes now are vain and fruitleſs.

                  </p>
                  <p>Come then, all ye ſelf-deluding, ſelf-deluded Sinners, and imagine yourſelves for once in the Place of that truly wretched Man I have been here deſcribing.—Think, I beſeech you by the Mercies of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, think with yourſelves, how racking, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable the never dying Worm of a ſelf-condemning Conſcience will hereafter be to you.

Come, all ye <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of a Lukewarm <hi>Laodicean</hi> Spirit, ye <hi>Gallio'</hi>s in Religion, who care a little, but not enough for the Things of GOD, O think, think with yourſelves how deplorable it will be to loſe the Enjoyment of Heaven, and run into endleſs Torments, merely becauſe you will be content to be <hi>almoſt,</hi> and will not ſtrive to be <hi>altogether Chriſtians.</hi>—Conſider, I beſeech you, conſider, how you will rave, and curſe that fatal Stupidity, that made you believe any Thing leſs than a Life of ſtrict Piety, Self-Denial, and Mortification, can keep you from thoſe Torments, the Eternity of which I have been endeavouring to prove.</p>
                  <p>But I can no more—Theſe Thoughts are too melancholly for me to dwell on, as well as for you to hear, and GOD knows, as Puniſhing is his ſtrange Work, ſo denouncing his Threatnings is mine. But if the bare mentioning the Torments of the Damned is ſo ſhocking, Good GOD! how terrible muſt the enduring of them be!</p>
                  <p>And now are not ſome of you ready to cry out, <hi>Theſe are hard Sayings, who can bear them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let not ſincere <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be in the leaſt terrified at what has been delivered.

Take heed therefore, and beware that there be not in any of you a Root of Bitterneſs ſpringing up of Unbelief.

                  <p>But let no obſtinately wicked Profeſſors dare to apply any of the Divine Promiſes to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>For it is not meet to take the Childrens Bread and give it unto Dogs,</hi> No, to ſuch the Terrors of the LORD only belong.

                  <head>DIRECTIONS how to hear SERMONS.</head>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>LUKE viii. 18.</bibl>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Take Heed therefore how you hear.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE Occaſion of our LORD's giving this Caution was this: Perceiving that much People were gathered together, to hear him, out of every City, and knowing (for he is GOD, and knoweth all Things) that many, if not moſt of them, would be Hearers only, and not Doers of the Word, he ſpake to them by a Parable, wherein, under the Similitude of a Sower, that went out to ſow his Seed, he plainly intimated how few there were amongſt them who would receive any ſaving Benefit from his Doctrine, or bring forth Fruit unto Perfection.</p>
                  <p>The Application, one would imagine, ſhould be plain and obvious: But the Diſciples, as yet unenlightened in any great Degree by the Holy Spirit, and therefore unable to ſee into the hidden Myſteries of the Kingdom of GOD, dealt with our Saviour, as People ought to deal with their Miniſters,—diſcourſed with him
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:004650_0215_100DDC9DA136EA18"/>
privately about the Meaning of what he had taught them in Publick, and with a ſincere Deſire of doing their Duty, asked for an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Parable.</p>
                  <p>Our bleſſed LORD, as he always was willing to inſtruct thoſe that were teachable (herein ſetting his Miniſters an Example to be courteous and eaſy of Acceſs) freely told them the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it. And withal, to make them more cautious and more attentive to his Doctrine for the future, He tells them, that they were in an eſpecial Manner to be the Light of the World, and were to proclaim on the Houſe-Top what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he told them in Secret. And as their improving the Knowledge already imparted, was the only Condition upon which more was to be given them, it therefore highly concerned them to <hi>take heed how they heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Context then it appears, that the Words were primarily ſpoken to the Apoſtles themſelves. But becauſe they were the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the whole Church, and 'tis to be feared out of thoſe many Thouſands that flock to hear Sermons, but few comparatively ſpeaking are effectually influenced by them; I cannot but think it very neceſſary to remind you of the Caution given by our LORD to his Diſciples, and to exhort you with the utmoſt Earneſtneſs to <hi>take heed how you hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Proſecution of which Deſign I ſhall in the following Diſcourſe,
<list>
                        <item>I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Prove that every one ought to take all Opportunities of hearing Sermons. And,</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="212" facs="unknown:004650_0216_100DDC9F722CBDE8"/>
II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall lay down ſome Cautions and Directions, in order to your hearing them with Profit and Advantage.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. And, <hi>Firſt;</hi> I am to prove that every one ought to take all Opportunities of hearing Sermons.</p>
                  <p>That there have always been particular Perſons ſet apart by GOD to inſtruct and exhort his People to practice what he ſhould require of them, is evident from many Paſſages of Scripture.—St. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us, that <hi>Enoch</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam</hi> propheſied, or preached, concerning the LORD's coming with ten Thouſand of his Saints to Judgment. And <hi>Noah,</hi> who lived not long after, is ſtiled by St. <hi>Peter, a Preacher of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> And though in all the intermediate Space between the Flood and Giving of the Law, we hear but of few Preachers, yet we may reaſonably conclude, that GOD never left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without Witneſs, but at ſundry Times, and after divers Manners, ſpoke to our Fathers by the Patriarchs and Prophets.</p>
                  <p>But however it was before, we are aſſured that after the Delivery of the Law, GOD has conſtantly ſeparated to himſelf a certain Order of Men to preach to, as well as pray for, his People; and commanded them to enquire their Duty at the Prieſts Mouths. And though the <hi>Jews</hi> were frequently led into Captivity, and for their Sins ſcattered abroad through the Face of the Earth, yet he never utterly forſook his Church, but ſtill kept up a Remnant of Prophets and Preachers, as <hi>Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel,</hi>
                     <pb n="213" facs="unknown:004650_0217_100DDCA40CC3DE38"/>
and others, to reprove, inſtruct, and call them to Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Thus was it under the Law. Nor has the Church been worſe, but infinitely better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for under the Goſpel: For when JESUS CHRIST, that great High Prieſt, had through the Eternal Spirit offered himſelf as a full, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole World, and after his Reſurrection had all Power committed to him both in Heaven and Earth, he gave Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, and in them to all ſucceeding Miniſters, to go and preach his Goſpel to every Creature; promiſing to be with them, to guide, aſſiſt, ſtrengthen and comfort them <hi>always, even to the End of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if it be the Duty of Miniſters to preach (and Woe be to them if they do not preach the Goſpel, for a Neceſſity is laid upon them) no doubt, the People are obliged to attend to them; for otherwiſe, wherefore are Miniſters ſent?</p>
                  <p>And how can we here avoid admiring the Love and tender Care which our dear Redeemer has expreſſed for his Spouſe the Church? Who, becauſe he could not be always with us in Perſon, on account it was expedient he ſhould go away, and as our Fore-runner take Poſſeſſion of that Glory he had purchaſed by his precious Blood, yet would not leave us comfortleſs, but firſt ſettled a ſufficient Number of Paſtors and Teachers, and afterwards, according to his Promiſe, actually did and will continue to ſend down the Holy Ghoſt to furniſh them and their Succeſſors with
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:004650_0218_100DDCA58EBF3138"/>
proper Gifts and Graces for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of his Body in Love, till we all come in the Unity of the Spirit, to the Fulneſs of the Meaſure of the Stature of CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Oh! how inſenſible are thoſe of this unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Gift, who do deſpite to the Spirit of Grace, who crucify the Son of GOD afreſh, and put him to an open Shame, by wilfully refuſing to attend on ſo great a Means of their Salvation? How dreadful will the End of ſuch Men be? How aggravating, that Light ſhould come into the World, that the glad Tidings of Salvation ſhould be ſo very frequently proclaimed in this City, and that ſo many ſhould loath this ſpiritual Manna, this Angels Food, and call it light Bread? How much more tolerable will it be for <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> than for ſuch Sinners? For better Men had never heard of a Saviour's being born, than after they have heard, not to give heed to the Miniſtry of thoſe, who are employed as his Ambaſſadors, to tranſact Affairs between GOD and their Souls.</p>
                  <p>We may, though at a Diſtance, without a Spirit of Propheſy, foretel the deplorable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Men; and behold them caſt into Hell, lifting up their Eyes, being in Torment, and crying out, How often would our Miniſters have <hi>gathered</hi> us, <hi>as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings!—But we would not.—Oh that we had known in that our Day, the Things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to our everlaſting Peace!—But now they are for ever hid from our Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

Thus wretched, thus inconceivably miſerable, will ſuch be as ſlight and make a Mock at the publick Preaching of the Goſpel.—But taking it for granted, there are but few, if any, of this unhappy Stamp, who think it not worth their while to tread the Courts of the LORD's Houſe, I paſs on now to the</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Second</hi> general Thing propoſed,—To lay down ſome Cautions and Directions, in order to your hearing Sermons with Profit and Advantage.</p>
                  <p>And here, if we reflect on what has been already delivered, and conſider that Preaching is an Ordinance of GOD, a Means appointed by JESUS CHRIST himſelf, for promoting his Kingdom amongſt Men, you cannot reaſonably be offended, if, in order that you may hear Sermons with Profit and Advantage, I</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> direct or intreat you to come to hear them, not out of Curioſity, but from a ſincere Deſire to know and do your Duty.</p>
                  <p>Formality and Hypocriſy in any religious Exerciſe is an Abomination unto the LORD. And to enter his Houſe merely to have our Ears entertained, and not our Hearts reformed, muſt certainly be highly diſpleaſing to the Moſt High GOD, as well as unprofitable to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that ſo many remain Unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yea, Unaffected with the moſt Evangelical Preaching; ſo that like St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Companions, they only hear the Preacher's Voice with their outward Ears, but do not experience the Power of it inwardly in their Hearts. Or like the
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:004650_0220_100DDCA9F498BCA8"/>
Ground near <hi>Gideon'</hi>s Fleece, they remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched; whilſt others that came to be fed with the ſincere Milk of the Word, like the Fleece itſelf, are watered by the Dew of GOD's Heavenly Bleſſing, and grow thereby.</p>
                  <p>Flee therefore, my Brethren, flee Curioſity; and prepare your Hearts by a humble Diſpoſition to receive with Meekneſs the engrafted Word, and then it will be a Means, under GOD, to quicken, build up, purify, and ſave your Souls.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Direction I ſhall lay down for the ſame Purpoſe, is, not only to prepare your Hearts before you hear, but alſo to give diligent heed to the Things that are ſpoken, whilſt you are hearing the Word of GOD.</p>

                  <p>When GOD deſcended on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in terrible Majeſty, to give unto his People the Law, how attentive were they to his Servant <hi>Moſes?</hi> And if they were ſo earneſt to hear the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings or Threatnings of the Law, ſhall not we be as ſollicitous to hear from the Miniſters of CHRIST, the glad Tidings of the Goſpel?</p>

Whilſt CHRIST was himſelf on Earth, it is ſaid, that the People hung upon him to hear the gracious Words that proceeded out of his Mouth.

                  <p>But how regardleſs are thoſe of this Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who inſtead of hanging on the Preacher to hear him, doze or ſleep whilſt he is ſpeaking to them from GOD?

What; Have they never read how <hi>Eutichus</hi> fell down as he was ſleeping, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his Diſcourſe till Midnight, and was taken up dead?</p>
                  <p>But to return. Though you may prepare your Hearts, as you may think, by a teachable Diſpoſition, and be attentive whilſt Diſcourſes are delivering, yet this will profit you little, unleſs you obſerve a</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third</hi> Direction,—not to entertain any the leaſt Prejudice againſt the Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>For could a Preacher ſpeak with the Tongu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Men and Angels, if his Audience was
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:004650_0222_100DDCB02AAC3990"/>
prejudiced againſt him, he would be but as a ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal.</p>
                  <p>That was the Reaſon why JESUS CHRIST himſelf, the eternal Word, could not do many mighty Works, nor preach to any great Effect among thoſe of his own Country; for they were offended at him. And was this ſame JESUS, this GOD incarnate again to bow the Heavens, and to come down ſpeaking as never Man ſpake; yet if we were prejudiced againſt him, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, we ſhould harden our Hearts as the <hi>Jews</hi> did theirs.</p>
                  <p>Take Heed therefore, my Brethren, and beware of entertaining any Diſlike againſt thoſe whom the Holy Ghoſt has made Overſeers over you. Conſider that the Clergy are Men of like Paſſions with yourſelves. And though we ſhould even hear a Perſon teaching others to do, what he has not taught himſelf; yet that is no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reaſon for rejecting his Doctrine. For Miniſters ſpeak not in their own, but CHRIST'S Name. And we know who commanded the People to do whatſoever the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> ſhould ſay unto them, though they ſaid but did not.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> as you ought not be prejudiced againſt, ſo you ſhould be careful not to depend too much on a Preacher, or think more highly of him than you ought to think. For though this be an Extreme that People ſeldom run into; yet preferring one Teacher, in Oppoſition to another, has often been of ill Conſequence to the Church of GOD.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="unknown:004650_0223_100DDCB2DA4CE518"/>
That, we read, was a Fault which the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> condemned in the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians:</hi> For whereas one ſaid, I am of <hi>Paul;</hi> another, I am of <hi>Apollos:</hi> Are ye not Carnal, ſays he? For who is <hi>Paul,</hi> and who is <hi>Apollos,</hi> but Inſtruments in GOD's Hand by whom you believed? And are not all Miniſters ſent forth to be miniſtring Ambaſſadors to thoſe who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation? And are they not all therefore greatly to be eſteemed for their Work's Sake?</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle, it is true, commands us to pay double Honour to thoſe who labour in the Word and Doctrine. But then to prefer one Miniſter at the Expence of another (perhaps to ſuch a Degree, as when you have actually entered a Church, to come out again, becauſe he does not preach) is earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh.</p>
                  <p>Not to mention that Popularity and Applauſe cannot but be exceeding dangerous even to a rightly informed Mind; and muſt neceſſarily fill any thinking Man with a holy Jealouſy, left he ſhould take that Honour to himſelf, which is due only to GOD; who alone qualifies him for his Miniſterial Labours, and from whom alone every good and perfect Gift cometh.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> Direction I would recommend is, to make a particular Application of every Thing that is delivered, to your own Hearts.</p>
                  <p>When our Saviour was diſcourſing at his laſt Supper with his beloved Diſciples, and foretold that one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ſhould betray him, each of them immediately applied it to his own Heart, and
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:004650_0224_100DDCB461FB5358"/>
ſaid, <hi>LORD, Is it I?</hi> And would Perſons in lik Manner, when Preachers are diſſuading from any Vice, or perſuading to any Virtue, inſtead of crying, this was deſigned againſt ſuch and ſuch a one, turn their Thoughts inwardly, and ſay, <hi>LORD, Is it I?</hi> How far more beneficial ſhould we find Diſcourſes to be, than they generally are now?</p>
                  <p>But we are apt to wander too much abroad: Always looking at the Mote which is in our Neighbour's Eye, rather than the Beam which is in our own.</p>
                  <p>Haſte we now to the <hi>Sixth</hi> and laſt Direction: If you would receive a Bleſſing from the LORD, when you hear his Word preached, pray to him, both before, in, and after every Sermon, to endue the Miniſter with Power to ſpeak, and to grant you a Will and Ability to put in Practice what he ſhall ſhew from the Book of GOD to be your Duty.</p>
                  <p>This would be an excellent Means to render the Word preached effectual to the Enlightning and Enflaming your Hearts, and without this all the other Means before preſcribed will be in vain.</p>
                  <p>No doubt it was this Conſideration that made St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly intreat his beloved <hi>Epheſians</hi> to intercede with GOD for him,—<hi>Praying always,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with all Manner of Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit; and for me alſo, that I may open my Mouth with Boldneſs, to make known the Myſteries of the Goſpel.</hi> And if ſo great an Apoſtle as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> needed the Prayers
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:004650_0225_100DDCB841619788"/>
of his People, much more do thoſe Miniſters, who have only the ordinary Gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, this would be a good Proof that you ſincerely deſired to do as well as know the Will of GOD: And it muſt highly profit both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and People; becauſe GOD through your Prayers will give them a double Portion of his Holy Spirit, whereby they will be enabled to inſtruct you more fully in the Things which pertain to the Kingdom of GOD.</p>
                  <p>And oh! that all that hear me this Day would ſeriouſly apply their Hearts to practiſe what has now been told them!—How would Miniſters ſee Satan like Lightning fall from Heaven, and People find the Word preached ſharper than a two-edged Sword, and mighty through GOD to the pulling down of the Devil's ſtrong Holds!</p>
                  <p>The Holy Ghoſt would then fall on all them that heard the Word; as when St. <hi>Peter</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Goſpel of CHRIST would have free Courſe, run very ſwiftly, and Thouſands again be converted by a Sermon.</p>
                  <p>For JESUS CHRIST, is the ſame Yeſterday, to Day, and for ever. He has promiſed to be with his Miniſters always, even unto the End of the World. And the Reaſon why we do not receive larger Effuſions of the bleſſed Spirit of GOD, is not, becauſe our All-powerful Redeemer's Hand is ſhortned, but becauſe we are not prepared to receive them, and becauſe we do not expect them, but confine them to the Primitive Times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="unknown:004650_0226_100DDCB9C3A1A060"/>
It does indeed ſometimes happen that GOD to magnify his Free Grace in CHRIST JESUS, is found of them that ſought him not; a notorious Sinner is forcibly worked upon by a publick Sermon, and plucked as a Fire-brand out of the Fire. But this is not GOD's ordinary Way of acting. No; for the Generality, he only viſits thoſe with the Power of his Word, who humbly wait to know what he would have them to do. And ſends unqualified Hearers not only empty, but hardened, away.</p>
                  <p>Take heed, therefore, ye careleſs, curious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, if any ſuch be here preſent, how you hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Remember that, whether we think of it or not, we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST, where Miniſters muſt give a ſtrict Account of the Doctrine they have delivered, and you as ſtrict a one, how you have improved under it. And good GOD! how will you be able to ſtand at the Bar of an angry, Sin-avenging Judge, and ſee ſo many Diſcourſes you have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, ſo many Miniſters who once longed and laboured for the Salvation of your precious and immortal Souls, brought out as ſo many ſwift Witneſſes againſt you? Will it be ſufficient then, think you, to alledge that you went to hear them only out of Curioſity, to paſs away an idle Hour, to admire the Oratory, or ridicule the Simplicity of the Preacher? No, GOD will then let you know, that you ought to have come out of better Principles, that every Sermon has been put down to your Account, and that you muſt then be juſtly puniſhed for not improving by them.</p>

nay a Thouſand times more concerned for their Well-being in a future State.</p>
                  <p>And there is ſtill the more Occaſion for ſuch an Alarm, becauſe Worldly-mindedneſs ſo eaſily and craftily beſets the Hearts of Men. For out of a ſpecious Pretence of ſerving GOD in labouring for the Meat which periſheth, they are inſenſibly lulled into ſuch a ſpiritual Slumber, as ſcarce to perceive their Neglect to ſecure that which endureth to everlaſting Life.</p>
                  <p>The Words of the Text, if not at firſt View, yet when examined and explained, will be found applicable to this Caſe, as containing an admirable Caution not to purſue the Affairs of this World at the Expence of our Happineſs in the next.</p>
                  <p>They are Words of JESUS CHRIST himſelf: The Occaſion of their being ſpoken was this,—As he was converſing with thoſe that were gathered round about him, he gave one of them an immediate Summons to follow him: But he, either afraid to go after ſuch a perſecuted Maſter, or rather loving this preſent World, ſays, <hi>Suffer me firſt to go home and bury my Father,</hi> or, as moſt explain it, <hi>Let me firſt go and diſpatch ſome important Buſineſs I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004650_0233_100DDCCC4B7E3708"/>
Whether this Perſon did as he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, I know not; but this I know,—That what CHRIST ſaid here in Perſon, he has often whiſpered with the ſmall ſtill Voice of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and ſaid to many here preſent, that riſe up early and late, take Reſt and eat the Bread of Carefulneſs, Come draw off your Affections from the Things of this Life, take up your Croſs and follow me. But they, willing to juſtify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, make Anſwer, <hi>LORD ſuffer us firſt to bury our Fathers,</hi> to diſpatch our ſecular Affairs. I ſay unto all ſuch, <hi>Let the Dead bury their Dead,</hi> let your Worldly Buſineſs be left undone rather than you ſhould neglect to follow him.</p>
                  <p>From the Words thus explained naturally ariſes this Propoſition,—That no Buſineſs, tho ever ſo important, can juſtify a Neglect of true Religion:</p>
                  <p>The Truth of which I ſhall firſt ſhew, and then make an Application of it.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I am to prove that no temporal Buſineſs, though ever ſo important, can juſtify a Neglect of <hi>true Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Word <hi>Religion</hi> I do not mean any Set of moral Vertues, and partial Amendment of ourſelves, or formal Attendance on any outward Duties whatſoever: but a thorough real Change of Nature wrought in us by the inviſible, yet powerful Operation of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> preſerved and nouriſhed in our Souls by a conſtant Uſe of all the Means of Grace, evidenced by a good Life, and bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit.</p>

This is the true and undefiled Religion, and for the perfecting this good Work in our Hearts, the eternal Son of GOD came down and ſhed his precious Blood; for this End were we made, and ſent into the World, and by this alone can we become the Sons of GOD. Were we indeed to judge by the common Practice of the World, we might think we were ſent into it for no other Purpoſe than to care and toil for the uncertain Riches of this Life: But if we conſult the lively Oracles, they will inform us, that we were born for nobler Ends,—to be born again from above,—to be reſtored to the Divine Likeneſs by JESUS CHRIST our Second <hi>Adam,</hi> and thereby be made meet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Some indeed are for confining Religion to the Clergy, and think it only belongs to thoſe who ſerve at the Altar: But what a fatal Miſtake is this, ſeeing all Perſons are indifferently called by GOD to the ſame State of inward Holineſs? As we are all corrupt in our Nature, ſo muſt we all be renewed and ſanctified. And though it muſt be granted, that the Clergy lie under double Obligations to be Examples to Believers in Faith, Zeal, Charity, and whatever elſe is commendable and of good Report, as being more immediately dedicated to the Service of

                  <p>But farther, one would imagine there was ſomething of the higheſt Concern and utmoſt Importance in our temporal Affairs, that they ſhould divert ſo many from purifying their Hearts by Faith which is in CHRIST JESUS.</p>

                  <p>And now what need we any farther Proof? We have heard the Deciſion out of CHRIST'S own Mouth. But becauſe it is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of this important Truth, whoſe Hearts are blinded by the Deceitfulneſs of Riches, ſo that we had need cry out to them in the Language of the Prophet, <hi>O Earth, Earth, Earth, hear the Word of the LORD.</hi> I ſhall lay before you one Paſſage of Scripture more, which I could wiſh were written on the Tables of all our Hearts. In the xivth of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the 18th and following Verſes, our bleſſed LORD puts forth this Parable,—<hi>A certain Man made a great Supper, and bad many, and ſent his Servant at Supper, Time, to call them that were bidden: But they all, with one Conſent, began to make Excuſe. The one ſaid, I have bought a Piece of Ground, and I muſt needs go ſee it, I pray thee have me excuſed.

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004650_0238_100DDCD92CEEE248"/>
cannot juſtify our Neglect, nay, that they are no longer lawful when they in any wiſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the great Concerns of Religion? For the Marriage Supper here ſpoken of, means the Goſpel; the Maſter of the Houſe is CHRIST; the Servants ſent out, are his Miniſters, whoſe Duty it is from time to time, to call the People to this Marriage Feaſt, or, in other Words, to be religious. Now we find thoſe that were bidden, were very well and honeſtly employed. There was no Harm in buying or ſeeing a Piece of Ground, or in going to prove a Yoke of Oxen; but here lay their Fault,—They were doing theſe Things when they were invited to come to the Marriage Feaſt.</p>
                  <p>Without doubt, Perſons may very honeſtly and commendably be employed in following their reſpective Callings; but yet, if they are engaged ſo deeply in theſe, as to hinder their working out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling, they muſt expect the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with their Predeceſſors in the Parable, that none of them ſhall taſte of CHRIST'S Supper; for our particular Calling, as of this or that Profeſſion, muſt never interfere with our general and precious Calling as we are Chriſtians. Not that Chriſtianity calls us entirely out of the World, the Holy Scriptures warrant no ſuch Doctrine.</p>

ſo many Lights in the World. Thus we hear of a good <hi>Centurion</hi> in the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and a Devout <hi>Cornelius</hi> in the <hi>Acts;</hi> a Pious Lawyer; and ſome that walked with GOD, even of <hi>Nero'</hi>s Houſhold, in the <hi>Epiſtles;</hi> and our Divine Maſter himſelf in his Check to <hi>Martha,</hi> does not condemn her for minding, but for being cumbered or perplexed about many Things.</p>
                  <p>No, you may, nay, you muſt labour, out of Obedience to GOD, even for the Meat which periſheth. But then, that I may in the <hi>Second</hi> Place apply what has been ſaid,</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you, by the Mercies of GOD, in CHRIST JESUS, let it not be at the Expence of that which endureth to everlaſting Life; for to repeat our Bleſſed Saviour's Words, <hi>What ſhall it profit a Man, if he ſhall gain the whole World and loſe his own Soul; or, What ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were we always to live in the World, then worldly Wiſdom would be our higheſt Wiſdom: But foraſmuch as we have here no continuing City, and were only ſent into this World to have our Natures changed, and to fit ourſelves for that which is to come; then to neglect this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Work for a little worldly Gain, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Alas! how unlike are Chriſtians to Chriſtianity, they are commanded to <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of GOD and his Righteouſneſs, and all</hi> other real Neceſſaries <hi>ſhall be added unto them;</hi> but

they are fearful <hi>(O Men of little Faith)</hi> if they ſhould do ſo, all other Neceſſaries would be taken from them: They are ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to be careful for the Morrow, and yet they reſt not Night or Day, but are continually heaping up Riches for many Years, tho' they know not who ſhall gather them. Is this acting like Perſons that are Strangers and Pilgrims upon Earth? Is this keeping their Baptiſmal Vow? Or rather, Is it not directly apoſtatizing from it, and deſerting the Service of JESUS CHRIST, to liſt themſelves under the Banner of <hi>Mammon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what will be the Hope of ſuch World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, when GOD ſhall take away their Souls? What if the Almighty ſhould ſay to each of them, as he did to the rich Fool in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>This Night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee;</hi> Oh then, what would all thoſe Things profit them, which they are now ſo buſy in providing?</p>
                  <p>Was Eternal Life, that free Gift of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, to be purchaſed with Money; or could Men carry their Stocks beyond the Grave to buy Oyl for their Lamps, <hi>i. e.</hi> Grace for their Hearts, when they ſhould be call'd to meet the Bridegroom, there might be ſome Reaſon why GOD might well bear with them: But ſince their Money is to periſh with them: ſince it is certain, as they brought nothing into the World, ſo they can carry nothing out; or ſuppoſing they could, ſince there is no Oyl to be bought, <hi>i. e.</hi> no Grace to be purchaſed

when once the Lamp of their natural Life is gone out; Would it not be much more prudent to ſpend the ſhort Time they have here allotted them in buying Oyl while it may be had, and not for Fear of having a little leſs of that which will quickly be another Man's, eternally loſe the true Riches?</p>

Alas! how will they bemoan themſelves for acting like the unjuſt Steward, ſo very wiſely in their temporal Concerns, in calling their reſpective Creditors ſo carefully, and asking how much every one owes to them, and yet never remembring to call themſelves to an Account, or enquire how much they owed their own Great LORD and Maſter?</p>
                  <p>And now what ſhould I ſay more? The God of this World, and the inordinate Deſire of other Things, muſt have wholly ſtifled the Conſcience of that Man, who does not ſee the Force of theſe plain reaſonings.</p>
                  <p>Permit me only to add a Word or two to the Rich, and Perſons that are freed from the Buſineſs of this Life.</p>
                  <p>But here I muſt pauſe a while, for I am ſenſible that it is but an ungrateful, and, as ſome may imagine, an aſſuming Thing, for ſuch a Novice in Religion to take upon him to inſtruct Men in high Stations, and who perhaps would diſdain to ſet me with the Dogs of their Flock.</p>
                  <p>But however, ſince St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who knew what beſt became a young Preacher, commanded <hi>Timothy,</hi> young as he was, to exhort and charge the Rich with all Authority. I hope none here that are ſo will be offended, if with Humility I beg leave to remind them, tho' they once knew, that if Perſons in the moſt buſy Employs are indiſpenſably obliged to <hi>work out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling,</hi> much more ought they to do ſo, who are free from

                  <p>But is this really the Caſe, or do we not find by fatal Experience that too many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But woe unto ſuch rich Men! for they have received their Conſolation. Happy had it been if they had never been born: For if the careleſs irreligious Tradeſman cannot be ſaved, where will the luxurious and wicked Gentlemen appear?</p>
                  <p>Let me therefore, by way of Concluſion, exhort all Perſons, High and Low, Rich and Poor, one with another, to make the Renewal of their fallen Nature, the one Buſineſs of their Lives, and to let no worldly Profit, no worldly Pleaſure divert them from the Thoughts if it. Let this Cry, <hi>Behold the Bridegroom cometh,</hi> be ever ſounding in our Ears; and let us live as Creatures that are every Moment liable to be hurried away by Death to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Let us remember that this Life is a State of infinite Importance, a Point between two Eternities, and that after theſe few Days

are ended, there will remain no more Sacrifice for Sin; let us be often asking ourſelves, How we ſhall wiſh we had lived when we leave the World? And then we ſhall always live in ſuch a State as we ſhall never fear to die in. So that whether we live, we ſhall live unto the LORD; or whether we die, we ſhall die unto the LORD; ſo that living or dying we may be the LORD's.</p>
                  <p>To which End, Let us beſeech GOD, the Protector of all them that put their Truſt in him, without whom nothing is ſtrong, nothing is holy, to increaſe and multiply upon us his Mercy, that he being our Ruler and Guide, we may ſo paſs through Things Temporal, that we finally loſe not the Things Eternal; through JESUS CHRIST, our LORD.</p>

                  <p>TWO Conſtructions have been given us of theſe Words; ſome have ſuppoſed, that the Queſtion here put, is, Whether theſe Diſciples, whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> found at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> after he had paſſed through the upper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>tion of Hands at Confirmation.—Others think, that theſe Diſciples had been already baptiſed into <hi>John'</hi>s Baptiſm; but that not being attended with an immediate Effuſion of the Holy Spirit, the Apoſtle here asks them, <hi>Whether they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Holy Ghoſt by being baptiſed into</hi> JESUS CHRIST? And upon their anſwering in the Negative, he firſt baptiſed, and then confirmed them in the Name of the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</p>

                     <item>II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall lay down ſome Scripture Marks, whereby we may know, <hi>Whether we have thus received the Holy Ghoſt, or not.</hi>

                  <p>I. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to ſhew who the Holy Ghoſt, ſpoken of in the Text is; and how we muſt all receive him ere we can be ſtiled <hi>True Believers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Holy Ghoſt here ſpoken of, is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Holy Spirit,—the third Perſon in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bleſſed Trinity,—conſubſtantial and coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with the Father and the Son,—proceeding from, yet equal to them both.—He is emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally called <hi>Holy,</hi> becauſe infinitely Holy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Author and Finiſher of all Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us.</p>
                  <p>This bleſſed Spirit, who once moved on the Face of the great Deep, who overſhadowed the Bleſſed Virgin before that Holy Thing was born of her, who deſcended in a bodily Shape like a Dove on our Bleſſed LORD, when he came up out of the Water at his Baptiſm; and lighted afterwards in fiery Tongues on the Heads of all his Apoſtles at the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> this is the Holy Ghoſt, who muſt move on the Faces
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004650_0247_100DDCF19E380DB0"/>
of our Souls; this Power of the Moſt High muſt come upon us, and we muſt be baptiſed with his Baptiſm and refining Fire, before we can be ſtiled True Members of its myſtical Body.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt is in you?</hi> that is, by his Spirit, <hi>unleſs you are Reprobates?</hi> Now if any Man hath not the Spirit of CHRIST, he is none of his.—And again, ſays St. <hi>John, We know that we are his by the Spirit that he hath given us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not indeed neceſſary that we ſhould have it now given in that miraculous Manner in which it was at firſt given to our LORD's Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, by Signs and Wonders.—But it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary that we ſhould receive the Holy Ghoſt in his ſanctifying Graces as really as they did, and ſo will it continue to be till the End of the World.</p>
                  <p>For thus ſtands the Caſe between GOD and Man.—GOD at firſt made Man upright, or as the ſacred Penman expreſſes it, <hi>In the Image of GOD made he Man,</hi> that is, his Soul was the very Copy, the Tranſcript of the Divine Nature.—He that before had by his Almighty F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at ſpoke the World into Being, breathed into Man the Breath of ſpiritual Life, and his Soul became adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity.—This was the finiſhing Stroke of the Creation: The Perfection both of the moral and material World,—and ſo near reſembled its Divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that GOD could not but rejoyce, and take Pleaſure in his own Likeneſs—And therefore we read, that when GOD had finiſhed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004650_0248_100DDCF53090B570"/>
and brutiſh Part of the Creation, he looked upon it, and behold it was <hi>Good;</hi> but when that lovely Godlike Creature, <hi>Man,</hi> was made, behold it was <hi>very Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Happy then, unſpeakably happy muſt Man needs be, who was thus Partaker of the Divine Nature; and thus might. we have ſtill continued, had he ſtill continued Holy.—But GOD had placed him in a State of Probation, with a free Grant to eat of every Tree in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> except the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.—The Day he did eat thereof he was ſurely to die; that is, not only to be ſubject to temporal, but ſpiritual Death, and conſequently to loſe that Divine Image, that ſpiritual Life GOD had not long ſince breathed into him, and which was as much his Happineſs as his Glory.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, one would imagine, were eaſy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions for a finite Creature's Happineſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on. But Man, unhappy Man, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Devil, and deſiring like him, to be equal with his Maker, eat of the forbidden Fruit, and thereby became liable to that Curſe which the Eternal GOD, who cannot lie, had denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt his Diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly we read, that ſoon after <hi>Adam</hi> had fallen, he complained that he was naked.—Naked not only as to his Body, but Naked and left deſtitute of thoſe Divne Graces, which before decked and beautified his Soul.—The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Mutiny and Diſorder which the viſible Creation fell into, thoſe Briars and Thorns which now ſprung up and overſpread the Earth,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004650_0249_100DDCF6B6545340"/>
were but poor Emblems, but lifeleſs Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of that Confuſion and Rebellion, thoſe divers Luſts and Paſſions which ſprung up in, and quite overwhelmed the Soul of Man imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Fall.—Alas! he was now no longer the Image of the inviſible GOD; but as he had imitated the Devil's Sin, he became Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Devil's Nature, and from an Union with, ſunk into a State of direct Enmity againſt GOD.</p>
                  <p>Now in this dreadful diſordered Condition are all of us brought into the World.—For as the Root is, ſuch muſt the Branches be.—According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are told, that <hi>Adam</hi> begat a Son in his own Likeneſs, that is with the ſame corrupt Nature which he himſelf had ſunk into after he had eaten the forbidden Fruit. And Experience, as well as Scripture proves, that we alſo are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together born in Sin and Corruption, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uncapable, whilſt in ſuch a State, to hold Communion with GOD.—For as Light cannot have Communion with Darkneſs, ſo GOD can have no Communion with ſuch polluted Sons of <hi>Belial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then appears the End and Deſign why CHRIST was made manifeſt in the Fleſh.—<hi>viz.</hi> to put an End to theſe Diſorders, and to reſtore us to that primitive Dignity in which we were at firſt created.—Accordingly he ſhed his precious Blood to ſatisfy his Father's Juſtice for our Sins, and thereby alſo he purchaſed again for us the HOLY GHOST, who ſhould once more re-inſtamp the Divine Image upon our
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004650_0250_100DDCF927AF2A18"/>
Hearts, and make us capable of living with and enjoying GOD.</p>
                  <p>This, I ſay, was the only End of our LORD's coming into the World—Nay, this is the only End why the World itſelf is now kept in Being. For as ſoon as a ſufficient Number are ſanctified out of it, the Heavens ſhall be wrapped up like a Scrowl, the Elements ſhall melt with fervent Heat, the Earth and all that therein is ſhall be burnt up.</p>
                  <p>This is that New-Birth mentioned by our bleſſed LORD to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> without which we cannot ſee the Kingdom of GOD. This is what St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls being renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, and herein conſiſts that Holineſs without which no Man ſhall ſee the LORD.</p>
                  <p>In this manner then it is undeniably certain we muſt receive the HOLY GHOST e'er we can be ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed true Members of CHRIST'S myſtical Body.</p>
                  <p>II. I come now, in the <hi>Second</hi> Place, to lay down ſome ſcriptural Marks, whereby we may eaſily judge whether we have received the HOLY GHOST or not.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Firſt</hi> Mark I ſhall mention is,—our having received a Spirit of Prayer and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—For that always accompanies the Spirit of Grace.—No ſooner was <hi>Paul</hi> converted, but behold he prayeth, ſays JESUS CHRIST. And this was urged as an Argument to convince <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> that he was converted. And GOD's Elect are ſaid to cry to him Day and Night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:004650_0251_100DDCFAAD122988"/>
For ſince one great Work of the Holy Spirit is to convince us of Sin, and to ſet us upon ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pardon and renewing Grace thro' the all-ſufficient Merits of a crucified Redeemer, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has felt the Powers of the World to come awakening him from his ſpiritual Lethargy, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be always crying out, LORD what wouldſt thou have me do? Or in the Language of the importunate blind <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> JESUS, thou Son of <hi>David,</hi> have Mercy upon me.</p>
                  <p>The bleſſed JESUS, as he received the Holy Ghoſt without Meaſure, ſo he evidenced it by nothing more than his frequent Addreſſes at the Throne of Grace. Accordingly we read, that he was often alone on the Mountain praying—That he roſe a great while before Day to pray.—Nay that he ſpent whole Nights in Prayer.—And whoſoever is made Partaker of the ſame Spirit with the HOLY JESUS, will be of the ſame Mind, and delight in nothing ſo much as to draw night unto GOD, and lift up holy Hands and Hearts in fervent and devout Prayer.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſſed indeed that this Spirit of Supplication is often as it were ſenſibly loſt, and decays for ſome Time even in thoſe who have actually received the Holy Ghoſt. And they, thro' ſpiritual Dryneſs and Barrenneſs of Soul, find in themſelves a Liſtleſſneſs and Backwardneſs to this Duty of Prayer;—but then they take it as their Croſs, and ſtill preſevere in ſeeking JESUS tho' it be ſorrowing. And their Hearts notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are fixed upon GOD, tho' they cannot exert their Affections ſo ſtrongly as uſual, on
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004650_0252_100DDCFC6C116AF8"/>
Account of that ſpiritual Deadneſs which GOD for wiſe Reaſons has ſuffered to benumb their Souls.</p>
                  <p>But as for the formal Believer, it is not ſo with him. No, he either prays not at all, or if he does enter into his Cloſet, it is with Reluctance—out of Cuſtom—or to ſatisfy the Checks of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience—Whereas the true Believer can no more live without Prayer, than without Food Day by Day. And he finds his Soul as really and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly fed by the one, as his Body is nouriſhed and ſupported by the other.</p>
                  <p>A Second Scripture Mark of our having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the HOLY GHOST, is—not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sin.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whoſoever is born of GOD, ſays St. John, ſinneth not, neither can be ſin becauſe his Seed remaineth in him</hi>—Neither can he ſin—This Expreſſion does not imply the Impoſſibility of a ſpiritual Man's ſinning. For we are told, that in many Things we offend all. It means only thus much; that a Man that is really born again of GOD, doth not wilfully commit Sin, much leſs live in the habitual Practice of it. For how ſhall he that is dead to Sin, as every converted Perſon is, live any longer therein?</p>
                  <p>'Tis true a Man that is born again of GOD may, thro' Surprize or Violence of a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fall into an Act of Sin: Witneſs the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter's</hi> De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ial of his Maſter. But then, like them, he quickly riſes again, goes out from the World, and weeps bitterly; waſhes the Guilt of Sin away by the Tears of a ſincere
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004650_0253_100DDD0223E85648"/>
Repentance, joined with Faith in the Blood of JESUS CHRIST; takes double Heed to his Ways for the future, and perfects Holineſs in the Fear of GOD.</p>
                  <p>The Meaning of this Expreſſion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, that a Man that is born again of GOD, cannot commit Sin, has been<note n="*" place="bottom">Law's <hi>Chriſtian Perfection.</hi>
                     </note> fitly illuſtrated in the Example of a covetous Worldling, to the general Bent of whoſe Inclinations, Liberality and Profuſeneſs are directly oppoſite. But if, upon ſome unexpected ſudden Occaſion, he does play the Prodigal, he immediately repents him of his Fault, and returns with double Care to his Saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs again.—And ſo is every one that is born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. To commit Sin is as contrary to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Frame and Tendency of his Mind, as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity is to the Inclinations of a Miſer. But if at any Time he is drawn into Sin, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with double Zeal returns to his Duty, and brings forth Fruits meet for Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the unconverted Sinner is quite dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,—or if he does abſtain from the groſs Acts of it, from worldly ſelfiſh Motives, yet there is ſome Right Eye he will not pluck out; ſome Right Hand which he will not cut off; ſome ſpecious <hi>Agag</hi> that he will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for GOD; and thereby he is convinced, that he is but a mere <hi>Saul;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatever Pretenſions he may make to the contrary, he has not yet received the HOLY GHOST.</p>

A <hi>Third</hi> Mark whereby we may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not we have received the Holy Ghoſt is,—our Conqueſt over the World.—For <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is born of GOD,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>overcometh the World.</hi>—By the World we are to underſtand, as St. <hi>John</hi> expreſſes it, all that is in the World, the Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and Pride of Life,—And by overcoming of it is meant our renouncing theſe, ſo as not to follow or be led by them.—For whoſoever is born from above, has his Affections ſet on Things above: He feels a Divine Attraction in his Soul, which forcibly draws his Mind Heavenwards; and as the Hart panteth after the Water-Brooks, ſo doth it make his Soul to long after the Enjoyment of his GOD.</p>
                  <p>Not that he is ſo taken up with the Affairs of another Life, as to neglect the Buſineſs of this. No, a truly ſpiritual Man dares not ſtand any Day idle: But then he takes Care, though he laboureth for the Meat which periſheth, firſt to ſecure that which endureth to everlaſting Life. Or if GOD has exalted him above his Brethren, yet, like <hi>Moſes, Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding looks upon himſelf as a Stranger and Pilgrim upon Earth.—Having received a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of new Life, he walks by Faith and not by Sight.—And his Hopes being full of Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he can look on all Things here below as Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.—In ſhort, tho' he is in, yet is not of the World: And as he was made for the Enjoyment of GOD, ſo nothing but GOD can ſatisfy his Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004650_0255_100DDD06324504C0"/>
The ever bleſſed JESUS was a perfect Inſtance of overcoming the World. For though he went continually about doing Good, and always lived in a Preſs, yet wherever he was, his Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tended Heavenwards. In like Manner he that is joined to the LORD in one Spirit, will ſo order his Thoughts, Words, and Actions aright, that he will evidence to all, that his Converſation is in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, an unconverted Man being of the Earth, is earthly: And having no ſpiritual Eye to diſcern ſpiritual Things, is always ſeeking for Happineſs in this Life, where it never was, will, or can be found. Being not born again from above, he is bowed down by a Spirit of natural Infirmity; the Serpent's Curſe becomes his Choice, and he eats of the Duſt of the Earth all the Days of his Life.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Scripture Mark of our <hi>New Birth,</hi> or of our having received the Holy Ghoſt, is,—our loving one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We know,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John, we are paſſed from Death unto Life, becauſe we love the Brethren.—And by this,</hi> ſays JESUS CHRIST, <hi>ſhall all Men know, that you are my Diſciples, if ye have Love one towards another.</hi>—Love is the fulfilling of the Goſpel, as well as the Law; for GOD is Love, and whoſoever dwelleth in GOD, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in Love.</p>
                  <p>But by this Love we are not to underſtand, a Softneſs and Tenderneſs of meer Nature, or a a Love founded on worldly Motives (for this a natural Man may have) but a Love of our
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004650_0256_100DDD0994A58D90"/>
Brethren proceeding from a Love towards GOD. Loving all Men in general, becauſe GOD loves all Men, and loving good Men in particular, for the Grace we ſee in them, and becauſe they love our Lord JESUS in Sincerity.</p>
                  <p>This is Chriſtian Charity, and that new Commandment which CHRIST gave his Diſciples. New not in its Object, but in the Motive and Example whereon it is founded, even JESUS CHRIST. This is that Love which the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians were ſo renowned for, that it became a Proverb.—<hi>See, how theſe Chriſtians love one another.</hi>—And without this Love, tho' we ſhould give all our Goods to feed the Poor, and our Bodies to be burnt, it would profit us nothing.</p>
                  <p>Farther, this Love is not confined to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Set of Men, but is impartial and catholic. A Love that embraces GOD's Image where-ever it beholds it, and that delights in nothing ſo much as to ſee CHRIST's Kingdom come.</p>
                  <p>This is the Love wherewith JESUS CHRIST loved Mankind.—He loved all, even the worſt of Men, as appears by his weeping over the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately perverſe; but wherever he ſaw the leaſt Appearance of the Divine Likeneſs, that Soul he loved in particular.—Thus we read, that when he heard the young Man ſay, <hi>All theſe Things have I kept from my Youth,</hi> that ſo far he loved him. And when he ſaw any noble Inſtance of Faith, though in a <hi>Centurion,</hi> a <hi>Syro-phoenician,</hi> Aliens to the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how is he ſaid to marvel at it, as Man, to rejoyce in it,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004650_0257_100DDD0D83E8C350"/>
ſpeak of, and commend it?—So alſo every ſpiritual Diſciple of JESUS CHRIST will cordially embrace all that worſhip GOD in Spirit and in Truth, howſoever they may differ as to the Appendages of Religion, and Things not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs indeed that the Heart of a natural Man is not thus enlarged all at once; and a Perſon may really have received the Holy Ghoſt (as <hi>Peter</hi> no doubt had when he was unwilling to go to <hi>Cornelius</hi>) though he be not arrived to this.—But then we affirm, where a Perſon is truly in CHRIST, all Narrowneſs of Spirit decreaſes in him daily; the Partition-Wall of Bigotry and Party Zeal is broken down more and more; and the nearer he comes to Heaven the more his Heart is enlarged with that Love which there will make no Difference between any People, Nation or Language, but we ſhall all with one Heart, and one Voice, ſing Praiſes to him that ſitteth upon the Throne for ever.</p>
                  <p>But I haſten to ſhew a <hi>Fifth,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſhall at preſent mention,—Loving our Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> ſays JESUS CHRIST, <hi>Love your Enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to thoſe that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi>—And this Duty of loving our Enemies is ſo neceſſary, that without it, our bleſſed LORD tells us, our Righteouſneſs does not exceed the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> nay, or of <hi>Publicans</hi> and Sinners: For if you do Good to them only which do
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004650_0258_100DDD0F071D4DE8"/>
Good to you, what do you more than others? What do you extraordinary? Do not even the <hi>Publicans</hi> the ſame?—And theſe Precepts our LORD confirmed by his own Example, when he wept over the bloody City; when he ſuffered himſelf to be led as a Sheep to the Slaughter; when he made that mild Reply to the Traytor <hi>Judas, Judas betrayeſt thou the Son of Man with a Kiſs;</hi>—And more eſpecially when in the Agonies and Pangs of Death, he prayed for his very Murderers, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the moſt difficult Duty to the natural Man, but whoſoever is made Partaker of that Promiſe of the Father, will find it practicable and eaſy. For if we are born again of GOD, we muſt be like him; and conſequently delight to be perfect in this Duty of doing good to our worſt Enemies in the ſame Manner, though not in the ſame Degree as he is perfect.—And he ſends his Rain on the Evil and the Good, cauſeth his Sun to ſhine on the Juſt and Unjuſt: And herein more eſpecially commendeth his Love towards us, that whilſt we were his Enemies, he ſent forth his Son, born of a Woman, made under the Law, that he might become a Curſe for us.</p>
                  <p>Many other Marks there are ſcattered up and down the Scriptures, whereby we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y know whether or not we have received the Holy Ghoſt. Such as <hi>to be carnally minded is Death, but to be ſpiritually minded is Life and Peace.—Now the Fruits of the Spirit are Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering,</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="unknown:004650_0259_100DDD11A6C840D0"/>
                     <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> with a Multitude of Texts to the ſame Purpoſe.—But as moſt, if not all of them, are comprehended in the Duties already laid down, I dare affirm, whoſoever, upon an impartial Examination, can find the aforeſaid Marks upon his Soul, may be as certain, as though an Angel was to tell him, that his Pardon is ſealed in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And as for my own Part, I had rather ſee theſe Divine Graces, theſe Heavenly Tempers ſtamped upon my Soul, than to hear an Angel from Heaven ſaying unto me, <hi>Son, be of good cheer, thy Sins be forgiven thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For theſe are infallible Witneſſes; theſe are <hi>Emanuel,</hi> GOD with and in us; theſe make up that white Stone, which none knoweth, ſaving he who receiveth it; theſe are the Earneſts of the Heavenly Inheritance in our Hearts. In ſhort, theſe are Glory begun, and are that good Thing, that better Part, which, if you continue to ſtir up this Gift of GOD, neither Men or Devils ſhall ever be able to take from us.</p>
                  <p>III. I proceed now, as was propoſed, in the <hi>Third</hi> Place, to make an Application of the Doctrine delivered, to ſeveral diſtinct Claſſes of Profeſſors.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall addreſs myſelf to thoſe who are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.—And here how could I weep over you, as our LORD wept over <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> For alas! how diſtant muſt you be from GOD, what a prodigious Work have you got to finiſh, who inſtead of praying Day and Night, ſeldom or never pray at all! And inſtead

of being born again in GOD, ſo as not to commit Sin, are ſo deeply ſunk into the Nature of Devils as to make a Mock at it. Or inſtead of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the World, ſo as not to follow or be led by it, are continually making Proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof. And laſtly, inſtead of being endued with the Godlike Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of loving all Men, even your Enemies, have your Hearts full of Hatred, Malice and Revenge, and deride thoſe who are ſincere Followers of the lowly JESUS.—But think you, O Sinners, that GOD will admit ſuch polluted Wretches into his Sight? Or ſhould he admit you, do you imagine you could take any Pleaſure in him? No, Heaven itſelf would be no Heaven to you: The Deviliſh Diſpoſitions which are in your Hearts would render all the ſpiritual Enjoyments of thoſe bleſſed Manſions ineffectual to make you happy.—To qualify you to be bliſsful Partakers of that Heavenly Inheritance with the Saints in Light, there is a Meetneſs required, to attain which ought to be the one Buſineſs of your Lives.</p>
                  <p>It is true, you, as well as the Righteous, in one Senſe ſhall ſee GOD (for we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) but you muſt ſee him once. never to ſee him more. For as you carry about in you the Devil's Image, with Devils you muſt dwell. Being of the ſame Nature, you muſt ſhare the ſame Doom. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent therefore and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out. See that you receive the Holy Ghoſt before you go hence: For

otherwiſe how can you eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall apply myſelf to thoſe who deceive themſelves with falſe Hopes of Salvation. And becauſe, through the Influence of a good Education, or other providential Reſtraints, they have not run into the ſame Exceſs of Riot with other Men, think they have no Need to receive the Holy Ghoſt, and flatter themſelves that they are really born again.</p>
                  <p>But do you ſhew it by bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit? Do you pray without ceaſing? Do you not commit Sin? Have you overcome the World? And do you love your Enemies, and all Mankind, in the ſame Manner as JESUS CHRIST loved them?</p>

The Nature of the old <hi>Adam</hi> ſtill reigneth in your Souls. And unleſs the Nature of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> be engrafted in its Room, you can never ſee GOD.</p>
                  <p>Think not therefore to dreſs yourſelves up in the Ornaments of a good Nature, and civil Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſay with <hi>Agag,</hi> ſurely the Bitterneſs of Death is paſt.

The Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the Body was entirely exploded and ſet at nought among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as appears from the <hi>Athenians</hi> mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at and calling St. <hi>Paul</hi> a Babler and a Setter forth of ſtrange Doctrines, when he preached to them JESUS, and the Reſurrection.—And though it was believed by moſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as is evident from many Paſſages of Scripture; yet not by all; the whole Sect of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> denied it. But the Reſurrection of JESUS CHRIST put it out of Diſpute.—For a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he acted as our Repreſentative, if he our Head be riſen, then muſt we alſo, who are his Members, riſe with him.—And as in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> we all died, even ſo in him our ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> we muſt all in this Senſe be made alive.</p>
                  <p>As it was neceſſary, upon all theſe Accounts, that our Bleſſed LORD ſhould riſe from the Dead; ſo it is plain beyond Contradiction, that he did. Never was any Matter of Fact better atteſted. Never were more Precautions made uſe of to prevent a Cheat.—He was buried in a Sepulchre, hewn out of a Rock, ſo that it could not be ſaid that any digged under, and conveyed him away. It was a Sepulchre alſo wherein ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Man before was laid; ſo that if any Body did riſe from thence, it muſt be the Body of JESUS of of <hi>Nazareth.</hi>—Beſides, the Sepulchre was ſealed; a great Stone rolled to the Mouth of it, and a Band of Soldiers (conſiſting not of his Friends, but of his profeſſed Enemies) was ſet to guard it.—And as for his Diſciples coming by Night and ſtealing him away, it was altogether impoſſible. For it was not long ſince that they had all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004650_0269_100DDD2BB2AD30B8"/>
him, and they were the moſt backward in believing his Reſurrection.—And ſuppoſing it was true that they came whilſt the Soldiers ſlept; yet the Soldiers muſt be caſt into a Deep Sleep indeed, that the rolling away ſo great a Stone did not awake ſome of them.</p>
                  <p>And our Bleſſed LORD's afterwards appearing at ſundry Times, and in divers Manners, to his Diſciples, when they were aſſembled together, when they were walking to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> when they were fiſhing; nay, and condeſcending to ſhew them his Hands and Feet, and his at length ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to above five hundred Brethren at once, put the Truth of his Reſurrection out of all Diſpute.</p>
                  <p>Indeed there is one Objection that may be made againſt what has been ſaid,—That the Books wherein theſe Facts are recorded were written by his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>And who more proper Perſons than thoſe who were Eye-Witneſſes of what they related, and eat and drank with him after his Reſurrection. "But they were illiterate and ignorant Men." Yet as good Witneſſes of a plain Matter of Fact, as the moſt learned Maſters in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>—Nay, this rendered them more proper Witneſſes.—For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain Men, they were therefore leſs to be ſuſpected of telling or making a Lye,—particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, ſince they laid down their Lives for a Teſtimony of the Truth of it. We read indeed of <hi>Jacob'</hi>s telling a Lie, though he was a plain Man, in order to get his Father's Bleſſing. But it was never heard ſince the World began, that
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004650_0270_100DDD2E70192028"/>
any Man, much leſs a whole Set of Men, died Martyrs for the Sake of an Untruth, when they themſelves were to reap no Advantage from it.</p>
                  <p>No, this ſingle Circumſtance proves them to be <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, in whom was no Guile.—And the wonderful Succeſs GOD gave to their Miniſtry afterwards, when three thouſand were converted by one Sermon, and twelve poor Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in a very ſhort Time were enabled to be more than Conquerors over all the Oppoſition Men or Devils could make, was as plain a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that CHRIST was riſen; according to their Goſpel, as that a Divine Power, at the Sound of a few Ram's Horns, cauſed the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> to fall down.</p>
                  <p>But what need we any farther Witneſſes? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you the Reſurrection of our Bleſſed LORD? I know that you believe it, as your gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on this firſt Day of the Week in the Courts of the LORD's Houſe abundantly teſtifies.</p>
                  <p>What concerns us moſt to be aſſured of, and which is the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second</hi> Thing I was to ſpeak to is,—Whether we have experimentally known the Power of his Reſurrection; that is, <hi>Whether or not we have received the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and by his powerful Operations on our Hearts been raiſed from the Death of Sin, to a Life of Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>It was this the great Apoſtle was chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know.—The Reſurrection of CHRIST'S Body he was ſatisfied would avail him nothing, unleſs he experienced the Power of it in raiſing his dead Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:004650_0271_100DDD2FF406EC88"/>
For another, and that a chief End of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed LORD's riſing from the Dead, was to enter Heaven as our Repreſentative, and to ſend down the Holy Ghoſt to apply that Redemption he had finiſhed on the Croſs to our Hearts, by working an entire Change in them.</p>
                  <p>Without this, CHRIST would have died in vain. For it would have done us no Service to have his outward Righteouſneſs imputed to us, unleſs we had an inward inherent Righteouſneſs wrought in us.—Becauſe being altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and born in Sin, and conſequently unfit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to hold Communion with an infinitely pure and holy GOD, we cannot poſſibly be made meet to ſee or enjoy him, till a thorough Renovation has paſſed upon our Hearts.</p>
                  <p>Without this, we leave out the Holy Ghoſt in the great Work of our Redemption.—But as we were made by the Joint Concurrence and Conſultation of the bleſſed Trinity. And as we were baptized in their Name—So muſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of them concur in rendring that Baptiſm effectual to our Salvation: As the Father made, and the Son Redeemed, ſo muſt the Holy Ghoſt ſanctify and ſeal us, or otherwiſe we have believed in vain.</p>
                  <p>This then is what the Apoſtle means by the Power of CHRIST'S Reſurrection, and this is what we are as much concerned experimentally to know, as that He roſe at all.</p>
                  <p>Without this, though we may be Moraliſts, though we may be civilized, good natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004650_0272_100DDD338148BC40"/>
we therefore a right Faith, becauſe we daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe that CHRIST roſe again the third Day from the Dead. But he is a true Chriſtian who is one inwardly; and then only can we be ſtiled true Believers, when we not only profeſs to believe, but have felt the Power of our bleſſed LORD's riſing from the Dead, by being quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and raiſed by his Spirit when dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and Sins, to a thorough Newneſs both of Heart and Life.</p>
                  <p>The Devils themſelves cannot but believe the Doctrine of the Reſurrection and tremble—But yet they continue Devils, becauſe the Benefits of this Reſurrection have not been applied to them, nor have they received a renovating Power from it to change and put off their Diabolical Nature—And ſo likewiſe, unleſs we not only profeſs to know, but alſo feel that CHRIST is riſen indeed, by being born again from above, we ſhall be as far from the Kingdom of GOD as they, our Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> will be as ineffectual as the Faith of Devils.</p>
                  <p>Nothing has done more harm to the Chriſtian World; nothing has rendered the Croſs of CHRIST of leſs Effect, than a vain Suppoſition that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ſomething without us—Whereas we ſhould conſider that every thing that CHRIST did outwardly, muſt be done over again in our Souls; or otherwiſe believing there was ſuch a divine Perſon once on Earth, who triumphed over Hell and the Grave, will profit us no more, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving there was once ſuch a Perſon as <hi>Alexander,</hi> who conquered the World.</p>

                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:004650_0273_100DDD360D3AA478"/>
As CHRIST was born of the Virgin's Womb, ſo muſt he be ſpiritually formed in our Hearts—As He died for Sin, ſo muſt we die to Sin—And as he roſe again from the Dead, ſo muſt we alſo riſe to a Divine Life.</p>
                  <p>None but thoſe who have followed him in this Regeneration, or new Birth, ſhall ſit on Thrones as Approvers of his Sentence, when he ſhall come in terrible Majeſty to judge the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, as for the outward Work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption it was a tranſient Act, and was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed on the Croſs—But the Application of that Redemption to our Hearts is a Work that will continue always, even unto the End of the World.</p>
                  <p>So long as there is a Man breathing on the Earth, who is naturally engendred of the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo long muſt the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit which was purchaſed by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that LORD from Heaven, be Breathing upon his Soul.</p>
                  <p>For tho' we may exiſt by CHRIST, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to exiſt in Him, till we are united to him by one Spirit, and enter into a new State of Things, as certainly as He entred into a new State of Things, after that he roſe from the Dead.</p>
                  <p>We may throng and crowd around about CHRIST, and call him LORD, LORD, when we come to worſhip before his Footſtool; but we have not effectually touched Him, till by a lively Faith in His Reſurrection, we perceive a Divine Virtue coming out of Him, to renew &amp; purify our Souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="unknown:004650_0274_100DDD3889CA60D0"/>
How greatly then do they err who reſt in a bare Hiſtorical Faith of our Saviour's Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and look only for external Proofs to evidence it? Whereas were we the moſt learned Diſputers of this World, and could ſpeak of the Certainty of this Fact with the Tongue of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, yet without this inward Teſtimony of it in our Hearts, tho' we might convince others, yet we ſhould never be ſaved by it ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>For we are but dead Men, we are but like ſo many Carcaſſes wrapt up in Grave Cloaths, till that ſame JESUS who called <hi>Lazarus</hi> from his Tomb, and at whoſe Reſurrection many that ſlept aroſe,—raiſe us alſo by his quickening Spirit from our natural Death, in which we have ſo long lain, to a holy and heavenly Life.</p>
                  <p>We might think ourſelves happy, if we had ſeen the HOLY JESUS after He was riſen from the Dead, and our Hands handled that LORD of Life. But more happy are they who have not ſeen him, and yet having felt the Power of his Reſurrection, therefore believe in Him.—For many ſaw our Divine Maſter, who were not ſaved by him; but whoſoever has thus felt the Power of his Reſurrection, he has the Earneſt of his Inheritance in his Heart, he has paſſed from Death to Life, and ſhall never, if he ſtill ſtir up the Gift of GOD that is in him, fall into Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>I am very ſenſible that this is Fooliſhneſs to the Natural Man, as were many ſuch like Truths to our LORD's own Diſciples before he roſe again. But when theſe natural Men, like them, have

                  <p>And Oh that all Unbelievers, all Letter-learned Maſters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who now look upon the Doctrine of the Power of CHRIST'S Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or our New Birth, as an idle Tale, and condemn the Preachers of it as Enthuſiaſts and Madmen, did but thus feel the Power of it in their Souls,—They would no longer ask, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But then by this Faith we are to underſtand not a dead ſpeculative Faith, a Faith in the Head; but a living Principle wrought in the Heart by the powerful Operations of the Holy Ghoſt,—A Faith that will enable us to overcome the World, and forſake all in Affection for JESUS CHRIST.

                  <p>GOD is LOVE; and therefore could our own Wills, or the World have made us happy, he never would have ſent his own dear Son JESUS CHRIST to die and riſe again, to deliver us from the Power of them.—But becauſe they only torment, but cannot ſatisfy, therefore GOD bids renounce them.</p>

                  <p>Well might that glorious Company of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, recorded in the Holy Scriptures, ſupported with a deep Senſe of their Heavenly Calling, deſpiſe the Pleaſures and Profits of this Life, and wander about in Sheep-Skins, and Goat-Skins, in Dens and Caves of the Earth, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented.</p>
                  <p>And oh that we were all like minded! that we felt the Power of CHRIST'S Reſurrection as they did!

                  <p>WHEN the <hi>Sadducees</hi> came to our Bleſſed LORD, and put to him the Queſtion, <hi>whoſe Wife a Woman ſhould be in the next Life, who had ſeven Husbands in this?</hi> He told them, <hi>they erred, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi>—And if we would know whence all the Errors that have overſpread the Church of CHRIST, firſt aroſe, we ſhould find they in a great Meaſure flowed from the ſame Fountain, <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>Our Bleſſed LORD, though he was the Eternal GOD, yet as Man, made it his conſtant Rule and Guide.—And therefore, when he was asked by the Lawyer, <hi>Which was the great Commandment of the Law?</hi> He referred him to his Bible for an Anſwer, <hi>What readeſt thou?</hi>—And thus, when led by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil, he repelled all his Aſſaults, with <hi>It is written.</hi>

A ſufficient Confutation this of their Opinion, who ſay, <q>The Spirit only, and not the Spirit by the Word, is to be our Rule of Action.</q>—If ſo, our Saviour, who had the Spirit without Meaſure, needed not always have referred to the written Word.</p>
                  <p>But how few copy after the Example of CHRIST? How many are there, who do not regard the Word of GOD at all, but throw the Sacred Oracles aſide, as an antiquated Book, fit only for unlearned and illiterate Men?</p>
                  <p>Such Men do greatly err, not knowing what the Scriptures are, and for what they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore in the following Diſcourſe,

                        <item>I. <hi>Firſt</hi> ſhew that it is every one's Duty to ſearch them. And,</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>By the Scriptures I underſtand the Law and the Prophets, and all thoſe Books which have in all Ages been accounted Canonical, and which make up that Book commonly called, <hi>The Bible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are emphatically ſtiled <hi>The Scriptures,</hi> and in one Place, <hi>The Scriptures of Truth,</hi> as though no other Books deſerved the Name of true Writings or Scriptures in Compariſon of them.</p>
                  <p>They are not of any private Interpretation, Authority, or Invention, but Holy Men of old wrote them, as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="unknown:004650_0282_100DDD4C82C3EA90"/>
The Foundation of GOD's revealing himſelf thus to Mankind, was our Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Neceſſity of our <hi>New Birth</hi> in CHRIST JESUS. And if we ſearch the Scriptures as we ought, we ſhall find the Sum and Subſtance, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginning and End of them, has no other Tendency but to lead us to a Knowledge of theſe two great Truths.</p>
                  <p>All the Threats, Promiſes, and Precepts, all the Exhortations and Doctrines contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, all the Rites, and Ceremonies, and Sacrifices appointed under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law; nay, almoſt all the Hiſtorical Parts of Holy Scripture, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our being fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> and either point out to us a Mediator to come, or ſpeak of him as already come in the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Had Man continued in a State of Innocence, he would not have needed an outward Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the Law of GOD was ſo deeply written in the Tables of his Heart. But having eaten of the forbidden Fruit, he incurred the Divine Diſpleaſure, and loſt the Divine Image, and therefore without an outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation could never tell how GOD would be reconciled unto him, or how he ſhould be ſaved from the Miſery and Darkneſs of his fallen Nature.</p>
                  <p>That theſe Truths are ſo, I need not refer you to any other Book than that of your own Hearts.</p>
                  <p>For unleſs we are fallen Creatures, whence come thoſe abominable Corruptions which daily ariſe in our Hearts? We could not come thus
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004650_0283_100DDD4F600B8978"/>
corrupt out of the Hands of our Maker, becauſe he being Goodneſs itſelf, could make nothing but what is like himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Holy, Juſt and Good. And that we want to be delivered from theſe Diſorders of our Nature is evident, becauſe we find an Unwillingneſs within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to own we are thus depraved, and are always ſtriving to appear to others of a quite different Frame and Temper of Mind, than what we are.</p>
                  <p>I appeal to the Experience of the moſt learned Diſputer againſt Divine Revelation, whether he does not find in himſelf that he is naturally Proud, Angry, Revengeful, and full of other Tempers contrary to the Purity, Holineſs, and Long-Suffering of GOD.—And is not this a demonſtrable Proof that ſome Way or other he is fallen from GOD?—And I appeal alſo whether at the ſame Time he finds theſe Helliſh Tempers in his Heart, he does not ſtrive to ſeem Amiable, Courteous, Kind, and Affable; and is not this as manifeſt a Proof that he is ſenſible that he is Miſerable, and wants he knows not how, to be redeemed or delivered from it?</p>
                  <p>Here then GOD by his Word ſteps in, and opens to his View ſuch a Scene of Divine Love, and infinite Goodneſs, in the Holy Scriptures, that none but Men of ſuch corrupt and reprobate Minds as our modern Deiſts, would ſhut their Eyes againſt it.</p>
                  <p>For what does GOD in his written Word do more or leſs, than ſhew thee, O Man, how
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004650_0284_100DDD52070D11A8"/>
thou art fallen into that Blindneſs, Darkneſs, and Miſery thou feeleſt and complaineſt of? And at the ſame Time points out the Way to what thou deſireſt, <hi>viz.</hi> How thou mayſt be redeemed out of it,—by believing in, and copying after the Son of his Love.</p>
                  <p>For, as I told you before, ſo I tell you again, upon theſe two Truths hangs all Divine Revelation. It being given us for no other End but to ſhew us our Miſery, and our Happineſs; our Fall and Recovery; or, in one Word, after what Manner we died in <hi>Adam,</hi> and how in CHRIST, we may again be made alive.</p>
                  <p>Hence then ariſes the Neceſſity of ſearching the Scriptures. For ſince they are nothing elſe but the grand Character of our Salvation, a Revelation of a Covenant made by GOD with Man in CHRIST, a Light to guide them into the Way of Peace: It follows, that all are obliged to read and ſearch them, becauſe all are equally fallen from GOD, all equally ſtand in need of being informed what they muſt do to be reſtored to, and again united with him.</p>
                  <p>How fooliſhly then do the diſputing Infidels of this Generation act, who are continually either calling for Signs from Heaven, or ſeeking for outward Evidence to prove the Truth of Divine Revelation? Whereas what they ſo earneſtly ſeek for is nigh unto, nay, within them. For let them but conſult their own Hearts, they cannot but feel what they want.—Let them but conſult the lively Oracles of GOD, and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004650_0285_100DDD555C0635A8"/>
they cannot but ſee a Remedy revealed for all their Wants, and that the written Word does as exactly anſwer the Wants and Deſire of their Hearts, as Face anſwers to Face in the Water.—Where then is the Scribe, where then is the Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>For whoſoever does not read them with this Temper ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Things contained therein.

                  <p>Fancy yourſelves therefore when you are ſearching the Scriptures, eſpecially when you are reading the New Teſtament, to be with <hi>Mary</hi> ſitting at the Feet of the HOLY JESUS, and be as willing to learn what GOD ſhall teach You, as <hi>Samuel</hi> was, when he ſaid, <hi>Speak, LORD, for thy Servant heareth.</hi>

Oh that they would, like new-born Babes, deſire to be fed with the pure Milk of the Word! then we ſhould have them no longer ſcoffing at Divine Revelation, nor would they read the Bible any more (with the ſame Intent the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> brought out <hi>Sampſon</hi>) to make Sport at it, but they would ſee the Divine Image and Superſcription written upon every Line of it. They would hear GOD ſpeaking unto their Souls by it, and conſequently be built up in the Knowledge and Fear of him who is the Author of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Search the Scriptures with a ſincere Intention to put in Practice what you read.</p>
                  <p>For a Deſire to do the Will of GOD is the only Way to know it, <hi>If any Man will do my Will,</hi> ſays JESUS CHRIST, <hi>He ſhall know of my Doctrine whether it he of GOD, or whether I ſpeak of myſelf.</hi> As he alſo ſpeaks in another Place to his Diſciples, <hi>To you,</hi> who are willing to practice your Duty, <hi>it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of GOD; but to thoſe that are without,</hi> who only want to raiſe Cavils againſt my Doctrine, <hi>all theſe Things are ſpoken in Parables, that ſeeing they may ſee and not underſtand, and hearing they may hear and not perceive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is but juſt in GOD to ſend thoſe ſtrong Deluſions, that they may believe a Lye, and to conceal the Knowledge of himſelf from all ſuch as do not ſeek him with a ſingle Intention.</p>

JESUS CHRIST is the ſame now as formerly. To thoſe who deſire to know from his Word, who he is that they may believe on and live by and to him, he will reveal himſelf as clearly as he did to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>I that ſpeak to thee am he;</hi> or as he did to the Man that was born blind, whom the <hi>Jews</hi> had caſt out for his Name's ſake, <hi>He that talketh with thee is he.</hi> But to thoſe who conſult his Word with a Deſire neither to know him or keep his Commandments, but either merely for their Entertainment, or to ſcoff at the Simplicity of the Manner in which he is revealed, to thoſe, I ſay, he never will reveal himſelf, though he ſhould ſearch the Scriptures to all Eternity.—As he never would tell thoſe whether he was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or not, who put that Queſtion to him either out of Curioſity, or that they might have whereof to accuſe him.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In order to ſearch the Scriptures ſtill more effectually, make an Application of every Thing you read to your own Hearts.</p>
                  <p>For whatever was written in the Book of GOD, was written for our Learning. And what CHRIST ſaid unto thoſe aforetime, we muſt look upon as ſpoken to us alſo: For ſince the Holy Scriptures are nothing but a Revelation from GOD, how fallen Man is to be reſtored by JESUS CHRIST, all the Precepts, Threats and Promiſes, belong to us and to our Children, as well as to thoſe to whom they were immediately made known.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:004650_0289_100DDD5ED354E210"/>
Thus the Apoſtle, when he tells us that <hi>he lived by the Faith of the Son of</hi> GOD, adds <hi>who died and gave himſelf for me,</hi> For it is this Application of JESUS CHRIST to our Hearts that makes his Redemption effectual to each of us.</p>
                  <p>And it is this Application of all the Doctrinal and Hiſtorical Parts of Scripture, when we are reading them over, that muſt render them profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us, as they were deſigned for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, and make every Child of GOD perfect, thoroughly furniſhed to every good Work.</p>
                  <p>And I dare appeal to the Experience of every Spiritual Reader of Holy Writ, whether or no if he conſulted the Word of GOD in this Manner, he was not at all Times and at all Seaſons as plainly directed how to act, as though he had conſulted the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> which was upon the <hi>High Prieſt'</hi>s Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>For this is the Way GOD now reveals himſelf to Man: Not by making new Revelations, but by applying general Things that are revealed already, to every particular ſincere Reader's Heart.</p>
                  <p>And this, by the Way, anſwers an Objection made by thoſe that ſay, <q>the Word of GOD is not a perfect Rule of Action, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not direct us how to act, or how to determine in particular Caſes, or what Place to go to when we are in Doubt, and therefore the Spirit, and not the Word, is to be our Rule of Action.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:004650_0290_100DDD62371FCD18"/>
But this I deny, and affirm on the Contrary, that GOD at all Times, Circumſtances and Places, though never ſo minute, never ſo particular, will, if we diligently ſeek the Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, apply general Things to our Hearts, and thereby, to uſe the Words of the Holy JESUS, will lead us into all Truth, and give us the particular Aſſiſtance we want: But this leads me to a</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifth</hi> Direction how to ſearch the Scriptures with Profit. Labour to attain that Spirit by which they were wrote.</p>
                  <p>For the natural Man diſcerneth not the Words of the Spirit of GOD, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned, the Words that CHRIST hath ſpoken they are Spirit, and they are Life, and can be no more underſtood, as to the true hidden Senſe and Meaning of them, by the mere natural Man, than a Perſon who had never learnt a Language can underſtand another ſpeaking in it. The Scriptures therefore have not unfitly been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd by ſome to the Cloud which went before the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they are dark and hard to be underſtood by the natural Man, as the Cloud appeared dark to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but they are Light, they are Life to Chriſtians indeed, as that ſame Cloud which ſeem'd dark to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Hoſt, appeared bright and altogether glorious to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD.</p>
                  <p>It was the Want of the Aſſiſtance of this Spirit that made <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a Teacher of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ruler of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo utterly ignorant in the Doctrine of <hi>Regeneration:</hi> For being only a natural Man.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:004650_0291_100DDD63BAE54D10"/>
he could not tell how that Thing could be. It was the Want of this Spirit that made our Saviour's Diſciples, tho' he ſo frequently converſed with them, daily miſtake the Nature of the Doctrines he delivered; and it is becauſe the natural Veil is not taken off from their Hearts, that ſo many who pretend to ſearch the Scriptures, yet ſee no farther than into the bare Letter of them and continue entire Strangers to the hidden Senſe, the Spiritual Meaning, couched under every Parable, and contained in almoſt all the Precepts of the Book of GOD.</p>
                  <p>And indeed how ſhould it be otherwiſe; for GOD being a Spirit, he cannot communicate himſelf any otherwiſe than in a ſpiritual Manner to the Hearts of Men; and conſequently i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we are Strangers to his Spirit, we muſt continue Strangers to his Word, becauſe it is altogether like himſelf Spiritual. Labour therefore ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to attain this bleſſed Spirit, for otherwiſe your Underſtandings will never be opened to underſtand the Scriptures aright; and becauſe Prayer is one of the moſt immediate Means to get his Holy Spirit,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Let me adviſe you before you read the Scripture, to pray that CHRIST, according to his Promiſe, would ſend his Spirit to guide you into all Truth; interſperſe ſhort Ejaculations whilſt you are engaged in Reading, pray over every Word and Verſe if poſſible, and when you cloſe up the Book moſt earneſtly beſeech GOD, that the Words which you then have read <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="62" facs="unknown:004650_0292_100DDD6689DF6F70"/>
Hearts, and bring forth in you the Fruits of Good Living.</p>
                  <p>Do this, and you will with an holy Violence draw down GOD's Holy Spirit into your Hearts, and you will experience his gracious Influences, and feel him enlightning, quickening and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Souls by the Word of GOD; you will then not only read, but mark, learn, and inwardly digeſt what you read, and the Word of GOD will be Meat indeed and Drink indeed unto your Souls; you then will be as <hi>Apollos</hi> was, powerful in the Scriptures, be <hi>Scribes</hi> ready inſtructed to the Kingdom of GOD, and bring out of the good Treaſures of your Heart, Things both from the Old and New Teſtament, to entertain all you converſe with.</p>
                  <p>One Direction more; which ſhall be the laſt, <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Read the Scripture conſtantly, or to uſe our Saviour's Expreſſion in the Text, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> dig in them as for hid Treaſure, for here's a manifeſt Alluſion to thoſe who dig in Mines, and our Saviour would thereby teach us that we muſt take as much Pains in conſtantly reading his Word, if we would grow thereby, as thoſe who dig for Gold and Silver. The Scriptures contain the Deep Things of GOD, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can never be ſufficiently ſearch'd into by a careleſs, ſuperficial, curſory Way of Reading them, but by an induſtrious, cloſe and humble Application.</p>
                  <p>The Pſalmiſt therefore makes it the Property of a good Man that he meditates on GOD's Law Day and Night: <hi>And this Book of the Law,</hi>

                  <p>THE Occaſion of theſe Words was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: In the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> there was an unhappy Perſon, who had committed ſuch Inceſt, as was not ſo much as named among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in taking his Father's Wife; but either on account of his Wealth, Power, or ſome ſuch Reaſons, like many notorious Offender<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

by the Devil, under whoſe Power the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated Perſon was for ſome Time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. The <hi>Corinthians,</hi> being obedient to the Apoſtle, as dear Children, no ſooner received this Reproof, but they ſubmitted to it, and caſt the offending Party out of the Church. But whilſt they were endeavouring to amend one Fault, they unhapply run into another; and as they formerly had been too mild and remiſs, ſo now they behaved towards him with too much Severity and Reſentment. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this Chapter, reproves this, and tells them, that ſufficient to the Offender's Shame, was <hi>The Puniſhment which had been inflicted of many;</hi> that he had now ſuffered enough; and that therefore, leſt he ſhould be tempted to ſay with <hi>Cain My Puniſhment is greater than I can bear;</hi> or to uſe the Apoſtle's own Words, <hi>Leſt he ſhould be ſwallowed up with over much Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;</hi> they ought, now he had given Proof of his Repentance, to forgive him, to confirm their Love towards him, and ſo reſtore him in the Spirit of Meekneſs; <hi>Leſt Satan,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to whoſe Buffetings he was now given, ſhould, by tempting him to Deſpair, get an Advantage over us;</hi> and ſo, by repreſenting you as Mercileſs and Cruel, cauſe that Holy Name to be blaſphemed by which you are called; <hi>for we are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his Devices:</hi> we know very well how many ſubtle Ways he has to draw aſide and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile unguarded unthinking Men.</p>

                  <p>The Word Satan, in its original Signification, means an Adverſary; and in its general Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is made uſe of to point out to us the Chief of the Devils, who, for ſtriving to be as GOD, was caſt down from Heaven, and is now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>with the Reſt of his ſpiritual Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in high Places, to walk up and down, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom he may devour.</hi> We hear of him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Creation, when in the Shape of a Serpent he lay in wait to deceive our firſt Parents.—He is called Satan in the Book of <hi>Job;</hi> wherein we are told, that <hi>when the Sons of GOD came to preſent themſelves before the LORD, Satan alſo came amongſt them.</hi>—As the Scripture alſo ſpeaketh in the Book of <hi>Chronicles, and Satan moved</hi> David <hi>to number the People.—</hi> In the New-Teſtament he goes under different Denominations; ſometimes he is called the <hi>Evil One,</hi> becauſe he is evil in himſelf, and tempts us to Evil.—Sometimes, <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Air, and the Spirit that now ruleth in the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> becauſe he reſides chiefly in the Air; and the whole World, <hi>i. e.</hi>

All that are not born of GOD, are ſaid to lie in him.</p>
                  <p>He is an Enemy to GOD and Goodneſs—He is a Hater of all Truth; why elſe did he ſlander GOD in Paradice? Why did he tell <hi>Eve, You ſhall not ſurely die?</hi> And why did he promiſe to give all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glories of them, to JESUS CHRIST, if he would fall down and worſhip him?</p>
                  <p>He is full of Malice, Envy and Revenge; for what other Motives could induce him to moleſt innocent Man in Paradice? And why is he ſtill ſo Reſtleſs in his Attempts to deſtroy us, who have done him no Wrong?</p>
                  <p>He is a Being of great Power, as appears in his being able to act on the Imagination of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed LORD, ſo as to repreſent to him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glories of them, in a Moment of Time. As alſo in carrying his ſacred Body through the Air up to a Pinnacle of the Temple; and his driving a Herd of Swine ſo furiouſly into the Deep—Nay, ſo great is his Might, that, I doubt not, was GOD to let him uſe his full Strength, he could turn the Earth upſide down, or pull the Sun from its Orb.</p>
                  <p>But what he is moſt remarkable for is, <hi>his Subtlety;</hi> for not having Power given from above to take us by Force, he is obliged to wait for Opportunities to betray us, and to catch us by Guile. He therefore made uſe of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which was ſubtle above all the Beaſts of the Field, in order to tempt our firſt Parents;
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004650_0299_100DD7B793AAF150"/>
and accordingly he is ſaid, in the <hi>New Teſtament, To lie in wait to deceive;</hi> and here in the Words of the Text, the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his Devices;</hi> thereby implying, that we are more in Danger of being ſeduced by his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, than over-borne by his Power.</p>
                  <p>From this ſhort Deſcription of Satan, we may eaſily judge whoſe Children they are, who love to make a Lie, who ſpeak Evil and ſlander their Neighbour, and whoſe Hearts are full of Pride, Subtlety, Malice, Envy, Revenge and all Uncharitableneſs.—Surely they have <hi>Satan</hi> for their Father—For the Tempers of Satan they know; and the Works of Satan they do. But were they to ſee either themſelves, or Satan, as he is, they could not but be terrified at their own Likeneſs, and abhor themſelves in Duſt and Aſhes.</p>
                  <p>But to return. The Juſtice of GOD in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering us to be tempted is vindicated from theſe Conſiderations—That we are here in a State of Probation—That he has promiſed not to ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able to bear—And not only ſo, but to him that overcometh, he will give a Crown of Life.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Angels themſelves, it ſhould ſeem, were once put to a Trial whether they would be faithful or not. The firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> was tempted even in Paradice. And JESUS CHRIST, that ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> though he was a Son, yet was carried, as our Repreſentative, by the Holy Spirit into the Wilderneſs to be tempted of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Paradice amongſt the Goodly Fellowſhip of the Prophets, the glorious Company of the Apoſtles, the noble Army of Martyrs, and the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, who, when on Earth, was not aſſaulted by the fiery Darts of that wicked one, <hi>the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then has been the common Lot of all GOD's children, of the Angels, nay, of the Eternal Son of GOD himſelf, we muſt not think to be exempted from. No, 'tis ſufficient if we are made perfect through Temptations, as they were.—And therefore ſince we cannot but be tempted, unleſs we could unmake Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, inſtead of repining at our Condition, we ſhould rather be enquiring, at what Time of our Lives Satan moſt violently aſſaults us? And what thoſe Devices are, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly makes uſe of, in order <hi>to get an Advantage over us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the <hi>firſt</hi> Queſtion, I anſwer, we muſt expect to be tempted by him, in ſome Degree or other, all our Lives long.—For this Life being a continual Warfare, we muſt never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have Reſt from our Spiritual Adverſary, the Devil; or to ſay, our Combat with him is finiſhed, till, with our bleſſed Maſter, we bow down our Heads, and give up the Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the Time of our Converſion, or firſt entring upon the Spiritual Life, is the moſt critical Time at which he moſt violently beſets us, as well knowing, if he can prevent our ſetting out, he can lead us Captive at his Will; and ſince the wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> particularly

                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Device I ſhall mention which <hi>Satan</hi> makes uſe of, is, <hi>to drive us to Deſpair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When GOD the Father awakens a Sinner by the Terrors of the Law, and by his Holy Spirit convinceth him of Sin, in order to lead him to CHRIST, and ſhew him the Neceſſity of a Redeemer; then <hi>Satan</hi> generally ſtrikes in, and aggravates thoſe Convictions to ſuch a Degree, as to make the Sinner doubt of finding Mercy through the Mediator.</p>
                  <p>Thus, in all his Temptations of the Holy JESUS, he chiefly aimed to make him queſtion, whether he was the Son of GOD? <hi>If thou be the Son of GOD,</hi> ſays he, <hi>do ſo and ſo.</hi> With many ſuch deſponding Thoughts, no doubt, he
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004650_0302_100DD7D1B00B29F0"/>
filled the Heart of the great St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he continued three Days neither eating Bread or drinking Water; and therefore he ſpeaks by Experience, when he ſays, in the Words of the Text, <hi>We are not ignorant of his Devices,</hi> how he will endeavour to drive the inceſtuous Perſon to Deſpair.</p>
                  <p>But let not any of you be influenced by him to deſpair of ſinding Mercy. For it is not the Greatneſs or Number of our Crimes, but Impenitence and Unbelief, that will prove our Ruin: No, <hi>were our Sins more in Number than the Hairs of our Head, or of a deeper Die than the brighteſt Scarlet; yet the Merits of the Death of</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>are infinitely greater, and Faith in his Blood ſhall make them white as Snow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer always therefore his deſpairing Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, as your Bleſſed LORD did, with an <hi>It is written.</hi> Tell him, you know that your Redeemer liveth, ever to make Interceſſion for you; that the LORD hath received from him double for all your Crimes: And tho' you have ſinned much, that is no Reaſon why you ſhould deſpair, but only why you ſhould love much, having ſo much forgiven.</p>
                  <p>Another Device that <hi>Satan</hi> generally makes uſe of, <hi>to get an Advantage over young Converts,</hi> is, to tempt them to preſume, and to think more highly of themſelves than they ought to think.</p>
                  <p>When a Perſon has for ſome little Time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſted the good Word of Life, and felt the

Powers of the World to come, he is commonly (as indeed well he may) moſt highly tranſported with that ſudden Change he finds in himſelf. But then, <hi>Satan</hi> will not be wanting at ſuch a Time, to puff him up with a high Conceit of his own Attainments, as if he was ſome great Perſon; and will tempt him to ſet at nought his Brethren, as though he was holier than they.</p>
                  <p>Take heed therefore, and let us beware of this Device of our ſpiritual Adverſary; for as before Honour is Humility, ſo a haughty Spirit generally goes before a Fall; and GOD is obliged, when under ſuch Circumſtances, to ſend us ſome humbling Viſitation, or permit us to fall, as he did <hi>Peter,</hi> into ſome grievous Sin, that we may learn not to be too high minded.</p>
                  <p>To check therefore all Suggeſtions to Spiritual Pride, let us conſider, that we did not apprehend CHRIST, but were apprehended of him.—That we have nothing but what we have received.—That the free Grace of GOD has alone made the Difference between us and others; and, was GOD to leave us to the Deceitfulneſs of our own Hearts but one Moment, we ſhould become weak and wicked, like other Men.—We ſhould farther conſider, that being proud of Grace, is the moſt ready Way to loſe it.—For GOD reſiſteth the Proud, and giveth more Grace only to the Humble. And were we endowed with the Perfections of <hi>Seraphims;</hi> yet if we were proud of thoſe Perfections, they would but render us more accompliſhed Devils.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004650_0304_100DD7D6F9505530"/>
—Above all, we ſhould pray earneſtly to Almighty GOD, that we may learn of JESUS CHRIST, to be lowly in Heart. That his Grace, through the Subtlety and Deceivableneſs of <hi>Satan,</hi> may not be our Poiſon. But that we may always think ſoberly of ourſelves, as we ought to think.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>third</hi> Device I ſhall mention, which <hi>Satan</hi> generally makes uſe of <hi>to get an Advantage over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi> is to tempt us to Uneaſineſs, and to have hard Thoughts of GOD, when we are under Deadneſs and Dryneſs in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Though this is a Term not underſtood by the Natural Man; yet, whoſoever there are amongſt you, who have paſſed through the Pangs of the <hi>New Birth,</hi> they know full well what I mean, when I talk of Deadneſs and Dryneſs in Prayer. And, I doubt not, but many of you, amongſt whom I am now preaching the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD, are at this very Time labouring under it.</p>
                  <p>For when Perſons are firſt awakened to the Divine Life, becauſe Grace is weak and Nature ſtrong, GOD is often pleaſed to vouchſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>

it will be made known unto you again, either in the Temple, by breaking of Bread, or ſome other Way.</p>
                  <p>But amongſt all the Devices, that <hi>Satan</hi> makes uſe of <hi>to get an Advantage over us,</hi> there is none in which he is more ſucceſsful, or by which he grieves the Children of GOD worſe, than that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourth</hi> Device I am going to mention, <hi>viz.</hi> His troubling you with blaſphemous, prophane, impious, unbelieving Thoughts; and ſometimes to ſuch a Degree, that they are as tormenting as the Rack.</p>
                  <p>Some indeed are apt to impute all ſuch evil Thoughts to a Diſorder of Body.—But thoſe, who know any Thing of the Spiritual Life, can inform you with greater Certainty, that for the Generality, they proceed from that wicked One, <hi>the Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who, no doubt, has Power given him from above, as well now as formerly, to diſorder the Body, as he did <hi>Job'</hi>s; that he may, with the more Secrecy and Succeſs work upon, ruffle and torment the Soul.</p>
                  <p>You that have felt his fiery Darts, can ſubſcribe to the Truth of this, and by fatal Experience can tell, how often he has bid you, <hi>Curſe GOD and die,</hi> and darted into your Thoughts a Thouſand blaſphemous Suggeſtions, even in your moſt ſecret and ſolemn Retirements; the bare looking back on which makes your very Hearts to tremble.</p>
                  <p>I appeal to your own Conſciences; have not ſome of you, when you have been lifting up
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:004650_0307_100DD7E0222852E0"/>
Holy Hands in Prayer, been peſtered with ſuch a Croud of the moſt horrid Inſinuations, that you have been often tempted to riſe off from your Knees, and been made believe your Prayers were an Abomination to the LORD? Nay, when, with the Reſt of your Chriſtian Brethren, you have crouded round the Holy Table, and taken the ſacred Symbols of CHRIST'S moſt bleſſed Body and Blood into your Hands, inſtead of remembring the Death of your Saviour, have you not been employed in driving out evil Thoughts, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was in driving away the Birds, that came to devour his Sacrifice; and thereby been terrified, leſt you have eat and drank your own Damnation?</p>
                  <p>But marvel not, as though ſome ſtrange Thing happened unto you; for this has been the common Lot of all GOD's Children.—We read even in <hi>Job'</hi>s Time, <hi>That when the Sons of GOD came to appear before their Maker,</hi> i. e. at public Worſhip, <hi>Satan alſo came amongſt them, to diſturb their Devotions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And think not that GOD is angry with you for theſe diſtracting, tho' ever ſo blaſphemous Thoughts: No, he knows it is not you, but <hi>Satan</hi> working in you, and therefore, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he may be diſpleaſed with, and certainly will puniſh him; yet he will both pity and reward you. And though it be difficult to make Perſons in your Circumſtances to believe ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet, I doubt not, but you are more acceptable to GOD, when performing your holy Duties in the midſt of ſuch involuntary Diſtractions,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:004650_0308_100DDD760926E158"/>
than when you are wrapped up by ſenſible Devotion, as it were, into the third Heavens.—For you are then ſuffering, as well as doing the Will of GOD at the ſame Time; and, like <hi>Nehemiah'</hi>s Servants at the Building of the Temple, are holding a Trowel in the one Hand, and a Sword in the other.—But be not you driven from the Uſe of any Ordinance whatever, on account of thoſe abominable Suggeſtions; for then you let <hi>Satan</hi> get his deſired Advantage over you; it being his chief Deſign, by theſe Thoughts, to make you fall out with the Means of Grace; and to tempt you to believe, you do not pleaſe GOD, for no other Reaſon, than becauſe you do not pleaſe yourſelves.—Rather perſevere in the Uſe of the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion eſpecially, and all other Means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and when theſe Temptations have wrought that Reſignation in you, for which they were permitted, GOD will viſit you with freſh Tokens of his Love, as he met <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he returned from the Slaughter of the five Kings; and will ſend an Angel from Heaven, as he did to his Son, on Purpoſe to ſtrengthen you.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have only obſerved ſuch Devices as <hi>Satan</hi> makes uſe of immediately by himſelf; but there is a</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifth</hi> I ſhall mention, that is not the leaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Tempting us by our carnal Friends and Relations.</p>
                  <p>This is one of the moſt common, as well as moſt artful Devices he makes uſe of to draw
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004650_0309_100DDD789FA76C90"/>
young Converts from GOD; for when he cannot prevail over them by himſelf, he will try what he can do by the Influence and Mediation of others.</p>
                  <p>Thus he tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> that ſhe might tempt <hi>Adam.</hi>—Thus he ſtirred up <hi>Job'</hi>s Wife, to bid him <hi>Curſe GOD and die.</hi>—And thus he made uſe of <hi>Peter'</hi>s Tongue, to perſuade our Bleſſed LORD <hi>To ſpare himſelf,</hi> and thereby decline thoſe Sufferings, by which alone we could be preſerved from ſuffering the Vengeance of Eternal Fire. And thus, in theſe laſt Days, he often ſtirs up our moſt powerful Friends and deareſt Intimates, to diſſuade us from going in that narrow Way, which alone leadeth unto Life eternal,</p>
                  <p>But our Bleſſed LORD has furniſhed us with a ſufficient Anſwer to all ſuch Suggeſtions.—<hi>Get you behind me, my Adverſaries;</hi> for otherwiſe they will be an Offence unto you; and the only Reaſon why they give ſuch Advice is, becauſe they ſavour not the Things that be of GOD, but the Things that be of Men.</p>
                  <p>Whoever therefore among you are reſolved to ſerve the LORD, prep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>, your Souls for many ſuch Temptations as thoſe; for it is neceſſary that ſuch Offences ſhould come, to try your Sincerity, to teach us to ceaſe from Man, and to ſee if we will forſake all to follow CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Indeed our Moderniſers o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Chriſtianity would perſwade us, that the Goſpel was calculated
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:004650_0310_100DDD7B22296838"/>
only for about two hundred Years; and that now there is no need of hating Father and Mother, or being perſecuted for the Sake of CHRIST and his Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch Perſons err, not knowing the Scriptures, and the Power of Godlineſs in their Hearts; for whoſoever receives the Love of GOD in the Truth of it, will find, that CHRIST came to ſend not Peace, but a Sword upon Earth, as much now as ever.—That the Father-in-law ſhall be againſt the Daughter-in-law, in theſe latter, as well as in the primitive Times; and that if we will live godly in CHRIST JESUS, we muſt, as then, ſo now, from carnal Friends and Relations, ſuffer Perſecution.</p>
                  <p>But the Devil has another Device, as dangerous as any of the former,—<hi>i. e.</hi> by not tempting us at all, or rather by withdrawing himſelf for a while, in order to come upon us at an Hour when we think not of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is ſaid, that he left JESUS CHRIST only for a Seaſon; and our Bleſſed LORD has bid us to watch and pray always, that we enter not into Temptation; thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that Satan, whether we think of it or not, is always ſeeking how he may devour us.</p>
                  <p>If we would therefore behave like good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST, we muſt be always upon our guard, and never pretend to lay down our ſpiritual Weapons of Prayer and Watching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till our Warfare is accompliſhed
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:004650_0311_100DDD7DCC5F6B60"/>
by Death; for if we do, our ſpiritual <hi>Amaleck</hi> will quickly prevail againſt us. What if he has left us? It is only for a Seaſon; yet, a little while, and, like a roaring Lion, with double Fury, he will break out upon us again.—So great a Coward as the Devil is, he ſeldom leaves us at the firſt Onſet.—As he followed our Bleſſed LORD with one Temptation after another, ſo will he treat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and to go on from conquering to conquer. Our Glory does not conſiſt in being exempted from, but in enduring Temptations. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that endureth Temptation;</hi> and again, <hi>Brethren, count it all Joy, when you fall into divers Temptations:</hi> And in that perfect Form our bleſſed LORD has preſcribed to us, we are taught to pray, not ſo much to be delivered from all Temptation, as from the Evil of it.

                  <p>But behold the Goodneſs, as well as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of GOD! For no ſooner had Man been convicted as a Sinner, but lo! a Saviour is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him, under the Character of the Seed of the Woman, the Merits of whoſe Sacrifice was then immediately to take Place, and who ſhould, in the Fulneſs of Time, by ſuffering Death, ſatisfy for the Guilt we had contracted; and by becoming a Principle of new Life in us, ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's Head, deſtroy the Power of the Devil within us, and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore us to a better State than that in which we were at firſt created.</p>

Suppoſing GOD then only to have our Goodneſs, he could not, at firſt, make us ſo ſinful, ſo polluted as we are.

                  <p>I know this Doctrine of our original Sin, or Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> is eſteemed Fooliſhneſs by the wiſe Diſputer of this World, who will reply, <hi>How does it ſuit with the Goodneſs of GOD to

impute one Man's Sin to an innocent Poſterity?</hi> But has it not been proved to a Demonſtration, that it is ſo? And therefore, ſuppoſing we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reconcile it to our ſhallow Comprehenſions, that is no Argument at all: For if it appears that GOD has done a Thing, we may be ſure it is right, whether we can ſee the Reaſons for it or not.</p>
                  <p>But this is intirely cleared up by what was ſaid before, that no ſooner was the Sin imputed, but a Mediator was revealed; ſo that as in <hi>Adam</hi> all died, even ſo in CHRIST all might be made alive.</p>
                  <p>That CHRIST then, this GOD incarnate, who was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, that he might be freed from the Guilt of our original Sin; who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that he might be the Seed of the Woman only, who ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> a <hi>Gentile</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, to fulfil thoſe Propheſies, which ſignified what Death he ſhould die—This ſame JESUS, who was crucified in Weakneſs, but raiſed in Power, is that Divine Perſon, that <hi>Immanuel,</hi> that <hi>GOD with us,</hi> whom we preach, in whom you believe, and whom alone the Apoſtle, in the Text, was determined to know.</p>
                  <p>By which Word <hi>Know,</hi> we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a bare hiſtorical Knowledge (for to know that CHRIST was crucified by his Enemies at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in this Manner only, will do us no more Service than to know that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly butchered by his Friends at <hi>Rome</hi>) but the Word <hi>Know,</hi> means to know, ſo as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This Knowledge the Apoſtle was ſo ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in, that he was determined not to know any Thing elſe; that is, He was reſolved to make that his only Study—the governing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his Life, the Point and End in which all his Thoughts, Words, and Actions, ſhould center.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Without this, our Perſons will not be accepted in the Sight of GOD. This, and conſequently this only, is Life Eternal, ſays our Bleſſed LORD himſelf, <hi>to know thee, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true GOD, and</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> As alſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>There is now no other Name given under Heaven whereby we can be ſaved, but that of</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</p>

Some indeed, may pleaſe themſelves in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World, others boaſt themſelves in the Knowledge of a Multitude of Languages; but could we ſpeak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, or did we know the Number of the Stars, and could call them all by their Names, yet, without this experimental Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and him crucified,</hi> it would profit us nothing.</p>
                  <p>The former, indeed, may procure us a little Honour, which cometh of Man; but the latter only can render us acceptable in the Sight of GOD: For, if we are ignorant of CHRIST, GOD will be to us a conſuming Fire.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST is Way, the Truth, and the Life; no one cometh to the Father but through him—He is the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World, and none ever were, or ever will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up into Glory, but by an experimental Application of his Merits to their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>We might as well think to rebuild the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> or reach Heaven with our Hands, as to imagine to enter therein by any other Door than that of <hi>the Knowledge of</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Other Knowledge may make you wiſe in your own Eyes, and puff you up; but this alone edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and maketh wiſe unto Salvation.</p>
                  <p>As the meaneſt Chriſtian, if he knows but this, though he know nothing elſe, will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; ſo the greateſt Maſter in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the moſt Letter-learned Teacher, without this, will be rejected. His Philoſophy is mere Nonſenſe, his Wiſdom mere Fooliſhneſs in the Sight of GOD.</p>

The Author of the Words now before us, was a remarkable Inſtance of this; never, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, was a greater Scholar, in all what the World calls fine Learning, than he: For he was bred up at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and profited in the Knowledge of Books, as well as in the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Religion, above many of his Equals, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Language, Rhetorick, and Spirit of his Writings; and yet, when he came to know what it was to be a Chriſtian, <hi>He accounted all Things but Loſs, ſo he might win</hi> CHRIST. And, though he was now at <hi>Corin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence then, appears the Folly of thoſe who ſpend their whole Lives in heaping up other Knowledge; and inſtead of ſearching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which teſtify of JESUS CHRIST, and are alone able to make them wiſe unto Salvation, diſquiet themſelves in a Purſuit after the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch Things, as when known, concern them no more, than to know that a Bird drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a Feather upon one of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that ſo many, who profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſe, becauſe they can diſpute of the Cauſes and Effects, the moral Fitneſs and Unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Things, appear mere Fools in the Things of GOD; ſo that when you come to converſe with them about the great Work of Redemption wrought out for us by JESUS CHRIST, of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a Propitiation for our Sins, and a Principle of new Life to our Souls, they are quite ignorant of the whole Matter, and prove, to a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, with all their Learning, they know nothing yet as they ought to know.</p>
                  <p>But, good GOD! how muſt it ſurpriſe a Man, when the Moſt High is about to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Soul, to think that he has paſſed for a wiſe Man, and a learned Diſputer in this World, and yet is left deſtitute of that Knowledge which alone can make him appear with Boldneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment-Seat of JESUS CHRIST? How muſt it grieve him, in a future State, to ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom he deſpiſed as unlearned and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Men, becauſe they experimentally <hi>knew</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and him crucified,</hi> exalted to the Right Hand of GOD, and himſelf, with all his ſine Accompliſhments, becauſe he knew every Thing, perhaps, but CHRIST, thruſt down into Hell?</p>
                  <p>Well might the Apoſtle, in a holy Triumph cry out, <hi>Where is the Wiſe? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Diſputer of this World?</hi> For, GOD will then make fooliſh the Wiſdom of this World, and bring to nought the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of thoſe who were ſo knowing in their own Eyes.</p>
                  <p>I made this Digreſſion from the main Point before us, not to condemn or deny human Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, but to ſhew, that it ought to be uſed only in Subordination to divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that a Chriſtian, if the holy Spirit guided the Pen of the Apoſtle when he wrote this Epiſtle, ought to ſtudy no Books, but ſuch as lead him into a farther

                  <p>And there is the more Reaſon for this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great Miſchief the contrary Practice has done to the Church of GOD: For, what was it but this Learning, or rather this Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that kept ſo many of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> from the ſaving Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST? And what is it, but this human Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, this Science, falſly ſo called, that blinds the Underſtanding, and corrupts the Hearts of ſo many modern Unbelievers, and makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſubmit to the Righteouſneſs which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS!</p>

                  <p>Farther, as our Devotions to GOD will not, ſo neither, without this Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, will our Acts of Charity to Men be accepted by him.</p>
                  <p>For did we give all our Goods to feed the Poor, and yet were deſtitute of this Knowledge, it would profit us nothing.</p>
                  <p>This our Bleſſed LORD himſelf intimates in the 25th of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he tells thoſe that had been rich in good Works, <hi>That in as much as they did it unto one of the leaſt of his Brethren, they did it unto him.</hi> From whence we may plainly infer, that it is ſeeing CHRIST in his Members, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to them out of an experimental Knowledge of his Love to us, that alone will render our Alms-Deeds rewardable at the laſt Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As neither our Acts of Piety nor Charity, ſo neither will our civil nor moral Actions be acceptable to GOD without this experimental Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Our modern Pretenders to Reaſon, indeed, ſet up another Principle to act from; they talk, I Know not what, <q>Of doing moral and civil Duties of Life, from the moral Fitneſs and Unfitneſs of Things.</q> But ſuch Men are blind, however they may pretend to ſee; and going thus about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, are utterly ignorant
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:004650_0327_100DDDA7F14BC428"/>
of the Righteouſneſs which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS.</p>
                  <p>For though we grant, that Morality is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Part of Chriſtianity, and that CHRIST came not to deſtroy, <hi>i. e.</hi> not to take off the Force of the moral Law, as a Rule of Action, but to explain, and ſo fulfil it; yet we affirm, that our moral and civil Actions are now no farther acceptable in the Sight of GOD the Father, than as they proceed from a Principle of a new Nature, and an experimental Knowledge of, or vital Faith in his dear Son.</p>
                  <p>For the Death of JESUS CHRIST has turned our whole Lives into one continued Sacrifice; and whether we eat or drink, whether we pray to GOD, or do any Thing to Man, it muſt all be done out of a Love for, and Knowledge of him who died and roſe again, to render all, even our moſt ordinary Deeds, acceptable in the Sight of GOD.</p>
                  <p>If we live by this Principle, if CHRIST be the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of all our Actions, then our moſt indifferent ones are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifices; but if this Principle be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our moſt pompous Services avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. We are but ſpiritual Idolaters—we ſacrifice to our own Net—we make an Idol of ourſelves, by making ourſelves, and not CHRIST, the End of our Actions; and therefore ſuch Actions are ſo far from being accepted by GOD, that, according to the Language of one of the Articles of our Church, <hi>We doubt not but they have the

                  <p>Value not then the Contempt of Friends, which you muſt neceſſarily meet with upon your open Profeſſion to act according to this Determination.

                  <p>It is neceſſary that Offences ſhould come, to try what is in our Hearts, and whether we will be faithful Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST, or not.</p>

                  <p>THE Perſons to whom theſe Words were written, were the People of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who being, as we are told in the <hi>Acts,</hi> Worſhippers of the great Goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi> in all Probability worſhipped the God <hi>Bacchus</hi> alſo; at the Celebration of whoſe Feſtivals, it was always cuſtomary, nay, part of their Religion, to get drunk; as though there was no other Way to pleaſe their God, but by turning themſelves into Brutes.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle therefore, in this Chapter, amongſt many other Precepts more eſpecially applicable to them, lays down that in the Text; and exhorts them, as they had now, by the free Grace of GOD, been turned from heatheniſh Darkneſs to the Light of the Goſpel, to walk <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the Contrary, ſtrive to be filled with the Spirit of that Saviour, after whoſe Name they were now called, and whoſe Religion taught them to abſtain from ſuch a filthy Sin, and to live ſoberly as they ought to live.</p>
                  <p>By the World being now Chriſtian, and the Doctrines of the Goſpel every where received, one would imagine, there ſhould be no Reaſon for repeating the Precepts now before us. But alas, Chriſtians! I mean Chriſtians falſly ſo called, are ſo led captive by all Sin in general, and by this of Drunkenneſs in particular, that was St. <hi>Paul</hi> to riſe again from the Dead, he might be tempted to think moſt of us were turned back to the Worſhip of dumb Idols; that we had ſet up Temples in Honour of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and made it Part of our Religion, as the <hi>Epheſians</hi> did of theirs, <hi>to be drunk with Wine wherein is Exceſs.</hi>

                  <p>Our civil Magiſtrates have not been wanting to uſe the Power given them from above, for the Puniſhment and Reſtraint of ſuch evil Doings; and I wiſh it could be ſaid this Plague of Drinking, by what they have done, had been ſtayed amongſt us. But alas! though their Labour, we truſt, has not been altogether in vain in the LORD, yet Thouſands, and I could almoſt ſay, ten Thouſands fall daily at our Right Hand, by this Sin of Drunkenneſs, in our Streets; nay, Men ſeem to have made a Covenant with Hell, and though the Power of the civil Magiſtrate is exerted againſt them; nay, and though they cannot but daily ſee

the Companions of their Riot hourly by this, brought to the Grave, yet they <hi>will riſe up early to follow ſtrong Drink, and cry, To Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhall be as to Day, and ſo much the more abundantly; when we awake, we will ſeek it yet again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is high Time therefore, for thy Miniſters to lift up their Voices like a Trumpet, and ſince human Threats cannot prevail, to ſet before them the Terrors of the LORD, and try if theſe will not perſuade them to ceaſe from the Evil of their Doings.</p>
                  <p>But alas! how ſhall I addreſs myſelf to them? I fear Exceſs of Drinking has made them ſuch mere <hi>Nabals,</hi> that there is no ſpeaking to them.

For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Drunkenneſs is a Sin which muſt be highly diſpleaſing to GOD; becauſe it is an Abuſe of his good Creatures.</p>
                  <p>When GOD firſt made Man, and had breathed into him the Breath of Life, he gave him Dominion over the Works of his Hands, and every Herb bearing Seed, and every Tree, in which was the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed, to him it was given for Meat; but when <hi>Adam</hi> had taſted the forbidden Fruit, which was the only Reſtraint laid upon him, he forfeited this Priviledge, and had no Right, ſince he had diſobeyed his Creator, to the Uſe of any one of the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>But, bleſſed be GOD, this Charter, as well as all other Privileges, is reſtored to us by the Death of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> our LORD and Maſter JESUS CHRIST. Of every Beaſt of the Field, every Fiſh of the Sea, and whatſoever f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

For GOD, by the Death of JESUS, has given no Man Licenſe to be intemperate; but, on the contrary, has laid us under the ſtrongeſt Obligations to live ſoberly, as well as godly in this preſent World.</p>
                  <p>But the Drunkard, deſpiſing the Goodneſs and Bounty of GOD, in reſtoring to us what we had ſo juſtly forfeited, turns his Grace into Wantonneſs; and as though the Creature was not of itſelf enough ſubject to Vanity, by being

Curſed for our Sake, he abuſes it ſtill more, by making it adminiſter to his Luſts; and turns that Wine which was intended to make glad his Heart, into a deadly Poiſon.</p>
                  <p>But thinkeſt thou, O Drunkard, whoſoever thou art, thou ſhalt eſcape the righteous Judgment of GOD? No, the Time will ſhortly come that thou muſt be no longer Steward, aud then the Sovereign Lord of all the Earth will reckon with thee for thus waſting his Goods. Alas! wilt thou then wreſt Scripture any longer to thy own Damnation? And becauſe JESUS CHRIST turned Water into Wine at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Feaſt, to ſupply the Wants of his indigent Hoſt, ſay, that it is therefore meet to make merry, and be drunken. No, thou ſhalt be ſilent before him; and know, that tho' thou haſt encouraged thyſelf in Drunkenneſs by ſuch like Arguments, yet for all theſe Things GOD will bring thee into Judgment.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> What makes Drunkenneſs more exceeding ſinful, is, that a Man, by falling into it, ſinneth againſt his own Body.</p>

Nay, I appeal to yourſelves. Are not many, for this Cauſe, even now ſickly among you? And have not many of your Companions whom you once ſaw flouriſhing, like green Bay Trees, been brought by it, with Sorrow, to their Graves?</p>
                  <p>We might perhaps, think ourſelves hardly dealt with by GOD, was he to ſend to us, as he did to the Royal Pſalmiſt, to chooſe one Plague out of three, whereby we ſhould be deſtroyed. But had the Almighty decreed to cut off Man from the Face of the Earth, and to ſhorten his Days, he could not well ſend a more effectual Plague, than to permit Men, as they pleaſed, to overcharge themſelves with Drunkenneſs; for tho' it be a ſlow, yet it is a certain Poiſon. And if the Sword has ſlain its Thouſands, Drunkenneſs has ſlain its ten Thouſands.</p>
                  <p>And will not this alarm you, O ye Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors? Will not this perſuade you to ſpare

You ſeem to have a great Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for your Bodies, why otherwiſe to gratify their inordinate Appetites, do you drink to Exceſs? But ſurely, if you truly loved them, you would not thus deſtroy them; and was there no other Argument to be urged againſt Drunkenneſs, the Conſideration that it will deſtroy thoſe Lives you are ſo fond of, one would imagine, ſhould be ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>I know, indeed, that it is a common Anſwer that Drunkards make to thoſe, who, out of Love, would pull them as Firebrands out of the Fire, <hi>We are no Body's Enemy but our own.</hi> But this, inſtead of being an Excuſe for, is but an Aggravation of their Guilt: For (not to mention that the Drunkenneſs of one Man has cloathed many a Family with Rags, and that it is ſcarce poſſible for a Perſon to be drunk, without tempting his Neighbour alſo) I ſay, not to mention theſe, and many other ill Conſequences, which would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What renders Drunkenneſs more inexcuſeable, is, that it robs a Man of his Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon is the Glory of a Man; the chief Thing whereby GOD has made us to differ from the Brute Creation. And our modern Unbelievers have exalted it to ſuch a high Degree, as even to ſet it in Oppoſition to Revelation, and deny the LORD that bought them. But though in doing this, they greatly err, and whilſt they profeſs themſelves wiſe, become real Fools; yet we muſt acknowledge, that Reaſon is the Candle of the LORD, and whoſoever puts it out, ſhall bear his Puniſhment, whoſoever he be.</p>

                  <p>The very Heathen Kings were ſo ſenſible of this, that, in order to deter their young Princes from drinking, they uſed to make their Slaves get drunk, and be expoſed before them. And didſt thou but ſee thine own Picture, O Drunkard, when, after having drowned thy
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004650_0339_100DDDC7CBFD8CB0"/>
Reaſon, thou ſtaggereſt to and fro, like one of the Fools in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſeeſt thy very Companions making Songs upon thee, ſurely thou wouldſt not return to thy Vomit again, but abhor thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Duſt and Aſhes!</p>
                  <p>When <hi>David,</hi> in a Holy Ecſtaſy, was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before the Ark, <hi>Michal, Saul'</hi>s Daughter, deſpiſed him in her Heart; and when he came home, ſhe ſaid, <hi>How glorious was the King of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to Day, who uncovered himſelf to Day in the Eyes of the Handmaids of his Servants, as one of the vain Fellows ſhameleſly uncovereth himſelf.</hi> And may not every one that meets a Drunkard, more juſtly ſay, <hi>How glorious does he, that was made a little lower than the Angels, look to Day, when unmindful of his Dignity, he has, by drinking, robbed himſelf of his Reaſon, and reduced himſelf to a Level with the Beaſts that periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what if GOD, in the Midſt of one of theſe drunken Fits, ſhould arreſt thee by Death, and ſay unto thee, <hi>Thou Fool, this Moment ſhall thy Soul be required of thee.</hi> Oh!

that he will come at an Hour thou lookeſt not for him; and ſince his Goodneſs and Long-Suffering has not led thee to Repentance, he will cut thee down, and not permit thee to cumber the Ground any longer.

                  <p>But, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is a farther Aggravation of this Crime, that it is an Inlet to, and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of many other Sins; for it ſeldom comes alone.</p>
                  <p>We may ſay of Drunkenneſs, as <hi>Solomon</hi> does of Strife, that it is like the letting out of Water; for we know not what will be the End thereof. Its Name is <hi>Legion:</hi> For behold a Troop of Sins cometh after it. And for my own Part, when I ſee a Drunkard, I can ſcarce, with the holy Prophet, when he looked in <hi>Hazael'</hi>s Face, forbear weeping, to conſider how many Vices he may fall into, e'er he comes to himſelf again.</p>

                     </gap>d Inceſt did righteous <hi>Lot</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit with his own Daughters when they had made him drunk? And, I doubt not, but there are many amongſt you, who have committed ſuch Crimes when you have deprived yourſelves of your Reaſon by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that were you to hear of them, your Heart, like <hi>Nabal</hi>'s, after he was told how he had abuſed <hi>David</hi> when he was drunk, would die within you.

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:004650_0341_100DDDCDD7676CB0"/>
when you were ſober, that you would have been guilty of ſuch Crimes, you would have cried out, with <hi>Hazael</hi> before mentioned, <hi>Are thy Servants ſo many Dogs, that they ſhould do thus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But no marvel that Drunkards commit ſuch Crimes: For Drunkenneſs drives the Holy Spirit from them: they become mere Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines for the Devil to work up to what he pleaſes; he enters into them, as he entred into the Herd of Swine; and no Wonder if they then commit all Uncleanneſs, and any other Crime, with Greedineſs. But this leads me to a</p>

                     <hi>Fifth</hi> Conſideration, which highly aggravates the Sin of Drunkenneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> That it ſeparates the holy Spirit from us.</p>

                  <p>But now Drunkards, do, in Effect, bid this Bleſſed Spirit depart from them: For what has he to do with ſuch filthy Swine? No, they have no Lot or Share in the Spirit

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle therefore, in the Words of the Text, exhorts the <hi>Epheſians, not to be drunk with Wine, wherein is Exceſs, but to be filled with the Spirit;</hi> thereby implying, that Drunkenneſs and the Spirit of GOD could never dwell in the ſame Heart. And in another Epiſtle, he bids them <hi>avoid unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Converſation, as a Thing which grieved the Holy Spirit; whereby alone they could be ſealed to the Day of Redemption.</hi> And if unprofitable Converſation grieves the Holy Spirit, at what an infinite Diſtance muſt Drunkenneſs drive him from the Hearts of Men?</p>
                  <p>But oh that you were wiſe! That you would conſider what a dreadful Thing it is to have the Spirit of the Living GOD depart from you: For, aſſure yourſelves, if you live without him, you live without GOD in the World.

                  <p>To ſee and enjoy GOD, and to be like the bleſſed Angels, always beholding the Face of our Heavenly Father, in the Glories of his Kingdom, is ſuch an unſpeakable Happineſs, that even wicked Men, though they will not live the Life of the Righteous, cannot but wiſh their future State to be like his.</p>

For Self- indulgence lulls the Soul into a ſpiritual Slumber, as well as direct Intemperance; and though the latter may expoſe us to more Contempt among Men, yet the former, if continued in, will as certainly ſhut us out from the Preſence of GOD. St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew this full well; and therefore, though he was the ſpiritual Father of Thouſands, and was near upon finiſhing his Courſe, yet he ſays, it was his daily Practice to keep his Body under, and bring it into Subjection, no doubt, by a ſtrict Abſtinence and Faſting; not that he might arrive at higher Degrees of Perfection, but le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

JESUS CHRIST, in the ſame Manner as learned Men read <hi>Caeſar's Commentaries,</hi> or <hi>the Conqueſts of Alexander;</hi> as Things rather intended to afford Matter for Speculation, than to be acted over again in and by us.</p>
                  <p>As this is true of the Doctrines of the Goſpel in general, ſo it is in particular of the Operations of GOD's Spirit upon the Hearts of Believers for we no ſooner mention the Neceſſity of our receiving the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in theſe laſt Days, as well as formerly; but we are look'd upon by ſome, as Enthuſiaſts and Madmen; and, by others, repreſented as wilfully deceiving the People, and undermining the eſtabliſhed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Judge ye then, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> whether it is not high Time for the true Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST, who have been themſelves made Partakers of this heavenly Gift, to lift up their Voices like a Trumpet; and if they would not have thoſe Souls periſh for which the LORD JESUS has ſhed his precious Blood, to declare with all Boldneſs, that the Holy Spirit is the common Privilege and Portion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

Tabernacles. Our LORD (herein leading all an Example) attended on the Temple-ſervice in general, and the Feſtivals of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in particular.—The Feſtival at which he was now preſent, was that of the Feaſt of Tabernacles which the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved according to GOD's Appointment in Commemoration of their living in Tents.—At the laſt Day of this Feaſt it was cuſtomary for many pious People to fetch Water from a certain Place, and bring it on their Heads, ſinging this Anthem out of <hi>Iſaiah, And with Joy ſhall they draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</hi>—Our dear Lord JESUS obſerving this, and it being his conſtant Practice to ſpiritualize every Thing he met with, cries out, <hi>If any Man thirſteth, let him come unto me, rather than unto that Well, and drink.—He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſpoken,</hi> (where it is ſaid, GOD will make Water ſpring out of a dry Rock, and ſuch like) <hi>out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water.</hi>—And that we might know what our Saviour meant by this living Water, the Evangeliſt immediately adds, <hi>But this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                  <p>By the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is to be underſtood the third Perſon in the ever bleſſed Trinity, conſubſtantial and co-eternal with the Father and the Son, proceeding from, yet equal to them both—For to uſe the Words of our Church in this Day's Office, that which we believe of the Glory of the <hi>Father,</hi> the ſame we believe of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> without any Difference or Inequality.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſays St.<hi>John,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. v. Ver. 7. <hi>There are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the</hi> Father, <hi>the</hi> Word, <hi>and the</hi> Holy Ghoſt, <hi>and theſe Three are one.</hi> And our LORD when he gave his Apoſtles Commiſſion to go and teach all Nations, commands them to baptize in the Name of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi>—And St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> v. Ver.3. ſaid to <hi>Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thine Heart to lie to the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> And, Ver.4. he ſays, <hi>Thou haſt not lied unto Men, but unto GOD.</hi>—From all which Paſſages, it is plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is truly and properly GOD, as well as the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> This is an unſpeakable Myſtery, but a Myſtery of GOD's revealing, and therefore to be aſſented to
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:004650_0354_100DDDEFB8B760F0"/>
with our whole Hearts.—Seeing GOD is not a Man that he ſhould lie, nor the Son of Man that he ſhould deceive.</p>
                  <p>I proceed, <hi>Secondly,</hi> to prove that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is the common Privilege of all Believers.</p>
                  <p>But, here I would not be underſtood of ſo receiving the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as to enable us to work Miracles, or ſhew outward Signs and Wonders. For I allow our Adverſaries, that to pretend to be inſpired, in this Senſe, is being wiſe above what is written. Perhaps it cannot be proved, that GOD ever interpoſed in this extraordinary Manner, but when ſome new Revelation was to be eſtabliſhed, as at the firſt ſettling of the Moſaick and Goſpel Diſpenſation.—And as for my own Part, I cannot but ſuſpect the Spirit of thoſe who inſiſt upon a Repetition of ſuch Miracles at this Time.—For the World being now become nominally Chriſtian, at leaſt, (though GOD knows, little of the Power is left among us) there need not outward Miracles, but only an inward Co-operation of the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> with the <hi>Word,</hi> to prove that JESUS is that <hi>Meſſiah</hi> which was to come into the World.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is poſſible for thee, O Man, to have Faith, ſo as to be able to remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or caſt out Devils; nay, thou mighteſt ſpeak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, yea, and bid the Sun ſtand ſtill in the midſt of Heaven; yet, what would all theſe Gifts of the Spirit avail thee, without being made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his ſanctifying Graces? <hi>Saul</hi> had the
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:004650_0355_100DDDF241338A78"/>
Spirit of Government for a while, ſo as to become another Man, and yet was a Caſtaway.—And many, who caſt out Devils in CHRIST's Name, at the laſt will be diſowned by him. If therefore thou hadſt only the Gifts, but was deſtitute of the Graces of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they would only ſerve to lead thee with ſo much the more Solemnity to Hell.</p>
                  <p>Here then, I ſay, we join iſſue with our Adverſaries, and will readily grant, that we are not in this Senſe to be inſpired, as were our LORD's firſt Apoſtles. But unleſs Men have Eyes which ſee not, and Ears which hear not, how can they read the latter Part of the Text, and not confeſs that the Holy Spirit, in another Senſe, is the common Privilege of all Believers, even to the End of the World?—<hi>This ſpake be of the Spirit, which they that believe on him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I ſay all his true Followers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—For it is evident from our LORD's own Words, that he had us and all Believers in View, when he put up this Prayer.—<hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their Word;</hi> ſo that, unleſs we treat our LORD as the High Prieſts did, and count him a Blaſphemer; we muſt confeſs, that all who believe in JESUS CHRIST, through the Word or Miniſtration of the Apoſtles, are to be joyned to JESUS CHRIST, by being made Partakers of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>There's a great Noiſe made of late, about the Word <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> and it has been caſt upon the Preachers of the Goſpel, as a Term of Reproach.—But every Chriſtian, in the proper Senſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For who dares ſay, he is a Chriſtian, till he can ſay, <hi>GOD is in me?</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, we have many great and precious Promiſes, that we may be made Partakers of the Divine Nature.—Our LORD prays, <hi>that we may be one, as the Father and He are One;</hi> and our own Church, in Conformity to theſe Texts of Scripture, in her excellent Communion-Office,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:004650_0357_100DDDF67A66ED80"/>
tells us, that thoſe who receive the Sacrament worthily, <q>dwell in CHRIST, and CHRIST in them; that they are one with CHRIST, and CHRIST with them.</q>—And yet Chriſtians in general, muſt have their Names caſt out as Evil, and Miniſters in particular muſt be looked upon as Deceivers of the People, for affirming, that we muſt be really united to GOD, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Indeed, I will not ſay, our Letter-learned Preachers deny this Doctrine in expreſs Words.—But however, they do it in Effect.—For they talk profeſſedly againſt inward Feelings, and ſay, we may have GOD's Spirit without feeling it, which is in Reality to deny the Thing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—And had I a Mind to hinder the Progreſs of the Goſpel, and to eſtabliſh the Kingdom of Darkneſs, I would go about, telling People, they might have the Spirit of GOD, and yet not feel it.</p>

Reaſon, and is capable, to thoſe who have Eyes to ſee, even of a Demonſtration—I ſay of a Demonſtration: For it ſtands on this Self-evident Suppoſition, that we are fallen Creatures, or, to uſe the Scripture-Expreſſion, <hi>Have all died in</hi> Adam.</p>
                  <p>I know indeed 'tis now no uncommon thing amongſt us, to deny the Doctrine of original Sin, as well as the Divinity of JESUS CHRIST, who is GOD over all, bleſſed forever—But it is incumbent on thoſe who deny it, firſt to diſprove the Authority of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—If thou canſt prove, thou Unbeliever, that the Book, which we call <hi>The Bible,</hi> does not contain the lively Oracles of GOD; if thou canſt ſhew, that holy Men of Old, did not write this Book, as they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt, then will we give up the Doctrine of original Sin—But unleſs thou canſt do this, we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it, that we are all conceived and born in Sin; if for no other, yet for this one Reaſon, becauſe that GOD, who cannot lye, has told us ſo.</p>

deny there is any ſuch Thing as Influences of the Holy Spirit that may be felt. For if they will grant that the Devil worketh, and that ſo as to be felt in the Hearts of the Children of Diſobedience (which they muſt grant, unleſs they will give an Apoſtle the Lie) where is the Wonder that the good Spirit ſhould have the ſame Power over thoſe that are truly obedient to the Faith of JESUS CHRIST?</p>
                  <p>But to return. If it be true then, that we are all by Nature a Motly Mixture of Brute and Devil, it is evident, that we all muſt receive the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> e'er we can dwell with and enjoy GOD.</p>
                  <p>When you read how the Prodigal in the Goſpel was reduced to ſo low a Condition, as to eat Husks with Swine, and how <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> was turned out, to graze with Oxen, I am confident, you pity their unhappy State. And when you hear, how JESUS CHRIST will ſay, at the laſt Day, to all that are not born again of GOD, <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> do not your Hearts ſhrink within you, with a ſecret Horror? And if Creatures with only our Degree of Goodneſs cannot bear, even the Thoughts of dwelling with Beaſts or Devils, to whoſe Nature we are ſo nearly allied, how do we imagine, GOD, who is infinite Goodneſs and Purity itſelf, can dwell with us, while we are Partakers of both their
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:004650_0365_100DDE0CADFDF8B8"/>
Natures? We might as well think to reconcile Heaven and Hell.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten the forbidden Fruit, he fled and hid himſelf from GOD. Why? becauſe he was naked; that is, he was alienated from the Life of GOD, the due Puniſhment of his Diſobedience. Now we are all by Nature naked and void of GOD, as he was at that Time, and conſequently, till we are changed, and cloathed upon by a Divine Nature again, we muſt fly from GOD alſo.</p>
                  <p>Hence then appears the Reaſonableneſs of our being obliged to receive the Spirit of GOD. It is founded on the Doctrine of Original Sin. And therefore you will always find that thoſe who talk againſt feeling the Operations of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> very rarely, or very ſlightly at leaſt, mention our Fall in <hi>Adam.</hi> No, they refer St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Account of the Depravity of Unbelievers, only to thoſe of old Time. Whereas 'tis obvious, on the contrary, that we are all equally included under the Guilt and Conſequences of our firſt Parent's Sin, even as others; and to uſe the Language of our own Church-Article, bring into the World with us a Corruption, which renders us liable to GOD's Wrath, and Eternal Damnation.</p>
                  <p>Should I preach to you any other Doctrine, I ſhould wrong my own Soul; I ſhould be found a falſe Witneſs towards GOD <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                     </gap> And he that preaches any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

From this plain Reaſon then appears the Neceſſity why we, as well as the firſt Apoſtle, in this Senſe, muſt receive the Spirit of GOD.</p>
                  <p>For the great Work of Sanctification, or making us holy, is particularly referred to the Holy Ghoſt. And therefore our LORD ſays, <hi>Unleſs a Man be born of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For JESUS CHRIST came down to ſave us not only from the Guilt, but alſo from the Power of Sin. And however often we have repeated our Creed, and told GOD we believe in the Holy Choſt, yet if we have not believed in him, ſo as to be really united to JESUS CHRIST by him, we have no more Concord with JESUS CHRIST than <hi>Belial</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And now, my Brethren, what ſhall I ſay more? Tell me, are not many of you offended at what has been ſaid already? Do not ſome of you think, though I mean well, yet I have carried the Point a little too far? Are not others ready to cry out, If this be true, who then can be ſaved? Is not this driving People into Deſpair?</p>
                  <p>Yes, I ingenuouſly confeſs it is. But into what Deſpair? A Deſpair of Mercy through CHRIST? No, GOD forbid; but a Deſpair of living with GOD without receiving the Holy Ghoſt. And I would to GOD, that not only all you that hear me this Day, but that the whole World was filled with <hi>this Deſpair.</hi> Believe me, my Brethren, I have been doing no more than you allow your bodily Phyſicians to

do every Day. If you have a Wound in your Bodies, and are in earneſt about a Cure, you bid the Surgeon probe it to the very Bottom. And ſhall not the Phyſician of your Souls be allowed the ſame Freedom? And what have I been doing but ſearching your natural Wounds, that I might convince you of your Danger, and put you upon applying to JESUS CHRIST for a Remedy? Indeed I have dealt with you as gently as I could; and now I have wounded, I come to heal you.</p>
                  <p>For I was, in the Laſt Place, to exhort you all to come to JESUS CHRIST by Faith, whereby you, even you alſo, ſhall receive the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>For this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi>

yet, if we believe the Scripture, <hi>Salvation is the free Gift of GOD in</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>our LORD; and whoſoever believeth on him with his whole Heart, though his Soul be as black as Hell itſelf, ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>—Behold then, I ſtand up, and cry out in this great Day of the Feaſt, <hi>Let every one that thirſteth come unto</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>and drink.

JESUS CHRIST as <hi>poor Sinners.</hi> I ſay, as <hi>poor Sinners;</hi> for the Poor in Spirit are only ſo bleſſed as to have a Right to the Kingdom of GOD.—JESUS CHRIST calls none to him but thoſe that thirſt after his Righteouſneſs, and feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves weary and heavy laden with the Burden of their Sins.—JESUS CHRIST juſtifies the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.

                  <p>Do not then ſay you are unworthy; for this is a faithful and true Saying, and worthy of all Men to be received, That JESUS CHRIST came into the World to ſave Sinners; and if you are the chief of Sinners; if you <hi>feel</hi> yourſelves ſuch, verily JESUS CHRIST came into the World chiefly to ſave you.—When <hi>Joſeph</hi> was called out of the Priſon-Houſe to <hi>Pharaoh'</hi>s Court, we are told, that he ſtaid ſome Time to prepare himſelf; but do you come with all your Priſon Cloaths about you; come poor, and miſerable, and blind, and naked as you are, and GOD the Father ſhall receive you with open Arms, as he did the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Prodigal.

The promiſcuous Diſpenſations of Providence in this Life, wherein we ſee good Men afflicted, deſtitute, tormented, and the Wicked permitted triumphantly to ride over their Heads, has been always looked upon as an indiſputable Argument, by the Generality of Men, that there will be a Day in which GOD will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, and adminiſter true Equity unto his People.—Some indeed are ſo bold as to deny it, while they are engaged in the Purſuit of the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.—But follow them to their Death-Beds, ask them, when their Souls are ready to launch into Eternity, what they then think of a Judgment to come? and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And firſt, I would remind you that are notoriouſly ungodly, of what our LORD ſays in the Text: For though I have ſaid that your Damnation ſlumbereth not, whilſt you continue in an impenitent State; yet that was only to ſet you upon your Watch, to convince you of your Danger, and excite you to cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> I appeal to all that hear me, whether I have ſaid the Door of Mercy ſhould be ſhut againſt you if you believe on JESUS CHRIST: No, if you are the chief of Sinners; if you are Murderers of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Murderers of Mothers; if you are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically the Dung and Offscouring of all Things; yet if you believe on JESUS CHRIST and cry unto him with the ſame Faith as the expiring Thief, <hi>LORD remember me now thou art in thy Kingdom;</hi> I will pawn my eternal

Salvation upon it, if he does not ſhortly tranſlate you to this heavenly Paradiſe. Wonder not at my ſpeaking with ſo much Aſſurance: For I know this is a faithful and true Saying, and worthy all Acceptation, that JESUS CHRIST came into the World to ſave all truely convicted and believing Sinners: Nay ſo great is his Love, that I am perſuaded, was it neceſſary, he would come again into the World and die a ſecond Time for them on the Croſs. But bleſſed be GOD, when our LORD bowed down his Head and gave up the Ghoſt, our Redemption was finiſhed. It's not our Sins, but our want of a lively Faith in his Blood, that will prove our Condemnation: If you draw near to him by Faith, tho' ye are the worſt of Sinners, yet he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

What is this but making yourſelves your own Saviours?—taking the Crown from JESUS CHRIST, and putting it on your own Heads? The Crime of the Devil ſome have ſuppoſed conſiſted in this, that he would not bow to JESUS CHRIST, when he came into the World as Mediator, and the Father commanded all the Angels to worſhip him; and what do you leſs? You will not own and ſubmit to his Righteouſneſs, and tho' you pretend to worſhip him with your Lips, yet your Hearts are far from him; beſides you in Effect deny the Operations of his bleſſed Spirit, you miſtake common for effectual Grace, you hope to be ſaved becauſe you have good Deſires, and a few ſhort Convictions; and what is this, but to give GOD, his Word, and all his Saints the Lie?

                  <p>WHEN it pleaſed the eternal Son of GOD to tabernacle among us, and come preaching the glad Tidings of Salvation to a fallen World, different Opinions were entertained by different Parties concerning him.—As to his Perſon, ſome ſaid he was <hi>Moſes;</hi> others that he was <hi>Elias, Jeremias,</hi> or one of the ancient Prophets; few acknowledged him to be what he really was, GOD Bleſſed for evermore.—And as to his Doctrine, tho' the common People, being free from Prejudice, were perſuaded of the heavenly Tendency of his going about to do Good, for the Generality, heard him gladly, and ſaid he was a good Man; yet the envious, worldly-minded, ſelf-righteous Governors and Teachers of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, being grieved at his Succeſs, on the one Hand, and unable (having never been taught of GOD) to underſtand the Purity of his Doctrine, on the other; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our LORD ſpake as never Man ſpake, and did ſuch Miracles which no Man could

But he is unworthy the Name of a Miniſter of the Goſpel of Peace, who is unwilling, not only to have his Name caſt out as evil, but alſo to die for the Truths of the Lord JESUS.—It is the Character of <hi>Hirelings</hi> and <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> who care not for the Sheep, to have all Men ſpeak well of them.—<hi>Bleſſed are you,</hi> ſays our LORD to his firſt Apoſtles, and in them to all ſucceeding Miniſters, <hi>when Men ſpeak all Manner of Evil againſt you falſely for my Name ſake.</hi>—And indeed it is impoſſible but ſuch Offences muſt come: For Men will always judge of others according to the Principles from which they act themſelves.—And if they care not to yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Doctrines which we deliver, they muſt neceſſarily, in Self-defence, ſpeak againſt the Preachers, leſt they ſhould be ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But alas! to out Shame be it mentioned, tho' CHRIST be not divided in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet Profeſſors are ſadly divided in their Thoughts about him; and that not only as to the Circumſtances of his Religion, but alſo of thoſe eſſential Truths which muſt neceſſarily be believed and received by us, if ever we hope to be Heirs of eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Some, and that I fear a Multitude which no Man can eaſily number, there are amongſt us, who call themſelves Chriſtians, and yet ſeldom or never ſeriouſly think of JESUS CHRIST at all. They can think of their Shops, and their Farms, their Plays, their Balls, their Aſſemblies, and Horſe-races (Entertainments which directly tend to exclude Religion out of the World) but as for CHRIST, the Author and Finiſher of their Faith, the LORD who has bought them with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood, and who is the only Thing worth their thinking of, alas! he is not in all, at moſt in very few, of their Thoughts. But believe me, O ye earthly, ſenſual, carnally minded Profeſſors, however little you may think of CHRIST now, or however induſtriouſly you may ſtrive to keep him out of your Thoughts, by purſuing the Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life, yet there is a Time coming, when you will wiſh you had thought of CHRIST more, and of your Profits and Pleaſures leſs.—For the Gay; the Polite, the Rich alſo muſt die as well as others, and leave their Pomps, their

Vanities, and all their Wealth behind them.—And oh! what Thoughts will you entertain concerning JESUS CHRIST, in that Hour.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt not purſue theſe Reflections: They would carry me too far from the main Deſign of this Diſcourſe, which is to ſhew what thoſe that are truly deſirous to know how to worſhip GOD in Spirit and in Truth, ought to think concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing JESUS CHRIST, whom GOD hath ſent to be the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to all them that ſhall believe.</p>

                  <p>Many will think theſe hard Sayings: But I think it no Breach of Charity to affirm, that an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> cannot be a Chriſtian.—The one would make us believe JESUS CHRIST <hi>is only a Created God,</hi> which is a Self-Contradiction.

For they are greater Infidels than the Devils themſelves.—They confeſſed that they knew who he was, he was <hi>even the holy One of GOD.</hi>—They not only believe, but which is more than all the Unbelievers of this Generation do, they tremble.—And was it poſſible for <hi>Arius</hi> or <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> thoſe Arch-Hereticks, to be releaſed from their Chains of Darkneſs, under which they are now reſerved to the Judgment of the great Day.

                  <p>But, <hi>Secondly, What think you of the Manhood or Incarnation of</hi> JESUS CHRIST? For CHRIST was not only GOD, but he was GOD and Man in one Perſon.—Thus runs the Text and Context.—<hi>When the Phariſees were gathered together.</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="unknown:004650_0410_100DDE8045881F58"/>
JESUS <hi>asked them, ſaying, What think ye of</hi> CHRIST? <hi>Whoſe Son is he?</hi> They ſay unto him, <hi>the Son of</hi> David.—<hi>How then,</hi> ſays our Divine Maſter, <hi>does</hi> David <hi>in Spirit call him LORD?</hi> From which Paſſage it is evident, that we do not think rightly of the Perſon of JESUS CHRIST, unleſs we believe him to be perfect GOD and perfect Man, of a reaſonable Soul and human Fleſh ſubſiſting.</p>
                  <p>For it is on this Account that he is called CHRIST, or the <hi>anointed, i. e.</hi> one who thro' his own voluntary Offer was ſet apart by the Father, and ſtrengthened and qualified by the Anointing or Communication of the Holy Ghoſt, to be a Mediator between Him and offending Man.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon or firſt Cauſe why the Son of GOD took upon him our Nature, was, the Fall of our firſt Parents.—I hope there is no one preſent ſo atheiſtical, as to think that Man made himſelf: No, it was GOD that made us, and not we ourſelves.—And I would willingly think, that no one would be ſo blaſphemous as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that if GOD did make us, he made us ſuch Creatures as we now find ourſelves to be. For this would be giving GOD's Word the lie, which tells us, that <hi>in the Image of GOD,</hi> not in the Image which we now bear on our Souls, <hi>made be Man.</hi>—Far be it from us to think thus: For as GOD made Man, ſo GOD made him perfect. He placed him in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and condeſcended to enter into a Covenant with him, promiſing him eternal Life, upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an unſinning Obedience; and threatning

eternal Death, if he broke his Law, and eat the forbidden Fruit.</p>
                  <p>Man did eat; and herein acting as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, thereby involved both himſelf and us in that Curſe, which GOD, the righteous Judge, had ſaid ſhould be the Conſequence of his Diſobedience.—But here begins that Myſtery of Godlineſs, GOD manifeſted in the Fleſh. For (ſing, O Heavens, and rejoice, O Earth!) the eternal Father, foreſeeing how <hi>Satan</hi> would bruiſe the Heel of Man, had in his eternal Counſel, provided a Means whereby he might bruiſe that accurſed Serpent's Head. Man is permitted to fall, and become ſubject to Death; but JESUS the only begotten Son of GOD, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father before all Worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God, of very God, offers to die to make an Attonement for his Tranſgreſſion, and to fulfil all Righteouſneſs in his ſtead. And becauſe it was impoſſible for him to do this as he was GOD, and yet ſince Man had offended, it was neceſſary it ſhould be done in the Perſon of Man, rather than we ſhould periſh; this <hi>Everlaſting GOD,</hi> this <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> this <hi>Antient of Days,</hi> in the Fulneſs of Time, had a Body prepared for him by the Holy Ghoſt, and became an Infant of a Span long.—In this Body he performed a compleat Obedience to the Law of GOD, whereby he, in our ſtead, fulfilled the Covenant of Works, and at laſt became ſubject to Death, even the Death upon the Croſs; that as GOD he might ſatisfy, as Man he might obey and ſuffer; and being GOD and Man in

one Perſon, might once more procure a Union between GOD and our Souls.</p>
                  <p>And now, What think you of this Love of CHRIST? Do not you think it was wondrous great? Eſpecially when you conſider that we were CHRIST'S bitter Enemies, and that he would have been infinitely happy in himſelf, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we had periſhed for ever.—Whatever you may think of it, I know the bleſſed Angels, who are not ſo much concerned in this Myſtery of Godlineſs as we, think moſt highly of it.—They do, they will deſire to look into and admire it, thro' all Eternity.—Why, Oh why, ye Sinners, will you not think of this Love of CHRIST!—Surely it muſt melt down the moſt harden'd Heart.—Whilſt I am ſpeaking, the Thoughts of this infinite and condeſcending Love, fires and warms my Soul.—I could dwell on it forever.—But it is expedient for you, that I ſhould ask you another Queſtion concerning JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, What think you about being juſtified by</hi> CHRIST?—I believe I can anſwer for ſome of you.—For many, I fear, think to be juſtified or looked upon as righteous in GOD's Sight, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out JESUS CHRIST.—But ſuch will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dreadfully miſtaken: For <hi>out of</hi> CHRIST <hi>GOD is a conſuming Fire.</hi>—Others ſatisfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with believing that CHRIST was GOD and Man, and that he came into the World to ſave Sinners in general. Whereas their chief Thoughts ought to be, how they may be aſſured that JESUS CHRIST came into the World to ſave them in particular.—<hi>The Life that I now live in the Fleſh,</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="unknown:004650_0413_100DDE87DE5E42F0"/>
ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>is by Faith of the Son of GOD, who died and gave himſelf for me.</hi>—Obſerve, <hi>for me.</hi> For it is this immediate Application of JESUS CHRIST to our own Hearts, that renders his Merits effectual to our eternal Salvation.—An unapplied CHRIST will do us no Service at all.—Others there are that go ſtill further: For they think that JESUS CHRIST is GOD-MAN, that he is to be applied to their Hearts, and that they can be juſtified in GOD's Sight in or thro' him; but then they make him only in Part a Saviour.—They are for doing what they can themſelves, and then JESUS CHRIST is to make up the Deficiencies of their Righteouſneſs. This is the Sum and Subſtance of our modern Divinity. And was it poſſible for me to know the Thoughts of moſt that hear me this Day, I believe they would tell me, this was the Scheme they had laid, and perhaps depended on for ſome Years, for their eternal Salvation. Is it not then high Time, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> for you to entert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

For if you think thus, you are in the Caſe of thoſe unhappy <hi>Jews,</hi> who went about eſtabliſhing their own Righteouſneſs, and would not ſubmit to, and conſequently were deprived of that Righteouſneſs which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS our LORD. What think you then, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> if I tell you, that you are to be juſtified freely thro' Faith in JESUS CHRIST, without any Regard to any Work, or Fitneſs, foreſeen in us, at all? For Salvation is the free Gift of GOD. I know no Fitneſs in Man, but
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:004650_0414_100DDE8A50C8D448"/>
a Fitneſs to be caſt into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone forever. Our Righteouſneſs in GOD's Sight is but as filthy Rags. He cannot away with it.—Our Holineſs, if we have any, is not the Cauſe, but the Effect of our Juſtification in GOD's Sight.—We love GOD, becauſe he firſt loved us. We muſt not come to GOD as the proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> did, bringing in as it were a Reckoning of our Services. We muſt come in the Temper and Language of the poor <hi>Publican,</hi> ſmiting upon our Breaſts and ſaying, <hi>GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> For JESUS CHRIST juſtifies us whilſt we are ungodly.—He came not to call the Righteous, but the Sinners to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The poor in Spirit, they who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go out of themſelves, and rely wholly on the Righteouſneſs of another, are only ſo bleſſed as to be Members of his Kingdom. The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the whole Righteouſneſs of JESUS CHRIST, is to be imputed to us, inſtead of our own. For we are not under the Law, but under Grace: And as many as walk after this Rule, Peace be on them; for they, and they only are the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD. In the great Work of Man's Redemption, Boaſting is intirely excluded; which could not be if only one of our Works was to be joined with the Merits of CHRIST. Our Salvation is all of GOD from the Beginning to the End. It is not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt. Man has no hand in it: It is CHRIST who is to be made to us of GOD the Father, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and eternal Redemption.—His active as well as
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:004650_0415_100DDE8C99301EC0"/>
his paſſive Obedience, is to be applied to poor Sinners. He has fulfilled all Righteouſneſs in our ſtead, that we might become the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD in him.—All we have to do, is to lay hold on this Righteouſneſs by Faith: And that very Moment we do apprehend him by a lively Faith, that very Moment we may be aſſured that the Blood of JESUS CHRIST has cleanſed us from all Sin.—For the Promiſe is to us and to our Children, and to as many as the LORD our GOD ſhall call. If we and our whole Houſes believe, we ſhall be ſaved as well as the Jaylor and his Houſe: For the Righteouſneſs of JESUS CHRIST is an everlaſting as well as a perfect Righteouſneſs.—It is as effectual to all them that believe in him now, as formerly; and ſo it will be, till Time ſhall be no more. Search the Scriptures as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did, and ſee whether theſe Things are not ſo.

                  <p>This Doctrine of our free Juſtification by Faith in CHRIST JESUS, however cenſured and evil ſpoken of by our preſent Maſters of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> was highly eſteemed by our wiſe Fore-Fathers: For in the ſubſequent Words of the forementioned Article, it is called a moſt wholeſome Doctrine,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:004650_0416_100DDE8EE617E848"/>
and very full of Comfort; and ſo it is to all that are weary and heavy laden, and are truly willing to find Reſt in JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>This is Goſpel, this is glad Tidings, of great Joy to all that feel themſelves poor, loſt and undone damned Sinners. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come unto the Waters of Life and drink freely; come and buy without Money and without Price.</hi>—Behold a Fountain opened in your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Side, for Sin and for all Uncleanneſs. Look unto him whom you have pierced. Look unto him by Faith, and verily you ſhall be ſaved, tho' you came here only to ridicule and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and never thought of GOD or of CHRIST before.</p>
                  <p>Not that you muſt think GOD will ſave you becauſe, or on Account of your Faith: For Faith is a Work, and then you would be juſtified for your Works. But when I tell you, we are to be juſtified by Faith, I mean that Faith is the Inſtrument whereby the Sinner applies or brings home the Redemption of JESUS CHRIST to his Heart. And to whomſoever GOD gives ſuch a Faith (for it is the free Gift of GOD) he may lift up his Head with Boldneſs, he need not fear, he is a ſpiritual Son of our ſpiritual <hi>David,</hi> he has paſſed from Death to Life, he ſhall never come into Condemnation.—This is the Goſpel which we preach.

                     </gap>, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> What think you of this Fooliſhneſs of Preaching? To you that have taſted the good Word of Life, and been enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſee the Riches of GOD's free Grace in CHRIST JESUS, I am perſuaded it is precious, and has diſtilled like the Dew into your Souls.—And Oh! that all were like minded!—But I am afraid Numbers are ready to go away contradicting and blaſpheming. Tell me, are there not many of you ſaying within yourſelves, <q>This is a licentious Doctrine; this Preacher is opening a Door for Encouragement in Sin.</q> But this does not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize me at all, it is a ſtale antiquated Objection, as old as the Doctrine of Juſtification itſelf; and (which by the Way is not much to the Credit of thoſe who urge it now) it was made by an Infidel. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> after he had in the firſt five Chapters demonſtrably proved the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone; in the ſixth, brings in an Unbeliever ſaying, <hi>ſhall we continue in Sin then that Grace may abound?</hi> But as he rejected ſuch an Inference with a <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſo do I: For the Faith which we preach is not a dead ſpeculative Faith, <hi>an aſſenting to Things credible as credible,</hi> as it is commonly defined. It is not a Faith of the Head only; but a Faith of the Heart. It is a living Principle wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of the Ever-living GOD, convincing the Sinner of his loſt, undone Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Nature, enabling him to apply and lay hold on the perfect Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> freely offered him in the Goſpel, and continually exciting him out of a Principle of Love and

Gratitude, to ſhew forth that Faith by abounding in every good Word and Work.—This is the Sum and Subſtance of the Doctrine that has been delivered.—And if this be a licentious Doctrine, judge ye.—No, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> this is not deſtroying, but teaching you how to do good Works, from a proper Principle.—For to uſe the Words of our Church in another of her Articles, <q>Works done before the Grace of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Inſpiration of the Spirit, are not pleaſant to God, foraſmuch as they ſpring not of Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>—rather for that they are not done as God has willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</q> So that they who bid you do, and then live, are juſt as wiſe as thoſe who would perſuade you to build a beautiful magnificent Houſe, without laying a Foundation.</p>
                  <p>It's true, the Doctrine of our free Juſtification by Faith in CHRIST JESUS, like other Goſpel Truths, may and will be abuſed by Men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Minds, Reprobates concerning the Faith: But they who receive the Truth of GOD in the Love of it, will always be ſhewing their Faith by their Works.

                  <p>Oh what would I give, that this Article was duly underſtood and preached by all that have ſubſcribed to it!

And when I am obliged to correct them, grant it may not be to ſhew my Authority, or gratify a corrupt Paſſion, but purely out of the ſame Motive from which thou doſt correct us, to make them Partakers of thy Holineſs.</p>

Stretch forth the Right Hand of thy Power, to heal all the Diſeaſes of my Sin-ſick Soul, and enable me by thy Holy Spirit, faithfully to diſcharge the ſeveral Duties of that Vocation, whereto I am called by thee my GOD. Give me Grace, I moſt humbly beſeech thee, to obey my Maſter, according to the Fleſh, in all Things; not with Eye-ſervice, as a Man-pleaſer, but with Singleneſs of Heart, as unto CHRIST; knowing, that whatſoever any Man doeth, the ſame he ſhall receive of the LORD, whether he be bond or free.</p>

                     <p>Create in me, I beſeech thee, a new Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me. For of whom ſhall I ſeek for Succour but of thee, O LORD, with whom alone this is poſſible? LORD if thou wilt thou canſt make me whole. O ſay unto my Soul, as thou didſt once unto the poor Leper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will, be thou renewed. Have Compaſſion on me, O LORD, as thou once hadſt unto blind <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> who ſat by the Way-ſide begging.</p>
                     <p>LORD, thou knoweſt all Things, thou knoweſt what I would have thee to do.—Grant, LORD, that I may receive my Sight.—For I am conceived and born in Sin, my whole Head is ſick, my whole Heart is faint, from the Crown of my Head to the Sole of my Feet I
