            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>STATE OF SOUTH-CAROLINA. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, December 6th, 1793. The Committee to whom was referred the buſineſs of examining into, and aſcertaining the truth of a report that an armed force is now levying within this ſtate, by perſons under a foreign authority, without the permiſſion, and contrary to the expreſs prohibition of the government of the United States, and of this ſtate, REPORT,</head>
            <p>THAT they have made diligent enquiry reſpecting the truth of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and have collected ſuch evidence relating thereto as was immediately within their reach—that your committee are perfectly ſatisfied, from the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, on the oaths of divers credible perſons, which they have received, that William Tate, Jacob R. Brown, William Urby, Robert Tate, Richard Speke, citizens of this ſtate, and other perſons unknown to your committee, alſo citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of this ſtate, have received and accepted military commiſſions from M. Genet, miniſter plenipotentiary from the republic of France to the United States of America, authoriſing them, and inſtructions requiring them, to raiſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganize, train, and conduct troops, within the United States of America—That the avowed purpoſe for which theſe troops are now raiſing, is, to rendezvous in the ſtate of Georgia, and from thence to proceed into the Spaniſh dominions, with a view to conqueſt or plunder, as their ſtrength might enable, or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity might tempt them—That in the event of a French fleet approaching the coaſts of the ſouthern ſtates, a junction and co operation with it is contemplated by the perſons abovementioned; but that though this was the avowed object of theſe troops and their leaders, among themſelves; from the injunction to conceal the whole ſyſtem from perſons not initiated, and the ſubordination eſtabliſhed to Mr. Genet, the author of the plan, and the ſource of authority to the officers. It is probable that the corps, when raiſed, muſt yield to any change of deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the judgment or inclination of Mr. Genet may point out to them— That ſeveral of the perſons above named, received, together with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, inſtructions by which they were to regulate their enrollments of men, stating the pay, rations, cloathing, plunder, and diviſion of conquered land, to be allotted to the officers and men who ſhould enter into this ſervice, and mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proportions of the acquiſitions to be reſerved to the republic of France— That the perſons above named, in purſuance of the powers veſted in them by the ſaid commiſſions, and in obedience to the inſtructions of M. Genet and his agents, particularly M. Mangourit, who ſigned ſome of the papers, have proceeded by themſelves, and by their agents, without any authority from the United States, or from this ſtate, to enroll numbers of the citizens of this ſtate, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with the hopes of plunder and the acquiſition of riches, in the ſervice of the republic of France, to be ſubject to the orders of Mr. Genet, the Miniſter Plenipotentiary of France.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:027920_0004_0FD65B2F63424E60"/>That Stephen Drayton and John Hamilton, alſo citizens of this ſtate, have made application to the good citizens thereof to engage in this ſcheme of raiſing men in this ſtate for the ſervice of France, to act under the orders of M. Genet, and to commit acts of hoſtility againſt nations at peace with the United States of America; and have avowed that they acted by the authority of M. Genet, the Miniſter Plenipotentiary of the Republic of France; that upon the whole of the information which your committee have been able to obtain, this is a daring and dangerous attempt by a foreign miniſter to intermeddle in the affairs of the United States, to uſurp the powers of government, and to levy troops in the boſom of the union, without the authority, and contrary to the expreſs ſenſe of the government of the United States, and in violation of the laws of nations—</p>
            <p>That the direct tendency of theſe meaſures of the foreign miniſter is to diſturb the internal tranquility of the United States, and to involve them in hoſtilities with nations with whom they are now at peace, which ſound policy requires ſhould be preſerved.—That in the opinion of your committee this attempt is the more dangerous and alarming as many citizens of the United States have been thereby ſeduced from their duty by inſidious arts practiced on their kindred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the French republic; and have been drawn into a ſcheme, in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of which they have uſurped the functions of government, and exerciſed the power of the ſword, which the wiſdom of the conſtitution hath veſted exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively in the Congreſs and Preſident of the United States.—That this committee therefore recommend that the governor of this ſtate be requeſted to iſſue his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, forbidding all perſons from enrolling any of the citizens of this ſtate, and prohibiting the citizens from enliſting under any officers, or for any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes not previouſly ſanctioned by the government of the United States, or of this ſtate; and alſo forbidding all unlawful aſſemblages of troops, unauthoriſed by government; and that the governor be requeſted to exert the whole public force to the utmoſt extent, if neceſſary, to inſure obedience to his proclamation.</p>
            <p>That in the opinion of this committee, the ſaid William Tate, Jacob R. Brown, Robert Tate, Stephen Drayton, John Hamilton, and Richard Speke, have been guilty of high crimes and miſdemeſnours; and they recommend that the attorney-general and ſolicitors be directed, forthwith to inſtitute, or cauſe to be inſtituted and conducted, proſecutions in the proper courts of law, againſt the ſaid William Tate, Jacob R. Brown, Robert Tate, Stephen Drayton, John Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, and Richard Speke, for accepting, or engaging to accept commiſſions from a foreign power, to raiſe troops within the United States, and for going about within the ſtate, levying or attempting to levy troops, and for ſeducing, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to ſeduce the citizens of this ſtate, to enroll themſelves for foreign ſervice, to commit acts of hoſtility againſt nations, with whom the United States are at peace, without the permiſſion of the government, and contrary to the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Preſident of the United States, declaring theſe ſtates to be in a ſtate of neutrality and peace.</p>
            <p>That copies of the evidence collected by this committee, together with the proceedings of this Houſe thereon, be forwarded immediately to the Preſident of the United States, and to the executives of the ſtates of North-Carolina and Georgia, for their information.</p>
