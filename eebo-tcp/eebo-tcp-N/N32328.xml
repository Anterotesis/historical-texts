            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>When we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly, Rom. 5, 6. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet ſinners. Chriſt died for us, verſe 8, who, by the grace of God, hath taſted death for every man, Heb. 2, 9; he gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time, 1 Tim. 2, 6. He was a lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world, Rev. 5, 8, 12, 13. In the fulneſs of time he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf, Heb. 9, 26, that they which live might not live unto themſelves, but unto him that died for them, Rom. 5, 8. He is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, 2 Pet. 3, 9, and receive the goſpel, which is the power of God, unto ſalvation, to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Rom. 1, 16, which was preached to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under Heaven, Col. 1, 23; and if it be hid, it is hid to them which are loſt, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine into them, 2 Cor. 4, 3, 4; for this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil, John 3, 19. In Chriſt was life, and the life was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, chap. 1, 4, 9, by which all things that are reprovable are made manifeſt; for whatſoever maketh manifeſt is light, Ephe. 5, 13. This is the more ſure word of prophecy, whereunto we do well to take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, 2 Pet. 1, 19; for God has ſaid his ſpirit will not always ſtrive with man, Gen. 6, 3, wherefore let us ſubmit ourſelves to the word of his grace, which is able to give us an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified, Acts, 20, 32.</p>

So then they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God, Rom. 8, 7, 8, wherefore let us not grieve the holy ſpirit of God, but ſubmit to his grace, Tit. 2, 11, that we may be renewed in the ſpirit of our minds, Ephe. 4, 23, and become the children of light, through faith, chap. 5, 8. God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all, 1 John, 1, 5; the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, John, 17, 21; the Holy Ghoſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Father and the Son, chap. 15, 26, by which all things that are reprovable are made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; for whatſoever maketh manifeſt is light, Ephe. 15, 13. As many, therefore, as do ſubmit to the divine life, John 1, 4, which ſhines into them by way of reproof, verſe 9, and Iſai. 51, 1, 4, making mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to them what is ſin, John 13, 19, 20, and Ephe. 5, 13, will be led to ſee the evil of ſin, and feel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for it in a higher or lower degree, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the eye of the mind, that damnation is the juſt reward of ſin, Rom. 6, 23. This all muſt ſee and feel in a greater or ſmaller meaſure, as all have ſinned, chap. 5, 12. Being thus made ſenſible of the juſt reward of ſin, Gal. 3, 10, they are filled with a fear that there is no mercy for them, Rom. 7, 9: This cauſes them to mourn over their miſpent time, being grieved with their ſins, Pſal. 25, 11, 17; their minds are ſo occupied, partly through fear, and a deſire to be ſaved, that their ſleep and wordly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments depart from them; ſo that nothing is more agreeable to them than to mourn over their hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
