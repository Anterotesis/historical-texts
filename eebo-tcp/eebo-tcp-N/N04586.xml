            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for Pardon, Peace and Happineſs, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick will ſurely fall, <hi>(debile Fundamentum fallit opus.)</hi> I have endeavoured to open this grand Article of Religion in the plaineſt Manner I could, that ſo the weakeſt Minds may have juſt Conceptions of it.</p>
                  <p>The Light in which I have ſet this Point, is agreeable to the Series of ſacred Scripture, and the harmonious Suffrage of the reformed Churches of <hi>Scotland, Holland, France, Geneva, England, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. expreſs'd in their Confeſſions of Faith; which altho' licentious Wits, who are diſpoſed to be as looſe and inconſiſtent in their <hi>Sentiments</hi> as <hi>Morals,</hi> may deride and burleſque as ſlaviſh Syſtems beneath their Notice, will notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be eſteemed by the Sober and Judicious, as inſtructive and valuable <hi>Summaries</hi> of divine Truth, ſo long as there be any Remains of true Religion in theſe Nations!</p>
                  <p>Its affecting to think how Mankind are inclin'd to run from one extreme to another. Some who have left the Principles of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> not thorowly underſtanding the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines

                  <p>Now as Vertue conſiſts in a Mediocrity between two Extremes, ſo do the Doctrines of Religion, and eſpecially this of Juſtification, we ſhould therefore beware, leaſt while we labour to ſhun <hi>Scilla,</hi> we ruſh upon <hi>Caribdis.</hi>

                  <p>I had no Intention of publiſhing this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe when I preach'd it, having offered to the Publick a Sermon upon Juſtification ſome Years agone, but was induced hereto, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Difficulty and Importance of the Subject, and the wrong Notions that many have of it, with deſign to give check to them. I was alſo inform'd, that a few of the Hearers were diſſatisfied, and many more entertain'd with a Method of handling the Subject different from what they had heard; and therefore to remove the unreaſonable Cenſures of ſome, and ſatisfy the Deſires of others, I conſented to its publication; not

But ſo ſoon as this Union is obtain'd, an actual Communion in the Benefits of Redemption immediately enſues, among which Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a primary and principal one: Of this the Apoſtle treats in the Words of our Text. To underſtand which let it be conſidered, that the Occaſion of writing this Epiſtle to the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> (a Country in the <hi>Leſſer Aſia</hi>) was partly to reprove and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome Members of theſe Churches, who had as ſhamefully as perilouſly Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiz'd from the important Doctrine of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification by Faith alone, thro' the corrupt Influence of ſome falſe Teachers who crept in among them, and taught the Neceſſity of Circumciſion and other Works of the Law, in order to the Juſtification of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before God; and this they did with a political Deſign, to ſcrene themſelves from that Perſecution which all the Chriſtians
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005697_0012_1026C1ABE3607138"/>
were then expos'd to who were not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcis'd; and in order to promote their new and pernicious Doctrine, they purſued the Method which is common to Hereticks and Seducers in every Age of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> They made great Shews of Religion, commended themſelves, traduc'd and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> inſinuating that he was no Apoſtle, that he had learn'd all he knew, from <hi>James, Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and yet differ'd from them in Doctrine and Practice, as well as from himſelf. Now the Apoſtle does not only in this Epiſtle labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the erring <hi>Galatians,</hi> but likewiſe to vindicate his Character from the unjuſt and invidious Charges of the falſe Teachers: To this purpoſe the firſt and ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Epiſtle are chiefly ſpent· The inſpir'd Writer does therein prove himſelf to be a true Apoſtle, and not to have learn'd what he taught from <hi>Peter, James</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> but that he had it by Revelation from Jeſus Chriſt.

<q>We <hi>Jews</hi> as well as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are in a State of Wrath and Condemnation before Faith, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of our Religious Priviledges, which being made ſenſible of, as well as the utter Inſufficiency of any Acts of Obedience we have or can perform, to free us from the Guilt of Sin, and acquire for us a Right to Happineſs; and being
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005697_0015_1026C1B364152EC0"/>
perſwaded of the Safety of entire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the Righteouſneſs of the Mediator for our Acceptance with God, we have conſented to embrace him upon Goſpel Terms, and reject all Refuges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him, and that becauſe, <hi>by the Works of the Law ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified, i. e.</hi> no mortal Man can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect, or ever attain to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Righteous before God, on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Obedience to the Law of God, becauſe of its Imperfection.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From what has been ſaid it appears, that the Point to be diſcours'd upon from this Text, is the Manner of a Sinner's Juſtification before God. It cannot be Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification before Men, or the evidencing of the reality of our faith to them that is here intended; for good Works would not then be wholly rejected, being of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Uſe in that Caſe; by thoſe, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> obſerves, <hi>our Faith is ſhewn</hi> or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. <note n="†" place="bottom">

                     <hi>i. e.</hi> Its reality is manifeſted to others, and evidenc'd to our ſelves. And
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005697_0016_1026C1B5D93DA798"/>
hence he concludes <hi>that a Man is juſtified by Works and not by Faith only,</hi> 
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Jam. ii. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> in the ſight of Men. High Pretences to and a great Bluſter about Faith and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, when theſe Things are not crown'd with a holy and humble Converſation, are juſtly rejected by the Sober and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as Inſtances of Hypocriſy and Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. That Faith that don't produce good Works is <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>unprofitable,</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Jam. ii. 14, 17.</note> and therefore cannot be the Inſtrument of our Juſtification before God. What has been ſaid ſerves to remove the ſeeming Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety between the two Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> and ſhew their Harmony: To which let me add, that they wrote to different Sorts of People, <hi>Paul</hi> directed his Diſcourſe of Juſtification without Works to <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and ſuch as were of a Self-righteous Caſt, who depended ſecurely upon their Acts of Obedience, and tho't thereby in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree at leaſt to procure the divine Favour: Theſe ambitious <hi>Babel-builders,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> labours to ſhake from the Summit of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005697_0017_1026C1B769D0AE70"/>
their Self-righteouſneſs in point of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that ſo being made <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> they might learn to <hi>ſubmit to,</hi> and lean alone upon the Mediator's Righteouſneſs for acceptance with God. <note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. iii. 8, 9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> had to do with a <hi>Club</hi> of <hi>Libertines,</hi> who made high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Faith and Juſtification by it, while they went on in a Courſe of Impiety in Practice: Theſe hardy Hypocrites he takes to taſk and ſhews the Vanity of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, by declaring, that that Faith that juſtified us before God, was a vital active Grace, productive of good Works; and that good Works were neceſſary to evidence to the World about us, the Truth of our Faith and the reality of our Juſtification, whatever lawleſs Libertines might unjuſtly mutter againſt them notwithſtanding! But to return: As it is not Juſtification before Men that is intended in our Text, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what has been ſaid; ſo neither is it a Juſtification in the Sight of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for good Works are of great Uſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005697_0018_1026C1BA63C5F968"/>
to evidence thereto the Safety of our State: <hi>Hereby</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>John) we do know that we know him, if we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and he that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar and the Truth is not in him</hi> 
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 John ii. 3, 4.</note>: (And elſewhere he aſſures us) <hi>that if we ſay we have Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him and walk in darkneſs, we lie and do not the Truth; but if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellowſhip one with another</hi>

                  <p>It remains therefore, that it is Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before God only, that the Apoſtle treats of in our Text, and aſſerts <hi>to be by Faith without the Works of the Law.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subſtance and Scope of the Text, I ſhall in order to prepare it for Improvement, ſpeak upon the two following Heads, <hi>viz:</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. <hi>Attempt to explain the Nature of Juſtification.</hi> And</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the Word <hi>juſtify</hi> is not to be taken in a <hi>moral Senſe,</hi> as intending a real, inward Change of the Temper and Diſpoſition of the Soul, as the Papiſts imagine, (for that is properly call'd Sanctification) but in a <hi>Law-Senſe,</hi> as importing a juridical Act of God, whereby as a Judge he acquits the Sinner from Guilt and accepts him into Favour, appears from the following Conſiderations, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the etymological <hi>Derivation</hi> of the Word <hi>juſtify,</hi> it is deriv'd from a Word that ſignifies <hi>Right,</hi> as judicially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced according to law. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dicaiutai a dice.</note>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> From its common <hi>Acceptation</hi> in Scripture, the Paſſages that treat of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification can admit of no other than a <hi>Law-Senſe;</hi>

The Law is not executed according to the Letter of it, for then no Sinner can be ſaved; but repenting Believers are free from Condemnation. Nor is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated, for then no Obligation remains as to the Duty or Penalty of it: But Men are ſtill bound to obey it, and impenitent Infidels are ſtill under the Curſe: <hi>The Wrath of God abides upon them.</hi> But 'tis <hi>relax'd</hi> as to the Puniſhment by the merciful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention of the Law-giver.</q>

Beſides ſome Laws cannot be relax'd <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> upon the Account of the Divine Decree which makes them Irrevocable, as that all who die in their Impenitency ſhall be damned. Now there was no expreſs Sign annex'd to the Sanction of the original Law, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that it ſhould be unalterable as to the Letter of it. The Threatning declar'd the Deſert of Sin in the Offender, and the Right of puniſhing in the Superior; but 'tis ſo to be underſtood as not to fruſtrate the Power of the Law-giver to relax the Puniſhment upon wiſe and juſt Reaſons.</q>

                  <p>From all which Conſiderations complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, it appears that the Obedience of Chriſt was of infinite Value, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an equivalent Satisfaction to Juſtice for the Sins of thoſe he repreſented: And ſeeing that the active and paſſive Obedience of Chriſt, was not due from him to the Law, conſidered as <hi>God-Man,</hi> it might be therefore imputed to others.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this Point of the <hi>Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Chriſt, is of infinite Moment in the Chriſtian Religion, I wou'd therefore offer the following Hints before I proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Confirmation and Illuſtration of it.</p>
                  <p>Natural Reaſon inſtructs us that there is a God, from whom all Things are deriv'd, and by whom they are govern'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:005697_0043_1026C1FD80A82AC8"/>This ſupreme Being having made intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Creatures capable of moral Homage, it was but reaſonable that he ſhould give them a Law to direct them in it, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeeing they cou'd not know ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts as took their Riſe from his abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, (which deſerves Honour, as well as his other Attributes) without ſome Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations from himſelf.</p>
                  <p>A Law being given, it's highly reaſonable that Obedience to it ſhould be enforc'd by Penalties equal to the Tranſgreſſions thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing by every Violation of the Law, the infinite Majeſty of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is affronted, and infinite Obligations to ſerve him, which the Creature is laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by reaſon of the eſſential Excellency and communicative Goodneſs of God are broken, therefore an infinite Guilt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by every Sin.</p>
                  <p>This Guilt, the Judge and Legiſlator, becauſe of his natural Holineſs, his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wiſdom, Truth and Juſtice, cannot paſs by without an equal Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>But this the Sinner cannot perform, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is finite, and therefore either he
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005697_0044_1026C1FF0856A0D8"/>
muſt ſuffer eternally, or a Surety under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for him, and do and ſuffer in his Room and Place, what he was and is uncapable of.</p>
                  <p>Now the Perſon that ſo interpoſes muſt be <hi>Man,</hi> that he might be capable of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, for the Deity is impaſſible; and it is but juſt and reaſonable that the Nature that ſinn'd ſhou'd ſuffer, that the Sin of Man ſhould be puniſh'd in Man.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it is as neceſſary, that the Perſon interpoſing be <hi>God,</hi> that ſo the human Nature ſhou'd be Supported under its Sufferings, which being equal to the Demerit of Sin, and conſequently infinite, wou'd otherways deſtroy it. It is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the Mediator ſhould be God, that ſo an infinite Dignity might be put upon the Sufferings and Obedience of his human Nature by its Union to the Divine, that ſo the Satisfaction made might be Equivalent to the Debt contracted.</p>
                  <p>Now there is no God-Man but our JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS; it remains therefore, that he is the only Mediator, who by performing the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Law,</hi> hath purchas'd
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005697_0045_1026C2008EF07A68"/>
for the Elect a Freedom from the Guilt of Sin, and a Right to eternal Happineſs. This Right purchas'd for the Elect by their Surety, 'twas previouſly concerted in the Covenant of Redemption, ſhould be apply'd to them in Time by Faith. <note n="†" place="bottom">Zech. vi 13.

I may add, that the Son's offering not the proper Payment in <hi>Specie</hi> in all Circumſtances which the Law requir'd, gives farther Light and Force to this Argument; not to ſay that it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe, that the Order ſhould be ſuch as does conſiſt with the Holineſs of God and Wiſdom of his Government, which is not like to be anſwered, unleſs Faith be conſidered as the Inſtrument of a Sinners Juſtification before God.</p>
                  <p>The Right purchas'd for the Elect is kept in the Hand of the Mediator, until
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005697_0046_1026C20507CCBC10"/>

We come into the World in our fallen State, under a twofold melancholy Diſorder, viz. <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, i. e.</hi> we are not only under the Power and Pollution of Sin, but likewiſe under the Guilt of it, or expos'd by it to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Now Sanctification cures the former, and Juſtification the latter. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Perſon was condem'd to die for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and at the ſame Time labour'd under bodily Diſeaſes, ſuch as the Leproſie and Conſumption, you know the removing

of the Sentence of Condemnation would not heal the Diſeaſes; a proper Application muſt be made to them of a ſuitable Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine beſides the other, otherwiſe the Perſon would ſtill be miſerable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. Another Reaſon is to ſignify that the Sentence of Juſtification paſſes upon the Sinner at once; when he believes, in a Moment his State is alter'd he is no more <hi>under the Law, (i. e.</hi> as a Covenant of Works) <hi>but under Grace.</hi>

There are, no doubt, various Degrees of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of this Matter reſpecting ourſelves; but that does not alter the Caſe at all, for ye know my Brethren that there is a vaſt
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005697_0051_1026C210E9C9DC58"/>
Difference between the Knowledge of a Thing and the Thing itſelf.</p>
                  <p>From what has been ſaid it appears, that Juſtification is <hi>no immanent Act</hi> of God, for all ſuch are Eternal, nor are they diſtinct from God himſelf; but the Act of Juſtification is at the Time of believing and not before, and has an Effect without him; it terminates on the Sinner, and makes a relative Change reſpecting his State.</p>
                  <p>Neither does the Notion of an <hi>immanent Act</hi> anſwer the End of Juſtification, which is to free the Sinner from Law Charges, whereby he was before impleaded, and therefore we may ſafely aſſert, that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as it proceeds from God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the State of the Perſon upon whom it terminates, is a <hi>tranſient Act.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another particular in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly's Deſcription is, the <hi>impulſive</hi> or <hi>firſt moving Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and that is <hi>Free-Grace.</hi> The Fountain from which the Act of Juſtification flows is pure Grace, this the Apoſtle aſſerts in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> in the following Words, <hi>being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

from Puniſhment, and procure a Title to Happineſs. To this Objection, he replies in the following Manner:
<q>Indeed we ſhould not ſeparate what the Lord hath not disjoyn'd: The Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt are not disjoyn'd in themſelves, in their Virtue or Effects. Not in themſelves: He ſuffered in all his Obedience, and obeyed in all his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ngs.—There was Obedience in all his Sufferings, becauſe he ſuffered in Complyance with his Father's Will: And there was ſufferings in all his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, becauſe his Acts of Obedience, were Acts of Humiliation and Abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all perform'd by the Son of God in the Form of a Servant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Nor in their Virtue: His Obedience was both meritorious and ſatisfactory; and his Sufferings were both ſatisfactory and meritorius. His Obedience was not only meritorious, but alſo ſatisfactory; if not as Obedience, yet as it was Penal.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>And his Sufferings were not only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, but alſo meritorious; if not

as they were great, yet as they were obediential.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Nor in their Effects: His Sufferings could not have ſatisfied Juſtice, without his perfect Obedience.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt:</hi> God imputes the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to the believing Elect: By <hi>imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> we underſtand God's reckoning, or placing to our Account, what was done and ſuffered by Chriſt as a Surety in our Room and Place, as much as tho' we had done and ſuffered theſe Things in our own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

manifeſt in the Fleſh and juſtified in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; i. e.</hi> openly acquitted, as his Peoples Repreſentative, by his Reſurrection from the Dead, which was perform'd thro' the holy Spirit's Agency.

                  <p>When a Perſon believes, he has a right to conclude that he is Juſtified, and to claim all the Privileges that iſſue from it, and not before.

                  <p>But tho' Faith be not alone in the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yet it juſtifies alone, (inſtrumentally) And hence the Righteouſneſs apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it is call'd the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 13.</note> not the Righteouſneſs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Love or any other Grace.</p>
                  <p>It has pleas'd God to employ the Grace of Faith in the Buſineſs of Juſtification ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other Grace; becauſe of its

fitneſs for this Office: The Eye is employed in ſeeing, the Ear in hearing, and not the Foot, becauſe of their Fitneſs for ſuch Functions. Thus ſeeing we are juſtified not by giving to God any thing that we do, but by receiving from God what Chriſt has done for us: Faith being the only receiving Grace, is therefore only fit for this Office, the other Graces have their Exerciſe and Uſe in order to Salvation, <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xiii. 3.</note> but do nothing towards our puting on the Robe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.

                  <p>What has been ſaid is Doubtleſs intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Aſſembly, when they tell us
<q>That Faith only receives the Righteouſneſs of <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> In Contradiſtinction from every other Grace in us, and all the Works of Holineſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs done by us.</p>
                  <p>The Repreſentation which the Church of <hi>England</hi> give of Juſtification in the <hi>eleventh</hi> Article, is exactly agreeable to that of the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Aſſembly, which I have explained and is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>We are accounted Righteous before God,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:005697_0071_1026C242E1B6A550"/>
only for the Merit of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour JESUS CHRIST by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deſervings. Wherefore that we are juſtified by Faith only, is a moſt wholeſome Doctrine and very full of Comfort, as more largely is expreſs'd in the Homily of Juſtification.</q>
This leads me to the</p>
                  <p n="2">II. General Head, which was to prove, <hi>that Juſtification is without the Works of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this is not only expreſly aſſerted in the Words of our Text, but likewiſe in other Places of Scripture: <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 28. Rom. v. 1. Rom. iii. 20. Gal. iii. 11, 24.</note> To which let me add the following Arguments, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Law requires a Perfection of Obedience in order to Juſtification by it, and denounces a <hi>Curſe</hi> upon thoſe that want it. <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 10.</note> Now ſeeing we are deſtitute of that perfect and inherent Righteouſneſs, in Habit and Act which the Law requires; <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 12,—18.</note> it is impoſſible we ſhould be juſtified by it; neither will it avail to reply that the aforeſaid Perfection was neceſſary under the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:005697_0072_1026C24467D10610"/>
Law, but not under the Goſpel; for the <hi>Relaxation</hi> made under the Goſpel is not that an imperfect Righteouſneſs ſhou'd be accepted for a perfect one; for thus the Juſtice of God would be wrong'd: Neither is it conſiſtent with the Truth of God to declare thoſe Righteous, that are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſo, either <hi>inherently</hi> or by <hi>Imputation.</hi> But the <hi>Relaxation</hi> made under the Goſpel, conſiſts in accepting of the Righteouſneſs of the Surety, in the Room of that which the Law required of the Sinner perſonally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> We have broken the Law, and cannot make Reparation equal to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and leſs than this, divine Juſtice will not accept. Our after Obedience, upon the Suppoſition it was perfect, (which in the mean time cannot be reaſonably expected from imperfect Creatures) wou'd not make Satisfaction for our paſt Diſobedience; the Reaſon of which is this: We are under a double Debt to God, <hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Penalty;</hi> as <hi>Creatures,</hi> we owe the former to God's <hi>Law,</hi> and as <hi>Tranſgreſſors</hi> we owe the latter to his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> now the Payment of the one, cannot diſcharge the other,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:005697_0073_1026C245F35C4CD8"/>
which is of a different Kind. Let me add, that the Penalty threatned, being equal to the Demerit of Sin, <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 23.</note> is ſuch as we can't endure without being eternally miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <note n="*" place="bottom">Becauſe the Sufferings of a finite Creature, cannot be infinite in Degree or Value, they muſt be infinite in Duration.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We can't be juſtify'd by Works, becauſe that Works done before Faith are not pleaſing to God, but full of Sin; and ſo ſoon as Faith is given, it immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Chriſt, and ſo we are Juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we perform Works that are ſpiritually Good. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 7, 8.</note> And hence the Almighty is ſaid <hi>to Juſtify the Ungodly:</hi> 
                     <note n="††" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> Such as have never done any acceptable Service to God. The Church of <hi>England</hi> ſpeak ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently upon this Point, in the 13th Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, which is as follows:
<q>Works done before the Grace of Chriſt and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of his Spirit, are not pleaſant to God, for as much as they ſpring not of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005697_0074_1026C24B24E9EF98"/>
(or as the School Authors ſay,) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Grace of congruity: Yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We cannot be Juſtified by Works, becauſe then the Reward wou'd be reckon'd of Debt and not of Grace; <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 4.</note> but the Reward is of Grace, and hence the Man is deſcrib'd as <hi>bleſſed, to whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth Righteouſneſs without Works:</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>And if of Grace, it is no more of Works, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works then it is no more Grace: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Work is no more Work.</hi> 
                     <note n="¶" place="bottom">Rom. xi. 5, 6.</note> To be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely, (which the Word Grace ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies) without any Regard to our Works, as Cauſes thereof either in Part or in whole, and to be juſtify'd partly or wholly by Works, are abſolute and unreconcileable Inconſiſtencies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly.</hi> Seeing the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST is perfect and of infinite Value,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:005697_0075_1026C24D92E57E70"/>
equal to the Demands of the Law and Juſtice, as has been before prov'd, then there is no need of adding ours to it with Deſign to purchaſe in Part our Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: And truly this Notion is Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Honour of CHRIST as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for it interpretatively ſays, that his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is incompleat; and if the Caſe were ſo, ſurely ours could never compleat it, becauſe it is at leaſt imperfect. <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. lxiv. 6.</note> And thus no Fleſh could be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="6">6thly. We cannot be juſtified by Works, becauſe that thus Man would have Cauſe of boaſting, which the Apoſtle aſſures us is excluded, <hi>Not by the Law of Works but by the Law of Faith.</hi> 
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 27.</note> It tends to puff up the Pride and Vanity of the Creature to imagine that there is any Merit in his Works. And how unreaſonable is the Suppoſition, that we ſhould merit Good from God by returning to him what is his own?</p>
                  <p n="7">7thly. It is reaſonable to conclude, that we are juſtifi'd in the ſame Manner that
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:005697_0076_1026C24F16A0FFD0"/>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful was. Now this was by Faith, for ſays the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified by Works, he hath whereof to Glory:</hi> But he denies that he had Cauſe of glorying before God, and therefore he was not juſtified by Works, <hi>No he believed God and it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 2.3.</note> In the mean Time, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> obſerves, this Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> by which he was juſtified, was a living Operative Principle which evidenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its Reality by good Works, that flow'd from it as Streams from a Fountain.</p>
                  <p n="8">8thly. Our Righteouſneſs anſwers not the Demands of the Goſpel no more than of the Law, and ſo falls ſhort of every Rule of Righteouſneſs. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> requires Perfection as well as the Law, to imagine the Contrary is in other Words to ſay, either that the Imperfections of Believers are no Sins, or that the Goſpel allows of Sin, both which are equally abſurd.!</p>
                  <p>It is true the Goſpel promiſes the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Imperfections to believers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on the Exerciſe of Faith and Repentance, which

(1ſt.) That there was a gracious Purpoſe of God from Eternity, to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe Bleſſings on the Elect in time. (2dly,) That there was a ſufficient Foundation laid in the Covenant of Redemption, as well as in the Sufferings and Obedience of Chriſt in purſuance of it, for the purchaſing and ſecuring the actual Reconciliation of the Elect in time. (3dly,) That there was and is a Sufficiency of Grace treaſur'd up in Chriſt as the Head of his Church and Fountain of Influence, to be communicated to the Elect upon their Cloſure with him; which in ſome Places of Scripture, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the <hi>Time paſt,</hi> to ſhew the Certainty of the Event: For the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Coming of our Lord to Judgment, is repreſented by the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> tho' it be <hi>future: Behold he cometh with the Clouds!</hi>

                  <p>To aſſert the Elect are actually juſtify'd and actually condemn'd at the ſame Time, is as groſs a Contradiction as to ſay that Light is Darkneſs, and Darkneſs is Light, it is impoſſible in the Nature of Things: Such as are actually juſtify'd are actually freed from Condemnation, and therefore can't at the ſame Time be actually under it.

                  <p>Now ſuch as do find in themſelves the Characters of Faith have Reaſon to rejoyce under the moſt gloomy Aſpects of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: For however Men may condemn them God will not, <hi>there is no Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>And we may likewiſe learn the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and Excellency of Faith thro' which alone we can be juſtified, and that the Greatneſs of Sin is no Bar to believing, ſeeing the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is able to make the moſt Crimſon Sins white as Snow; and that it is freely offer'd to all Believers.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, juſtified Perſons ſhould be exceeding humble, ſeeing that <hi>boaſting is excluded by the Law of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi> alſo in all Manner of Converſation, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing thereby their Juſtification to the World about them.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>A JUST View of the Harmony that ſubſiſts between the Law and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is of great Importance in the Chriſtian Religion: To promote this, is therefore the Deſign of our preſent Meditations, to which the Text I have choſen directly leads.</p>
                  <p>To underſtand which let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> having in the preceeding Verſes of this Chapter, prov'd at large by a Train of cloſe Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Juſtification of a Sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is by Faith only. Foreſeeing that ſome wou'd be tempted to abuſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doctrine of Grace to the Contempt of the Law; in order to prevent this vile Abuſe, he proleptically States the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch by way of Query or Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and rejects it with a vehement Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:005697_0100_1026C286ACF8A260"/>
or with great abhorrence! <hi>Do we then make void the Law by Faith?</hi> The Objection more fully Stated is this:
<q>The Apoſtles by their Doctrine of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Faith, make the Law unprofitable, uſeleſs, vain; they aboliſh and abrogate it, and deſtroy all Obligation to obey it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle replies with a <hi>God forbid!</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I abhor the Thought! That ſo valuable and excellent a Rule of Life ſhould be made void! O dreadful, deteſtable Suggeſtion! This Objection is the ſame in Subſtance with the ſlanderous Report which ſome ſpread concerning the Doctrines of Grace, which the Apoſtles preach'd, affirming that
<q>they ſaid, let us do Evil that Good may come.</q>
This Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny <hi>Paul</hi> rejects with equal Deteſtation, in the following Words, <hi>whoſe Damnation js juſt:</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See Verſe 8 of Rom. iii. Chap.</note> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> Sayeth <hi>Poole,</hi>
                     <q>Their Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is juſt, who teach ſuch Doctrine and Practice accordingly; or they juſtly deſerve Damnation, who calumniate the Apoſtles and publiſhers of the Goſpel,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:005697_0101_1026C28A15374E10"/>
and raiſe falſe Reports and Slanders of them:— Who affirm we ſay or hold, <hi>that Evil may be done that Good may come thereof.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Poole's <hi>Annotations</hi> in Locum.</note> Now ſeeing the aboliſhing the Moral Law as a Rule of Action, tends to deſtroy all Holineſs entirely, (as I ſhall afterwards labour to make evident) it muſt needs be a great Evil; and if this be done <hi>that Good may come,</hi> it is in Subſtance what the Apoſtle rejects with ſo much Warmth in the preceeding Part of this Chapter!</p>
                  <p>It is the Moral Law that the Apoſtle here Diſcourſes of, for in this Chapter he ſhews that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sin by breaking of it: Now the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were not under the ceremonial Law, and ſo could not tranſgreſs it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be the Moral Law that is intended in our Text.</p>
                  <p>Beſides it is certain that the Goſpel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Faith, does make void the ceremonial Law; when the Subſtance came the Shadows fled away, the Types muſt
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:005697_0102_1026C28BC02D78A0"/>
needs give Place to the Antitype, that <hi>Hand-writing of Ordinances was nail'd to the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> But in what Senſe does the Apoſtle oppoſe making void the Moral Law?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, not as a Covenant of Works; for himſelf elſewhere ſhews, that it is in that Reſpect made void to Believers, and aſſerts, that <hi>they are not under the Law but under Grace.</hi> 
                     <note n="¶" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 14.</note> Since Man's Apoſtacy, the Law cannot give Life as a Covenant thro' our Default, foraſmuch as it requires a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Obedience to that Purpoſe, which we have rendered ourſelves unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. It is therefore the Deſtruction of the Moral Law as a <hi>Rule</hi> of Life, or its Obligation to Obedience under that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which the Apoſtle oppoſes.</p>
                  <p>To make this the more eaſy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, let it be conſidered, that a Law in general may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is a Rule of Duty, or of Things to be done and avoided, preſcrib'd by the Almighty, and enforced by the Threatning of Puniſhment upon the Tranſgreſſor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="unknown:005697_0103_1026C28D6EA79E68"/>Now there are two Kinds of Laws, namely, <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>moral:</hi> The former take their Riſe entirely from the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Pleaſure, and enjoyn Things that are not eſſentially or intrinſically Good in their own Nature, antecedent to the Command, and are therefore Good only becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and Evil becauſe forbid: Of this Kind was the primitive Prohibition, of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from the Fruit of a certain Tree, which before, was no doubt, lawful to be eaten: of this Kind was alſo the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Obſervances of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and likewiſe their judicicial or political Laws, at leaſt ſuch of them as were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly adapted to the State of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation: Theſe Commands are alterable becauſe they are not grounded on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Goodneſs and Reaſonableneſs of Things, but upon the Legiſlator's Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>But the latter, <hi>viz. moral</hi> Preceps, have an eſſential Equity and Reaſonableneſs in them, they conform us to the Attributes and Actions of God, which are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of our Imitation; they are exactly adapted to the Frame of Man's Faculties,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005697_0104_1026C2911BA7A6A0"/>
and to his Condition in the World, and ſerve to maintain the Primitive Dignity of human Nature, and good of Society, and therefore cannot be altered; for the Things are enjoyn'd becauſe they are good, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden becauſe they are in themſelves Evil.</p>
                  <p>This Law is call'd <hi>Moral,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from poſitive and ceremonial Inſtitutions; and likewiſe the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> becauſe it was at firſt, as to the Subſtance of it, made C-onatural to Man, and, as it were, engraven on the human Soul (or Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) when it came at firſt out of the Hands of God. But Man's underſtanding being darkned, and his Will and Affections being deprav'd by Sin, there was need of a Second Edition of it for our Direction in Practice; which God in infinite Condeſcention gave in two Tables of Stone upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Law does virtually contain in it an Obligation to believe and obey what God ſhould afterwards reveal and enjoin, and therefore all <hi>poſitive Precepts</hi> of a Divine Original were and are eſtabliſh'd by the Moral Law, during the Time appointed for their Continuance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:005697_0105_1026C29398137B90"/>This Law was never given to any ſince the Fall of Man with Deſign to obtain Juſtification before God by Obedience to it, tho' many carnal Perſons took it in this Light to their great Prejudice, but <hi>was added</hi> to the Covenant of Grace, <hi>becauſe of Tranſgreſſions,</hi> as an Appendix to promote its grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention by convincing Sinners and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saints, and ſo it is <hi>not againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God</hi> but greatly ſerves them by making <hi>Offences</hi> to <hi>abound</hi> in the Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, <hi>i. e.</hi> as to their View of them and by <hi>working Wrath, i. e.</hi> Making them ſenſible of the Wrath they deſerve for Sin, and ſo diſpoſing them to accept the Redeemer by Faith, and by guiding Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the Paths of Purity, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them for their Defects.</p>
                  <p>And tho' under the Goſpel Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Church being come to mature Age, Believers are not under ſo ſevere a Diſcipline as obtain'd during the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> OEconomy, but are freed entirely from the Bondage of the Ceremonial Severities as well as from ſo frequent an Inculcation of the Terrors of the Moral Law, attended
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:005697_0106_1026C295D06ABE58"/>
with but obſcure Diſcoveries of Goſpel Grace, which were neceſſary to prepare the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> infant Church to embrace with readineſs a brighter and milder Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo may be ſaid to be <hi>no longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law as a School-Maſter;</hi> yet they need it as a Rule of Practice.</p>
                  <p>Now the moral Law was given to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Man, both as a <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Duty</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> Man was not only to be directed by it as a <hi>Rule</hi> enforc'd with a Penalty, but it was given alſo in the form of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> a promiſe of Happineſs being annex'd to Man's perfect Obedience to it, together with the poſitive Precept before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The Moral Law therefore can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be made void, but in two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> Either as a <hi>Covenant</hi> or as a <hi>Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it cannot be the former Senſe that the Apoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2dly. This Law being <hi>Moral,</hi> grounded on the Nature of our Relation to God and one another, muſt needs be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally binding at leaſt as a <hi>Rule,</hi> becauſe it's

It is certain that Believers are free thro' Chriſt from the Condemnation of the Law, and that it's principal Uſe to them is not to affect their fear by its Threats, but to inform their Judgments and direct their Practice by it's Precepts: They are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influenced by the free ingenuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Love that inclines them to obey the Law of Choice, which the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are drove to againſt their Inclination.

                  <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> namely, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> of <hi>Sin, eſtabliſhes</hi> the <hi>Law;</hi> for by this the Sinner is alarm'd out of his Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and arraign'd before the <hi>Bar</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and made to confeſs the Purity of its Precepts, and Equity of its condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sentence, together with his Deſert thereof by Sin.

it is attended with <hi>clearer Light,</hi> and for the general, with <hi>larger Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> than the legal Diſpenſation.

                  <p>Now the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the following Conſiderations, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt:</hi> Almighty God put Honour upon it, in the <hi>Manner of its Promulgation;</hi> it was given forth with the moſt awful Solemnity, and Enſigns of commanding Majeſty, that thereby Reverence and Obedience might be procur'd to it. The great <hi>God</hi> himſelf <hi>ſpoke all the Words</hi> of the Moral Law, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Exod. xx. 1.</note> and at the Time of the giving of it Jehovah de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in viſible Glory from the Manſions of Light, the <hi>Seat</hi> of his ſpecial Reſidence upon <hi>Sinai</hi>'s Mount; which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="unknown:005697_0140_1026C2F4F5255CA8"/>
repreſents with great beauty and grandeur of Diction; <hi>He bowed the Heavens and came down, he rode upon the Cherubims, and did fly upon the Wings of the Wind, he made Darkneſs his Pavilion round about him, at his Preſence the Earth ſhook, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Hills were moved,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly (as it were for fear of the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God) Sinai <hi>trembled,</hi> and was wrap'd in Fire and Smoke! <note n="¶" place="bottom">Pſalm xviii.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Terrors of that Day were likewiſe encreas'd, by the loud and long Blaſts of a Trumpet, by ſucceſſive Peals of Thunder and Flaſhes of Lightning, which opened a moſt tremendous Scene!</p>
                  <p>To what has been ſaid we may add, the divine Injunction, that the People muſt prepare themſelves to hear the LAW; they were to <hi>ſanctify themſelves and waſh their Cloaths:</hi> Now tho' this was a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Uſage peculiar to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy, yet doubtleſs the Sanctification of the Heart was thereby ſignified. They were alſo to abſtain from conjugal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:005697_0141_1026C2FE5EF5DB88"/>
that they might attend on the Hearing of the Law with greater Solemnity!</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Bounds were ſet to the Mount that none might touch it,</hi> in order to create a Reverence of that Law that was then to be proclaim'd! <note n="†" place="bottom">Ex. xix. 9. to the 22. Verſe.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly:</hi> Another Inſtance of Honour put upon the Moral Law, was the <hi>writing of it upon Tables of Stone by the Finger of God:</hi> 
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ex. xxxi. 18.</note> By which we are doubtleſs to underſtand his Power and immediate Operation: This was ſurely deſign'd to repreſent in a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Manner, the eminent <hi>Dignity</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Moral Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly:</hi> Jehovah's <hi>repairing</hi> the <hi>Tables</hi> after they were broken, is an additional Argument for the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> Jehovah <hi>commanded</hi> Moſes <hi>to hew two Tables of Stone like unto the Firſt,</hi> and promis'd <hi>that he wou'd write upon them the Words which were in the firſt Tables, that</hi> Moſes <hi>broke:</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Ex. xxxiv. 1.</note> Here it is evident, that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſecond Tables, was done im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by God himſelf, like that of the Firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="unknown:005697_0142_1026C2FFE7404F30"/>
                     <hi>Fourthly:</hi> The <hi>Shine upon the Face of</hi> Moſes <hi>was ſo great, that the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>could not ſtedfaſtly behold him without a Vail.</hi> This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> applies to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Law, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. iii.</note> and acknowledges that it had a great deal of Glory in it, <hi>but ſuch as was to vaniſh;</hi> not that the Law it ſelf was to vaniſh, no by no Means! but only that particular Diſpenſation of it of which he ſpeaks, which was attended with many Ceremonies and Types, that when the Antitype came, of their accord evaniſhed.</p>
                  <p>When the Apoſtle calls the <hi>Law,</hi> a <hi>killing Letter,</hi> a <hi>Miniſtration</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Condemnation;</hi> he ſpeaks of it only
<q>as ſeparate from, and ſet in Oppoſition to the Goſpel, <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. iii.</note> which it never was (ſays excellent Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi>) ſince the Fall, but by the Ignorance and Infidelity of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Men.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly:</hi> The <hi>Preſervation of the Law in the Ark,</hi> and that by vertue of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of God, is another Evidence of its
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:005697_0143_1026C3018813AC38"/>
                     <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Excellency:</hi> 
                     <note n="¶" place="bottom">1 Kings viii. 9.</note> To which might be added, the Time of <hi>Moſes's</hi> being on the Mount at the giving of it, and his Preſervation for the Space of Forty Days, without Meat or Drink, which doubtleſs was a Miracle wrought in Honour of the Law of God. But I proceed to the</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Propos'd, which was to ſhew <hi>the Excellency of the</hi> Moral Law, <hi>from the Characters or Properties aſcrib'd to it in the divine Word.</hi>

                  <p>Now the Moral Law has the following Characters in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is call'd the <hi>Royal Law,</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that it is enjoyn'd by the Authority of God as a King; and if ſo, then it muſt needs be an Inſtance of <hi>Loyalty</hi> to obey it, and of <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of all, to diſclaim and reject it. The royal Law is the King's Law: <hi>i. e.</hi>
                     <q>The great Law, which is the ſame to all rich and poor, the common Rule by which all are to act, as the King's Way: <note n="‡" place="bottom">Numb. xxi. 22.</note>

                     </note> This Senſe of the Words the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> confirms, by ſaying in the ſame Verſe, <hi>if ye fulfill the Royal Law according to the Scriptures, ye do well:</hi> Now that he means the Moral Law, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly from what is expreſs'd in the ſame Text, <hi>thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>Law</hi> is full of <hi>royal Majeſty,</hi> both on the Account of the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> of it; it is enjoyn'd by the <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi> who has Power to bind and looſe the Conſciences of Men, and is only <hi>able to ſave and deſtroy;</hi> and the <hi>Equity</hi> of its <hi>Matter,</hi> does likewiſe eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh its univerſal and unceaſing Empire,

and venerable Majeſty; and hence it is the ſame with the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> from which, as a Fountain, all other good Laws do ſpring, to every of which it is ſuperior and by which they are all judg'd, but it is judg'd by none!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly:</hi> Its a <hi>ſpiritual Law: We know</hi> ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, that the Law is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> we know it both b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Inſpiration and Experience; the Law is ſpiritual in reſpect of its <hi>Author, Extent</hi> and <hi>Tendency,</hi> God who is a Spirit has formed it, and made it extend to the Spirit or Soul of Man; it not only regulates our overt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but preſcribes Bounds to our Thoughts and Deſires, as appears from our Lord's Explication of it. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. v. 28.</note> It requires ſpiritual Duties, ſuch as pure <hi>Love</hi> to the bleſſed God, <hi>Faith</hi> in his Word, and a <hi>Reverence</hi> of his Majeſty, as well as <hi>outward Acts</hi> of Obedience from ſpiritual <hi>Principles,</hi> and therefore it tends to make thoſe that are ſubject to it, ſpiritual in the Frame of their Minds, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them to that God who is a Spirit.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly:</hi> It is a <hi>holy Law; the Law is holy, and the Commandment holy:</hi> 
                     <note n="‡‡" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 12.</note> The Law is not only holy in reſpect of its <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> but likewiſe in regard of its <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Effects;</hi> it proceeds from a holy God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Things that are meerly <hi>poſitive,</hi> are Good becauſe they are commanded, and therefore alterable; but Things that are <hi>Moral</hi> are commanded becauſe they are <hi>intrinſically Good,</hi> and agreeable to that eternal Juſtice and Goodneſs that are in God himſelf: And hence it neceſſarily follows, that to ſuppoſe that God may command contrary Things (in a moral Senſe) is to ſuppoſe that God may contradict his own Nature and ſo deny himſelf, which is Blaſphemous?</p>
                  <p>And indeed the Contrary of the Moral

Precepts, does not only deſtroy all Religion, but likewiſe civil Society at a Stroke!</p>
                  <p>Neither did the Command of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſlay his Son, and to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> to borrow Jewels of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> contradict the Precepts of the Moral Law: For in the former Inſtance the Sovereign Lord of Life and Death did but give Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to <hi>Abraham</hi> to take away a Life which he was the ſole Author of, and therefore could remove when he pleas'd; but <hi>Murder</hi> is the taking away of a Life without juſt Authority. And in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Inſtance, the Almighty, who made all Things, and is conſequently abſolute Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them, did but transfer the civil dependant Right of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and this indeed was but a juſt Compenſation for their hard Services. <hi>May not the Lord do with his own what he pleaſes?</hi> But Theft is the taking away what belongs to another without juſt Authority or Right.</p>
                  <p>And it may be farther obſerv'd, that the <hi>Egyptions</hi> gave their Veſſels freely to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> neither did they aſk them again
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:005697_0151_1026C3174644EF48"/>
when they left that Part of the World but drove them away with the Veſſels in haſte; neither was the other Precept to <hi>Abraham abſolute,</hi> but only a Command of Tryal.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed. The <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>Good,</hi> not only in reſpect of it's <hi>Precepts</hi> but <hi>Sanctions.</hi> It is accompany'd with Promiſes both of ſpiritual and temporal Good, as appears from the ſecond and fourth Commands: It was therefore wicked in the <hi>heretical Manichees</hi> (who infeſted the Church about the fourth Century, whom bleſſed <hi>Auguſtine</hi> faithfully oppos'd) to ſay that the Law was only Carnal, and had only carnal Promiſes; whereas it is certain that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had for Subſtance the ſame Faith, which we now, thro' divine Goodneſs, enjoy. And the <hi>Threatnings</hi> annex'd to the Moral Law are Juſt, and therefore Good.</p>
                  <p>Again, the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>Good</hi> in regard of it's <hi>Uſe.</hi> Now the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> is either <hi>general</hi> to all Men or <hi>particular</hi> to ſome. And,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moral Law</hi> is a Declaration of God's Will to Mankind, reſpecting their Duty to him and each other, obliging them to perſonal, perfect and perpetual Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>As we are <hi>Creatures</hi> we are <hi>Subjects,</hi> he who gave us Being has a Right to demand Obedience from us, to what he preſcribes.</p>
                  <p>And tho' we have made ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to perform perfect perſonal O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law, yet God's Right to it remains firm; our Sin cannot leſſen that: And tho' Proviſion is made through Chriſt for the Juſtification of our Perſons upon believing, and the Acceptance of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,

tho' imperfect, Services thro' him; yet are we bound by the Law as a Rule to ſeek after a Perfection of Holineſs in our own Perſons, and to lament from Love our Defects. The Deſign of Chriſt's coming into the World was to ſtrengthen the Obligation of the Law as a Rule, by Arguments of Ingenuity and Gratitude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of diſſolving it. Here obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. That the <hi>Law informs</hi> all Men of the Holy <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and their <hi>Duty</hi> to him: The divine <hi>Perfections</hi> are impreſs'd on the <hi>Moral Law</hi> in large, legible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible <hi>Characters;</hi> his <hi>Sovereignty</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Obedience; his <hi>Wiſdom, Holineſs</hi> and Righteouſneſs in the Nature of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties requir'd, which are reaſonable, pure, equal, and his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in their Uſe and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to us: What is the Language of the Law, but <hi>Holineſs</hi> towards God and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> towards Man?</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. The Moral Law binds the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all Men to Obedience, ſo that none have Reaſon preſumptuouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to their Ruin, <hi>We may live as we liſt, and who is Lord over us?</hi> And indeed
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:005697_0154_1026C32257A87138"/>
the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God ſhine with equal Glory and Luſtre in continuing our Obligation to Obedience as the Way to future Bleſſedneſs: This Method tends to prevent the pregnant Woe and Ruin which would enſue the Withdraw of our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance from our Creator and Sovereign Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. The <hi>Moral Law</hi> being <hi>ſpiritual, pure, perfect,</hi> the exact Model and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible Standard of Integrity has a noble Tendency to ſhew us that we are <hi>carnal, impure</hi> and <hi>imperfect.</hi> When this <hi>Law</hi> by the Spirit's Influence <hi>enters</hi> into the Soul and Conſcience, <hi>then does Sin abound</hi> in our View, in reſpect of its Number, Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Demerit; and thus we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of our Inability to fulfil it, and humbled under a Senſe of Sin and Miſery, as well as thereby induc'd to behold our abſolute Need of a Redeemer's Obedience together with the Perfection of it, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Law's Demands.</p>
                  <p>But the particular Uſe of the Moral Law either reſpects the Unregenerate or Regenerate. Now,</p>

                  <p>Nor is it reaſonable to imagine, that our Lord in his firſt Sermon, wou'd have uſed a Method which had no direct Tendency to convert his Hearers.

                  <p n="1">1ſt. It <hi>diſcovers Heart Sins:</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle had not known</hi> the Evil of <hi>Luſt, if the Law had not ſaid, thou ſhalt not covet.</hi>

                  <p>It is ſurely <hi>Ignorance</hi> of God's <hi>Law,</hi> that makes Men <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>Self-righteous,</hi> and conceit that they are perfect.

but their Ignorance of the Spiritual Extent of the Law? This puffed them up with ambitious Diſdain of others, and enclin'd them to ſay, as the Prophet expreſſes <hi>it, ſtand by thy ſelf, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou,</hi>

                  <p n="3">(3dly.) The <hi>Law tends to make us prize Chriſt</hi> by ſhewing us our need of him.

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Cant. viii. 5.</note>,</p>
                  <p n="4">(4thly.) The <hi>Law excites to Duty,</hi> both by its <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Penalties:</hi> As a <hi>Good</hi> it rouſes the Believer out of his Sloth and Security, and excites him to <hi>work out the Work of his Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Altho' the Regenerate have a new Nature, which diſpoſes them to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and are principally influenced to Obedience from <hi>Love;</hi> yet they need the Diſcipline of Fear: Nor is there any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency between a predominant Love to God as a Father, and a Fear of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Sin, as well as the Conſequences of the Offence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="unknown:005697_0169_1026C350A28F5210"/>I may add, that the Law is of ſingular Service to the People of God, in bringing them to a compaſſionate and merciful Frame of Spirit towards others that have fallen, by ſhewing them their own Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Blunders! And as this is a noble Attainment in it ſelf, ſo it is of great Uſe in promoting the Good of Society. <q>The <hi>Law</hi> is likewiſe of great <hi>Uſe</hi> to <hi>Believers,</hi> (as the <hi>Weſtminſter Aſſembly</hi> juſtly obſerve) in ſhewing them how much they are bound to Chriſt for his fulfiling it, and enduring the Curſe thereof in their Stead and for their Good, and thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to more thankfulneſs, and to expreſs the ſame in their greater Care to conform themſelves thereunto as the Rule of their Obedience.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Believer</hi> is under a <hi>peculiar</hi> and ſuperadded Obligation to obey the <hi>Law,</hi> for he is not only bound by God's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, over him in common with others, as he is God's Creature, but he is conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the dying Love of Chriſt, as he is a Believer. Now inaſmuch as the Precepts and Penalties of the Moral Law being
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:005697_0170_1026C35235469490"/>
exact and great, they ſerve to ſhew the Riches and Greatneſs of the Redeemer's Love, who was willing to be <hi>made under the Law,</hi> and did fulfil its Demands for us; and thus our Gratitude is incited, which cannot be better expreſs'd then by a willing, unfeigned, unfainting, univerſal Obedience to God's Law, which we owe to <hi>God</hi> as our rightful Lord and Sovereign, our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Benefactor and Father; to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as our King and Redeemer, and to the Holy Spirit as our Sanctifier.</p>
                  <p>But beſide theſe ſpiritual Benefits of the Moral Law to the Unregenerate and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, which have been mentioned, the Law promotes the temporal Good of both; this is the <hi>Guardian</hi> and <hi>Barrier</hi> of all that is naturally dear to us; hereby our Names and Eſtates, our Liberties and Lives are protected from Injuſtice and Violence!</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to offer a Word of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. And</p>

Effects of it in your ſelves? O! have ye felt its convincing and condemning Power? Have ye been thereby thro' the Influence of God's Holy Spirit, brought to ſee not only the Evils of your Practice, but alſo that Fountain of Corruption in the Heart from which they proceed? Particularly have ye been convinc'd of your Unbelief? Your total Want of true Faith and Inability to Believe, as well as your utter Unworthineſs of the Gift of Faith from God? O! were ye ever made ſenſible that ye were in a periſhing State with the Prodigal? And has the Spirit of God become a <hi>Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to fear</hi> to your Souls? Shewing you thro' the Condemnation of that righteous Law ye have broken, the Greatneſs, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and Eternity of that <hi>Miſery</hi> you were thereby expos'd to, in ſuch a ſtrong Light as to affect your Souls with bitter Anguiſh and Diſtreſs, and excite anxious Enquiries after the Way of Deliverance therefrom?

Chriſt's Sufficiency and Willingneſs, (to help poor ſin-ſick Souls that fly to him for ſhelter) to venture your wounded, weary Souls by believing upon him, as the only Foundation of Acceptance with God? And have ye been ſince enclin'd to love the holy <hi>Law</hi> of God as a perfect Rule of Life, becauſe of its <hi>Author,</hi> its excellent <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Effects?</hi> And has it been your chief Deſire and Endeavour in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to conform to it in Heart and Practice, from Love to him as a Father, and Fear of him as a Maſter and Lord? And have your Defects therein been for the general your chief Grief? If you can anſwer with a good Conſcience in the Affirmative, you are ſincere and in a gracious State. O! what cauſe have ye to love God, my dear Brethren, to exalt him and rejoice in him, in all Changes of outward Circumſtance! O how diſtinguiſhing and affecting is the Mercy of God towards you! in bringing his bleſſed Law to your Hearts, and you thereby to the holy Jeſus? And that while many others ſit as ſenſeleſs Stones under the ſame Word; the very Sermon

which was bleſs'd to your Conviction or Converſion, perhaps ſome poor, ignorant, conceity Creatures in the ſame Aſſembly, cavil'd with and ſnarl'd at, and went away and told groſs Lies about it, in order to blacken the Speaker inſtead of getting Good by it. O admire! admire! the rich, the glorious Grace of God! and let that Law that the bleſſed God has made a Mean of ſuch Good to your Souls, be ever eſteemed by you; take it as the Rule of your Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, <hi>meditate upon it all the Day,</hi> and let it be the chief Labour of your Life to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to it in Heart and Converſation. O make Uſe of the Law of God to convince you of Sin, to humble you for Sin, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite you to thankfulneſs and practical Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Dear Brethren! Let not your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> lie chiefly at the <hi>Tip</hi> of your <hi>Tongues,</hi> but watch your <hi>Hearts,</hi> and bring forth the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Holineſs</hi> or <hi>Obedience</hi> to God's Law in your Lives.</p>
                  <p>But alas! how much is the Caſe of ſuch to be pitied and lamented, who want the aforeſaid Experiences! All ye to whoſe Hearts the Law of God has not been
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:005697_0174_1026C35F9B7EAE58"/>
brought in its condemning Influence, who have not ſeen the falſe Grounds of your Hopes, the Filthineſs of your Hearts, and the Badneſs of your States, and who have never been ſhut up to Chriſt as the only Door of Hope by the Law, are falſe-hearted Hypocrites!</p>
                  <p>And what ground is there to ſuſpect the State of ſuch who grow weary of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God's Law, and look upon it to be a State of Bondage? <hi>i. e.</hi> In other Words, it is bondage to be <hi>Holy,</hi> in their Opinion; for Obedience to God's Law, from Love to God and regard to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Authority, is the very Nature of Holineſs, as I have prov'd before: They therefore neglect the ſtated Performance of Duty in their Cloſets and Families, and count this Chriſtian Liberty, whereas it is only a fleſhly Gratifying the wicked Sloth of Nature: Chriſtian Liberty is a Freedom from Sin, and not from Righteouſneſs; <hi>as free</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Peter) and yet not uſing your Liberty as a Cloak of Maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but as the Servants of God.</hi> Thoſe that are Chriſt's Freemen, are God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:005697_0175_1026C36129B0E1D0"/>
and do manifeſt it by Obedience to his Authority. Chriſt has never purchaſed by his Blood, a Liberty, or rather a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for any to commit Wickedneſs. O! its a Sign of an unholy Heart in any, to be weary of the Yoke of God's Precepts, and to ſay with the Wicked, <hi>let us break their Bands aſunder, and caſt their Cords from us.</hi> Thoſe that are ſincerely Holy, love God's Law, <hi>it is their Meditation all the Day,</hi> and they look upon Obedience to it, to be ſweet Liberty!</p>
                  <p>But on the Contrary, obſtinate Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors <hi>break the Yoke, and burſt the Bands.</hi> Sirs! it is a dreadful Inſtance of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to pretend that the Goſpel or Grace of God, frees from Obedience to the Law; that is, to make the Goſpel an Inſtrument of the vileſt Iniquity, and to ſay in other Words, that it gives Men licence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce God's Authority over them, and riſe up in Rebellion againſt his Crown and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! or that it has put an End to all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in thoſe that accept it.

<pb n="176" facs="unknown:005697_0176_1026C3681B568130"/>
Whereas on the Contrary, it is the Deſign of the Goſpel, <hi>to deliver us from the Hands of our Enemies, that we may</hi> SERVE <hi>him without fear, (i. e.</hi> ſlaviſh Fear) <hi>in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the Days of our Life; to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, and to make us zealous of good Works.</hi>

                  <p>DEAR Brethren! Seeing the right Underſtanding of the proper Uſe of the Law of God, together with its <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Excellency,</hi> is of ſo great Moment in Religion, I hope you will not think it ſtrange that I have repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly inſiſted upon ſo important a Subject, and eſpecially conſidering, that it is ſomewhat difficult to explain and ſtate in an eaſy Light, to the Overthrow of all the Cavils and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms with which it has been obſcur'd and oppos'd, either by the Deſigning or Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious: This I could not do in a very narrow Compaſs, and therefore have been led reluctant to Proxility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="unknown:005697_0187_1026C387C3D9A820"/>I have been likewiſe induced, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the more to ruminate upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, becauſe it is much miſunderſtood by ſome, and ſlighted by others in the preſent Day!</p>
                  <p>It is certainly our Duty in a ſpecial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to labour to underſtand well thoſe precious Truths, that are controverted in the Times and Places in which we live, (eſpecially if they concern practical Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and have conſiderable Influence upon it) that ſo we may be preſerv'd from the Infection of the Times, and glorify God as his Witneſſes, in bearing a judicious and faithful Teſtimony to God's Truths, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are ignorantly oppoſed by ſome, and baſely diſſerted and betrayed by others!</p>
                  <p>It is as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> obſerves, <hi>the ignorant and unſtable, that wreſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their own Deſtruction:</hi> It is theſe <hi>ſimple, ſilly</hi> Souls, that falſe Teachers <hi>deceive with their good Words and fair Speeches,</hi> and therefore it is no wonder they cry out againſt <hi>Head-Knowledge,</hi> becauſe it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the Spread of their erroneous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:005697_0188_1026C38A84280E70"/>
and nonſenſical Sentiments, tho' in the mean time, the God of Truth on the contrary denounces his awful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Ignorant, <hi>this is a People of no Underſtanding, and therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Dear Brethren! forget not to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor and oppoſe that vile <hi>Popiſh</hi> Notion, <hi>that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion!</hi> If they had ſaid that it was the Mother of <hi>Superſtition, Enthuſiaſm</hi> and <hi>Nonſenſe,</hi> they wou'd have ſaid right, but true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is grounded in Knowledge. I paſs from this to obſerve, that I have in the preceeding Sermon, endeavour'd to ſhew you, <hi>the Dignity and Excellency of the Moral Law,</hi> by mentioning the <hi>Honours</hi> that the bleſſed God put upon it at its Promulgation, as well as by explaining five honourable <hi>Characters,</hi> that the Holy Scriptures aſſign to it. What remains now, is to offer ſome more ſcriptural <hi>Characters</hi> or Properties of the Moral Law, to anſwer
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:005697_0189_1026C38C0BAA8E98"/>
ſome <hi>Objections,</hi> and then proceed to the <hi>Improvement</hi> of the whole. The</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixth</hi> Character therefore that I wou'd mention, is, that it is a <hi>perfect Law.</hi> Now the Law of God is perfect in the following Reſpects, <hi>viz. Eſſentially, Extenſively, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively,</hi> and <hi>Finally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law is perfect in its <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Eſſence,</hi> ſo as to contain in it a compleat Rule of all things, that are to be done and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by every one, towards God and towards his Neighbour; ſo that there is no Work truly and properly Good, which does not agree with it, and is not preſcrib'd by it. Whatſoever is neither commanded nor forbid by it, is in its Nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and left to Men's Liberty, except that Liberty be reſtrained by ſome poſſitive Precept.</p>
                  <p>The Moral Law is likewiſe perfect <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively,</hi> in reſpect of its <hi>Parts,</hi> it enjoyns Love to God and Man, and therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the Duties we owe to both; and therefore the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were forbid
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:005697_0190_10269293EB4D82A0"/>
to add any Thing to it, or diminiſh any thing from it. <note n="¶" place="bottom">Deut iv. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again the bleſſed Law of God is <hi>perfect Intenſively,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Degrees;</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires perfect Love, the moſt ſupreme, tranſcendent and intenſe Affection, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Add to this, that the Moral Law is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Finally,</hi> in reſpect of its orginial Uſe and Deſign; it could give Life to the perfect Obſervers of it: This the Almighty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf declar'd to <hi>Moſes</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>ye ſhall therefore keep my Statutes and my Judgments, which if a Man do he ſhall live in them.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Lev. xviii. v.</note> Man's contracted inability to keep the Law to Perfection, is his own Fault, and therefore cannot be juſtly charg'd upon the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>The Perfection of the Law appears from the Deſign of Chriſt's coming, which was not to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> but to <hi>fulfil it.</hi> The original Word, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pleroſai.</note> by a <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> ſignifies to do what was enjoyned by it. <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xxii. 37.

The Words of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> are excellent to this purpoſe; <hi>For Brethren ye have been call'd to Liberty, only uſe not Liberty for an occaſion to the Fleſh.—For all the Law is fulfill'd in one Word, even in this, thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi>

                  <p>And why is the Goſpel ſometimes call'd a Law? <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life,</hi> but to ſhew, that there is a wiſe Conſtitution of God under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, without a Complyance with which, we can have no Benefit by its gracious Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals; and alſo to ſignify that the Goſpel is not without the Moral Law, which is now indeed propos'd to Believers, in a more mild and gentle Dreſs, than obtain'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> OEconomy; but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it ſtill obliges all rational Creatures to Obedience that enjoy it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the Creature is neceſſarily Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on God, is a ſelf evident Propoſition; for otherwiſe it would not be a Creature, <hi>In God we live, move and have our Being.</hi> Now, an Obligation to obedience flows neceſſarily from this, as appears thus: <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> has a Right to the Creature's Service, not only becauſe of the <hi>Independance, Self-exiſtence</hi> and tranſcendent <hi>Perfection</hi> of his <hi>Being,</hi> but becauſe he is the Author of the Creature's <hi>Being</hi> and all its <hi>Benefits.</hi> Now ſeeing the Almighty gave to Man a Capacity to perform Acts of Worſhip and Obedience to his Creator, it is but reaſonable that the Almighty ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his <hi>Due.</hi> And on the Contrary its very unreaſonable to imagine that God gave Powers to his Creatures to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or caſt off all Care about them! It is equally abſur'd to ſuppoſe, either that God ſhould make his rational Creatures for no valuable End, or that he ſhould not propoſe proper Means to attain it, or ceaſe requiring a Compliance with thoſe Means!</p>

                     <pb n="223" facs="unknown:005697_0223_1026C3ACC4CA68F0"/>Again let it be conſidered, my Brethren. that if the Moral Precepts be alterable, then they are only of a <hi>poſitive Nature;</hi> and if ſo, the Almighty might either not have enjoyned thoſe Things, or have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the Contrary, and ſo according to this Scheme the Bleſſed God might not only have neglected giving a Law to the reaſonable Creature to love and Worſhip him, but have commanded him to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme and diſobey his Creator, to believe in no God at all, or to worſhip falſe Gods, yea to worſhip the very Devil himſelf!

and the <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> and ſo no greater O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation to Obedience to the one than the other, and conſequently no greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in violating the one than the other; and ſo the Man that touched a dead Body, or eat ſwines Fleſh, would be guilty of as great a Crime as he that <hi>blaſphemed</hi> the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>murdered</hi> his <hi>Father,</hi> which is quite rediculous to imagine!</p>
                  <p>Nor can the <hi>Moral Law</hi> as a <hi>Rule</hi> be deſtroy'd, becauſe of it's Conformity to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> it is the Rule of God's I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in Man, in which <hi>Jehovah</hi> has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd his Righteouſneſs and Holineſs: Now it is unreaſonable to think that God would deſtroy his own Image.</p>
                  <p>Without Conformity to the <hi>Moral Law</hi> we cannot imitate the <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to which we are ſo frequently urg'd in Scripture, and therefore its Obſervation is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>

                  <p>By the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> I underſtand the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the <hi>practical Notions</hi> of the <hi>Difference between Moral Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> which we receive with our Nature; or a practical <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Moral Duties,</hi> which was originally impreſs'd on the human Mind when Man was firſt form'd, to which all Mankind are by Nature oblig'd.</p>
                  <p>Altho' this <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> was much broken by the Fall of Man, yet that there be ſome Remains of it in all, we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Evidence from <hi>Scripture, Conſcience,</hi> the <hi>conſent of Mankind,</hi> and the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Holy Scriptures aſſure us, that the <hi>Gentiles, who had not the Law, (i. e.</hi> the written Law of <hi>Moſes) did by Nature the Things contain'd in the Law, and ſo were a Law to themſelves, and ſhew'd the Work of the Law written in their Hearts.</hi> And does not the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of every Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, that <hi>Good</hi> is to be done, and

                     <hi>Evil</hi> to be avoided? What elſe is the <hi>Source</hi> of thoſe Uneaſineſſes for ſecret E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils which do not fall under the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of human Laws, with which the Wicked are tormented, and all their brutiſh Delights allay'd with the Forebodings of future Miſery?</p>
                  <p>If there was no <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> why ſhould the moſt ſavage and uncultivated Nations own a ſupream Being, and that he is to be adored as well as our Parents ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, and juſtice maintain'd? Whence flow all the Laws of Nations reſpecting Honeſty and Juſtice, if there was no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Rule of Right implanted in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Mind?</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Reaſon</hi> likewiſe gives its <hi>Suffrage</hi> to the Reality of the Law of Nature thus: Seeing the Creature as ſuch depends una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably upon its former, and is govern'd by him <hi>phiſically,</hi> it is abſur'd to ſuppoſe that it ſhould not be govern'd by him alſo in a <hi>Moral Way,</hi> agreeable to its Nature, which cannot be without a Law. It therefore follows that either Man muſt be

made independant, or have a natutal Law impreſs'd upon his Mind!</p>
                  <p>And indeed innumerable <hi>Inconſiſtences</hi> follow the contrary Sentiment, <hi>e. g.</hi> If nothing be in its Nature Juſt, but that which Men judge profitable to them, then it follows that Men are born for themſelves and not for the Glory of that Being to whom they owe their Original! Or for the Good of Society, and then all Things would be equally lawful, to love God, or hate him; to honour our Parents, or cut their Throats! Thus every Man's Luſt would be his Rule of Actions, and ſo a Scene of Confuſion and Blood would open to the utter Deſtruction of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Race! If the Law of Nature be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, my Brethren, then are the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of civil Juſtice unhing'd, from which Fountains iſſue Human Laws: Hereby a Way is open'd to <hi>Atheiſm</hi> in Principle, and the moſt <hi>ſordid Evils</hi> in <hi>Practice,</hi> ſo that all <hi>Religion, Virtue, Order</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> are hereby entirely ſubverted, and left ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring in the Agonies of Death.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and the
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:005697_0228_1026C3FD94BBB570"/>
                     <hi>Moral Law</hi> are the very ſame in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the ſame Duties towards God and Man, which are preſcrib'd by the Moral Law, are contain'd in the Law of Nature: The Sum of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as I have before obſerv'd, is to love God and our Neighbour, and this is the very Law of Nature: All the Precepts of the Moral Law are impreſs'd on rational Nature, and may be diſcover'd by its Light: There is nothing in them but right Reaſon dictates or approves of; nothing but what belongs to all Nations in all Ages of the World; nothing but what is neceſſary to Human Nature to obtain its proper End, and therefore it ought to be of perpetual Obligation; for rational Nature is ever the ſame, and like itſelf, and conſequently ſo muſt that which is grounded upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Difference between the <hi>Moral Law</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> is only in <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals</hi> and <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> as follows: What is contain'd in the Law of Nature, is more clearly and diſtinctly declar'd in the Moral Law. The Law of Nature was much obſcur'd by the Fall of Man, and
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:005697_0229_1026C3B636FF6820"/>
therefore there was need of a Renovation of it: The Law of Nature was wrote upon the Mind of Man, and binds all; but the Moral Law upon Tables of Stone, and belongs to thoſe that are privileged with the Knowledge of it: The Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has nothing but what is Moral in it; but the Moral Law contains ſome Things that are <hi>poſitive or ceremonial,</hi> not in its <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> but in the <hi>Arguments</hi> exciting to the Performance of them. Thus the firſt Command is enforc'd by an Argument of Gratitude peculiar to the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz. <hi>God's bringing them out of</hi> Egypt. And ſo as to the Fourth, tho' the Duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd be Moral, namely the <hi>Dedication</hi> of a <hi>ſeventh Part</hi> of <hi>our Time,</hi> or one Day in Seven to the <hi>Worſhip of God;</hi> yet the <hi>Specification</hi> of one Day rather than another for that purpoſe is only poſitive and therefore alterable; for there is no real Difference in the ſeveral Parts of Time as to their <hi>Nature,</hi> all Time is alike in itſelf, and therefore equally fit for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip: And thus it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the <hi>Specification</hi> of one Day
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:005697_0230_1026C40210C6CCC0"/>
rather than another cannot be <hi>moral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> or grounded upon the Nature and Reaſon of Things. This, learned Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> repreſents in the following Manner. <q>The Moral Law required no more than one Day of Seven to be kept as a Day of Holy Reſt, not this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Day; the <hi>Jews</hi> learn'd it from the Ceremonial Law, as Chriſtians learn theirs from Chriſt's and the Apoſtles Practice. Nor is it any Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this that the ſeventh Day from the Creation is mentioned in the Law to thoſe who know how to diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>the Argument,</hi> the Seventh from the Creation is not in the <hi>Precept</hi> but in the <hi>Argument: For in Six Days,</hi> &amp;c. Now there is nothing more Ordinary than to have Arguments of a particular temporary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment uſed to inforce Precepts of an eternal Obligation; where the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts were firſt given to that particular People, as to whom thoſe Arguments were of Force, an Inſtance of which is in the firſt Commandment as well as
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:005697_0231_1026C3BA92F6B0C8"/>
in this: As on the other ſide Arguments of univerſal Force are oft annext to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which had but a particular Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon a particular People for a Time. Thus in the Ceremonial Law we often find it is an Argument to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force many Ceremonial Precepts: <hi>For I am the Lord thy God.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I may add that what has been ſaid is farther confirm'd by an Argument or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of a temporary Nature, which is annex'd to the 5th Commandment, <hi>That thy Days may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> This certainly intended the earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> which was promis'd to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo had ſomething in it peculiar to that Nation which does not extend to us. Now I ſay excepting thoſe Arguments mentioned, which are annex'd to the Firſt, Fourth, and Fifth Commands, the whole Moral Law is the very ſame with the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore perpetually binding.</p>
                  <p>The Law of Nature being <hi>Natural,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:005697_0232_1026C404C4A777A0"/>
Univerſal,</hi> and <hi>Rational,</hi> muſt needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to the laſt Period of the Line of Time. And the Moral Law being the ſame in Subſtance with it, muſt needs be of the ſame Duration.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to the <hi>Improvement</hi> of this Subject. And <hi>Firſt:</hi> From what has been ſaid, you may learn the Neceſſity of <hi>preaching</hi> the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> ſeeing it is a Mean of ſo many and important Benefits to the Unconverted and Converted, and that thoſe who neglect it do great Injury to the Souls of Men, and uſe a Mean which tends but to deceive Men and flatter them to their Ruin! He is a fooliſh <hi>Builder,</hi> that pretends to raiſe the Fabrick before he lays the Foundation, or attempts to lay it without digging, in order to it. He is a fooliſh <hi>Phyſician,</hi> that pretends to cure a Lethargy by Anodynes. He is a fooliſh <hi>Surgeon,</hi> or ſomething worſe, that pretends to cure an old Ulcer without probing it and ſearching it firſt. He is alſo a fooliſh <hi>Farmer,</hi> that pretends to ſow before he plows. To ſound the comfortable Strains of Peace and Pardon, and a Saviour's <hi>Blood,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:005697_0233_1026C3BD4D69EA08"/>
only</hi> in the Ears of a ſecure World; tho' it pleaſes them and may poſſibly move the ſofter Paſſions of ſome; yet like a <hi>lul-a-by,</hi> it tends to rock or ſoothe them into a deeper Sleep of Security to their endleſs Deſtruction! Such Preachers <hi>daub with untempered Mortar, and ſlay the Souls of Men by promiſing them Life,</hi> as the Prophet expreſſes it.</p>
                  <p>Such Miniſters as have preach'd the Law moſt, have been moſt ſucceſsful; witneſs <hi>Hooker, Hilderſham, Baal, Bolton, Rogers,</hi> and an Army of others of precious Memory. And here give me leave to mention the Teſtimony of one of the moſt learned and pious Divines of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, I mean the Reverend Doctor <hi>John Owen,</hi> who in his Treatiſe of Juſtification ſpeaks thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Let no Man think to underſtand the Goſpel, who knoweth nothing of the Law. God's Conſtitution and the Nature of Things themſelves, have given the Law the Precedency with reſpect unto Sinners; <hi>For by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin;</hi> and Goſpel-Faith is the Souls acting for
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:005697_0234_1026C407DE93B688"/>
Deliverance from that State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which it is caſt under by the Law. And all thoſe Deſcriptions of Faith, which abound in the Writings of <hi>learned Men,</hi> which do not at leaſt include in them a virtual Reſpect unto this State and Condition, or the Work of the Law on the Conſciences of Sinners, are all of them vain Speculations! There is nothing in this Doctrine which I will more firmly adhere unto than the Neceſſity of the Convictions mentioned, previous unto true believing, without which, not one Line of it can be underſtood aright, and Men do but beat the Air in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about it.</q> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Vide Owen</hi> of Juſt. p. 133.</note> If any will call us legal Preachers, becauſe we preach the Law; we Anſwer, that we follow our Lord's Example in ſo doing, and if they will reproach us for our imitating him, we hope our Maſter will ſupport us under thoſe unjuſt Cenſures, that condemn his Practice as well as ours, and in ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany we need neither be afraid or aſham'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="235" facs="unknown:005697_0235_1026C3C066DD3418"/>
                     <hi>Secondly:</hi> We may learn that there is a beautiful Harmony between the Law and Goſpel, they mutually honour and eſtabliſh each other. The <hi>Law</hi> ſends us to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſends us back to the Law for <hi>Direction.</hi> The Law helps us to ſee the abſolute Need of the Goſpel, and the Goſpel opens before us the tranſcendent Excellency of the Law. O let us admire the Wiſdom, the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Holineſs and Love of God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd in this <hi>Harmony!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly:</hi> From what has been ſaid, we may learn the Danger of rejecting the Law of God. This ſtrikes at the Foundations of the Chriſtian Religion, and directly tends to deſtroy it entirely! For</p>
                  <p>Hereby an awful <hi>Bar</hi> is put in the Way of <hi>Conviction, Faith, Repentance, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Juſtification, Conſolation,</hi> and ſo by conſequence of <hi>eternal Salvation!</hi> How ſhall poor Sinners be convinc'd if that Law be deſtroy'd by which is the Knowledge of Sin? And is there any probability that ſuch as are whole in their own Eyes, will apply in earneſt to Chriſt for a Cure?
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:005697_0236_1026C40A8A16DED8"/>
Or that thoſe who ſee no Danger, will fly by Faith to the Refuge ſet before them?</p>
                  <p>If there be no Law their can be no Tranſgreſſion of it, or in other Words, no Sin: And if there be no Sin, what need is there of Repentance? Shall People repent over what is not? No ſurely! And what need is there of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> to deliver from nothing?</p>
                  <p>And if the <hi>Moral Law</hi> is deſtroy'd, does not Juſtification fall with it? For is not that a Sentence judicially pronounc'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law? And how cruel and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious is it to rob poor Sinners of a Mean of their Converſion to God?</p>
                  <p>Neither can their be any ſuch Thing as Sanctification or Holineſs upon Earth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Moral Law. For what is Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but an inward and outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity thereto, or a renewing us after the Image of God, which is his Law? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> inaſmuch as they are neither requir'd by God, nor done in Obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Authority, (according to the Scheme I propoſe) are all <hi>Superſtition</hi> and
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:005697_0237_1026C3C38636F528"/>
                     <hi>Will-worſhip;</hi> and conſequently inſtead of being pleaſing to God, do provoke his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; becauſe they imply a Reflection upon his Wiſdom, Goodneſs or Fidelity; as if he either knew not how to furniſh his Creatures with a perfect Law for their Direction, or wanted Goodneſs and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to act in purſuance of his Wiſdom!</p>
                  <p>When Men reject the Law of God, they renounce Interpretatively, his Dominion over them, and commence their own Lord's and Maſters. And as to their Acts of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion, this Query ſpoils them all, <hi>Who hath required theſe Things at your Hands?</hi> And how ſhall thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, prize Chriſt as a Fountain, when the <hi>Glaſs</hi> that diſcovers their Blemiſhes is broken and caſt away? Or how ſhall they live daily upon his Offices, without a Sight of their Need of them?</p>
                  <p>Nor is <hi>Ignorance</hi> of our Sins in Heart and Life, the Way to true and real Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: For how ſhall thoſe be diſcovered to us, without comparing our ſelves with that Law of God, of which Sin is a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="238" facs="unknown:005697_0238_1026C40C0FB78B58"/>And are we like to extol the Glory of pure pardoning Grace, while the Sins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given are hid from our View by rejecting the Law of God?</p>
                  <p>Is there any Perfection of the bleſſed God, more venerable and amiable than his Holineſs? Of this the Seraphs ſhout with Joy and Tranſport, ſaying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hoſts!</hi> And certainly a Gladneſs, and Satisfaction ariſes to the Saints on Earth in ſome degree from a View thereof. Now does it not tend to mar their Joy and Satisfaction in this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, when the <hi>Law,</hi> that Image of the divine <hi>Purity</hi> is rejected? <hi>Surely in keeping God's Commands there is a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If our <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> be not built upon a right <hi>Foundation,</hi> they are worſe than none. And is the Foundation like to be well laid, while we are ignorant of our Sins thro' a Slight of the Law of God, the appointed Mean of Self-Knowledge?</p>

                  <p>From what has been ſaid, conſidered complexly, methinks this Concluſion na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and freely flows, <hi>viz.</hi> That the rejecting the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> directly tends to deſtroy all <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> at one dreadful <hi>Stroak,</hi> and conſequently, to plunge Mankind in a Deluge of Impiety, Confuſion and Ruin? <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>If they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi>

                     </gap>fore his Life is not a ſufficient Rule to us without the Law; neither do we find that it is any where recommended to us in Scripture as ſuch. His Practice was entirely perfect and without Stain, and therefore ſo far as it is reveal'd to us, it is both our Honour, our Duty, and our Priviledge to imitate it, (excepting ſuch extraordinary Caſes that concern'd him peculiarly as Mediator) but what is not reveal'd we know not, and therefore cannot imitate.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it reaſonable and ſafe for us to follow our <hi>Hearts</hi> as Rules or Guides, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are by Nature <hi>deceitful and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Wicked.</hi> And there are too much of the Remains thereof in the beſt of Men, which <hi>Paul</hi> bewail'd over in very moving Strains; ſaying, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Sin and Death?</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo far deceiv'd

by it, as to diſſuade his Lord from ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! Yea all the Apoſtles were ſo ſenſible of it, that they <hi>groan'd within themſelves, waiting for the Redemption of their Bodies!</hi> The Caſe being ſo, <hi>Solomon</hi> juſtly obſerves, that he <hi>who truſts in his Heart is a Fool,</hi> ſimple indeed in the worſt Senſe.</p>
                  <p>And to expect the Direction of God's Spirit, while we neglect or contemn the Means God has appointed for our Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is great and dangerous <hi>Preſumption; for all theſe Things God will be enquir'd of. i. e.</hi> apply'd to in the Uſe of proper Means.

Light, or guiſe of Truth and Good, and we have no Defenſative: For without the humble Uſe of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> how can we try the Spirits by the Word, or have any juſt and conſiſtent Apprehenſion of its meaning? In ſhort by this Notion the Scriptures are rendered Uſeleſs to us in Effect; for its much alike whether we want the Scriptures altogether, or want the true Knowledge of them in <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals:</hi> For it is by the Notion we have of the Meaning of the Scriptures that we are directed in Practice, and not by them conſidered abſolutely. It's abſurd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that an infinitely Wiſe God would firſt give <hi>Reaſon</hi> to his Creatures, and then order them to caſt it entirely away in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to become Religious; that is, firſt to commence <hi>Beaſts</hi> before they become Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>But ſome object againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> that Place of Scripture in the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>That the Law is not of Faith.</hi> I anſwer with <hi>Turretine:</hi> 
                     <q>That the Law is ſaid not to be of Faith, not as it is taken largely for

the whole <hi>Moſaick</hi> OEconomy, but ſtrictly for the Moral Law abſtracted and ſeparated from the Promiſes of Grace, in which Senſe the Self-righteous <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood it, who ſought Life by it; for that Faith was commanded in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant is evinc'd.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore, my dear Brethren! be entreated to eſteem and value God's holy Law, whatever Contempt others caſt upon it; let it be dear to us to the Death, more precious than fine Gold, and ſweeter than Honey!</p>
                  <p>O Brethren! let us avoid with all Care and Caution, the <hi>Abuſes</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> before mentioned; beware that ye depend not upon your Obedience to it for acceptance with God: And likewiſe take care that ye do not oppoſe Law and Goſpel to each other, or advance the one to the others prejudice, for in ſo doing ye wound the Chriſtian Religion, as well as your own Souls exceedingly! O there is a ſweet Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between them, which we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to admire and adore God for! And indeed the Thoughts and Knowledge of
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:005697_0245_1026C3CE8E615DB0"/>
this bleſſed <hi>Harmony</hi> and mutual Subſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency, tends to ſtrengthen our Belief in the Divinity of the Chriſtian Religion!</p>
                  <p>O ye unconverted Souls! uſe and apply the Law's Threatnings to alarm you out of your Iron Slumbers. Let the <hi>legal Lancet</hi> run into your ſecure Hearts and open your Wounds, that ye may be ſick of Sin and flee to Jeſus!</p>
                  <p>Surely it is Ignorance of God's Law that makes ſome deſpiſe it. If we may ſlight that, we may alſo the whole Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with it, which is for the moſt part but an Explication thereof. And if the Old Teſtament be deſtroy'd, what ſhall become of the New that is built on that Foundation? Let us therefore ſtudy the Law, and pray to God that he wou'd ſhew us the Breadth of it, and wonders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in it.</p>
                  <p>Let the People of God be entreated to obſerve it as the Rule of their Practice. Obey it, dear Brethren! from a Principle of Love to God, and with an Eye to his Glory: And lean on Jeſus by Faith, that

for his ſake your Imperfections may be pardon'd and your Acts of Obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and thus ye may expect that Peace will be upon you and the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Which may God grant for Chriſt's Sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Grace in the Creature, is but the Imitation of ſome divine Attribute in God to which it correſponds; and therefore the more we exerciſe it in Works of Piety and Charity, the more we manifeſt Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah's Excellencies, or as the Apoſtle phraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, <hi>ſhew forth his Virtues.</hi>

<pb n="274" facs="unknown:005697_0273_1026C43E68288868"/>
it is evident, that good Works are the moſt effectual Way of glorifying God, becauſe they offer the moſt convincing Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his adorable Excellencies to Men.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly our <hi>Duty</hi> as well as <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,</hi> to <hi>imitate</hi> the <hi>bleſſed Jeſus;</hi> and hence we are commanded, <hi>ſo to walk even as he walked.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>good Works</hi> promote our own <hi>Comfort</hi> exceedingly, and that not only as they are the Way, in which we can only expect, with Reaſon, the Fulfilment of God's gracious Promiſes towards us; but as they prevent much Guilt, which would be contracted by ſpiritual Sloth, and farther our Aſſurance of being in a gracious State!

Habits are known by their Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and we judge of a Fountain by its Streams. Now it is the Knowledge of our Covenant Intereſt in God, that is the Source of Sweetneſs; the Comfort of a Believer ebbs and flows with that; and therefore thoſe that deſire the Comfort of Grace, muſt be diligent in the Exerciſe of Grace. I might add, that the <hi>Approbation</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> in a <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>religious Labour,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the grateful <hi>Guſt,</hi> that attends the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> therein, is no ſmall Part of a Chriſtians Delight, and therefore no inconſiderable Incentive to <hi>good Works.</hi>

                  <p>Again, my Brethren, our Neighbours <hi>Edification</hi> is <hi>promoted</hi> by <hi>good Works;</hi> and

hence our Lord enjoyns us, <hi>to let our Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee our good Works, and glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. v. 16.</note> And we are likewiſe bid <hi>to ſhine as Lights in the World, that thoſe who ſeek to accuſe our good Converſation in Chriſt, may be aſham'd: i. e.</hi> Thro' their not finding juſt Matter of Accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.

                     <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. iii. 1.</note> By theſe Inſtances it appears, that good Works have a noble Tendency to excite Men to glorify God, to ſilence Gainſayers, and to bring Men to Converſion.</p>

                  <p>Jehovah never devis'd a Religion, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy any Power or Paſſion he himſelf had form'd, but only to direct them to proper Objects, and regulate their Degrees of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which being obſerv'd, they conſpire in harmony to promote God's Glory, and the Creature's Honour, Comfort and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in his Service.</p>

of the <hi>Price</hi> which was laid down to purchaſe it, the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but alſo in reſpect of the <hi>Evils</hi> we are thereby <hi>delivered from,</hi> and the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> we are <hi>inſtated in.</hi> There is a perfect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from all <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>penal Evil,</hi> from Sin and all the gloomy Train of Miſeries introduc'd by it, which affect our <hi>Names, Bodies, Eſtates</hi> and our <hi>Souls.</hi> In Heaven there is a perfect <hi>Reſt</hi> prepar'd from them all!

                  </p>
                  <p>And on the other Hand, how great are the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> that are there poſſeſs'd?

                  </p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Property</hi> of this <hi>Salvation</hi> is, that it is <hi>incomprehenſible; Eye hath not ſeen, neither has Ear heard, nor has it entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heart of Man to conceive, the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Glory that is reſerv'd for the People of God.—Beloved now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> The richeſt and ſtrongeſt Images we can form, faint before the Glories of Paradiſe!

                     <hi>Thirdly:</hi> Another Argument us'd by the Apoſtle in our Text, to excite to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is the <hi>Property</hi> that <hi>Believers</hi> have in <hi>Salvation;</hi> Work out <hi>your own</hi> Salvation. <hi>Property</hi> is certainly the <hi>Spring</hi> of <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Sollicitude</hi> about the Things of Time, and ſhou'd it not be much more ſo about the Things of Eternity, which infinitely excel them in Importance and Duration? <hi>If you are wiſe here, you are wiſe for your ſelves, but if fooliſh you alone muſt bear it.</hi> It is your own Salvation, Brethren, which you are entreated to ſecure. And will ye not be concern'd about it, and <hi>labour for that Meat which will never periſh?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some that neglect others Buſineſs, are careful about their own, becauſe of their <hi>Property.</hi> Well, here is an <hi>Eternal</hi> and moſt <hi>important Property,</hi> the <hi>one Thing needful,</hi> which exceeds in Value all the reſt; and which unleſs it be ſecur'd, all is loſt; <hi>For what ſhall a Man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his Soul, if he ſhou'd gain the whole World and looſe the ſame?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as it is highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there are different <hi>Degrees</hi> of

                     <hi>Glory,</hi> as well as of Miſery, and that thoſe who have made the greateſt Advances in Holineſs and Uſefulneſs are made Partakers of the former.

                     <hi>Fourth,</hi> and laſt Argument, which the Apoſtle uſeth in our Text, to excite the believing <hi>Philippians,</hi> and us thro' them, to work out the <hi>Work of your Salvation with fear and tremblings,</hi> is this, <hi>that it is God which worketh in us, both to will and to do of his own good Pleaſure.</hi> This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is adapted to work upon our <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> our <hi>Fear</hi> and our <hi>Hope,</hi> as appears thus:</p>
                  <p>It is a great Inſtance of divine <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and Condeſcenſion, that he freely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any deſert of yours, works in you by his holy Spirit a Diſpoſition and Capacity to do good; and therefore, <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> for ſo great a <hi>Benefit,</hi> ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain

you to comply with his bleſſed Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>It is a <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>ſovereign God</hi> who, works in you of his own <hi>good Pleaſure,</hi> who if ye do not comply with his Influences <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> and <hi>ſpeedily,</hi> will be provok'd to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them, and chaſtiſe your neglect; tho' he will not <hi>take his loving Kindneſs away, or ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail; yet he will chaſtiſe your Iniquities with Rods, and your Tranſgreſſions with Stripes.</hi> This Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may juſtly alarm your Fear.</p>
                  <p>It is a <hi>gracious God</hi> who works in you, both <hi>to will and to do:</hi> And this may Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port your <hi>Hope;</hi> tho' you are not equal to the Work requir'd, God is able and willing to help you, in caſe <hi>you ſtir up your ſelves to lay hold upon him,</hi> and labour to improve the Grace ye have receiv'd; and this he has given you a Proof of, in his working in you both to will and to do of his own good Pleaſure.</p>

Knowledge of God,</hi> by which all things from everlaſting to everlaſting, are open at once to his Eye, is enough to ſtrike your Souls with a ſolemn Awe of God. This Conſideration much affected the Pſalmiſt, (and well it might) <hi>Thou knoweſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>my down-ſitting and my up-riſing, thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeſt my Thought afar off, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Darkneſs is as the Light to God, and the Night ſhines as the Day.</hi> O Sirs! the Thoughts of God's <hi>all-ſeeing Eye</hi> being continually upon us, beholding us in our moſt ſecure Retreats, is enough to make us fear and tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                  <p>Add to this the inflexible <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which diſpoſes him to render to all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Works; this is impartial in its Executions, it will not ſpare becauſe of the Number or Quality of Tranſgreſſors, but render to them exactly according to the Degrees of their Guilt, and when the Time of Probation expires, it is inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;

this excites Jehovah's <hi>Power,</hi> and awakes his <hi>Wrath</hi> to Arms; this makes his <hi>Vengeance</hi> burn and ſparkle againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent and obſtinate Tranſgreſſors; this opens impending Clouds of <hi>Indignation,</hi> and makes them break into reſiſtleſs Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Woe, which drown Sinners in a ſuddain Death, and ſweep them off the burden'd Globe, into a ſwift, certain, and eternal Deſtruction!</p>
                  <p>And how affecting likewiſe, dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, is the <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Immenſity</hi> of the bleſſed GOD! which fills Heaven and Earth, and infinitely ſurpaſſes the Bounds of Matter! Tho' the Globe we tread upon be very extenſive, yet it is but a Point compar'd with the viſible Heavens, and that, it is probable, is much exceeded by the third Heaven; and yet we are inform'd, that <hi>the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain God.</hi> The Sinner therefore cannot eſcape his Cognizance or Juſtice; this Thought affected the Pſalmiſt, who ſpeaks in the following Manner reſpecting it; <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence? If I aſcend up

into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt Parts of the Sea; even there ſhall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand ſhall hold me.</hi> 
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm cxxxix. 8, 9.</note> If we aſcend <hi>Carmel</hi>'s Top, or dive the Ocean's Depths, God is there. <hi>He is wiſe in Heart and mighty in Strength, who has hardened himſelf againſt God and proſpered?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And does not the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> lay us under ſtrong and ingenuous Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to fear him? O is it not the vileſt <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to offend ſuch a faithful Friend, ſuch an indulgent Father, ſuch a bounteous Benefactor, and requite him evil for good? Will not therefore our fear of diſpleaſing him, riſe in Proportion to the Degree of our Love to him, and that in Proportion to the Degree of our Faith in his Promiſes, and View of his Excellencies?</p>
                  <p>Now Sirs, if we compare our <hi>Vileneſs</hi> with God's <hi>Purity,</hi> our <hi>Weakneſs</hi> with his <hi>Almightineſs,</hi> our <hi>Ignorance</hi> with his <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>

our <hi>Guilt</hi> with his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> our <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi> with his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> may not this View make us fear and tremble before him? Moreover, is it not congruous to the State of a dependent Creature, to fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before his great Lord and Sovereign, to whom he owes, and on whom depends his All?</p>
                  <p>Yea, my Brethren, as the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is the diſtinguiſhing <hi>Character</hi> of his People, and the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo the conſtant Senſe of it, is of peculiar Service to promote its Intereſt in the Souls of Men: by this they are more conform'd to God in Holineſs, and diſpos'd to perform Acts of Worſhip to him, with a Decency and Reverence becoming a Creature to his Lord and Sovereign; and by this many hurtful Exceſſes are prevented; without this, we are like a Veſſel that has large Sails but no Ballaſt, and is in the mean time beat upon with boiſterous Winds and angry Waves; without this, our <hi>Faith</hi> degenerates into <hi>Preſumption,</hi> our <hi>Love</hi> into an <hi>effeminate Fondneſs,</hi> our <hi>Hope</hi> into <hi>Impudence,</hi> our <hi>Joy</hi> into <hi>Froth</hi> and <hi>Lightneſs,</hi> our ſuppos'd

                  <p>And indeed without the Fear of God, we are apt to be catch'd unawares, and fall heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and headlong into every ſinful Snare that we are expos'd to. <hi>Abraham</hi> the Friend of God, excell'd in this ornamental Grace. After his extraordinary Viſion, he ſpeaks in the following Strain; <hi>How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is this Place?
