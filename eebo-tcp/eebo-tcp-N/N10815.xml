            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If they have been thought, nevertheleſs, to have diſcovered a little too much aſperity towards thoſe who differed from them in religious ſentiment, we may be diſpoſed to make an apology for them, if not to juſtify them, in that regard, when we conſider the exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating things they had ſuffered; and how eaſy it was for them to judge, that ſeverity was eſſential to their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in their <hi>peculiar</hi> circumſtances.

land (in the judgment of ſome, if one of their number may ſay it with decency) deſerving, at preſent, of an excellent character, will obtain the moſt correct underſtanding of <hi>the truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and arrive to all the higheſt miniſterial accompliſhments; that the <hi>plummet</hi> for adjuſting the line, between the power of rulers and privileges of the people, in matters civil and eccleſiaſtical, will be held with a ſteady, wiſe and unerring hand; and <hi>North-America</hi> riſe unto the nobleſt <hi>ſtructure</hi> the ſun has ever beheld; and which ſhall be a pattern and ſource of inſtruction and happineſs, to the reſt of mankind. I cannot prevail with myſelf to cenſure it, as vanity and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, to form ſuch an alotment. There is this at leaſt in reaſon to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance it, that when God has ſeen fit to appear for a people, for ſeveral ages, in a <hi>remarkable manner,</hi> there is a certain degree of probability, according to the known rules of <hi>analogy,</hi> that he will <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> thus remarkably to favor them. When we conſider <hi>Rome,</hi> as founded by a rude uncultivated collection of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but yet, without chriſtian princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013696_0031_0F91B5E64F6B24C0"/>
to form and animate the patriot, arriving to ſuch an eminent pitch of glory among the nations, we ſtand amazed; and ought to conſider our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as reproached: If God will grant that <hi>North-America,</hi> ſhall exceed <hi>Rome</hi> in it's higheſt perfection, as much as our anceſtry and our advantages exceed theirs, our higheſt expectations will be anſwered; and the moſt ſanguinary wiſhes of the warmeſt patriot will be completely gratified. Imagining ſuch happineſs to be in reſerve for future generations, we may be tempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that we were born ſo ſoon; but that need give us no uneaſineſs. Inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that chriſtian ſpirit, whereby the diſciples of Jeſus <hi>poſſeſs all things,</hi> we are traſported into futurity; we live with poſterity; we ſee all their religion, virtue, catholiciſm, love, peace, unity, beneficence, ſobriety, learning, liberty, wealth and greatneſs; and enjoy all their happineſs.</p>
            <p>AFTER all, we are not to imagine that God ſets before us any proſpect, which may not be blaſted by our irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and vices; any <hi>hope,</hi> but ſuch

as may be <hi>cut off,</hi> by a neglect to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the proper meaſures for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic welfare. I rejoice in all the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an piety and holineſs among us; am conſcious of no malevolent inclination to exaggerate the degeneracy of the times; but confeſs myſelf unable to point out a country, founded in oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy induſtry frugality and temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that has arrived to ſuch a degree of luxury, in ſo ſhort a time as ours. Our <hi>ſingularity,</hi> in this regard, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be accounted for, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by our <hi>intaminating</hi> connections; but ought to be viewed as a moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy threatning circumſtance. In this <hi>fluctuating</hi> earthly ſcene, ſtates, when by various means they have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to power and wealth, are by proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity thrown into luxury; and luxury operates ſlavery and political death! Such is the courſe of this world! No doubt, late and preſent diſpenſations of providence towards us, have been deſigned in part, to put us in mind of ſuch a truth, for our warning to repent and become temperate; while they were deſigned alſo, to quicken us to a
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013696_0033_0F91B5E7ABC64898"/>
laudable inquiry, into <hi>all</hi> the proper means for eſtabliſhing and perpetuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our freedom and happineſs. May the divine admonition be properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; and oppreſſion, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned our being planted, be made, in effect, to contribute to our ſafety and perfection. If no additional laws are enacted, for a check to vitious extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies, we hope the higher ranks of people will combine to lead in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reformation. And may God <hi>pour out his ſpirit</hi> upon his people, and <hi>his bleſſing on their offspring;</hi> that the inhabitants of the land may return, to be a godly virtuous temperate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; and have the <hi>singular</hi> honor among the nations, of <hi>knowing how to abound;</hi> and the glory and happineſs of purſuing <hi>that</hi> on which their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance depends, and in which their <hi>life conſiſteth.</hi> Is it impoſſible that there ſhould <hi>once</hi> be a people, wiſe enough to withſtand the temptations of afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
            <p>WE admire at the growth of our loved country: <hi>freedom</hi> is a thing, which, under God, has been princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally

inſtrumental of it's arriving to be what it is; and freedom muſt ſtill, in the hand of God, be one of it's main pillars; or it will fall, with as great a celerity, as ever it has riſen.</p>
            <p>IN a view to the <hi>edification,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent liberty and happineſs of our land, it muſt be thought of the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that the <hi>youth be educated,</hi> as in general, in the principles of <hi>our moſt holy faith;</hi> ſo, particularly, in that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of heavenly contempt of <hi>the pleaſures of ſin</hi> and <hi>wages of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and in that ſpirit of freedom, which chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity naturally inſpires. Liberty is the happineſs, and ſlavery the miſery, depopulation and deſtruction of any land. A <hi>ſpirit</hi> of liberty is neceſſary to the preſervation of the <hi>thing.</hi> And the character of the world, as to a ſpirit of liberty, and every thing elſe, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but perceive, is ever mainly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>education.</hi>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:013696_0035_0F91B5AF354C8FD0"/>NOR is it by any means of trivial conſequence, that a laudable care be taken to prevent the eſtabliſhment of an <hi>epiſcopal hierarchy</hi> among us. As <hi>epiſcopacy,</hi> in the modern ſenſe of the word, is diſagreable to the goſpel; ſo, it is to be conſidered, as an engine of civil, as well as eccleſiaſtical ſlavery. NO BISHOP! NO KING! was a <hi>max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> with a Britiſh Prince, whoſe ideas of <hi>royal power,</hi> and what <hi>we</hi> call <hi>tyranny,</hi> appear to have been the <hi>ſame;</hi> and who, perhaps, had no vaſt regard for <hi>Biſhop,</hi> church or religion, farther than he thought they might be ſubſervient to his <hi>arbitrary</hi> views. It might not be greatly amiſs if, NO BISHOP, NO TY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANT! Should be ever held <hi>a ſacred maxim with this people;</hi> and a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable vigilence be uſed that epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy may never take place in this country. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>When Biſhops are immediately and highly dependant on the Prince, and at the ſame time are Lords over the reſt of the clergy, the whole power and influence of the clergy is apt to be thrown into the prerogative ſcale; and this, when a Prince is diſpoſed for a ſtretch of power, may have a moſt unhappy aſpect on the liberties of a land.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, to prevent the appropriation and confinement of the landed intereſt, and poſts of honor, profit and influence, to a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular families in the country, demands the vigilence of the patriot. If ſuch things are not prevented, <hi>honor</hi> will be too apt to alight on thoſe for whom it is not <hi>ſeemly: power</hi> will be too apt to fall into the hands of thoſe, who want the underſtanding or the heart to make a good uſe of it: there will not be proper encouragement for the geniuſes, which the <hi>God of nature</hi> ſcatters promiſcuouſly among the people; hope of riſing will be cut off; laudable and uſeful emulation will be cramped: there will not be that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for liberty, which may be ſeen, where there are great numbers of freeholders in a country, who have real eſtates to preſerve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embarraſſed: bribery in elections (if any ſuch things as elections remain) will take place more eaſily and ſucceſsfully, than it would if the number of freeholders was very great: there will not be ſuch a ſpur to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, as where men have a proſpect of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining good farms, for themſelves and for their children: a great part of the people will be very poor, and therefore ignorant, irreligious and vicious; they will be untaught to read, or they will have but little leiſure for reading the <hi>word of God,</hi> or other uſeful writings; they will be callous and inſenſible; the friendly inſtructions and warnings of the patriot's pen, will not reach their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and hearts; they will be low lived, mean ſpirited and ſervile in their tempers, and they will be ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>We aſk leave to ſubjoin, that inſtead of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to keep the people in ignorance, and under hard bondage, under a pretence of it's being neceſſary for keeping them in order, and to prevent their ruining themſelves; rulers, of any kind, if they would act the truely human and chriſtian part, ſhould ſtrive to enlighten them as far as poſſible; and, leaving them in the enjoyment of their liberty, endeavor to correct their morals, and bring them to <hi>chooſe</hi> that reſpectfulneſs and ſubmiſſion to regular government, in which their intereſt will forever be involved.</p>
                  <p>The care that has been taken to ſupport more public or more private <hi>ſchools</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> is high praiſeworthy; and we hope there will, in time to come, be much larger room for commendation, in this reſpect.</p>

We know indeed that, in ſuch a world as this, the proviſion made by tender induſtrious frugal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is not ſeldom conſumed, by the riot prodigality and diſſipation of their poſterity: but, conſidering how <hi>near</hi> you live to <hi>our</hi> time, with every other circumſtance that merits attention in the caſe, if <hi>you</hi> are found ſo immerſed in worldly-mindedneſs and ſenſuality, ſo dead to a ſenſe of the importance of liberty, and ſo void of all religious and
