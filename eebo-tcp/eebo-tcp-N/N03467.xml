            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                        </gap> publiſhed on the earneſt Deſire of thoſe to whom they were preached. Theſe particular Diſcourſes are fixed upon, and deſigned for the Preſs, rather than others that were deliver'd in that remarkable Seaſon, by</hi> their <hi>Election. What has determin'd them in their Choice, is the Experience they hope they have had of ſpecial Benefit to their Souls from</hi> theſe Diſcourſes. <hi>Their Deſire to have 'em in their Hands from the Preſs has been long manifeſted, and often expreſſed to me; Their Earneſtneſs in it is evident from this, that tho' it be a Year of the greateſt publick Charge to them that over has been, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Expence of building a new Meeting Houſe, yet they choſe rather to be at this additional Expence now, tho' it be very conſiderable, than to have it delayed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Year. I am fully ſenſible that their Value for theſe Diſcourſes has ariſen more from the Frame in which they heard them, and the Good which they hope they, thro' the ſovereign Bleſſing of God, have received by them, than any real Worth in them: And whatever the Diſcourſes are in themſelves, yet thoſe that heard them are not to be blamed or wonder'd at, if that is dear to them, that they hope God has made a Means of ſaving and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Benefit to them. They have much inſiſted on this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with me, to induce me to comply with their Deſire,</hi> viz <hi>that they hoped that the reading theſe Diſcourſes would have a Tendency in ſome Meaſure to renew the ſame Effect in them that was wrought in the hearing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Memory of that great Work of God, which this
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004239_0003_10040484BAE58B90"/>
Town has ſo much Cauſe ever to remember; which Argument has been of principal Weight with me, to incline me to think it to be my Duty to comply with their Deſire; tho' I can't ſay there are no other Conſiderations concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to induce me to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With reſpect to the Diſcourſe on</hi> Juſtification, <hi>beſides the deſire of my People to make it publick, I have been adviſed to it by certain Rev. Gentlemen, my Fathers, that happen'd to be the Hearers of it; (or, at leaſt, Part of it,) when preached, whoſe Opinion and Advice, in ſuch an Affair, I thought ſhould be of as great Weight with me as of moſt that I was acquainted with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Beginning of the late Work of God in this Place was ſo circumſtanced, that I could not but look upon it as a remarkable Teſtimony of God's Approbation of the Doctrine of</hi> Juſtification by Faith alone, <hi>here aſſerted and vindicated:—By the noiſe that had a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been raiſed in this County, concerning that Doctrine, People here ſeem'd to have their Minds put into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Ruffle; ſome were brought to doubt of that Way of Acceptance with God, which from their Infancy they had been taught to be the only Way, and many were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged more thoroughly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ook into the Grounds of thoſe Doctrines they had been educated in:—The following Diſcourſe of Juſtification, that was preach'd, (tho' not ſo fully as it is here printed,) at two publick Lectures, ſeem'd to be remarkably bleſs'd, not only to eſtabliſh the Judgments of many in this Truth, but to engage their Hearts in a more earneſt purſuit of Juſtification, in that Way that had been explained and defended; And</hi> at that Time, <hi>while I was greatly reproached for defending this Doctrine in the Pulpit, and juſt upon my ſuffering a very open Abuſe for it, God's Work wonderfully brake forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and Souls began to flock to Chriſt, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in whoſe Righteouſneſs alone they hoped to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: So that this was the Doctrine on which this Work in its Beginning was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ounded, as it evidently was in the whole progreſs of it.</hi>

                     <hi>A great Objection that is made againſt the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctrine of</hi> Juſtification by Faith alone, <hi>and the
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004239_0004_10042B01E27B8F78"/>
Scheme of thoſe Divines that have chiefly defended it, by thoſe that value themſelves upon the new faſhion'd Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is, That the Scheme is too much incumber'd with ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Niceties, and ſubtil Diſtinctions, that, they ſay, ſerve only to involve the Subject in endleſs Controverſy and Diſpute; whereas, their Scheme, they ſuppoſe, is a plain, eaſy, and natural Account of Things. But their Prejudice againſt Diſtinctions in Divinity, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, is carried to a great Extreme. So great, and general, and loud a cry has been raiſed by modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Divines, againſt the ſubtil Diſtinctions of the Schoolmen, for their learned Impertinence, that many are ready to ſtart at any Thing that looks like nice Diſtinction, and to condemn it for Nonſenſe without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. Upon the ſame Account, we might expect to have St.</hi> Paul's <hi>Epiſtles, that are full of very nice Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, called Nonſenſe, and unintelligible Jargon, had not they the good Luck, to be univerſally received by all Chriſtians, as part of the holy Scriptures.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Our diſcovering the Abſurdity of the impertinent and abſtruſe Diſtinctions of the School Divines, may juſtly give us a Diſtaſte of</hi> ſuch Diſtinctions <hi>as have a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

So much of the Scripture Scheme of Juſtification as is abſolutely neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be very plain and level with the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the weakeſt Chriſtians; but it does not therefore follow that the Scripture teaches us no more about it, that it would be exceeding profitable for us to know, and by gaining the Knowledge of which, we may obtain a more full a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Faith, that tho' they contain ſomething that is eaſy, yet they alſo contain great Myſteries, and there is room for Progreſs in the Knowledge of them, and doubtleſs will be to the End of the World; but 'tis unreaſonable to expect that this Progreſs ſhould be made, in the Knowledge of Things that are high and myſterious, without accurate Diſtinction, and cloſe Application of Thought: And 'tis alſo unreaſonable to think that this Doctrine of the Juſtification of a Sinner by a Mediator, ſhould be without Myſteries. We all own it to be a Matter of pure Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, above the Light of natural Reaſon, and that 'tis what the infinite Wiſdom of God reveal'd in the Goſpel mainly appears in, That he hath found out ſuch a Way of Reconciliation, that neither Men nor Angels could have thought of. And after all, ſhall we expect that this Way when found out and declared, ſhall contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is obvious to the moſt curſory and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial View, and may be fully and clearly comprehended without ſome Diligence, Accuracy, &amp; careful Diſtinction?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It the Diſtinctions I have made uſe of in handling this Subject are found to be inconſiſtent, trivial, and unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Niceties, tending only to cloud the Subject, I ought to be willing that they ſhould be rejected; but if on due Examination they are found both ſcriptural &amp; rational, I humbly conceive that it will be unjuſt to condemn them, meerly becauſe they are Diſtinctions, under a Notion that Niceneſs in Divinity never helps it, but always perplexes and darkens it. 'Tis to God's own Revelation that I make my Appeal, by which alone we can know in what Way he will be pleaſed again to receive into Favour, thoſe that have offended him, and incur'd his Diſpleaſure. If there be any Part of the Scheme here laid down, or any Diſtinction here made uſe of, not warranted by Scripture, let it be rejected; and if any oppoſite Scheme can be found that is more eaſy and plain, having fewer and more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Diſtinctions, and not demonſtrably inconſiſtent with it ſelf, and with the Word of God, let it be received. Let the</hi> Arminian <hi>Scheme of Juſtification by our own Vertue, he as</hi> plain <hi>and natural as it will, if at the ſame Time 'tis</hi> plainly <hi>contrary to the certain &amp; demonſtrable Doctrine

of the Goſpel, as contained in the Scriptures, we are bound to reject it, unleſs we reject the Scriptures themſelves, as perplexed and abſurd, and make our ſelves wiſer than God, and pretend to know his Mind better than Himſelf.</hi>

                     <hi>This Diſcourſe on Juſtification is printed much larger than it was preached; but the practical Diſcourſes that follow have but little added to them, and now appear in that very plain and unpoliſhed Dreſs, in which they were firſt prepared and delivered; which was moſtly at a Time, when the Circumſtances of the Auditory they were preached to, were enough to make a Miniſter neglect, forget, and deſpiſe ſuch Ornaments as Politeneſs, &amp; Modiſhneſs of Style and Method, when coming as a Meſſenger from God to Souls, deeply impreſs'd with a Senſe of their Danger of God's everlaſting Wrath, to treat with them about their eternal Salvation.—However unable I am to preach or write po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely, if I would, yet I have this to comfort me under ſuch a Defect, that God has ſhewed us that he don't need ſuch Talents in Men to carry on his own Work, and that he has been pleaſed to ſmile upon and bleſs a very plain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhionable Way of Preaching.

That Juſtification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects a Man as ungodly: This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by thoſe Words—<hi>that juſtifieth the Ungodly.</hi> Which Words can't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply leſs than that God in the Act of Juſtification, has no Regard to any Thing in the Perſon juſtified, as Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any Goodneſs in him; but that nextly, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before this Act, God beholds him only as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly or wicked Creature; ſo that Godlineſs in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004239_0009_10042B10E0CA8800"/>
to be juſtified is not ſo antecedent to his Juſtification as to be the Ground of it. When it is ſaid that God juſtifies the Ungodly, 'tis as abſurd to ſuppoſe that our Godlineſs, taken as ſome Goodneſs in us, is the Ground of our Juſtification, as when it is ſaid that Chriſt gave Sight to the Blind, to ſuppoſe that Sight was <hi>Prior to,</hi> and the <hi>Ground of</hi> that Act of Mercy in Chriſt, or as if it ſhould be ſaid that ſuch an One by his Bounty has made a poor Man rich, to ſuppoſe that it was the Wealth of this poor Man that was the Ground of this Bounty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and was the Price by which it was procured.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It appears that <hi>by him that worketh not</hi> in this Verſe, is not meant only one that don't conform to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, becauſe <hi>he that worketh not,</hi> and <hi>the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> are evidently ſynonimous Expreſſions, or what ſignify the ſame; it appears by the Manner of their Connection; if it ben't ſo, to what Purpoſe is the latter Expreſſion <hi>the Ungodly</hi> brought in? The Context gives no other Occaſion for it, but only to ſhew that the Grace of the Goſpel appears in that God in Juſtification has no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any Godlineſs of ours: The foregoing Verſe is, <hi>Now to him that worketh is the Reward not reckon'd of Grace, but of Debt:</hi> In that Verſe 'tis evident, that Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Grace conſiſts in the Rewards being given <hi>without Works;</hi> &amp; in this Verſe which nextly follows it &amp; in Senſe is connected with it, 'tis evident that Goſpel Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a Man's being juſtified that is <hi>ungodly;</hi> by which it is moſt plain that by <hi>him that worketh not,</hi> and him that is <hi>ungodly,</hi> are meant the ſame Thing; and that therefore not only Works of the ceremonial Law are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this Buſineſs of Juſtification, but Works of Morality and <hi>Godlineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. 'Tis evident in the Words, that by that Faith that is here ſpoken of, by which we are juſtified, is not meant the ſame Thing as a Courſe of Obedience, or Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the Expreſſion, by which this Faith is here deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>viz believing on him that juſtifies the Ungodly</hi>—They that oppoſe the <hi>Solifidians,</hi> as they call them, do greatly inſiſt on it, that we ſhould take the Words of Scripture concerning this Doctrine, in their moſt natural
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004239_0010_10040456B2BD9408"/>
and obvious Meaning; and how do they cry out of our clouding this Doctrine with obſcure Metaphors, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible Figures of Speech! But is this to interpret Scripture according to it's moſt obvious Meaning, when the Scripture ſpeaks of our <hi>believing on him that juſtifies the Ungodly,</hi> or the <hi>Breakers of his Law,</hi> to ſay that the Meaning of it is performing a Courſe of <hi>Obedience to his Law,</hi> and <hi>avoiding the Breaches of it?</hi> Believing on God as a <hi>Juſtifier,</hi> certainly is a different Thing from ſubmitting to God as a <hi>Lawgiver;</hi> eſpecially a believing on him as a Juſtifier of <hi>the Ungodly,</hi> or Rebels <hi>againſt the Lawgiver.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. 'Tis evident that the Subject of Juſtification is look'd upon as deſtitute of any Righteouſneſs in himſelf, by that Expreſſion, <hi>it is counted, or imputed to him for Righteouſneſs;</hi> the Phraſe, as the Apoſtle uſes it here, and in the Context, manifeſtly imports, that God of his ſovereign Grace is pleaſed in his Dealings with the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to take and regard, that which indeed <hi>is not</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and in one that <hi>has no</hi> Righteouſneſs, ſo that the Conſequence ſhall be the ſame as if he <hi>had</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; (which may be from the Reſpect that it bears to ſome thing that is indeed Righteouſneſs.) 'Tis plain that this is the force of the Expreſſion in the preceeding Verſes: In the laſt Verſe but one, 'tis manifeſt that the Apoſtle lays the Streſs of his Argument for the free Grace of God, from that Text that he cites out of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about <hi>Abraham,</hi> on that Word <hi>counted</hi> or <hi>imputed,</hi> and that this is the Thing that he ſuppoſed God to ſhew his Grace in, <hi>viz</hi> in his <hi>counting</hi> ſomething for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, in his conſequential Dealings with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that was no Righteouſneſs in itſelf. And in the next Verſe which immediately preceeds the Text, <hi>Now to him that worketh is the Reward not</hi> reckoned <hi>of Grace, but of Debt;</hi> the Word there tranſlated <hi>reckoned,</hi> is the ſame that in the other Verſes is render'd <hi>imputed,</hi> and <hi>counted:</hi> And 'tis as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, <q>As to <hi>him that works,</hi> there is no need of any gracious <hi>Reckoning,</hi> or <hi>counting</hi> it for Righteouſneſs, and cauſing the Reward to follow <hi>as if it were</hi> a Righteouſneſs; for
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004239_0011_10042B1267460038"/>
if he has Works he has that which <hi>is</hi> a Righteouſneſs <hi>in itſelf,</hi> to which the Reward properly belongs.</q> This is further evident by the Words that follow, Ver. 6. <hi>Even as David alſo deſcribed the Bleſſedneſs of the Man unto whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works;</hi> what can here b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> meant by imputing Righteouſneſs without Works, but imputing Righteouſneſs to him that has none of his own? Ver. 7, 8. <hi>Saying bleſſed are they whoſe Iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered: Bleſſed is the Man to whom the Lord will not impute Sin.</hi> How are theſe Words of <hi>David</hi> to the Apoſtle's Purpoſe? Or how do they prove any ſuch Thing, as that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is imputed without Works, unleſs it be becauſe the Word <hi>imputed</hi> is uſed, and the Subject of the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is mentioned, as a Sinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; conſequently deſtitute of a moral Righteouſneſs? For <hi>David</hi> ſays no ſuch Thing, as that he is forgiven without the Works of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law; there is no Hint of the ceremonial Law, or Reference to it, in the Words. I will therefore venture to infer this <hi>Doctrine</hi> from the Words, for the Subject of my preſent Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>A Perſon is ſaid to be juſtified when he is approved of God as free from the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin, and it's deſerved <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> and as having that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> belonging to him that entitles to the <hi>Reward</hi> of Life. That we ſhould take the Word in ſuch a Senſe, and underſtand it as the Judges accepting a Perſon as having both a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and poſitive Righteouſneſs belonging to him, and looking on him therefore, as not only <hi>quit,</hi> or free from any Obligation to Puniſhment but alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> and ſo entitled to a poſitive Reward, is not only moſt agreable to the Etimology, and natural Import of the Word, which ſignifies to make righteous, or to paſs One for righteous in Judgment, but alſo manifeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the Force of the Word, as uſed in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Some ſuppoſe that nothing more is intended in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by <hi>Juſtification</hi> than barely the <hi>Remiſſion of Sins:</hi> if it be ſo it is very ſtrange, if we conſider the Nature of the Caſe; for 'tis moſt evident, and none will deny, that it is with Reſpect to the Rule, or Law of God that we are under, that we are ſaid in Scripture to be either juſtified or condemned: Now what is it to juſtify a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the Subject of a Law or Rule, but to judge him,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004239_0013_10042B1454DA7488"/>
or look upon him, and approve him as <hi>ſtanding right</hi> with Reſpect to that Rule? To juſtify a Perſon <hi>in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſe,</hi> is to approve of him as ſtanding right, as ſubject to the Law or Rule <hi>in that Caſe;</hi> and to juſtify <hi>in general,</hi> is to paſs him in Judgment, as ſtanding right, in a State correſpondent to the Law or Rule <hi>in general.</hi> But certainly in order to a Perſon's being looked on as ſtanding right with Reſpect to the Rule in general, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> or in a State correſponding with the Law of God, more is needful than what is negative, or a not having the Guilt of Sin; for whatever that Law is, whether a <hi>new</hi> one, or an <hi>old</hi> one, yet doubtleſs ſomething poſitive is needed in order to its being anſwered. We are no more juſtified by the Voice of the Law, or of him that judges according to it, by a meer Pardon of Sin, than <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was juſtified by the Law, at the firſt Point of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, before he had done the Work, or fulfilled the Obedience of the Law, or had had ſo much as any Trial whether he would fulfil it or no. If <hi>Adam</hi> had finiſhed his Courſe of perfect Obedience, he would have been <hi>juſtified;</hi> and certainly his Juſtification would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſomething more than what is meerly negative; he would have been approved of, as having fulfilled the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and accordingly would have been adjudged to the Reward of it: So Chriſt our <hi>ſecond Surety,</hi> (in whoſe Juſtification all who believe in him, and whoſe Surety he is, are vertually juſtified,) was not juſtified 'till he had done the Work the Father had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, and kept the Father's Commandments, thro' all Trials, and then in his Reſurrection he was <hi>juſtified:</hi> When he that had been put to Death in the Fleſh was <hi>quickened</hi> by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18 then he that was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the Fleſh was <hi>juſtified</hi> in the Spirit, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. But God when he juſtified him in raiſing him from the Dead, did not only releaſe him from his Humiliation for Sin, and acquit him from any further Suffering or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement for it, but admitted him to that eternal and immortal Life, and to the Beginning of that Exaltation, that was the Reward of what he had done. And indeed the Juſtification of a Believer is no other than his being
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004239_0014_10042B1856AD5BE0"/>
admitted to Communion <hi>in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> or Participation <hi>of</hi> the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of this Head and Surety of all Believers; for as Chriſt ſuffered the Puniſhment of Sin, not as a private Perſon, but as our Surety, ſo when after this Suffering he was raiſed from the Dead, he was therein juſtified, not as a private Perſon, but as the Surety and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of all that ſhould believe in him; ſo that he was raiſed again not only for <hi>his own,</hi> but alſo for <hi>our</hi> Juſtification, according to the Apoſtle Rom. 4 25. <hi>Who was delivered for our Offences, and raiſed again for</hi> our Juſtification. And therefore it is that the Apoſtle ſays as he does in Rom. 8. 34. <hi>Who is he that</hi> condemneth, <hi>it is Chriſt that died, yea</hi> rather <hi>that is riſen again.</hi>

                     <p>But that a Believer's Juſtification implies not only Remiſſion of Sins, or Acquittance from the Wrath due to it, but alſo an Admittance to a Title to that Glory that is the Reward of Righteouſneſs, is more directly taught in the Scripture, as particularly in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2. where the Apoſtle mentions both theſe, as joint Benefits implied in Juſtification, <hi>Therefore being</hi> juſtified <hi>by Faith, we</hi> have Peace with God <hi>through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom alſo we</hi> have Acceſs into this Grace wherein we ſtand, and rejoice in Hope of the Glory of God. So <hi>Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> and <hi>Inheritance among them that are ſanctified,</hi> are mentioned together as what are jointly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Faith in Chriſt, Acts 26. 18. <hi>That they may receive Forgiveneſs of Sins, and Inheritance among them that are ſanctified,</hi> through Faith <hi>that is in me.</hi> Both theſe are without Doubt implied in that paſſing from Death to Life, which Chriſt ſpeaks of as the Fruit of Faith, and which he oppoſes to Condemnation, John. 5. 24 <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, he that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting Life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation, but is paſſed from Death to Life.</hi> I proceed now</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly.</hi> To ſhew what is meant when it is ſaid that this Juſtification is by Faith only, and not by any Vertue or Goodneſs of our own.</p>
                     <p>This enquiry may be ſubdivided into two, <hi>viz</hi> 1. How 'tis <hi>by Faith.</hi> 2. How 'tis by Faith <hi>alone, without any Manner of Goodneſs of ours.</hi>

1. <hi>How Juſtification is by Faith.</hi> Here the great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty has been about the Import and Force of the Particle BY, or what is that <hi>Influence</hi> that Faith has in the Affair of Juſtification that is expreſſed in Scripture by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>juſtified BY Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here, if I may humbly expreſs what ſeems evident to me, tho' Faith be indeed the Condition of Juſtification <hi>ſo as nothing elſe is,</hi> yet this Matter is not clearly and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently explained by ſaying that Faith is the <hi>Condition</hi> of Juſtification; and that becauſe the Word ſeems am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, both in common Uſe, and alſo as uſed in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: in one Senſe Chriſt alone performs the Condition of our Juſtification and Salvation; in another Senſe, Faith is the Condition of Juſtification; in another Senſe, other Qualifications and Acts are Conditions of Salvation and Juſtification too: there ſeems to be a great deal of ambiguity in ſuch Expreſſions as are commonly uſed, (which yet we are forced to uſe,) ſuch as <hi>Condition of Salvation, what is required in order to Salvation or Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; the Terms of the Covenant,</hi> and the like; and I believe they are underſtood in very different Senſes by different Perſons. And beſides as the Word <hi>Condition</hi> is very often underſtood in the common uſe of Language, Faith is not the only Thing, in us, that is the Condition of Juſtification; for by the Word Condition, as 'tis very often, (and perhaps moſt commonly,) uſed; we mean a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that may have the Place of a Condition in a conditional Propoſition, and as ſuch is truly connected with the Conſequent, eſpecially if the Propoſition holds both in the Affirmative and Negative, as the Condition is either affirmed or denied; if it be that <hi>with which,</hi> or <hi>which being ſuppoſed,</hi> a thing ſhall be, and <hi>without which,</hi> or <hi>it being denied,</hi> a Thing ſhall not be, we in ſuch a Caſe call it a Condition of that Thing: But in this Senſe Faith is not the only Condition of Salvation or Juſtification, for there are many Things that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and flow from Faith, that are Things with which Juſtification ſhall be, and without which it will not be, and therefore are found to be put in Scripture in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Propoſitions with Juſtification and Salvation. in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004239_0016_1004045A2DE8B368"/>
Multitudes of Places; ſuch are <hi>Love to God, and Love to our Brethren, forgiving Men their Treſpaſſes,</hi> and many other good Qualifications and Acts. And there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Things beſides Faith, which are directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us, to be purſued or performed by us, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to eternal Life, as thoſe which if they are done, or obtain'd we ſhall have eternal Life, &amp; if not done or not obtain'd, we ſhall ſurely periſh. And <hi>if it were ſo,</hi> that Faith was the only Condition of Juſtification in this Senſe, yet I don't apprehend that to ſay that Faith was the Condition of Juſtification, would expreſs the Senſe of that Phraſe of Scripture of being <hi>Juſtified BY Faith:</hi> there is a Difference between <hi>being juſtified by a Thing,</hi> and that Thing <hi>univerſally, and neceſſarily, and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably attending,</hi> or <hi>going with Juſtification;</hi> for ſo do a great many Things that we ben't ſaid to be juſtified by: it is not the inſeparable <hi>connection</hi> with juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Holy Ghoſt would ſignify, (or that is naturally ſignified,) by ſuch a Phraſe, but ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>influence</hi> that Faith has in the Affair, or ſome certain Dependance that that Effect has on its Influence.</p>
                     <p>Some that have been aware of this have ſuppoſed that the influence or dependance might well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by Faith's being the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; which has been miſunderſtood, and injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented, and ridiculed by thoſe that have deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone, as tho' they had ſuppoſed that Faith was uſed as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Hand of God, whereby he performed, and brought to paſs that Act of his, <hi>viz.</hi> Approving and Juſtifying the Believer: Whereas it was not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Faith was the Inſtrument wherewith <hi>God juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies,</hi> but the Inſtrument wherewith <hi>we receive Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> not the Inſtrument where with the juſtifier acts in Juſtifying, but wherewith the receiver of Juſtification acts <hi>in accepting</hi> Juſtification. But yet it muſt be own'd that this is an obſcure way of Speaking, and there muſt certainly be ſome impropriety in calling of it an Inſtrument wherewith we receive or accept Juſtification; for the very Perſons that thus explain the Matter ſpeak
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004239_0017_10042B1B650831B0"/>
of Faith as being the <hi>Reception</hi> or <hi>Acceptance it ſelf;</hi> and if ſo how can it be the Inſtrument <hi>of</hi> Reception or Acceptance? Certainly there is difference between the Act and the Inſtrument. And beſides by their own Deſcriptions of Faith, Chriſt the Mediator, <hi>by whom,</hi> and his Righteouſneſs, <hi>by which</hi> we are juſtified, is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the Object of this Acceptance, and Juſtification which is the Benefit ariſing therefrom, more indirectly: and therefore if Faith be an Inſtrument, 'tis more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Inſtrument by which we receive Chriſt, than the Inſtrument by which we receive Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>But I humbly conceive we have been ready to look too far to find out what that Influence of Faith in our Juſtification is, or what is that Dependance of this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on Faith, ſignified by the Expreſſion of being <hi>juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Faith,</hi> over looking that which is moſt obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pointed forth in the Expreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that, the Caſe being as it is, (there being a Mediator that has purchaſed Juſtification,) Faith in this Mediator is that which renders i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There is this Benefit purchaſed, which God ſees it to be a more meet and ſuitable Thing that it ſhould be aſſigned to ſome than others, becauſe he ſees 'em differently qualified; that qualification wherein the meetneſs to this Benefit, as the Caſe ſtands conſiſts, is that, <hi>in us, by which we are Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified</hi> If Chriſt had not come into the World and died, &amp;c. to purchaſe Juſtification, no Qualification what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>in us,</hi> could render it a meet or fit Thing that we ſhould be juſtified; but the Caſe being as it now ſtands, <hi>viz</hi> that Chriſt has actually purchaſed Juſtification by his own Blood, for infinitely unworthy Creatures, there may be ſome certain Qualification found in ſome Perſons, that, either from the Relation it bears to the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and his Merits, or on ſome other Account, is the Thing that in the Sight of God renders it a <hi>meet &amp; condecent</hi> Thing that they ſhould have an intereſt in this purchaſed Benefit, and which if any are deſtitute of, it renders it an <hi>unfit &amp; unſuitable</hi> Thing that they ſhould have it. The

Wiſdom of God in his Conſtitutions, doubtleſs appears much in the Fitneſs and Beauty of them, ſo that thoſe Things are <hi>eſtabliſhed to be done</hi> that are <hi>fit to be done,</hi> and that theſe Things are connected in his Conſtitution, that are agreable one to another: ſo God juſtifies a Believer according to his revealed Conſtitution, without doubt, becauſe he ſees ſomething in this Qualification, that as the Caſe ſtands, renders it a <hi>fit</hi> Thing that ſuch ſhould be juſtified; whether it be becauſe Faith is the <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or as it were the Hand, by which he that has purchaſed Juſtification is apprehended and accepted, or becauſe it is the <hi>Acceptance it ſelf,</hi> or whatever. To be juſtified is to be <hi>approved</hi> of God as a <hi>proper Subject</hi> of Pardon, and a right to eternal life; and therefore when it is ſaid that we are Juſtified <hi>BY</hi> Faith, what elſe can be underſtood by it than that Faith is that <hi>BY</hi> which we are render'd <hi>approvable, fitly ſo,</hi> and indeed, as the Caſe ſtands, <hi>proper Subjects</hi> of this Benefit?</p>
                     <p>This is ſomething different from Faith's being the Condition of Juſtification, only ſo as to be inſeparably connected with Juſtification; ſo are many other Things beſides Faith, and yet nothing in us, but Faith, renders it <hi>meet</hi> that we ſhould have Juſtification aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to us; as I ſhall preſently ſhew <hi>how,</hi> in anſwer to the next Enq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Here for the greater Clearneſs, I would particularly explain my ſelf under ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is certain that there is ſome Union or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the People <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> ſtand in <hi>to him,</hi> that is expreſſed in Scripture, from time to time, by being <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and is repreſented frequently by thoſe Metaphors of being <hi>Members of Chriſt,</hi> or being united to him as <hi>Members to the Head,</hi> and Branches to the Stock,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>
                              <q>Our Saviour compares his myſtical Body, that is his Church, to a Vine, which his Father, whom he compares to a Husbandman, hath planted, <hi>I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman.</hi> To repreſent to us the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that is betwixt Chriſt and all true Chriſtians, and the Influence of Grace and ſpiritual Life, which all that are <hi>United</hi> to him do derive and receive from him, he ſets it forth to us by the Reſemblance of a Vine and Branches. As there is a <hi>natural vital Union</hi> between the Vine and the Branches, ſo there is a <hi>ſpiritual Union</hi> between Chriſt and true Chriſtians; and this Union is the Cauſe of our Fruitfulneſs, in the Works of Obedience and a good Life. There are ſome indeed that ſeem to be <hi>grafted into Chriſt</hi> by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, who yet derive no Influence from him, ſo as to bring forth Fruit, becauſe they are not <hi>vitally united to him.</hi>
                              </q> Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> in his 3d. Vol. of Serm. p. 307.</p>
                           <p>By this it appears that the vital Union between Chriſt and true Chriſtians, which is much more of a Myſtery than the relative Union, and neceſſarily implies it, was not thought an unreaſonable Doctrine, by one of the greateſt Divines, on the other ſide of the Queſtion in Hand.</p>
                        </note>
                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004239_0020_1004045248CE70B8"/>
and is compared to a Marriage Union between <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife.</hi> I don't now pretend to determine of what Sort this Union is; nor is it neceſſary to my preſent Purpoſe to enter into any Manner of Diſputes about it: if any are diſguſted at the Word Union, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and unintelligible, the Word <hi>Relation</hi> equally ſerves my Purpoſe; I don't now deſire to determine any more about it, than all, of all Sorts, will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow, <hi>viz</hi> that there is a peculiar <hi>Relation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true Chriſtians and Chriſt, or a certain Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between him and them, that there is not between him and others; which is ſignified by thoſe metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Expreſſions in Scripture, of being <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> being <hi>Members of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Relation or Union to Chriſt, whereby Chriſtians are ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, (whatever it be,) is the Ground of their Right to his Benefits. This needs no Proof; the Reaſon of the Thing, at firſt Bluſh, demonſtrates it: but yet 'tis exceeding evident alſo by Scripture, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life, and he that hath not the Son hath not Life.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 3. <hi>Of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us—Righteouſneſs.</hi> Firſt we muſt be in him, and then he will be made Righteouſneſs, or Juſtification to us. Eph. 1. 6. <hi>Who hath made us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004239_0021_10042B269A1FA328"/>
in the Beloved.</hi> Our being <hi>in him</hi> is the Ground of our being accepted. So it is in thoſe Unions which the Holy Ghoſt has thought fit to compare this Union to; the Union of the Members of the Body with the Head is the Ground of their partaking of the Life of the Head; 'tis the Union of the Branches to the Stock, which is the Ground of their partaking of the Sap &amp; Life of the Stock; 'tis the Relation of the Wife to the Husband, that is the Ground of her joynt Intereſt in his Eſtate, they are looked upon, in ſeveral Reſpects, as one in Law: ſo there is a legal Union between Chriſt and true Chriſtians; ſo that (as all except <hi>Socinians</hi> allow,) <hi>one,</hi> in ſome reſpects, is <hi>accepted for the other,</hi> by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And thus it is that Faith is that Qualification in any Perſon, that renders it meet in the Sight of God that he ſhould be looked upon as having Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Righteouſneſs belonging to him, <hi>viz. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that in him, which, on his Part, makes up this Union between him and Chriſt.</hi> By what has been juſt now obſerved, 'tis a Perſon's being, according to Scripture Phraſe, <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> that is the Ground of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Satisfaction and Merits belonging to him, and a Right to the Benefits procured thereby: and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it is plain; 'tis eaſy to ſee how a having Chriſt's Merits and Benefits <hi>belonging to us,</hi> follows from our having (if I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>Chriſt himſelf belonging to us,</hi> or a being united to him; and if ſo it muſt alſo be eaſy to ſee how, or in what Manner, that, in a Perſon, that on his Part makes up the Union between his Soul &amp; Chriſt, ſhould be the Thing on the Account of which God looks on it meet that he ſhould have Chriſt's Merits belonging to him; and alſo that it is a very different Thing, for God to aſſign to a particular Perſon, a Right to Chriſt's Merits and Benefits, from Regard to any Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification in him, in this Reſpect, from his doing of it for him, out of Reſpect to the Value or Lovelineſs of that Qualification, or as a Reward of the Excellency of it.</p>
                     <p>As there is no Body but what will allow that there is a peculiar Relation between Chriſt &amp; his true Diſciples,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004239_0022_10042B2CDC30FAE0"/>
by which they are in ſome ſenſe in scripture ſaid to be one; ſo I ſuppoſe there is no Body but what will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there may be ſomething that the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an does on his Part, whereby he is <hi>active in coming into this Relation</hi> or <hi>Union,</hi> ſome Act of the Soul of the Chriſtian, that is the Chriſtian's <hi>uniting Act,</hi> or that which is done towards this Union or Relation, (or whatever any pleaſe to call it,) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I don't now pretend to define juſtifying Faith, or to determine preciſely how much is contain'd in it, but only to determine thus much concerning it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is that by which the Soul, that before was ſeperate, and alienated from Chriſt, unites it ſelf to him, or ceaſes to be any longer in that State of Alienation, and comes into that ſore mention'd Union or Relation to him, or to uſe the Scripture Phraſe, that 'tis that by which the Soul COMES TO Chriſt, and RECEIVES him: and this is evident by the Scriptures uſing theſe very Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſignify Faith. John 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 35, 36, 37, 38, 39<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

they might be well underſtood of Old, among thoſe that then commonly uſed ſuch Metaphors, yet they are difficultly underſtood now. I allow that the Expreſſions of <hi>receiving</hi> Chriſt and <hi>coming</hi> to Chriſt, are metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Expreſſions; and if I ſhould allow 'em to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Metaphors; yet ſo much at leaſt, is certainly <hi>plain</hi> in 'em, <hi>viz.</hi> that Faith is that by which thoſe that before were <hi>ſeperated,</hi> and <hi>at a diſtance</hi> from Chriſt, (that is to ſay were not ſo related and united to him as his People are;) do ceaſe to be any longer at ſuch a Diſtance, and do <hi>come into that Relation</hi> and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; unleſs they are ſo unintelligible, that nothing at all can be underſtood by 'em.</p>
                     <p>God don't give thoſe that believe, an Union <hi>with,</hi> or an intereſt <hi>in</hi> the Saviour, in <hi>reward</hi> for Faith, but only becauſe Faith is the Soul's active uniting with Chriſt, or is it ſelf the very act of Unition, on their Part. God ſees it fit, that in order to an Union's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhed between two intelligent active Beings or Perſons, ſo as that they ſhould be looked upon as one, there ſhould be the mutual Act of both, that each ſhould receive other, as actively joining themſelves one to another. God in requiring this in order to an union with Chriſt as one of his People, treats Men as reaſonable Creatures, capable of Act, and Choice; and hence ſees it fit that they only, that are <hi>one</hi> with Chriſt <hi>by their own Act,</hi> ſhould be looked upon <hi>as one in Law:</hi> what is <hi>real</hi> in the Union betwen Chriſt and his People, is the Foundation of what is <hi>legal;</hi> that is, it is ſomething that is <hi>really</hi> in them, &amp; between them, uniting them, that is the Ground of the Suitableneſs of their being <hi>accounted</hi> as one by the Judge: And if there be any Act, or Qualification in Believers, that is of that uniting Nature, that it is meet on that Account that the Judge ſhould look upon 'em, and accept 'em as one, no wonder that upon the Account of the ſame Act or Qualification, he ſhould accept the Satisfaction and Merits of the one, for the other, as if it were their Satisfaction and Merits: It neceſſarily follows, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is implied.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:004239_0024_100404639FB67050"/>
And thus it is that Faith juſtifies, or gives an Intereſt in Chriſt's Satisfaction and Merits, and a Right to the Benefits procured thereby, <hi>viz.</hi> as it thus makes Chriſt and the Believer <hi>one</hi> in the Acceptance of the ſupreme Judge. 'Tis by Faith that we have a Title to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, becauſe, tis by Faith that we have the Son of God, by whom Life is. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in thoſe Words, 1 John 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the son hath Life,</hi> ſeems evidently to have reſpect to thoſe Words of Chriſt that he gives an Account of in his Goſpel, Chap. 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting Life, and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee Life.</hi> And in the ſame Places that the Scripture ſpeaks of Faith as the Soul's <hi>receiving,</hi> or <hi>coming to Chriſt,</hi> it alſo ſpeaks of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, or coming <hi>to,</hi> or joyning <hi>with</hi> Chriſt, as the Ground of an Intereſt in his Benefits: To as many as received him, <hi>to them gave he Power</hi> to become the Sons of God. Ye will not come unto me <hi>that ye might have Life,</hi> And there is a wide Difference between its being look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuitable that Chriſt's Satisfaction and Merits ſhould be theirs that believe, becauſe an Intereſt in that Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Merit is but a fit Reward of Faith, or a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Teſtimony of God's Reſpect to the Amiableneſs and Excellency of that Grace, and it's only being look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuitable that Chriſt's Satisfaction and Merits ſhould be theirs, becauſe Chriſt and they are ſo united, that in the Eyes of the Judge they may ſuitably be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and taken, as one.</p>
                     <p>Altho', on the Account of Faith in the Believer, it is, in the Sight of God, fit and congruous, both that he that believes ſhould be looked upon as in Chriſt, and alſo as having an Intereſt in his Merits, in the way that has been now explain'd, yet it appears that this is very wide from a <hi>merit of Congruity,</hi> or indeed <hi>any moral Congruity at all</hi> to either. There is a twofold Fitneſs to a State; I know not how to give them diſtinguiſhing Names o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by calling the one a <hi>moral,</hi> and the other a <hi>natural</hi> Fitneſs: A Perſon has a <hi>moral</hi> Fitneſs for a State, when his moral Excellency commends him to it, or when his being put into ſuch a good State, is but a <hi>fit</hi> or ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004239_0025_10042B316E735B80"/>
Teſtimony of Regard or Love to the <hi>moral Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,</hi> or Value, or Amiableneſs of any of his Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Acts. A Perſon has a <hi>natural</hi> Fitneſs for a State when it appears meet and condecent that he ſhould be in ſuch a State or Circumſtances, only from the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord or agreableneſs there is between ſuch Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſuch Circumſtances; not becauſe the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are lovely or unlovely, but only becauſe the Qualifications, and the Circumſtances are like one another, or do in their nature ſuit and agree or unite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And 'tis on this latter Account only that God looks on it fit by a <hi>natural Fitneſs,</hi> that he whoſe Heart ſincerely <hi>unites</hi> it ſelf to Chriſt as his Saviour, ſhould be looked upon as <hi>united</hi> to that Saviour, and ſo having an Intereſt in him; and not from any moral Fitneſs there is between the excellency of ſuch a Qualification as Faith, and ſuch a glorious Bleſſedneſs as the having an Intereſt in Chriſt. God's beſtowing Chriſt and his Benefits on a Soul in conſequence of Faith, out of Regard only to the natural Concord there is between ſuch a Qualification of a Soul, and ſuch an union with Chriſt, and Intereſt in him, makes the Caſe very widely different from what would be; if he beſtowed this from regard to any moral Suitableneſs; for in the <hi>former</hi> Caſe, 'tis only from God's Love of <hi>order</hi> that he beſtows theſe Things on the account of Faith. In the <hi>latter</hi> God doth it out of Love to the <hi>Grace of Faith it ſelf.</hi> God will neither look on Chriſt's Merits as ours, nor adjudge his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to us, till we be <hi>in Chriſt:</hi> nor will he look upon us as being <hi>in him,</hi> without an active unition of our Hearts and Souls to him; becauſe he is a wiſe Being, and delights in Order, and not in Confuſion, and that Things ſhould be together or aſunder according to their nature; and his making ſuch a Conſtitution is a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his love of Order: whereas if it were out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any moral Fitneſs or ſuitableneſs between Faith and ſuch Bleſſedneſs, it would be a Teſtimony of his Love to the Act or Qualification it ſelf: The one ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes this divine Conſtitution to be a Manifeſtation of God's regard to the Beauty of the act of Faith, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004239_0026_10042B32F5F771E8"/>
only ſuppoſes it to be a Manifeſtation of his regard to the Beauty of that Order that there is in uniting thoſe Things that have a natural Agreement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, and unition the one with the other. Indeed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Suitableneſs or Fitneſs to a State includes a natural; for 'tis never ſo that if there be a moral Suitableneſs that a Perſon ſhould be in ſuch a State, but that there is alſo a natural Suitableneſs; but ſuch a natural Suitableneſs as I have deſcribed, by no means neceſſarily includes a moral.</p>
                     <p>This is plainly what our Divines intend when they ſay that Faith don't juſtify as a <hi>Work,</hi> or a <hi>Righteouſneſs, viz.</hi> That it don't juſtify as a Part of our moral Goodneſs or Excellency, or that it don't juſtify as a Work, in the Senſe that Man was to have been juſtified by his Works by the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> which was to have a Title to eternal Life, given him of God in Teſtimony of his pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs with his Works, or his regard to the inherent Excellency and Beauty of his Obedience. And this is certainly what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> means, when he ſo much inſiſts upon it that we are not juſtified by <hi>works, viz. </hi> that we are not juſtified by them as <hi>good Works,</hi> or by any <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, value,</hi> or <hi>excellency of our Works.</hi> For the proof of this I ſhall at preſent mention but one Thing, (being like to have occaſion to ſay what ſhall make it more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly manifeſt afterwards,) and that is, the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, from Time to Time, ſpeaking of our not being juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by <hi>Works,</hi> as the Thing that excludes all <hi>boaſting, Eph.</hi> 2 9. <hi>Rom</hi> 3. 27. and Chap. 4. 2. now which way do Works give occaſion for boaſting, but as <hi>good?</hi> What do Men uſe to boaſt of, but of ſomething they ſuppoſe <hi>good</hi> or <hi>excellent?</hi> And on what Account do they boaſt of any Thing, but for the ſuppoſed <hi>Excellency</hi> that is in it?</p>
                     <p>From theſe Things we may learn in what manner Faith is the only Condition of Juſtification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for tho' it be not the only Condition, ſo as alone tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have the Place of a Condition in an hypothetical Propoſition, in which Juſtification and Salvation are the <hi>Conſequent,</hi> yet it is the Condition of Juſtification in a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004239_0027_10042B3489782DD8"/>
Manner peculiar to it, and ſo that nothing elſe has a parallel Influence with it; becauſe Faith includes the whole Act of Unition to Chriſt as a Saviour: The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire active uniting of the Soul, or the whole of what is called <hi>coming to</hi> Chriſt, and <hi>receiving</hi> of him, is called Faith in Scripture; and however other Things may be no leſs excellent than Faith, yet 'tis not the nature of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces or Vertues directly to cloſe with Chriſt as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, any further than they enter into the Conſtitution of juſtifying Faith, and do belong to its Nature.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have explained my meaning, in aſſerting it as a Doctrine of the Goſpel, that we are juſtified by Faith only, without any manner of Goodneſs of our own.</p>
                     <p>I now proceed in the</p>
                     <p>II. Place, <hi>to the Proof of it,</hi> which I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to produce in the following Arguments,</p>
                     <p>Firſt Such is <hi>our Caſe,</hi> and the <hi>State of Things,</hi> that neither Faith, nor any other Qualification, or Act, or Courſe of Acts <hi>does,</hi> or can render it <hi>ſuitable</hi> or <hi>fit</hi> that Perſon ſhould have an Intereſt in the Saviour, and ſo a Title to his Benefits, on Account of any excellency therein, or any other way than only as ſomething in him may unite him to the Saviour. It is not <hi>ſuitable</hi> that God ſhould give fallen Man an Intereſt in Chriſt and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as a Teſtimony of his reſpect to any Thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever as a lovelineſs in him; and that becauſe 'tis not meet till a Sinner is actually juſtified, that any Thing in him ſhould be accepted of God, as any excellency or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miableneſs of his Perſon; or that God by any Act, ſhould in any manner or degree teſtify any pleaſedneſs with him, or favour towards him, on the account of any Thing inherent in him; and that for two Reaſons, 1. Becauſe the nature of Things will not admit of it. 2. Becauſe an antecedent divine Conſtitution ſtands in the way of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Nature of Things will not admit of it. And this appears from the infinite Guilt that the Sinner 'till juſtified is under; which ariſes from the infinite evil or heinouſneſs of Sin. But becauſe this is what ſome deny, I would therefore <hi>firſt</hi> eſtabliſh that Point, and ſhew that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004239_0028_10042B3D15D7DF88"/>
Sin is a Thing that is indeed properly of infinite Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs; and <hi>then</hi> ſhew the Conſequence, and ſhew that it being ſo, and ſo the Sinner under infinite Guilt in God's Sight, it cannot be ſuitable, 'till the Sinner is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually juſtified, that God ſhould by any Act teſtify any pleaſedneſs <hi>with,</hi> or acceptance <hi>of,</hi> any Thing as any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency or amiableneſs of his Perſon, or indeed <hi>have</hi> any acceptance <hi>of</hi> him, or pleaſedneſs <hi>with</hi> him <hi>to teſtify.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the evil and demerit of Sin is infinitely great, is moſt demonſtrably evident, becauſe what the evil or iniquity of Sin conſiſts in, is the violating of an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the doing contrary to what we are obliged to do, or doing what we ſhould not do; and therefore by how much the greater the Obligation is that is violated, by ſo much the greater is the Iniquity of the violation. But certainly our Obligation to love or honour any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is great in proportion to the greatneſs or excellency of that Being, or his worthineſs to be loved and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: we are under greater Obligations to love a more lovely Being than a leſs lovely; and if a Being be <hi>infinitely excellent</hi> and lovely, our Obligations to love him are therein <hi>infinitely great:</hi> The matter is ſo plain it ſeems needleſs to ſay much about it.</p>
                     <p>Some have argued exceeding ſtrangely againſt the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite evil of Sin, from its being committed againſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Object, that if ſo, then it may as well be argued that there is alſo an infinite value or worthineſs in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love to God, becauſe that alſo has an infinite Object; Whereas the Argument from parity of Reaſon will carry it in the <hi>reverſe:</hi> the Sin of the Creature <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God is ill deſerving</hi> in proportion to the diſtance there is between<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> God and the Creature, the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Object,</hi> and the <hi>meanneſs of the Subject</hi> aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates it; but 'tis the reverſe with regard to the <hi>worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the reſpect of the Creature to God. <hi>'tis worthleſs</hi> (and not <hi>worthy</hi>) in proportion to the <hi>meanneſs of the Subject:</hi> ſo much the greater the Diſtance between God and the Creature, ſo much the leſs is the Creature's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect worthy of God's notice or regard. The <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs</hi> of Sin or oppoſition to God riſes, and is great in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004239_0029_10042B3E9D83F820"/>
proportion to the <hi>dignity</hi> of the <hi>Object,</hi> &amp; <hi>inferiority</hi> of the <hi>Subject;</hi> but on the contrary the <hi>worth</hi> or <hi>value</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect riſes in proportion to the <hi>value</hi> of the <hi>Subject;</hi> and that for this plain Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>evil</hi> of <hi>diſreſpect</hi> is in proportion to the Obligation that lies upon the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to the <hi>Object;</hi> which Obligation is moſt evidently encreaſed by the excellency and ſuperiority of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> but on the contrary the <hi>worthineſs</hi> of <hi>reſpect</hi> to a Being is in proportion to the Obligation that lies on him who is the <hi>Object,</hi> (or rather the Reaſon he has) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Subject,</hi> which certainly is in proportion to the Subject's value or excellency. Sin or <hi>diſreſpect</hi> is evil or heinous in proportion to the Degree of what it denies in the <hi>Object,</hi> and as it were <hi>takes from it, viz.</hi> its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and <hi>worthineſs of reſpect;</hi> On the contrary, reſpect is valuable in proportion to the value of what is <hi>given to the Object</hi> in that reſpect, which undoubtedly, (other Things being equal,) is great in proportion to the Subject's value, or worthineſs of regard; becauſe the Subject in giving his Reſpect, can give no more than himſelf; ſo far as he gives his reſpect he gives himſelf to the Object; and therefore <hi>his gift</hi> is of greater or leſſer value in proportion to the value <hi>of himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence (by the way,) the Love, Honour, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt towards God, has infinite Value, from the excellency and dignity of the Perſon in whom theſe Qualifications were inherent: and the Reaſon why we needed a Perſon of infinite Dignity to obey for us, was becauſe of our infinite comparative Meanneſs, who had diſobeyed, whereby our Diſobedience was infinitely ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated: We needed one, the worthineſs of whoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, might be anſwerable to the unworthineſs of our Diſobedience; and therefore needed one who was as great and worthy, as we were unworthy.</p>
                     <p>Another Objection (that perhaps may be thought hardly worth mentioning.) is, that to ſuppoſe Sin to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely heinous is to make all Sins equally heinous; for how can any Sin be more than infinitely heinous? But all that can be argued hence is, that no Sin can be greater with reſpect <hi>to that aggravation</hi> the worthineſs of the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004239_0030_10042B406F8690A0"/>
Object againſt whom it is committed: one Sin can't be more aggravated than another <hi>in that reſpect,</hi> becauſe in this reſpect the aggravation of every Sin is infinite; but that don't hinder but that ſome Sins may be more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous than others <hi>in other reſpects:</hi> as if we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>Cylinder</hi> infinitely long, it can't be greater in that reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> with reſpect to the length of it; but yet it may be doubled, and trebled, and made a thouſand fold more, by the increaſe of other Dimenſions. Of Sins that are all infinitely heinous, ſome may be more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous than others, as well as of divers Puniſhments that are all infinitely dreadful Calamities, or all of them infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeding all finite Calamities, ſo that there is no finite Calamity however great but what is infinitely leſs dreadful, or more eligable than any of them, yet ſome of them may be a thouſand Times more dreadful than others. A Puniſhment may be infinitely dreadful by reaſon of the infinite Duration of it; and therefore can't be greater with reſpect to that Aggravation of it, <hi>viz.</hi> its length of continuance; but yet may be vaſtly more terrible on other Accounts.</p>
                     <p>Having thus, as I imagine, made it clear that all Sin is infinitely heinous, and conſequently that the Sinner, before he is juſtified, is under infinite Guilt in God's Sight, it now remains that I ſhew the <hi>Conſequence,</hi> or how it follows from hence, that it is not ſuitable that God ſhould give the Sinner an Intereſt in Chriſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſo a title to his Benefits, from regard to any Qualification, or Act, or courſe of Acts, in him, on the Account of any Excellency or Goodneſs whatſoever therein, but only as uniting to Chriſt; or (which fully implies it) that it is not ſuitable that God by any Act, ſhould in any Manner or Degree, teſtify any acceptance <hi>of,</hi> or pleaſedneſs <hi>with</hi> any Thing, as any Vertue, or Excellency, or any part of lovelineſs, or valuableneſs, in his Perſon, until he is actually <hi>already</hi> intereſted in Chriſt's Merits; which appears by this, that from the <hi>Premiſſes</hi> it follows, that before the Sinner is already intereſted in Chriſt, &amp; juſtified, 'tis impoſſible God ſhould <hi>have</hi> any acceptance of, or pleaſedneſs with the Perſon
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004239_0031_10042B4284DE0860"/>
of the Sinner, as in any Degree lovely in his Sight, or indeed leſs the Object of his Diſpleaſure and Wrath: For, by the Suppoſition, the Sinner ſtill remains infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely guilty in the Sight of God; for Guilt is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved but by Pardon; but to ſuppoſe the Sinner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready pardoned, is to ſuppoſe him already juſtified; which is contrary to the Suppoſition: But if the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtill remains infinitely guilty in God's Sight, that is the ſame Thing as ſtill to be beheld of God as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely the Object of his Diſpleaſure and Wrath, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely hateful in his Eyes; and if ſo, where is any room for any Thing in him, to be accepted as ſome valuableneſs or acceptableneſs of him in God's Sight, or for any Act of Favour, of any Kind towards him, or any Gift whatſoever to him, in Teſtimony of God's Reſpect <hi>to</hi> and Acceptance <hi>of</hi> ſomething of him lovely and pleaſing? If we ſhould ſuppoſe that it could be ſo, that a Sinner could have Faith, or ſome other Grace in his Heart, and yet remain ſeparate from Chriſt; and it ſhould continue ſtill to be ſo, that he is not looked upon as being in Chriſt, or having any relation to him, it would not be meet that that true Grace ſhould be accepted of God as any lovelineſs of his Perſon in the Sight of God: If it ſhould be accepted as the lovelineſs of the Perſon, that would be to accept the Perſon as in ſome Degree lovely to God, but this can't be conſiſtent with his ſtill remaining under infinite Guilt, or infinite Unworthineſs in God's Sight, which that Goodneſs has no worthineſs to ballance. While God beholds the Man as ſeparate from Chriſt, he muſt behold him <hi>as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004239_0032_10042B46DADA4480"/>
the Man muſt be looked upon in God's Sight according to the remainder: For here by the Suppoſition all Acts of Grace of Favour, in not imputing the Guilt <hi>as it is,</hi> are excluded, becauſe that ſuppoſes a Degree of Pardon, and that ſuppoſes Juſtification, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is ſuppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sinner is not already juſtified: and therefore Things muſt be taken ſtrictly <hi>as they are;</hi> and ſo the Man is ſtill infinitely unworthy, and hateful in God's Sight, as he was before, without diminution, becauſe his Goodneſs bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his Unworthineſs; and therefore when taken together is nothing.</p>
                     <p>Hence may be more clearly ſeen, the Force of that Expreſſion in the Text, of believing on him that <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ungodly;</hi> for tho' there is indeed ſomething in Man that is really and ſpiritually Good, that is <hi>prior</hi> to Juſtification, yet there is nothing that is <hi>accepted</hi> as any godlineſs or excellency <hi>of the Perſon,</hi> till after Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Goodneſs or Lovelineſs of the Perſon <hi>in the Acceptance of God,</hi> in any Degree, is not to be conſider'd as <hi>prior</hi> but <hi>poſterior</hi> in the Order and Method of <hi>God's proceeding</hi> in this Affair: Tho' a Reſpect to the <hi>natural Suitableneſs</hi> between ſuch a Qualification, and ſuch a State, does go before Juſtification, yet the Acceptance even of Faith as any Goodneſs or Lovelineſs of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, follows Juſtification: The Goodneſs is on the forementioned Account juſtly looked upon as nothing, until the Man is juſtified: And therefore the Man is reſpected in Juſtification, as in himſelf altogether hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.—Thus the Nature of Things will not admit of a Man's having an Intereſt given him in the Merits or Benefits of a Saviour, on the Account of any Thing as a Righteouſneſs, or Vertue, or Excellency in him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 A divine Conſtitution that is antecedent to that which eſtabliſhes Juſtification by a Saviour, (and indeed to any need of a Saviour,) ſtands in the Way of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that original Conſtitution or Law which Man was put under; by which Conſtitution or Law the Sinner is condemned, becauſe he is a violater of that Law; and ſtands condemned, till he has actually an Intereſt in

                     <p>I know that the Anſwer that will be ready for this is, that we now are not ſubject to that Conſtitution that Mankind were at firſt put under; but that God in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Mankind has aboliſhed that rigorous Conſtitution or Law that they were under originally, &amp; has put us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a new Law, and introduced a more mild Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And that the Conſtitution or Law it ſelf not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, there is no need of ſuppoſing that the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it remains, to ſtand in the Way of the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our Vertue.

intereſted in the Saviour, that has ſatisfied and anſwered the Law, effectually to prevent any Acceptance of his Vertue, before, or in order to ſuch an Intereſt, unleſs the Law or Conſtitution it ſelf be aboliſhed. But the Scheme of thoſe modern Divines by whom this is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſeems to contain a great deal of Abſurdity and Self-Contradiction: they hold that the old Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> which requires perfect Obedience is entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, and that inſtead of it we are put under a new Law, which requires no more than imperfect, ſincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, in compliance with our poor, infirm, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Circumſtances ſince the Fall, whereby we are unable to perform that perfect Obedience that was required by the firſt Law: for they ſtrenuouſly maintain that it would be unjuſt in God to require any Thing of us that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our <hi>preſent</hi> Power and Ability to perform; and yet they hold that Chriſt died to ſatisfy for the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Obedience, that ſo our imperfect Obedience might be accepted inſtead of perfect—Now how can theſe Things hang together.—I would ask what Law theſe imperfections of our Obedience are a breach of? if they are a breach of no Law, then they ben't Sins; and if they ben't Sins, what need of Chriſt's dying to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy for them? but if they are Sins, and ſo the breach of ſome Law, what Law is it? they can't be a breach of their new Law, for that requires no other than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Obedience, or Obedience with imperfections; and they can't be a breach of the old Law, for that they ſay is entirely aboliſhed, and we never were under it; and we can't break a Law that we never were under.—They ſay it would not be juſt in God to exact of us perfect Obedience, becauſe it would not be juſt in God to require more of us than we can perform in our preſent State, &amp; to puniſh us for ſailing of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by their own Scheme the imperfections of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience don't deſerve to be puniſhed; What need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Chriſt's dying to ſatisfy for them?

                     <p>Thus far I have argued principally from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>the Nature of Things:</hi> I proceed now to the</p>
                     <p>Second <hi>Argument,</hi> which is, That this is a Doctrine that the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> the Revelation that God has given us of his Mind and Will, by which alone we can never come to know how thoſe that have offended God can come to be accepted of him, and juſtified in his Sight, is exceeding full in: Particularly the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is abundant in teaching that <hi>we are juſtified by Faith alone without the Works of the Law:</hi> There is no one Doctrine that he inſiſts ſo much upon, and is ſo particular in, and that he handles with ſo much diſtinctneſs, explaining, and giving Reaſons, and anſwering Objections.</p>
                     <p>Here it is not denied by any, that the Apoſtle does aſſert that we are juſtified by Faith, without the Works of the Law, becauſe the Words are expreſs; but only it is ſaid that we take his Words wrong, and underſtand that by 'em that never entered into his Heart, in that when he excludes the Works of the Law, we underſtand him of the whole Law of God, or the Rule which he has given to Mankind to walk by; whereas all that he intends is the <hi>ceremonial</hi> Law.</p>
                     <p>Some that oppoſe this Doctrine indeed ſay, that the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004239_0036_10042B53138CA380"/>
Apoſtle ſometimes means that it is by Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> an hearty embracing the Goſpel in its firſt Act, <hi>only,</hi> or <hi>without any preceeding holy Life,</hi> that Perſons are admitted into a juſtified State; but, ſay they, 'tis by a perſevering Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that they are continued in a juſtified State, and it is by this that they are finally juſtified. But this is the ſame Thing as to ſay that a Man on his firſt embracing the Goſpel is <hi>conditionally</hi> juſtified and pardon'd.—To pardon Sin, is to free the Sinner from the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, or from that eternal Miſery that is due to it; And therefore if a Perſon is pardon'd, or freed from this Miſery, on his firſt embracing the Goſpel, and yet not finally freed, but his actual freedom ſtill depends on ſome Condition yet to be performed, 'tis inconceivable how he can be pardon'd otherwiſe than conditionally: <hi>that is</hi> he is not properly <hi>actually pardon'd,</hi> and freed from Puniſhment, but only he has God's Promiſe that he ſhall be pardon'd <hi>on future Conditions;</hi> God promiſes him that now, if he perſeveres in Obedience, he ſhall be finally pardon'd, or actually freed from Hell; which is to make juſt nothing at all of the Apoſtle's great Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone: ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Pardon is no Pardon or Juſtification at all, any more than all Mankind have, whether they embrace the Goſpel or no; for they all have a promiſe of final Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication on Conditions of future ſincere Obedience, as much as he that embraces the Goſpel.—But not to diſpute about this, we will ſuppoſe that there may be ſomething or other at the Sinner's <hi>firſt embracing the Goſpel,</hi> that may properly be called Juſtification or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and yet that final Juſtification, or real freedom from the Puniſhment of Sin, is ſtill ſuſpended on Conditions hitherto unfulfill'd; yet they that hold that Sinners are thus juſtified on embracing the Goſpel, they ſuppoſe that they are juſtified by this, no otherwiſe than as this is a <hi>leading act of Obedience,</hi> or at leaſt as Vertue and moral Goodneſs in them, and therefore would be excluded by the Apoſtle as much as any other Vertue or Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; if it be allowed that he means the moral Law, when he excludes <hi>Works of the Law.</hi> And therefore if
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004239_0037_10042B562CD3E808"/>
that Point be yielded that the Apoſtle means the <hi>moral,</hi> and not only the <hi>ceremonial</hi> Law, their whole Scheme falls to the Ground.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the iſſue of the whole Argument from thoſe Texts in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles depends on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of this Point, I would be particular in the diſcuſſion of it.</p>
                     <p>Some of our Opponents in this Doctrine of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they deny that by the Law, the Apoſtle means the moral Law, or the whole Rule of Life which God has given to Mankind, ſeem to chooſe to expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thus, that the Apoſtle only intends the <hi>Moſaic Diſpenſation:</hi> But this comes to juſt the ſame Thing as if they ſaid that the Apoſtle only means to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>lude the Works of the Ceremonial Law; for when they ſay that 'tis intended only that we ben't juſtified by the Works of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation, if they mean any Thing by it, it muſt be that we ben't juſtified by attending, and obſerving what is <hi>Moſaic in that Diſpenſation,</hi> or by what was peculiar to it, and wherein it differed from the <hi>Chriſtian Diſpenſation;</hi> which is the ſame as that which is ceremonial and poſitive, and not moral, <hi>in that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</hi>—. So that this is what I have to diſprove, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apoſtle when he ſpeaks of Works of the Law in this Affair, means only Works of the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law, or thoſe Obſervances that were peculiar to the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>And here it muſt be noted, that no Body controverts it with them, whether the Works of the Ceremonial Law ben't included or whether the Apoſtle don't par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly argue againſt Juſtification by Circumciſion, and other ceremonial Obſervances; but all that is in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, whether when he denies Juſtification by Works of the Law, he is to be underſtood only of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, or whether the moral Law ben't alſo implied and intended; And therefore thoſe Arguments that are brought to prove that the Apoſtle meant the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law are nothing to the Purpoſe, unleſs they prove more than that, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apoſtle meant <hi>thoſe only.</hi>
                     </p>

What is much inſiſted on is, that it was the <hi>judaiſing</hi> Chriſtians being ſo fond of Circumciſion, and other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law, and depending ſo much on them, which was the very Occaſion of the Apoſtles writing as he does againſt Juſtification by the Works of the Law. But ſuppoſing it were ſo, that their truſting in Works of the Ceremonial Law, were the <hi>ſole</hi> Occaſion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's writing; (which yet there is no reaſon to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as may appear afterwards;) if their truſting in a <hi>particular Work,</hi> as a Work of Righteouſneſs was all that gave <hi>occaſion</hi> to the Apoſtle to write, how does it follow that therefore the Apoſtle did not upon that <hi>Occaſion</hi> write againſt truſting in <hi>all Works</hi> of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whatſoever? Where is the abſurdity of ſuppoſing that the Apoſtle might take occaſion from his obſerving ſome to truſt in a <hi>certain</hi> Work as a Work of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of Righteouſneſs <hi>at all,</hi> and that it was a very proper Occaſion too? yea it would have been anavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Apoſtle to have argued againſt truſting in a particular Work in that quality of a Work of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which quality was general, but he muſt there in argue againſt truſting in Works of Righteouſneſs <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Suppoſing it had been ſome other particular ſort of Works that was the occaſion of the Apoſtle's writing, as for inſtance, Works of Charity, and the Apoſtle ſhould hence take occaſion to write to them not to truſt in their Works, could the Apoſtle by that be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of no other Works beſides Works of Charity? Would it have been abſurd to underſtand him as writing againſt truſting in <hi>any Work at all,</hi> becauſe it was their truſting to a <hi>particular Work</hi> that gave occaſion to his writing?</p>
                     <p>Another Thing that is alledged as an Evidence that the Apoſtle means the ceremonial Law, when he ſays we can not be juſtified by the Works of the Law, is that he uſes that Argument to prove it, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Law that he ſpeaks of was given ſo long after the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in Gal 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. <hi>And this I ſay that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004239_0039_10042B5BF19BCC70"/>
Law that was four hundred and thirty years after can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſannul.</hi> But ſay they, it was only the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and not the Covenant of Works that was given ſo long after.—But the Apoſtle's Argument ſeems manifeſtly to be miſtaken by them. The Apoſtle don't ſpeak of a Law that began firſt <hi>to have being</hi> four hundred and thirty Years after; if he did, there would be ſome force in their Objection; But he has reſpect to a certain ſolemn Tranſaction, well known among the <hi>Jews,</hi> by the Phraſe of <hi>the giving of the Law,</hi> which was that great Tranſaction at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that we have Account of in the 19, and 20 Chapters of <hi>Exodus,</hi> conſiſting eſpecially in God's giving the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is the moral Law, with that terrible Voice, which Law he afterwards gave in Tables of Stone. This Tranſaction the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Apoſtles Time miſinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they looked upon it as God's eſtabliſhing that Law as a Rule of Juſtification. This conceit of theirs the Apoſtle brings this invincible Argument againſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That God would never go about to <hi>diſannul</hi> his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was plainly a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> by a Tranſaction with his Poſterity, that was ſo long after it, and was plainly built upon it: He would not overthrow a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> that he had long before eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> for him, and his Seed, (which is often mention'd as the Ground of God's making them his People,) by now eſtabliſhing a <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> with them at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as the Jews and judaizing Chriſtians ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p>But that the Apoſtle don't mean only Works of the ceremonial Law, when he excludes Works of the Law in Juſtification, but alſo of the moral Law, and all Works of Obedience, Vertue, and Righteouſneſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, may appear by the following Things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle don't only ſay, that we are not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Works <hi>of the Law,</hi> but that we are not juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified <hi>by Works,</hi> uſing a general Term; as in our Text it is ſaid, unto him that <hi>worketh not,</hi> but believeth on him that juſtifieth, &amp;c. and in the 6. v. <hi>God imputeth righteouſneſs</hi> without Works, And Chap 11. 6. <hi>"And
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004239_0040_10042B6097C56748"/>
if by Grace, then it is no more of</hi> Works, <hi>otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace: But if it be of</hi> Works, <hi>then it is no more Grace; otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace. St Eph. 2 8, 9 For by Grace ye are ſaved, through Faith,—not of</hi> Works. By which, there is no Reaſon in the World to underſtand the Apoſtle of any other than Works in general, as correlates of a Reward, or good Works, or Works of Vertue and Righteouſneſs. When the Apoſtle ſays we are juſtified or ſaved <hi>not by Works,</hi> without any ſuch Term annexed, as <hi>the Law,</hi> or any other Addition to limit the Expreſſion, what War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant have any to confine it to Works of a particular Law, or Inſtitution, excluding others? Are not Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of other Divine Laws Works, as well as of that? It ſeems to be allowed by the Divines in the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme, in their Interpretation of ſeveral of thoſe Texts where the Apoſtle only mentions <hi>Works,</hi> without any Addition, that he means our own good Works in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but then they ſay, he only means to exclude any proper merit in thoſe Works. But to ſay the Apoſtle means one Thing when he ſays we ben't juſtified by <hi>Works,</hi> another when he ſays we ben't juſtified by the <hi>Works of the Law,</hi> when we find the Expreſſions mixed. and uſed in the ſame Diſcourſe, and when the Apoſtle is evidently upon the ſame Argument, is very unreaſonable, it is to dodge, and fly from Scripture, rather than to open and yield our ſelves to it's teachings.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the third Chapter of <hi>Romans,</hi> our having been guilty of Breaches of the moral Law, is an Argument that the Apoſtle uſes why we cannot be juſtified <hi>by the Works of the Law;</hi> Beginning with the 9th <hi>v</hi> There he proves out of the Old Teſtament, that all are under Sin; <hi>There is none righteous, no not one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

4. 'Tis evident that when the Apoſtle ſays, we can't be juſtified by the Works of the Law, he means the Moral as well as ceremonial Law, by his giving this Reaſon for it, that <hi>by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin,</hi> as <hi>Rom</hi> 3. 20. <hi>By the Deeds of the Law ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified in his Sight, for by the Law is the knowledge of Sin.</hi> Now that Law by which we come to the knowledge of Sin, is the moral Law chiefly and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.—If this Argument of the Apoſtle be good, <hi>that we can't be juſtified by the Deeds of the Law, becauſe it is by the Law that we come to the knowledge of Sin,</hi> then it proves that we can't be juſtified by the Deeds of the Moral Law, nor by the Precepts of Chriſtianity; for by them is the Knowledge of Sin. If the Reaſon be good, then where the Reaſon holds, the Truth holds.—'Tis a miſerable Shift, and a violent Force put upon the Words, to ſay that the meaning is, that by the Law of Circumciſion is the Knowledge of Sin, becauſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ſignifying the taking away of Sin, puts Men in mind of Sin. The plain meaning of the Apoſtle is, that as the Law moſt ſtrictly forbids Sin, it tends to convince us of Sin, and bring our own Conſciences to <hi>condemn</hi> us, inſtead of <hi>juſtifying</hi> of us; that the Uſe of it is to declare to us our own Guilt and Unworthineſs, which is the reverſe of juſtifying and approving of us as virtuous or worthy. This is the Apoſtle's meaning, if we will allow him to be his own expoſitor; for he himſelf in this very Epiſtle explains to us how it is that by the Law we have the Knowledge of Sin, and that 'tis by the Law's forbidding Sin <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſhalt not covet: Therefore when the Apoſtle argues that by the Deeds of the Law no Fleſh living ſhall be juſtifyed, becauſe by the Law is the knowledge of Sin, his Argument proves, (unleſs he was miſtaken as to the force of his Argument,) that we can't be juſtifyed by the Deeds of the Moral Law.</p>
                     <p n="5">5.

                     <p>But it is ſaid that boaſting is excluded, as Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was excluded, which was what the <hi>Jews</hi> eſpecially uſed to glory in, and value themſelves upon, above other Nations.</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were not only uſed to boaſt of Circumciſion, but were notorious for boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their moral Righteouſneſs. The <hi>Jews</hi> of thoſe Days were generally Admirers, and followers of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were full of their Boaſts of their moral Righteouſneſs, as we may ſee by the Example of the Phariſee mention'd in the 18th of <hi>Luke,</hi> which Chriſt mentions as deſcribing the general Temper of that Sect; <hi>Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I thank thee, that I am not as other Men, an Extortioner nor Unjuſt, nor an Adulterer.</hi> The Works that he boaſts of were chiefly moral Works: He depended on the Works of the Law for Juſtification; and therefore Chriſt tells us that the <hi>Publican,</hi> that renounced all his own Righteouſneſs, <hi>went down to</hi> his Houſe <hi>juſtified</hi> rather than he.

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004239_0046_10042B6FC29AF630"/>
Idolatry, and Sacriledge, were the breaches, which is the moral Law: So that this is the boaſting which the Apoſtle condemns them for; and therefore if they were juſtified by the Works of this Law, then how comes he to ſay that their boaſting is excluded? And beſides, when they boaſted of the Rites of the <hi>ceremonial</hi> Law, it was under a Notion of it's being a Part of their own Goodneſs or Excellency, or what made them holier and more lovely in the ſight of God than other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and if they were not juſtified by this Part of their own ſuppoſed Goodneſs, or Holineſs, yet if they were by another, how did that exclude boaſting? How was their boaſting excluded, unleſs all Goodneſs or Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their own was excluded?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Reaſon given by the Apoſtle why we can be juſtified only by Faith, and not by the Works of the Law, in the 3d Chap. of <hi>Gal. viz. That they that are under the Law are under the Curſe,</hi> makes it evident that he don't mean only the ceremonial Law. In that Chapter the Apoſtle had particularly inſiſted upon it that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by Faith, and that it is by Faith only, and not by the Works of the Law, that we can be juſtified and become the Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and be made Partakers of the Bleſſing of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> And he gives this Reaſon for it, in the 10th <hi>v. For as many as are of the Works of the Law are under the Curſe; for it is written curſed is every one that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not in all Things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> 'Tis manifeſt that theſe Words cited from <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> are ſpoken not only with Regard to the ceremonial Law, but the whole Law of God to Mankind, and <hi>chiefly</hi> the moral Law; and that all Mankind are therefore as they are in themſelves under that Curſe, not only while the ceremonial Law laſted, but now ſince that has ceaſed: And therefore all that are juſtified, are redeemed from that curſe, by Chriſt's bearing it for them; as there in the 13. ver. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us; For it is written, curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree.</hi>—Now therefore, either it's

being ſaid ſo, that he is curſed that continueth not in all Things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them, is a good Reaſon why we can't be juſtified by the Works of <hi>that Law,</hi> of which it is ſo ſaid, or it is not; if it be, then it is a good Reaſon why we can't be juſtified by the Works of the moral Law, and of the whole Rule which God has given to Mankind to walk by; for the Words are ſpoken of the moral as well as ceremonial Law, and reach every Command, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept which God has given to Mankind, and chiefly the moral Precepts, which are moſt ſtrictly enjoin'd, and the Violations of which in both New Teſtament and Old, and in the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> themſelves, are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the moſt dreadful <hi>Curſe.</hi>

                     <p>But then further, if we ſhould allow that the Apoſtle intends only to oppoſe Juſtification by Works of the ceremonial Law in this Text, yet 'tis evident by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion he uſes that he means to oppoſe it under that Notion, or in that quality, of their being <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs of our own doing.</hi> But if the Apoſtle argues againſt our being juſtified by Works of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law under the Notion of their being <hi>of that Nature and Kind,</hi> viz. <hi>Works of our own doing;</hi> then it will follow that the Apoſtle's Argument is ſtrong againſt, not only <hi>thoſe,</hi> but <hi>all of that Nature and Kind,</hi> even all that <hi>are of our own doing</hi>

'Tis true their Obedience to the ceremonial Law would have nothing to do in the Affair of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs it was <hi>ſincere;</hi> and ſo neither would the Works of the moral Law: Obedience to the moral Law would have been concerned in the Affair of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if ſincere; and ſo would Obedience to the ceremonial.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis manifeſt that <hi>Moſes</hi> when he deſcribes the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, or the Way of Juſtification by the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Words here cited, <hi>He that doth thoſe Things ſhall live in them,</hi> don't ſpeak only, nor chiefly, of the Works of the ceremonial Law; For none will pretend that God ever made ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Man, that he that kept the ceremonial Law ſhould live in it, or that there ever was a Time that it was <hi>chiefly</hi> by the Works of the ceremonial Law, that Men lived and were juſtified.

                     </p>
                     <p>And further, how can the Apoſtle's Deſcription that he here gives from <hi>Moſes,</hi> of this <hi>exploded</hi> Way of Juſtification by the Works of the Law, conſiſt with the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme of a Way of Juſtification by the Vertue of a ſincere Obedience, that <hi>ſtill remains</hi> as the <hi>true and only Way</hi> of Juſtification, under the Goſpel. 'Tis moſt apparent that 'tis the deſign of the Apoſtle to give a Deſcription of both the legal <hi>rejected,</hi> and the evangelical <hi>valid</hi> Ways of Juſtification, in that wherein they differ, or are diſtinguiſhed the one from the other: But how is that, that <hi>he that doth thoſe Things ſhall live in them,</hi> that wherein the Way of Juſtification by the Works of the Law, differs, or is diſtinguiſhed from that in which Chriſtians under the Goſpel are juſtified, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Scheme; for ſtill, according to them, it may be ſaid, in the ſame Manner, of the <hi>Precepts of the Goſpel,</hi> he that doth theſe Things ſhall live in them: The difference lies only in the Things <hi>to be done,</hi> but not at all, in that that the <hi>doing of them</hi> is not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of living in them, juſt in the one Caſe, as in the other. The Words, <hi>He that doth them ſhall live in them,</hi> will ſerve juſt as well for a Deſcription of the latter as the former.—By the Apoſtle's ſaying, the Righteouſneſs of the Law is deſcribed <hi>thus,</hi> he that doth theſe Things ſhall live in them, but the Righteouſneſs of Faith, faith <hi>thus,</hi> plainly intimates that the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith faith <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> and in an <hi>oppoſite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>—But beſides, if theſe Words cited from <hi>Moſes,</hi> are actually ſaid by him of the moral Law as well as ceremonial, as 'tis moſt evident they are, it renders it ſtill more abſurd to ſuppoſe them mentioned by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, as the <hi>very Note of Diſtinction</hi> between Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by a ceremonial Obedience, and a moral ſincere Obedience, as the <hi>Arminians</hi> muſt ſuppoſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have ſpoken to a ſecond Argument, to prove that we are not juſtified by any manner of Virtue or

Goodneſs of our own, <hi>viz.</hi> That to ſuppoſe otherwiſe is contrary to the Doctrine that is directly urged, and abundantly inſiſted on by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtles.</p>
                     <p>I proceed now to a</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Third</hi> Argument, <hi>viz</hi> That to ſuppoſe that we are juſtified by our own ſincere Obedience, or any of our own Virtue or Goodneſs, <hi>derogates from Goſpel Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Scheme of Juſtification that manifeſtly takes from, or diminiſhes the Grace of God, is undoubtedly to be rejected; for 'tis the declared Deſign of God in the Goſpel to exalt the Freedom and Riches of his Grace, in that Method of Juſtification of Sinners, and Way of admitting them to his Favour, and the bleſſed Fruits of it, which it declares. The Scripture teaches that the Way of Juſtification that is appointed in the Goſpel Covenant, is appointed, <hi>as it is,</hi> for that end, that free Grace might be expreſs'd, and glorified; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace.</hi> The exerciſing, and magnifying the free Grace of God in the Goſpel contrivance for the Juſtification and Salvation of Sinners, is evidently the <hi>chief Deſign of it:</hi> And this Freedom and Riches of the Grace of the Goſpel is every where ſpoken of in Scripture as the <hi>chief Glory of it.</hi> Therefore that Doctrine that dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from the free Grace of God in juſtifying Sinners, as it is moſt oppoſite to God's Deſign, ſo it muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding offenſive to him.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that maintain that we are juſtified by our own ſincere Obedience, do pretend that their Scheme does not diminiſh the Grace of the Goſpel; for they ſay that the Grace of God is wonderfully manifeſted in appointing ſuch a Way and Method of Salvation, by ſincere Obedience, in aſſiſting us to perform ſuch an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and in accepting our imperfect Obedience, inſtead of perfect.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore examine that Matter, whether their Scheme of a Man's being juſtified by his own Vertue, and ſincere Obedience, does derogate from the Grace of God or no; or whether free Grace is not mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

This is agreeable to the common Senſe of Mankind, that the leſs worthy or excellent the Object of Benevolence, or the receiver of Kindneſs is, the more he is obliged, and the greater Gratitude is due. He therefore is moſt of all obliged, that receives Kindneſs without <hi>any</hi> Goodneſs or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in himſelf, but with a <hi>total</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> Hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. And as 'tis agreeable to the common Senſe of Mankind; ſo 'tis agreeable to the Word of God: How often does God in the Scripture inſiſt on this Argument with Men, to move them to love him, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Kindneſs? How much does he inſiſt on this as an Obligation to Gratitude, that they are ſo ſinful and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Therefore it certainly follows, that that Doctrine that teaches that God, when he juſtifies a Man, and ſhews him that great Kindneſs, as to give him a Right to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, don't do it for any Obedience, or any manner of Goodneſs of his; but that Juſtification reſpects a Man as ungodly, and wholly without any manner of Vertue, Beauty, or Excellency. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would <hi>explain what we mean by the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</hi> Sometimes the Expreſſion is taken by our Divines in a larger Senſe, for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of all that Chriſt did and ſuffered for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, whereby we are free from Guilt, and ſtand Righteous in the ſight of God; and ſo implies the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation both of Chriſt's Satisfaction, and Obedience. But here I intend it in a ſtricter Senſe, for the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Righteouſneſs, or moral Goodneſs, that conſiſts in the Obedience of Chriſt. And by that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs being <hi>imputed</hi> to us, is meant no other than this, that that Righteouſneſs of Chriſt <hi>is accepted for us, and admitted inſtead of that perfect inherent Righteouſneſs that ought to be in our ſelves:</hi> Chriſt's perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

ſhall be <hi>reckoned to our Account,</hi> ſo that we ſhall have <hi>the Benefit of it, as tho' we had performed it our ſelves:</hi> And ſo we ſuppoſe that a Title to eternal Life is given us as the <hi>reward of this Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Scripture uſes the Word <hi>impute</hi> in this Senſe, <hi>viz. For reckoning</hi> any Thing belonging to any Perſon, <hi>to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon's Account:</hi> As Philem. v. 18. <hi>If he have wronged thee, or oweth thee ought,</hi> put that on mine Account.

                        <hi>impute that to me.</hi> 'Tis a Word of the ſame Root with that which is tranſlated impute, <hi>Rom</hi> 4. 6. <hi>To whom God</hi> imputeth <hi>Righteouſneſs without Works.</hi> And 'tis the very ſame Word that is uſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. that is tranſlated <hi>impute;</hi> ſin is not <hi>imputed,</hi> where there is no Law.</p>
                     <p>The oppoſers of this Doctrine ſuppoſe that there is an abſurdity in it: They ſay that to ſuppoſe that God imputes Chriſt's Obedience to us, is to ſuppoſe that God is miſtaken, and thinks that we perform'd that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that Chriſt performed. But why can't that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs be <hi>reckoned to our Account,</hi> and be <hi>accepted for us,</hi> without any ſuch abſurdity? Why is there any more abſurdity in it, then in a Merchant's transferring Debt or Credit from one Man's Account to another, when one Man pays a Price for another, ſo that it ſhall be accepted as if that other had paid it? Why is there any more abſurdity in ſuppoſing that Chriſt's Obedience is imputed to us, than that his Satisfaction is imputed? If Chriſt has ſuffered the Penalty of the Law for us, and in our ſtead, then it will follow, that his ſuffering that Penalty is imputed to us, <hi>i. e.</hi> That it is accepted <hi>for us,</hi> and in our ſtead, and is reckon'd to our Account, as tho' <hi>we</hi> had ſuffered it. But why mayn't his <hi>obeying the Law</hi> of God be as rationally reckon'd to our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as his <hi>ſuffering the Penalty of the Law?</hi> Why may not a Price to <hi>bring into Debt,</hi> be as rationally trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from one Perſon's Account to another, as a Price to <hi>pay a Debt</hi>—Having thus explain'd what we mean by the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, I proceed,</p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To prove that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is thus imputed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is the very ſame need of Chriſt's <hi>obeying the Law in our ſtead, in order to the Reward,</hi> as of his <hi>ſuffering the Penalty of the Law, in our ſtead, in order to our eſcaping the Penalty;</hi> and the ſame Reaſon why one ſhould be accepted on our Account, as the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is the ſame need of one as the other, <hi>that the Law of God might be anſwered:</hi> One was as requiſite to <hi>anſwer the Law</hi> as the other, This is certain, that that was the Reaſon why there was need that Chriſt ſuffer the Penalty for us, even <hi>that the Law might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;</hi> for this the Scripture plainly teaches: This is given as the Reaſon why Chriſt was made a <hi>curſe for us,</hi> that the Law threatned a <hi>curſe to us, Gal.</hi> 3, 10, 13.

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> is therefore exactly the ſame need <hi>from the Law</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience being <hi>fulfill'd,</hi> in order to our obtaining the Reward, as there is of Death's being <hi>ſuffered,</hi> in order to our eſcaping the Puniſhment, or the ſame Neceſſity <hi>by the Law,</hi> of perfect Obedience <hi>preceeding</hi> Life, as there is of Diſobedience being <hi>ſucceeded</hi> by Death: The Law is without doubt, as much of an eſtabliſhed Rule in one Caſe as in the other.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt by ſuffering the Penalty, and ſo making At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for us, only removes the Guilt of our Sins and ſo ſets us in the ſame State that <hi>Adam</hi> was in the firſt Moment of his Creation: And it is no more fit, that we ſhould obtain eternal Life, only on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have the Reward of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, or of a confirmed and unalterable State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, the firſt Moment of his exiſtence, without any Obedience at all.— <hi>Adam</hi> was not to have the Reward meerly on the Account of his being innocent; if ſo, he would have had it fixed upon him at once, as ſoon

as ever he was created; for he was as innocent then as he could be: But he was to have the Reward on the Account of his Activeneſs in Obedience; not on the Account meerly of his not having done ill, but on the Account of his <hi>doing well.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So on the ſame Account we han't eternal Life meerly on the Account of being void of Guilt, (as <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt exiſtence,) which we have by the <hi>Attonement of Chriſt;</hi> but on the Account of <hi>Chriſt's activeneſs in Obedience,</hi> and <hi>doing well.</hi> Chriſt is our ſecond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Head, and is called the <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 22. becauſe he acted the Part for us, that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have done: When he had undertaken for us to ſtand in our ſtead, he was looked upon, and treated as tho' he were guilty with our Guilt; and by his ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or bearing the Penalty, he did as it were <hi>free himſelf</hi> from this Guilt.

                        </gap> freedom from Guilt; and hereby indeed was free from any Obligation to ſuffer Puniſhment: But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed, there was need of ſomething further, even a poſitive Obedience, in order to his obtaining, as our ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Reward of eternal Life.</p>
                     <p>God ſaw meet to place Man firſt in a State of Trial, and not to give him a Title to eternal Life, as ſoon as he had made him: becauſe it was his will that he ſhould firſt give Honour to his Authority, by fully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to it, in Will and Act, and perfectly obeying his Law. God inſiſted upon it that his holy Majeſty and Law ſhould have their due Acknowledgement, and Honour from Man, ſuch as became the Relation he ſtood in to that Being that created him, before he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the Reward of confirmed and everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon him; and therefore God gave him a Law when he created him, that he might have Opportunity, by giving due Honour to his Authority in obeying it, to obtain this Happineſs. It therefore became Chriſt, ſeeing that in aſſuming Man to himſelf, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ought a Title to this eternal Happineſs for him, after he had

broken the Law, that he himſelf ſhould become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to God's Authority, and be in the Form of a Servant, that he might do that honour to God's Authority for him, by his Obedience, which God at firſt required of Man, as the Condition of his having a Title to that Reward. Chriſt came into the World to that end, to render the Honour of God's Authority and Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Salvation and eternal Life of Sinners; he came to ſave them, and yet withal to aſſert and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Honour of the Lawgiver, and his holy Law. Now if the Sinner after his Sin was ſatisfied for, had eternal Life beſtowed upon him, without active Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the Honour of his Law would not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently vindicated. Suppoſing this were poſſible, that the Sinner himſelf could by ſuffering pay the Debt, and afterwards be in the ſame State that he was in before his Probation, that is to ſay, <hi>negatively righteous,</hi> or meerly without Guilt; if he now at laſt ſhould have eternal Life beſtowed upon him, without performing that Condition of Obedience, then God would recede from his Law, and would give the promiſed Reward, and his Law never have Reſpect and Honour ſhewn to it, in that Way of being obeyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But now Chriſt by ſubjecting himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the Law and obeying of it, has done great Honour to the Law, and to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God who gave it: That ſo glorious a Perſon ſhould become ſubject to the Law, and fulfil it, has done much more to honour it, than if meer Man had obeyed it: It was a Thing infinitely honourable to God that a Perſon of infinite Dignity was not aſhamed to call him <hi>his God,</hi> and to adore and obey him as ſuch: This was more to God's Honour than if any meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of any poſſible Degree of Excellency and Dignity, had ſo done.</p>
                     <p>'Tis abſolutely neceſſary that in order to a Sinner's being juſtified, the Righteouſneſs of ſome other ſhould be reckoned to his Account; for 'tis declared that the Perſon juſtified is looked upon as (in himſelf) <hi>ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> but God neither <hi>will</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> juſtify a Perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Righteouſneſs; for Juſtification is manifeſtly a

To ſay, that God don't juſtify the Sinner without ſincere, tho' an imperfect Obedience, don't help the Caſe; for an imperfect Righteouſneſs <hi>before a Judge</hi> is no Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. To accept of ſomething that falls ſhort of the Rule, inſtead of ſomething elſe that anſwers the Rule, is no judicial Act, or act of a Judge, but a pure Act of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty. An imperfect Righteouſneſs is no Righteouſneſs, before a Judge; For <q>Righteouſneſs [as one obſerves] is a relative Thing, and has always Relation to a Law: The formal Nature of Righteouſneſs, properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, lies in a conformity of Actions to that which is the Rule and Meaſure of them.</q> Therefore that only is Righteouſneſs in the Sight of a Judge that anſwers the Law<note n="*" place="bottom">That it is <hi>perfect Obedience,</hi> that is what is called <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in the New-Teſtament, and that this Righteouſneſs or perfect Obedience is by God's fixed unalterable Rule, the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtification, is from the plain Evidence of Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, by a certain great Man, that no Body will think to be a likely Perſon to be blinded by a Prejudice in favour of the Doctrine we are maintaining, and one who did not receive this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> in his <hi>Reaſonableneſs of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity as delivered in the Scriptures,</hi> Vol. 2d of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Works. p 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Law is the Judges Rule: If he pardons and hides what <hi>really is,</hi> and ſo don't paſs Sentence according to what Things are in themſelves, he either don't act the Part of a Judge, or elſe judges falſly. The very Notion

of judging, is to determine <hi>what is,</hi> and <hi>what is not,</hi> in any one's Caſe. The Judge's Work is two fold, it is to determine firſt what is <hi>fact,</hi> and then whether what is <hi>in fact</hi> be according to <hi>Rule,</hi> or according to the <hi>Law.</hi> If a Judge has no <hi>Rule</hi> or Law eſtabliſhed before Hand, by which he ſhould proceed in judging, he has no Foundation to go upon in judging, he has no Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be a Judge; nor is it poſſible that he ſhould do the Part of a Judge. To judge without a Law or Rule by which to judge, is impoſſible, for the very Notion of judging is to determine whether the Object of Judgment be according to Rule; and therefore God has declared that when he acts as a Judge he will not juſtifie the Wicked, and cannot <hi>clear</hi> the <hi>Guilty;</hi> and by parity of Reaſon cannot <hi>juſtify</hi> without <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>

                     <p>And the Scheme of the old Law's being abrogated, and a new Law introduced, won't help at all in this difficulty; for an imperfect Righteouſneſs cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Law of God that we are under, whither that be an old one or a new one; for every Law requires perfect Obedience to it ſelf: Every Rule whatſoever requires perfect conformity to it ſelf; 'tis a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuppoſe otherwiſe; for to ſay, that there is a Law that don't require <hi>perfect</hi> Obedience to it ſelf, is to ſay that there is a Law that don't require <hi>all</hi> that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. That Law that <hi>now</hi> forbids Sin, is certainly the Law that we are <hi>now</hi> under, (let that be an old one, or a new one;) or elſe it is <hi>not ſin:</hi> That which is <hi>not</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and is the Breach of <hi>no</hi> Law, is <hi>no</hi> Sin: But if we are <hi>now</hi> forbidden to commit Sin, then 'tis by a Law that we are <hi>now</hi> under, for ſurely we are neither under the forbiddings, nor commandings of a Law that we are not under.

God doth in the Sentence of Juſtification pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a Man <hi>perfectly Righteous,</hi> or elſe he would need a further Juſtification after he is juſtified: His Sins being removed by Chriſt's Atonement, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for his Juſtification; for juſtifying a Man, as has been already ſhewn, is not meerly pronouncing him <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> or <hi>without Guilt,</hi> but ſtanding Right, with regard to the Rule that he is under, and righteous unto Life; But this according to the eſtabliſhed Rule of Nature, Reaſon, and Divine Appointment, is a poſitive perfect Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>As there is the <hi>ſame need that</hi> Chriſt's Obedience <hi>ſhould</hi> he reckon'd to our Account, as that his Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould; ſo there is <hi>the ſame Reaſon why it ſhould.</hi> As if Adam had perſevered, and finiſhed his courſe of Obedience, we ſhould have received <hi>the Benefit</hi> of his Obedience, as much as now we have the Miſchief of his Diſobedience; ſo in like Manner, there is Reaſon that we ſhould receive the Benefit of the ſecond Adam's <hi>Obedience,</hi> as of his <hi>Atonement</hi> of our Diſobedience: Believers are repreſented in Scripture as being ſo <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, as that they are legally one, or accepted as one, by the ſupreme Judge: Chriſt has aſſumed our Nature, and has ſo aſſumed all, in that Nature, that belong to him, into ſuch an Union with himſelf, that he is become their Head, and has taken them to be his Members: And therefore what Chriſt has done in our Nature, whereby he <hi>did honour</hi> to the Law and Authority of God by his <hi>Acts,</hi> as well as the <hi>Reparation to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of the Law, by his <hi>ſufferings,</hi> is reckon'd to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Account; ſo as that the believer ſhould be <hi>made happy,</hi> becauſe it was ſo <hi>well,</hi> and <hi>worthily done</hi> by his Head, as well as <hi>freed from being miſerable,</hi> becauſe he has <hi>ſuffered</hi> for our <hi>ill and unworthy doing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When Chriſt had once undertaken with God, to ſtand for us, and put himſelf under our Law, <hi>by that Law</hi> he was obliged to <hi>ſuffer</hi> and <hi>by the ſame Law</hi> he was obliged to obey: By the ſame Law, after he had taken Man's Guilt upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he <hi>himſelf</hi> being our Surety, could not be <hi>acquitted,</hi> till he had <hi>ſuffer'd,</hi> nor

The Scripture teaches us, that when Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, he was juſtified; which Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as I have already ſhewn, implies, both his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance from our Guilt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is Acceptance to the Exaltation and Glory that was the Reward of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: But believers, as ſoon as they Believe are admitted to partake with Chriſt in this his Juſtification: Hence we are told that he was <hi>raiſed again for our Juſtification,</hi> Rom 4. 25. Which is true, not only of that Part of his Juſtification that conſiſts in his Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but alſo his Acceptance to his Reward: The Scripture teaches us that he is exalted, and gone to Heaven, to take Poſſeſſion of Glory <hi>in our Name,</hi> as our forerunner. <hi>Heb</hi> 6 20 We are as it were both <hi>raiſed up together with Chriſt,</hi> and alſo <hi>made to ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Chriſt, in heavenly Places, and in Him.</hi> Eph 2. 6.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected here, that there is <hi>this Reaſon,</hi> why what Chriſt ſuffer'd ſhould be accepted on our Account rather than the Obedience he performed, that <hi>he was obliged to Obedience for himſelf, but was not obliged to ſuffer but only on our Account.</hi> To this I anſwer, that Chriſt was not obliged on his own Account, to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> to obey. Chriſt in his original Circumſtances, was in no ſubjection to the Father, being altogether equal with him: He was under no Obligation to put himſelf in Man's ſtead, and under Man's Law, or to put himſelf into any State of Subjection to God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. There was a Tranſaction between the Father and the Son, that was antecedent to Chriſt's becoming Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being made under the Law, wherein he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to put himſelf under the Law, and both to obey and to ſuffer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which Tranſaction theſe Things were already vertually done in the ſight of God; as is evident by this, that God acted on the Ground of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004239_0070_10042BAEAD6F1698"/>
that Tranſaction, juſtifying and ſaving Sinners, as if the Things undertaken had been actually performed long before they were performed indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore, without doubt, in order to the eſtimating the value, and validity of what Chriſt did and ſuffered, we muſt look back to that Tranſaction, wherein theſe Things were firſt undertaken, and vertually done in the ſight of God, and ſee what Capacity and Circumſtances Chriſt acted in then, and then we ſhall find that Chriſt was under no manner of Obligation, either to obey the Law, or ſuffer the Penalty of it. After this he was equally under Obligation to both; for henceforward he ſtood as our Surety or Repreſentative: And therefore this conſequent Obligation, may be as much of an Objection againſt the validity of his ſuffering the Penalty, as againſt his Obedience. But if we look to that original Tranſaction between the Father and the Son, wherein both th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe were undertaken and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as vertually done in the ſight of the Father, we ſhall find Chriſt acting with Regard to both, as one perfectly in his own Right, and under no manner of previous Obligation, to hinder the validity of either.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To ſuppoſe that all that Chriſt does is only to make Atonement for us by ſuffering, is to make him our Saviour but in Part. 'Tis to rob him of half his Glory as a Saviour. For if ſo, all that he does is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from Hell, he don't purchaſe Heaven for us. The adverſe Scheme ſuppoſes that he purchaſes Heaven for us, in this Senſe, that he ſatisfies for the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our Obedience, and ſo purchaſes that our ſincere imperfect Obedience might be accepted as the Condition of eternal Life; and ſo purchaſes an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for us to obtain Heaven by our own Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But to purchaſe Heaven for us, only in this Senſe, is to purchaſe it in no Senſe at all; for all of it comes to no more than a Satisfaction for our Sins, or removing the Penalty by ſuffering in our ſtead: For all the purchaſing they ſpeak of, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> imperfect Obedience ſhould be accepted, is only his ſatisfying
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:004239_0071_10042BB646B69508"/>
for the ſinful imperfection of our Obedience, or (which is the ſame Thing) making Atonement for the Sin that our Obedience is attended with. But that is not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing Heaven, meerly to ſet us at Liberty again, that we may go, and get Heaven by what we do our ſelves: all that Chriſt does is only to pay a Debt for us; there is no poſitive Purchaſe of any Good.—We are taught in Scripture that Heaven is <hi>purchaſed</hi> for us, 'tis called the <hi>purchaſed Poſſeſſion,</hi> Eph. 1. 14. The Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the eternal Inheritance, not to be acquired, as the firſt Covenant did, but as already acquired and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: But he that pays a Man's Debt for him, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers him from Slavery, can't be ſaid to purchaſe an Eſtate for him, meerly becauſe he ſets him at Liberty, ſo that henceforward he has an opportunity to get an Eſtate by his own hand Labour. So that according to this Scheme, the Saints in Heaven have no Reaſon to thank Chriſt for purchaſing Heaven for 'em, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming them <hi>to God,</hi> and making them King's and Prieſt's, as we have an Account that they do in <hi>Rev.</hi>5. 9</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, whether we call it active or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, it alters not the Caſe as to the preſent Argument, as long as 'tis evident by the Words that 'tis not meerly under the Notion of an <hi>Atonement</hi> for Diſobedience, or a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for Unrighteouſneſs, but under the Notion of a poſitive <hi>Obedience,</hi> and a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> or moral Goodneſs, that it <hi>juſtifies</hi> us, or makes us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; becauſe both the Words <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> are uſed, and uſed too as the Oppoſites to <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> and an <hi>Offence.

It can be no juſt Objection againſt this, that that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Father to Chriſt that he ſhould lay down his Life, was no Part of the Law that we had broken, and therefore that his obeying this Command could be no Part of that Obedience that he performed for us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we needed that he ſhould obey no other Law for us, but only that which we had broken or fail'd of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For altho' it muſt be the ſame legiſlative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whoſe Honour is repair'd by Chriſt's Obedience, that we have injured by our Diſobedience; yet there is no need that the Law that Chriſt obeys ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame that <hi>Adam</hi> was to have obeyed, in that Senſe that there ſhould be no <hi>poſitive</hi> Precepts wanting, nor any added: There was wanting the Precept about the forbidden Fruit, and there was added the ceremonial Law. The Thing required was perfect Obedience: It is no Matter whether the <hi>poſitive</hi> Precepts were the ſame, if they were equivalent. The poſitive Precepts that Chriſt was to obey, were much more than equivalent to what was wanting, becauſe infinitely more difficult, particularly the Command that he had received to lay down his Life, which was his principal Act of Obedience, and which above all others, is concern'd in our Juſtification.

'Tis no Objection againſt the laſt mention'd Thing, even Chriſt's laying down his Life, its being included in the moral Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe that Law it ſelf allowed of no Occaſion for any ſuch Thing; for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law virtually includes all right Acts, on all <hi>poſſible Occaſions,</hi> even Occaſions that the Law it ſelf allows not: Thus we are obliged by the moral Law to mortify our Luſts, and repent of our Sins, tho' that Law allows of no Luſt to mortify, or Sin to repent of.</p>
                     <p>There is indeed but one great Law of God, and that is the ſame Law that ſays, <hi>if thou ſinneſt thou ſhalt die,</hi> and <hi>curſed is every one that continues not in all Things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Law to do them:</hi> All Duties of poſitive Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, are virtually comprehended in this Law: and therefore if the <hi>Jews</hi> brake the ceremonial Law, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed 'em to the Penalty of the Law, or Covenant of Works, which threaten'd, <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> The Law is the eternal and unalterable <hi>Rule of Righteouſneſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, and therefore is the Rule of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> by which all that a Man does ſhall be either juſtified or condemn'd; and no Sin expoſes to Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by the Law: So now he that refuſes to obey the Precepts that require an Attendance on the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the New-Teſtament, is expoſed to Damnation, by Virtue of the Law or Covenant of Works.—It may moreover be argued, that all Sins whatſoever, are Breaches of the Law or Covenant of Works, becauſe all Sins, even Breaches of the poſitive Precepts, as well as others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have Atonement by the Death of Chriſt: But what Chriſt died for, was to ſatisfy the Law, or to bear the Curſe of the Law; as appears by <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

So that Chriſt's laying down his Life might be Part of that Obedience by which we are juſtified, tho' it was a poſitive Precept, not given to <hi>Adam.</hi> It was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Chriſt's main Act of Obedience, becauſe it was Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to a Command that was attended with immenſely the greateſt Difficulty, and ſo to a Command that was the greateſt Trial of his Obedience; his Reſpect ſhown to God in it, and his Honour to God's Authority, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably great: It is ſpoken of in Scripture as Chriſt's principal Act of Obedience. Philip. 2. 7, 8. <hi>But made himſelf of no Reputation, and took upon him</hi> the Form of a Servant, <hi>and was made in the Likeneſs of Man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in Faſhion as a Man, he humbled himſelf and</hi> became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs Heb. 5. 8 <hi>Though he were a Son, yet learned he Obedience by the Things that he ſuffered.</hi> It was mainly by this Act of Obedience, that Chriſt purchaſed ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Reward <hi>for himſelf;</hi> as in that Place in Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans 2. 8, 9. <hi>He became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs;</hi> wherefore <hi>God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name, which is above every Name:</hi> And it therefore follows from what has been already ſaid, that it's mainly by this Act of Obedience, that Believers in Chriſt alſo, have the Reward of Glory, or come to partake with Chriſt in his Glory. We are as much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Death of Chriſt, as his yielding himſelf to die <hi>was an Act of Obedience,</hi> as we are, as it was <hi>a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Sins:</hi> For as it was not the only Act of Obedience that merited, he having performed meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acts of Obedience through the whole Courſe of his Life; ſo neither was it the only Suffering that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory; all his Sufferings through the whole Courſe of his Life being propitiatory, as well as every Act of Obedience meritorious: Indeed this was his <hi>principal Suffering;</hi> and it was as much his <hi>principal Act of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence we may ſee how that the Death of Chriſt did not only make Atonement, but alſo merited eternal Life; and hence we may ſee how by the Blood of Chriſt we are not only redeemed from Sin, but <hi>redeemed unto
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004239_0079_1004047536F98838"/>
God;</hi> and therefore the Scripture ſeems every where to attribute the whole of Salvation to the Blood of Chriſt: This precious Blood is as much the main Price by which <hi>Heaven is purchaſed,</hi> as 'tis the main Price by which we are <hi>redeemed from Hell.</hi> The poſitive Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, or <hi>that Price</hi> by which he merited, was of equal Value with <hi>that</hi> by which he ſatisfied; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was the ſame Price: <hi>He ſpill'd his Blood</hi> to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, and by Reaſon of the infinite Dignity of his Perſon, his Sufferings were looked upon as of infinite Value, and equivalent to the eternal Sufferings of a finite Creature: And <hi>he ſpill'd his Blood</hi> out of Reſpect to the Honour of God's Majeſty, and in Submiſſion to his Authority, who had commanded him ſo to do, and his Obedience there in was of infinite Value; both becauſe of the Dignity of the Perſon that performed it, and becauſe he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to infinite Expence to perform it, whereby the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Degree of his Regard to God's Authority appear'd.</p>
                     <p>One would wonder what <hi>Arminians</hi> mean by Chriſt's <hi>Merits:</hi> They talk of Chriſt's <hi>Merits</hi> as much as any Body, and yet deny the Imputation of Chriſt's poſitive Righteouſneſs: What ſhould there be that any one ſhould merit or deſerve any Thing by, beſides Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs or Goodneſs? If any Thing that Chriſt did or ſuffered, merited or deſerved any Thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Goodneſs, or Righteouſneſs, or Holineſs of it: If Chriſt's Sufferings and Death merited Heaven, it muſt be becauſe there was an excellent Righteouſneſs, and tranſcendent moral Goodneſs in that Act of laying down his Life: And if by that excellent Righteouſneſs he merited Heaven <hi>for us,</hi> then ſurely that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is <hi>reckon'd to our Account,</hi> that we have the Benefit of it, or which is the ſame Thing, <hi>it is imputed to us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I hope I have made it evident, that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt is indeed imputed to us. I proceed now to the</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Third,</hi> and laſt Thing under this Argument, That this Doctrine of the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is utterly inconſiſtent with the Doctrine of our being
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004239_0080_10042BCBE0847298"/>
juſtified by <hi>our own</hi> Virtue, or ſincere Obedience. If Acceptance to God's Favour, and a Title to Life, be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Believers, as the Reward of <hi>Chriſt's Obedience,</hi> then it is not given as the Reward of <hi>our own Obedience. In what reſpect ſoever,</hi> Chriſt is our Saviour, that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs excludes our being our own Saviours, <hi>in that ſame reſpect.</hi> If we can be our own Saviours <hi>in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> that Chriſt is, it will thence follow that the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt is needleſs, <hi>in that reſpect;</hi> according to the Apoſtle's reaſoning, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Chriſt is render'd of no effect unto you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law.</hi> Doubtleſs 'tis Chriſt's Prerogative to <hi>be our Saviour,</hi> in that Senſe wherein <hi>he is our Saviour:</hi> And therefore if it be by his Obedience that we are juſtified, then it is not by our own Obedience.</p>
                     <p>Here perhaps it may be ſaid, that a Title to Salvation is not directly given as the Reward of our Obedience; for that is not by any Thing of ours; but only by Chriſt's Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs; but yet an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in</hi> that Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs is given as a Reward of our Obedience.</p>
                     <p>But this don't at all help the Caſe; for this is to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe as much to our Obedience, as if we aſcribed Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to it <hi>directly,</hi> without the Intervention of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs: For it would be as great a Thing for God to give us Chriſt, and his Satisfaction and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, in Reward for our Obedience, as to give us Heaven <hi>immediately;</hi> it would be as great a Reward, and as great a Teſtimony of reſpect to our Obedience. And if God gives as great a Thing as Salvation, for our Obedience, why could he not as well give Salvation it ſelf directly? And then there would have been no need of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. And indeed if God gives us <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or an Intereſt in him, properly in reward of our Obedience, he does really give us <hi>Salvation</hi> in reward for our Obedience; for the former implies the latter; yea it implies it as the greater implies the leſs. So that indeed it exalts our Vertue and Obedience more, to ſuppoſe that God gives us Chriſt in reward of that Vertue and Obedience, than if he ſhould give Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Chriſt.</p>

The Thing that the Scripture guards, and militates againſt, is our imagining that 'tis our own Goodneſs, Vertue, or Excellency, that inſtates us in God's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and Favour. But to ſuppoſe that God gives us an Intereſt in Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in Reward for our Vertue, is as great an Argument that it inſtates us in God's Favour, as if he beſtowed a title to eternal Life, as it's <hi>direct reward.</hi> If God gives us an Intereſt in Chriſt, as a reward <hi>of our Obedience,</hi> it will then follow, that we are inſtated in God's Acceptance and Favour by our own Obedience, antecedent to our having an Intereſt in Chriſt. For a rewarding any one's Excellency, ever-more ſuppoſes Favour and Acceptance on the Account of that Excellency: It is the very Notion of a reward, that it is a good Thing, beſtowed in Teſtimony of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Favour for the Vertue or Excellency reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that it is not by Vertue of our Intereſt in Chriſt and his Merits, that we firſt come into Favour with God, according to this Scheme; for we are in God's Favour before we have any Intereſt in thoſe Merits; in that we have an Intereſt in thoſe Merits given as a Fruit of God's Favour for our own Vertue. If our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt be the Fruit of God's Favour, then it can't be the Ground of it. If God did not accept us, and had no Favour for us, for our own Excellency, he never would beſtow ſo great a Reward upon us, as a Right in Chriſt's Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs. So that ſuch a Scheme deſtroys it ſelf, for it ſuppoſes that Chriſt's Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us to recommend us to the Favour of God; and yet ſuppoſes that we have God's Favour and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before we have Chriſt's Satisfaction and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and have theſe given as <hi>a Fruit of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>

As when a Man offers himſelf to a Woman in Marriage, he don't give himſelf to her as a Reward of her receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in Marriage: Her receiving him is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as a worthy Deed in her, for which he rewards her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by giving himſelf to her; but 'tis by her receiving him, that <hi>the Union is made,</hi> by which ſhe hath him for her Husband: 'Tis on her Part the Unition it ſelf.—By theſe Things it appears how contrary to the Scheme of the Goſpel of Chriſt, their Scheme is, who ſay that Faith juſtifies <hi>as a 'Principle of Obedience,</hi> or as a <hi>leading Act of Obedience;</hi> or (as others) <hi>the Sum,</hi> and <hi>Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of all evangelical Obedience: For by this 'tis the Obedience or Virtue that is in Faith, that is the Thing, that gives it its juſtifying Influence; and that is the ſame thing as to ſay, that we are juſtified by our own Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Virtue or Goodneſs.</p>

But the determining what concern Acts of chriſtian Obedience can have in Juſtification in this Reſpect, will depend on the reſolving of another Point, <hi>viz</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any other Act of Faith beſides the firſt Act, has any Concern in our Juſtification, or how far Perſeverance in Faith, or the continued and renewed Acts of Faith, have Influence in this Affair.</p>
                     <p>And it ſeems manifeſt that Juſtification is <hi>by</hi> the firſt Act of Faith, in ſome Reſpects, in a Peculiar Manner, becauſe a Sinner is actually and finally juſtified as ſoon as he has performed one Act of Faith; and Faith in its firſt Act does, virtually at leaſt, depend on God for Perſeverance, and intitles to this among other Benefits. But yet the Perſeverance of Faith is not excluded in this Affair; it is not only certainly connected with Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but it is not to be excluded from that on which the Juſtification of a Sinner has a <hi>Dependance,</hi> or that <hi>by which</hi> he is juſtified.</p>
                     <p>I have ſhown that the Way in which Juſtification has a Dependance on Faith, is that it is the Qualification on which the <hi>Congruity</hi> of an Intereſt in the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt depends, or wherein ſuch a Fitneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. But the Conſideration of the Perſeverance of Faith, can't be excluded out of this Congruity or Fitneſs, for it is congruous that he that believes in Chriſt ſhould have an Intereſt in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and ſo in the eternal Benefits purchaſed by it, becauſe Faith is that by which the Soul hath Union or Oneneſs with Chriſt, and there is a natural Congruity in it, that they that are one with Chriſt, ſhould have a joint Intereſt with him in his eternal Benefits; but yet this Congruity depends on its being an <hi>abiding Union.</hi> As it is needful that the Branch ſhould abide in the Vine, in order to its receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſting Benefits of the Root, ſo it is neceſſary that the Soul ſhould abide in Chriſt, in order to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving thoſe laſting Benefits of God's final Acceptance and Favour. John 15. 6, 7. <hi>If a Man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a Branch. If ye abide in me, and my Words abide you, ye ſhall ask what ye will, and it ſhall be done unto you.</hi> Verſes 9, 10. <hi>Continue ye in my Love: If
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:004239_0084_100404770B8C9AA0"/>
ye keep</hi> (or abide in) <hi>my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my Love, even as I have kept my Father's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and abide in his Love.</hi> There is the ſame Reaſon why it is neceſſary that the Union with Chriſt ſhould remain, as why it ſhould be begun, why it ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be, as why it ſhould once be: If it ſhould be begun without remaining, the beginning would be in vain. In order to the Soul's being <hi>now</hi> in a juſtified State, and <hi>now</hi> free from Condemnation, 'tis neceſſary that it ſhould <hi>now</hi> be in Chriſt, and not only that it ſhould once have been in him. Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The Soul is ſaved <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, as being now in him, when the Salvation is beſtowed, and not meerly as remembring that it <hi>once was</hi> in him. Philip. 3 9. <hi>That I may be FOUND IN HIM, not having mine own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> 1 John 2. 28. <hi>And now little Children abide in him; that when he ſhall appear, we may have Confidence, and not be aſhamed before him at his Coming.</hi> In order to Perſons being bleſſed after Death, 'tis neceſſary not only that they ſhould once be in him, but that they ſhould <hi>die in him.</hi> Rev. 14. 13. <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead that die in the Lord</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And there is the ſame Reaſon why Faith, the uniting Qualification, ſhould remain, in order to the Union's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, as why it ſhould once be, in order to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's once being.</p>
                     <p>So that altho' the Sinner is actually, and finally juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied on the firſt Act of Faith, yet the Perſeverance of Faith, even then, comes into Conſideration, as one Thing on which the Fitneſs of Acceptance to Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God in the Act of Juſtification, which is paſſed on a Sinner's firſt believing, has Reſpect to Perſeverance, as being virtually contain'd in that firſt Act of Faith; and 'tis looked upon and taken by him that juſtifies, as being as it were a Property in that Faith that then is: God has Reſpect to the Believer's Continuance in Faith, and he is juſtified by that, as tho' it already were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by divine Eſtabliſhment it ſhall follow; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:004239_0085_10042BDA193E0D28"/>
by divine Conſtitution connected with that firſt Faith, as much as if it were a Property in it, it is then conſider'd as ſuch, and ſo Juſtification is not ſuſpended; but were it not for this it would be needful that it ſhould be ſuſpended, till the Sinner had actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered in Faith.</p>
                     <p>And that it is ſo, that God in that Act of final Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that he paſſes at the Sinner's Converſion, has Reſpect to Perſeverance in Faith, and future Acts of Faith, as being virtually implied in that firſt Act, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt by this, <hi>viz.</hi> That in a Sinner's Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at his Converſion, there is virtually contained a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs as to eternal, and deſerved Puniſhment, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all paſt Sins, but alſo of all future Infirmities and Acts of Sin, that they ſhall be guilty of; becauſe that firſt Juſtification is deciſive and final. And yet Pardon, in the Order of Nature, properly follows the Crime, and alſo follows thoſe Acts of Repentance and Faith that reſpect the Crime pardoned, as is manifeſt both from Reaſon and Scripture. <hi>David</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. ſpeaks of the Forgiveneſs of Sins of his, that were doubtleſs committed long after he was firſt godly, as being conſequent on thoſe Sins, and on his Repentance and Faith with Reſpect to them; and yet this Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſpoken of by the Apoſtle in the 4th of <hi>Romans,</hi> as an Inſtance of Juſtification by Faith. Probably the Sin <hi>David</hi> there ſpeaks of is the ſame that he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> and ſo the Pardon the ſame with that Releaſe from Death, or eternal Puniſhment, that the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 Sam 12. 13. <hi>The Lord alſo hath put away thy Sin; thou ſhalt not die.</hi> Not only does the Manifeſtation of this Pardon follow the Sin in the Order of Time, but the Pardon it ſelf, in the Order of Nature, follows <hi>David's</hi> Repentance and Faith with Reſpect to this Sin; for it is ſpoken of in the 32nd <hi>Pſalm</hi> as depending on it.</p>
                     <p>And beſides, if no other Act of Faith could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in Juſtification but the firſt Act, it will then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Chriſtians ought never to ſeek Juſtification by any other Act of Faith. For if Juſtification is not to be
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004239_0086_10042BDB9FEB2C50"/>
obtain'd by after Acts of Faith, then ſurely it is not a Duty to ſeek it by ſuch Acts: And ſo it can never be a Duty for Perſons after they are once converted, by Faith to ſeek to God; or believingly to look to him for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin, or Deliverance from the Guilt of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Deliverance from the Guilt of Sin is Part of what belongs to Juſtification. And if it ben't proper for Converts by Faith to look to God through Chriſt for it, then it will follow that it is not proper for them to pray for it, for chriſtian Prayer to God for a Bleſſing is but an Expreſſion of Faith in God for that Bleſſing; Prayer is only the Voice of Faith. But if theſe Things are ſo, it will follow that that Petition of the Lord's Prayer, <hi>for give us our Debts,</hi> is not proper to be put up by Diſciples of Chriſt, or to be uſed in chriſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and that Chriſt improperly directed his Diſciples to uſe that Petition, when they were all of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Judas,</hi> converted before. The Debt that Chriſt directs his Diſciples to pray for the Forgiveneſs of, can mean nothing elſe, but the Puniſhment that Sin deſerves, or the Debt that we owe to divine Juſtice, the ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Talents we owe our Lord. To pray that God would forgive our <hi>Debts,</hi> is undoubtedly the ſame Thing as to pray that God would releaſe us from Obligation to <hi>due Puniſhment;</hi> but releaſing from Obligation to the Puniſhment due to Sin, and forgiving the Debt that we owe to divine Juſtice, is what appertains to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>And then to ſuppoſe that no after Acts of Faith are concerned in the Buſineſs of Juſtification, and ſo that it is not proper for any ever to ſeek Juſtification by ſuch Acts, would be forever to cut off thoſe Chriſtians, that are doubtful concerning their firſt Act of Faith, from the Joy and Peace of Believing. As the Buſineſs of a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith is to obtain Pardon and Peace with God, by looking to God and truſting in him for theſe Bleſſings, ſo the Joy and Peace of that Faith, is in the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Pardon and Peace obtain'd by ſuch a Truſt. This a Chriſtian that is doubtful of his firſt Act of Faith, can't have from that Act, becauſe, by the Suppoſition,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:004239_0087_10042BDD2748EA50"/>
he is doubtful whether it be an Act of Faith, and ſo whether he did obtain Pardon and Peace by that Act: The proper Remedy, in ſuch a Caſe, is now by Faith to look to God in Chriſt for theſe Bleſſings; but he is cut off from this Remedy, becauſe he is uncertain whether he has Warrant ſo to do, for he don't know but that he has believed already; and if ſo, then he has no Warrant to look to God by Faith for theſe Bleſſings now, becauſe by the Suppoſition no new Act of Faith is a proper Means of obtaining theſe Bleſſings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo he can never proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain the Joy of Faith; for there are Acts of true Faith, that are very weak Acts, and the firſt Act may be ſo as well as others; it may be like the firſt Motion of the Infant in the Womb, it may be ſo weak an Act that the Chriſtian by examining of it, may never be able to determine whether it was a true Act of Faith or n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; and it is evident from Fact, and abundant Experience, that many Chriſtians are forever at a Loſs to determine which was their firſt Act of Faith. And thoſe Saints that have had a good Degree of Satisfaction concerning their Faith, may be ſubject to great Declenſions and Falls, in which Caſe they are liable to great Fears of eternal Puniſhment; and the proper Way of Deliverance is to forſake their Sin by Repentance, and by Faith now to come to Chriſt for Deliverance from the deſerved eternal Puniſhment; but this it would not be, if Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from that Puniſhment, was not this Way to be obtain'd.</p>
                     <p>But what is a ſtill more plain and direct Evidence of what I am now arguing for, is that that Act of Faith that <hi>Abraham</hi> exerciſed in the great Promiſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace that God made to him, of which it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, Gen 15. 16. <hi>It was accounted to him for Righteouſneſs;</hi> which is the grand Inſtance and Proof, that the Apoſtle ſo much inſiſts upon throughout the 4th Chapter of <hi>Romans,</hi> and 3d. Chapter of <hi>Galatians,</hi> to confirm his Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone, was not <hi>Abraham's</hi> firſt A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ted long after he had by Faith forſaken his own Country, <hi>Heb. 11. 8.</hi> and had been treated as an eminent Friend of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="unknown:004239_0088_10042BDED1616EB0"/>
Moreover, The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the third Chapter of <hi>Philippians,</hi> tells us how earneſtly he ſought Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith, or to win Chriſt and obtain that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which was by the Faith of him, in what he did after his Converſion. Verſes 8, 9 <hi>For whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all Things, and do count them but, Dung that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having on mine own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> And in the two next Verſes he expreſſes the ſame Thing in other Words, and tells us how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e went through Sufferings, and became conformable to Chriſt's Death, that he might be a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker with Chriſt in the Benefit of his Reſurrection; which the ſame Apoſtle elſewhere teaches us, is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Juſtification: Chriſt's Reſurrection was his Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; in this, he that was put to Death in the Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſh, was juſtified by the Spirit, and he that was delivered for our Offences, roſe again for our Juſtification. And the Apoſtle tells us in the Verſes that follow, in that third Chapter of <hi>Philippians,</hi> that he thus fought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Righteouſneſs which is through the Faith of Chriſt, and ſo to partake of the Benefit of his Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtill, as tho' he had not already attain'd, but that he continued to follow after it.</p>
                     <p>But in as much as a Sinner, in his firſt Juſtification, is forever juſtified and freed from all Obligation to eternal Puniſhment, it hence of neceſſity follows, that future Faith and Repentance are beheld in that Juſtification, as virtually contained in that firſt Faith and Repentance; becauſe Repentance of thoſe future Sins, and Faith in a Redeemer, with Reſpect to them, or, at leaſt, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of that Habit and Principle in the Heart, that has ſuch an actual Repentance and Faith, in it's Nature and Tendency, is now made ſure by God's Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>If Remiſſion of Sins, committed after Converſion, in the order of Nature, follows that Faith and Repentance that is after them, then it follows that future <hi>Sins</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in the firſt Juſtification, no otherwiſe than as <hi>future Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are reſpected in it. And
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:004239_0089_100404792E279CE0"/>
future Repentance and Faith are looked upon by him that juſtifies, as virtually implied in the firſt Repentance and Faith, in the ſame Manner as Juſtification from future Sins, is virtually implied in the firſt Juſtification; which is the Thing that was to be proved.</p>
                     <p>On the whole, it appears that the Perſeverance of Faith is neceſſary, even to the Congruity of Juſtification, and that not the leſs, becauſe a Sinner is juſtified, and Perſeverance promiſed on the firſt Act of Faith, but God in that Juſtification has Reſpect not only to the paſt Act of Faith, but to his own Promiſe of future Acts, and to the fitneſs of a Qualification beheld as yet only in his own Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>And, that Perſeverance in Faith is thus neceſſary to Salvation, not meerly as a <hi>ſine qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>non,</hi> or as an univerſal Concomitant of it, but by Reaſon of ſuch an Influence and Dependance, ſeems manifeſt by many Scriptures; I would mention two or three; Heb. 3. 6. <hi>Whoſe Houſe are we, if we hold faſt the Confidence, and the Rejoycing of the Hope, firm unto the End.</hi> Verſe 14. <hi>For we are made Partakers of Chriſt, if we hold the beginning of our Confidence, ſtedfaſt unto the End.</hi> Chap. 5 12. <hi>Be ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of them, who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes.</hi> Rom 11. 20. <hi>Well, becauſe of Unbelief they were broken off, but thou ſtandeſt by Faith: Be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but fear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as the Congruity to a final Juſtification depends on Perſeverance in Faith, as well as the firſt Act, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the Manifeſtation of Juſtification in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ariſes a great deal more from after Acts, than the firſt Act. And all the difference whereby the firſt Act of Faith has a Concern in this Affair that is peculiar, ſeems to be as it were only an accidental Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ariſing from the Circumſtance of Time, or its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt in Order of Time; and not from any peculiar Reſpect that God has to it, or any Influence it has of a peculiar Nature, in the Affair of our Salvation.</p>
                     <p>And thus it is that a truly chriſtian Walk, and the Acts of an evangelical, child like, believing Obedience, are concerned in the Affair of our Juſtification, and ſeem
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:004239_0090_10042BE605191978"/>
to be ſometimes ſo ſpoken of in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a perſevering Faith in the Son of God, the only Saviour. Faith unites to Chriſt, and ſo gives a Congruity to Juſtification, not meerly as remaining a dormant Principle in the Heart, but as being, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in its active Expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>The Obedience of a Chriſtian, ſo far as it is truly evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, and performed with the Spirit of the Son ſent forth into the Heart, has all relation to Chriſt the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and is but an Expreſſion of the Soul's believing Unition to Chriſt: All evangelical Works are Works of that Faith that worketh by Love; and every ſuch Act of Obedience, wherein it is inward, and the Act of the Soul, is only a new effective Act of Reception of Chriſt, and Adherence to the glorious Saviour. Hence that of the Apoſtle, Gal 2. 20. <hi>I live, yet not I; but Chriſt liveth in me; and the Life that I now live in the Fleſh, is by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> And hence we are directed, in whatever we do, whether in Word or Deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                     <p>And that God in Juſtification has reſpect, not only to the firſt Act of Faith, but alſo to future perſevering Acts, in this Senſe, <hi>viz</hi> as expreſſed in Life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſeems manifeſt by <hi>Rom</hi> 1. 17. <hi>For therein is the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God revealed, from Faith to Faith: As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the Juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> And Heb. 10. 38, 39. <hi>Now the Juſt ſhall live by Faith; but if any Man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no Pleaſure in him. But we are not of them that draw back unto Perdition, but of them that believe to the ſaving of the Soul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that as was before ſaid of Faith, ſo may it be ſaid of a child like, believing Obedience, it has no concern in Juſtification by any Vertue, or Excellency in it; but only as there is a Reception of Chriſt in it. And this is no more contrary to the Apoſtle's frequent Aſſertion of our being juſtified without the Works of the Law, than to ſay that we are juſtified by Faith; for Faith is as much a Work or act of chriſtian Obedience, as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Faith, in ſpiritual Life and Walk. And
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004239_0091_10042BE789769F68"/>
therefore as we ſay that Faith don't juſtify as a Work, ſo we ſay of all theſe effective Expreſſions of Faith.</p>
                     <p>This is the reverſe of the Scheme of our modern Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hold that Faith juſtifies only as an Act, or Expreſſion of Obedience; whereas in Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Obedience has no concern in Juſtification, any otherwiſe than as an Expreſſion of Faith.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 Theſe Things being promiſed to our Vertue and Obedience, argues no more, than that there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between them and evangelical Obedience; which I have already obſerved is not the Thing in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.

Faith, without any Goodneſs of our own, that has been maintain'd, and therefore it can be no Objection againſt this Doctrine, that we have ſometimes in Scripture, Promiſes of Pardon and Acceptance, made to ſuch Acts of Obedience.</p>

Argument that 'tis the Thing, upon the Account of which we are accepted to a Right to it.

A Parent may do much to prepare a Child for an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in it's Education, after the Child is an Heir: yea there are many Things neceſſary to fit a Child for the actual Poſſeſſion of the Inheritance, that ben't neceſſary in order to it's having a Right to the Inheritance.</p>

Our Obedience is not only indiſſolubly connected with Salvation, and Preparatory to it, but the Scripture expreſly ſpeaks of beſtowing eternal Bleſſings as <hi>Rewards</hi> for the good Deeds of the Saints.

Which, tho' we ſuppoſe it to imply no proper <hi>Merit,</hi> yet it at leaſt implies a moral fitneſs, or that the excellency of their Vertue in God's Sight, <hi>recommends</hi> them to ſuch a Reward; which ſeems directly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to what has been ſuppoſed, <hi>viz</hi> That we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and approved of God, as the Heirs of Salvation, not out of Regard to the Excellency of our own Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Goodneſs, or any <hi>moral fitneſs</hi> therein to ſuch a Reward, but only on the Account of the Dignity, and <hi>moral fitneſs</hi> of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. 2 Our being eternally rewarded for our own Holineſs, and good Works, neceſſarily ſuppoſes that our future Happineſs will be greater or ſmaller, in ſome Proportion, as our own Holineſs and Obedience is more or leſs; and that there are different Degrees of Glory, according to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Degrees of Vertue and good Works, is a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine very expreſly, and frequently taught us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But this ſeems quite inconſiſtent with the Saints all having their future bleſſedneſs as a Reward of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs: For if Chriſt's Righteouſneſs be imputed to all, and this be what entitles each one to Glory, then 'tis the ſame Righteouſneſs that entitles one to Glory, which entitles another: But if all have Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as the Reward of the <hi>ſame Righteouſneſs,</hi> why han't all the <hi>ſame Glory?</hi> Don't the ſame Righteouſneſs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as much Glory, when imputed to one, as when imputed to another.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>firſt</hi> Part of this Objection. I would obſerve, that it don't argue that we are juſtified by our good Deeds, becauſe we ſhall have eternal Bleſſings in Reward for them; for 'tis in <hi>Conſequence of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> that our good Deeds become <hi>rewardable,</hi> with ſpiritual and eternal Rewards. The acceptableneſs, and ſo the rewardableneſs of our Vertue is not antecedent to Juſtification, but follows it, and is built entirely upon it; which is the reverſe of what thoſe in the adverſe Scheme of Juſtification ſuppoſe, <hi>viz</hi> That Juſtification is built on the Acceptableneſs and Rewardableneſs of our Vertue. They ſuppoſe that a ſaving Intereſt in Chriſt is given as a Reward of our Vertue, or (which is
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:004239_0096_10042BF5F44CCF28"/>
the ſame Thing,) as a Teſtimony of God's Acceptance of our Excellency, in our Vertue. But the contrary is true; that God's reſpect to our Vertue, as our amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Sight, and his Acceptance of it as reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is entirely built on our Intereſt in Chriſt already eſtabliſhed. So that that Relation to Chriſt, whereby Believers in Scripture Language, are ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, is the very Foundation of our Vertues, and good Deeds, being accepted of God, and ſo of their being rewarded; for a Reward is a Teſtimony of Acceptance. For we, and all that we do, are accepted only <hi>in the beloved,</hi> Eph 1. 6. Our Sacrifices are acceptable, only through our Intereſt in him, and through his Worthineſs, and Preciouſneſs, being as it were made ours. 1 Pet. 2. 4 5. To whom coming <hi>as unto a living Stone, diſallowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of Men, but choſen of God and</hi> precious; <hi>ye alſo as lively Stones, are built up a ſpiritual Houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices,</hi> acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt. Here a being actually built on this Stone, <hi>precious to God,</hi> is mentioned as all the Ground of the <hi>Acceptableneſs</hi> of our good Works to God, and their becoming, <hi>alſo precious</hi> in his Eves. So Heb. 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 21. <hi>Make you perfect in every good Work, to do his Will, working in you that which is</hi> well pleaſing in his Sight, through Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And hence we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, whatever we offer to God, to offer it in Chriſt's Name, as expecting to have it accepted no other Way, than from the Value that God has to that Name. Col. 3. 17. <hi>And whatſoever ye do, in Word or Deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, giving Thanks to God, and the Father by him</hi> To act in Chriſt's Name, is to act under him, as our Head, and as having him to ſtand for us, and repreſent us to God ward.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon of this may be ſeen, from what has been already ſaid, to ſhew that it is not meet that any Thing in us, ſhould be accepted of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as any Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our Perſons, until we are actually in Chriſt, and juſtified through him. The Lovelineſs of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of fallen Creatures, is nothing in the Sight of God, till he beholds them in Chriſt, and clothed with his
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:004239_0097_10042BF7790BA340"/>
Righteouſneſs. 1. Becauſe till then we ſtand condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before God, by his own holy Law, to his utter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and Abhorrence, And, 2. Becauſe we are infinitely Guilty before him, and the Lovelineſs of our Vertue bears no Proportion to our Guilt; and muſt therefore paſs for nothing before a ſtrict Judge. And, 3 Becauſe our good Deeds, and vertuous Acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are in a Senſe corrupt, and the hatefulneſs of the Corruption of them, if we are beheld as we are in our ſelves, or ſeperate from Chriſt, infinitely outweighs the Lovelineſs of the Good that is in them: So that if no other Sin was conſidered, but only that which attends the Act of Vertue itſelf, the Lovelineſs vaniſhes into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Compariſon of it: And therefore the Virtue muſt paſs for nothing, out of Chriſt. Not only are our beſt Duties defiled, in being attended with the Exerciſes of Sin and Corruption, that precede them and follow them, and are <hi>intermingled with holy Acts;</hi> but even the <hi>holy Acts themſelves,</hi> and the gracious Exerciſes of the godly, tho' the Act moſt ſimply conſidered is good, yet take the Acts in their Meaſure, and Dimenſions, and the manner in which they are exerted, and they are <hi>corrupt Acts;</hi> that is, they are defectively corrupt, or ſinfully defective; there is that defect in them, that may well be called the Corruption of them; that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is properly Sin, an Expreſſion of a vile Sinfulneſs of Heart, and what tends to provoke the juſt anger of God; not becauſe the Exerciſe of Love and other Grace, is not equal to God's lovelineſs; for 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the Love of Creatures (Men or Angels) ſhould be ſo; but becauſe the Act is ſo very diſproportionate to the Occaſion given for Love or other Grace, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's lovelineſs, and the Manifeſtation that is made of it, and the exerciſes of Kindneſs, and the capacity of human Nature, and our Advantages, (and the like) together. A negative Expreſſion of Corruption may be as truly Sin, and as juſt Cauſe of Provocation, as a poſitive. Thus if a Man, a worthy &amp; excellent Perſon, ſhould from meer Generoſity and Goodneſs, exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay out himſelf, and ſhould with great Expence and
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:004239_0098_10042BF90E3B8E00"/>
Suffering, ſave another's Life, or redeem him from ſome extream Calamity; and when he had done all, that other Perſon ſhould never thank him for it, or expreſs the leaſt Gratitude any way; this would be a negative Expreſſion of his Ingratitude and Baſeneſs; but is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to an <hi>Act</hi> of Ingratitude, or <hi>poſitive</hi> exerciſe of a baſe unworthy Spirit; and is truly an Expreſſion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and brings as much Blame, as if he by ſome poſitive Act, had much injured another Perſon. And ſo it would be, (only in a leſſer Degree,) if the Gratitude was but very ſmall, bearing no Proportion to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Obligation; as if for ſo great and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a Kindneſs, he ſhould expreſs no more Gratitude than would have been becoming towards a Perſon that had only given him a cup of Water when thirſty, or ſhewn him the Way in a Journey, when at a loſs, or had done him ſome ſuch ſmall Kindneſs: If he ſhould come to his Benefactor to expreſs his Gratitude, and ſhould do after this manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he might truly he ſaid to act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily and odiouſly; he would ſhew a moſt ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit: And his doing after ſuch a Manner might juſtly be abhorr'd by all: And yet the Gratitude, that little there is of it, moſt ſimply conſidered, and ſo far as it goes, is good. And ſo it is with reſpect to our exerciſe of Love, and Gratitude, and other Graces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, they are defectively corrupt and ſinful, and take 'em as they are, in their Manner, and Meaſure, might juſtly be odious, and provoking to God, and would neceſſarily be ſo, were we beheld out of Chriſt: For in that this Defect is Sin, it is <hi>infinitely hateful;</hi> and ſo the hatefulneſs of the very Act, infinitely out weighs the Lovelineſs of it; becauſe all Sin has infinite hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and heinouſneſs; but our Holineſs has but little Value and Lovelineſs, as has been elſewhere demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>Hence, tho' it be true that the Saints are rewarded for their good Works, yet it is for Chriſt's ſake only, and not for the Excellency of their Works in themſelves
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:004239_0099_10042C16773456E8"/>
conſidered, or beheld ſeperately from Chriſt; for ſo they have no excellency in God's ſight, or acceptableneſs to him, as has now been ſhewn. 'Tis acknowledged that God in rewarding the Holineſs and good Works of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers, does in ſome reſpect give them Happineſs as a Teſtimony of his Reſpect to the Lovelineſs of their Holineſs and good Works in his Sight; for that is the very Notion of a Reward: But in a very different Senſe from what would have been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Man had not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; which would have been to beſtow eternal Life on Man, as a Teſtimony of God's Reſpect to the Lovelineſs of what Man did, conſidered as in it ſelf, and as in Man, ſeperately by himſelf, and not beheld as a Member of Chriſt: In which Senſe alſo, the Scheme of Juſtification we are oppoſing, neceſſarily ſuppoſes, the Excellency of our Virtue to be reſpected and rewarded; for it ſuppoſes a ſaving Intereſt in Chriſt <hi>it ſelf</hi> to be given as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it.</p>
                     <p>Two Things come to paſs, relating to the Saints Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their inherent Righteouſneſs, by Virtue of their Relation to Chriſt. 1. The Guilt of their Perſons is all done away, and the Pollution and Hatefulneſs that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and <hi>is in,</hi> their good Works, is hid. 2. Their Relation to Chriſt adds a <hi>poſitive</hi> Value and Dignity to their good Works, in God's Sight. That little Holineſs, and thoſe faint and feeble Acts of Love, and other Grace, receive an exceeding Value in the Sight of God, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of God's beholding them as in Chriſt, and as it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

(as has been before obſerved,) is valuable, in Proportion to the Dignity of the Perſon, whoſe Love it is; becauſe, ſo far as any one gives his Love to another, he gives <hi>himſelf,</hi> in that he gives his Heart: But this is a more excellent Offering, in Proportion as the Perſon whoſe <hi>ſelf</hi> is offered, is more worthy.

                        </gap>n Man would have been, conſidered as by himſelf, tho' he had been free from Sin; as a mean Perſon becomes more honourable when married to a King. Hence God will probably reward the little weak Love, and poor and exceeding imperfect Obedience of Believers in Chriſt, with a more glorious Reward, than he would have done <hi>Adam's</hi> perfect Obedience. According to the Tenour of the firſt Covenant, the Perſon was to be accepted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, only for the Work's Sake; but by the Covenant of Grace, the Work is accepted and rewarded, only for the Perſon's Sake; the Perſon being beheld antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a Member of Chriſt, and clothed with his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. So that tho' the Saints inherent Holineſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, yet this very Reward is indeed, not the leſs founded on the Worthineſs and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: None of the Value that their Works have in his Sight, nor any of the Acceptance they have with him, is out of Chriſt, and out of his Righteouſneſs; but his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs as Mediator, is the prime and only Foundation on which all is built, and the univerſal Source whence all ariſes. God indeed doth great Things out of Regard to the Saints Lovelineſs, but 'tis only as a ſecondary and derivative Lovelineſs, as it were.—When I ſpeak of a derivative Lovelineſs, I don't mean only, that the <hi>Qualifications themſelves,</hi> that are accepted as lovely, are derived from Chriſt, and are from his Power and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; but that the <hi>Acceptance of them</hi> as a Lovelineſs, and all the Value that is ſet upon them, and all their Connection with the Reward, is founded <hi>in,</hi> and derived <hi>from</hi> Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Worthineſs.</p>

If we ſuppoſe that not only higher Degrees of Glory in Heaven, but Heaven it ſelf, is in ſome Reſpect given in Reward for the Holineſs, and good Works of the Saints, in this ſecondary and derivative Senſe, it won't prejudice the Doctrine we have maintain'd 'Tis no Way impoſſible that God may beſtow Heaven's Glory wholly out of Reſpect to Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and yet in Reward for Man's inherent Holineſs, in different Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and different Ways It may be only Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that God has reſpect to, for its own Sake, the independent Acceptableneſs, and Dignity of it being ſufficient of it ſelf, to recommend all that believe in Chriſt, to a Title to this Glory; and ſo it may be only by this that Perſons <hi>enter</hi> into a Title to Heaven, or have their prime Right to it: And yet God may alſo have Reſpect to the Saints own Holineſs, <hi>for Chriſt's Sake,</hi> and as deriving a Value from Chriſt's Merit, which he may teſtify in beſtowing Heaven upon them. The Saints being beheld as Members of Chriſt, their Obedience is looked upon by God, as ſomething of Chriſt's, it being the Obedience of the Members of Chriſt; as the <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of the Members of Chriſt, are looked upon, in ſome Reſpect, as the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Chriſt. Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaking of his Sufferings, ſays Col 1. 24. <hi>Who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in my Sufferings for you,</hi> and fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Chriſt in my Fleſh. To the ſame Purpoſe is Matth 25. 35, &amp;c. <hi>I was an hungred, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſick, and in Priſon,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo that in Rev. 11. 8. <hi>And their dead Bodies ſhall lie in the Street of the great City, which ſpiritually is called Sodom, and Egypt,</hi> where alſo our Lord was crucified.</p>
                     <p>By the Merit and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God towards the Believer may be obtained, as that God may hereby, be already, as it were diſpoſed to make them perfectly and eternally happy: But yet this don't hinder, but that God in his Wiſdom, may chooſe to beſtow this perfect and eternal Happineſs, in this Way, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſome Reſpect, as a Reward of their Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Obedience: 'Tis not impoſſible but that the Bleſſedneſs may be beſtowed as a Reward for that which
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:004239_0102_100404CD542E1F58"/>
is done after that an Intereſt is already obtain'd in that Favour, which (to ſpeak of God after the Manner of Men) diſpoſes God to beſtow the Bleſſedneſs. Our heavenly Father may already have that Favour for a Child, whereby he may be thoroughly ready to give the Child an Inheritance, <hi>becauſe he is his Child;</hi> which he is by the Purchaſe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; and yet that don't hinder but that it ſhould be poſſible, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may chooſe to beſtow the Inheritance on the Child, in a Way of Reward for his Dutifulneſs, and behaving becoming a Child. And ſo great, and exceeding a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, may not be judged more than a meet Reward for his Dutifulneſs, but that ſo great a Reward <hi>is judged meet,</hi> don't ariſe from the Excellency of the Obedience, abſolutely conſidered, but from his ſtanding in ſo near, and honourable a Relation to God, as that of a Child, <hi>which is obtained only by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</hi> And thus the Reward, and the Greatneſs of it, ariſes properly from the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; tho' it be indeed in ſome ſort the Reward of their Obedience. As a Father might juſtly eſteem the Inheritance, no more than a meet Reward for the Obedience of his Child, and yet eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem it more than a meet Reward for the Obedience of a Servant. The Favour whence a Believer's heavenly Father beſtows the eternal Inheritance, and his Title as an Heir, is founded in that Relation he ſtands in to him as a Child, purchaſed by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; tho' he in Wiſdom, chooſes to beſtow it in ſuch a Way, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to teſtify his Acceptance of the Amiableneſs of his Obedience in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Believers having a Title to Heaven by Faith antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their Obedience, or it's being abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them before, don't hinder but that the actual Beſtowment of Heaven may alſo be a Teſtimony of God's Regard to their Obedience, tho' performed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Thus it was with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father and Pattern of all Believers: God beſtowed upon him that Bleſſing of multiplying his Seed as the Stars of Heaven, and cauſing that in his Seed all the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, in Reward for his Obedience, in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering

                     <p n="1">1. God looks on theſe glorious Benefits as a meet Teſtimony of his Regard to the Value which their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have in his Sight.

The Foundation being thus contrary, the whole Scheme becomes exceeding diverſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; the one Scheme is an <hi>evangelical</hi> Scheme, the other a <hi>legal</hi> one; the one is utterly inconſiſtent with our being juſtified by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, the other not at all.</p>

                     <p>With Reſpect to the <hi>ſecond</hi> Part of the Objection, that relates to the different Degrees of Glory, and the ſeeming Inconſiſtence there is in it, that the Degrees of Glory in different Saints ſhould be greater or leſſer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their inherent Holineſs and good Works, and yet that every ones Glory ſhould be purchaſed with the Price of the very ſame imputed Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi> That Chriſt by his Righteouſneſs purchaſed for every one, compleat and perfect Happineſs, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Capacity:</hi> But this don't hinder but that the Saints being of <hi>various Capacities,</hi> may have <hi>various

Degrees of Happineſs,</hi> and yet all their Happineſs be the Fruit of Chriſt's Purchaſe. Indeed it can't be properly ſaid that Chriſt purchaſed any particular Degree of Happineſs, ſo that the Value of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in the Sight of God, is ſufficient to raiſe a Believer <hi>ſo high,</hi> in Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and <hi>no higher;</hi> and ſo that if the Believer were made happier, it would exceed the Value of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs: But in general, Chriſt purchaſed eternal Life, or perfect Happineſs for all, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Capacities. The Saints are as ſo many Veſſels, of different Sizes, caſt into a Sea of Happineſs, where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Veſſel is full; this Chriſt purchaſed for all: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all 'tis left to God's ſovereign Pleaſure to determine the Largeneſs of the Veſſel; Chriſt's Righteouſneſs meddles not with this Matter. Eph. 4. 4. 5, 6, 7. <hi>There is one Body, and one Spirit; even as ye are called in one Hope of your Calling; one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, &amp;c.—But unto every one of us, is given Grace accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt.</hi> God may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe in this Matter according to what Rule he pleaſes, not the leſs for what Chriſt has done: He may diſpenſe either without Condition, or upon what Condition he pleaſes to fix. 'Tis evident that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs meddles not with this Matter; for what Chriſt did, was to fulfil the Covenant of Works; but the Covenant of Works did not meddle at all with this: If <hi>Adam</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever'd in perfect Obedience, he and his Poſterity would have had perfect and full Happineſs; every ones Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs would have ſo anſwer'd his Capacity, that he would have been compleatly bleſſed; but God would have been at Liberty to have made ſome of one Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and others of another as he pleaſed. The Angels have obtained eternal Life, or a State of confirmed Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by a Covenant of Works, whoſe Condition was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience; but yet ſome are higher in Glory than others, according to the ſeveral Capacity that God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſovereign Pleaſure, hath given them. So that it being ſtill left with God, notwithſtanding the perfect Obedience of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to fix the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of each ones Capacity, by what Rule he pleaſes,

he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gree of each ones Capacity, by what Rule he pleaſe; he hath been pleaſed to fix the Degree of Capacity, and ſo of Glory by the Proportion of the Saints Grace and Fruitfulneſs here: He gives higher Degrees of Glory, in Reward for higher Degrees of Holineſs and good Works, <hi>becauſe it pleaſes him;</hi> and yet all the Happineſs of each Saint is indeed the Fruit of the Purchaſe of Chriſt's Obedience. If it had been but one Man, that Chriſt had obeyed and died for, and it had pleaſed God to make him of a very large Capacity, Chriſt's perfect Obedience would have purchaſed that his Capacity ſhould be fill'd, and then <hi>all</hi> his Happineſs might properly be ſaid to be the Fruit of Chriſt's perfect Obedience; though if he had been of a leſs Capacity, he would not have had <hi>ſo much</hi> Happineſs, by the <hi>ſame</hi> Obedience; and yet would had as much as Chriſt merited for him. Chriſt's Righteouſneſs meddles not with the Degree of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, any otherwiſe than as he merits that it ſhould be full, and perfect, according to the Capacity: And ſo it may be ſaid to be concern'd in the Degree of Happineſs, as <hi>perfect</hi> is a Degree, with Reſpect to <hi>imperfect;</hi> but it meddles not with Degrees of perfect Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>This Matter may be yet better underſtood, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that Chriſt and the whole Church of Saints, are as it were, one Body, of which he is the Head and they Members, of different Place and Capacity: Now the whole Body, Head and Members, have Communion in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, they are all Partakers of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it; Chriſt himſelf the Head is rewarded for it, and every Member is Partaker of the Benefit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: But it does by no Means follow, that every Part ſhould equally partake of the Benefit; but every Part in Proportion to its Place and Capacity; the Head par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of far more than other Parts, becauſe it is of a far greater Capacity; and the more noble Members partake of more than the Inferiour. As it is in a natural Body that enjoys perfect Health, the Head, and the Heart, and Lungs have a greater Share of this Health, they have it more ſeated in them, than the Hands and Feet, becauſe they are Parts of greater Capacity; tho' the Hands and Feet are as much in perfect Health as thoſe nobler
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:004239_0108_10042C02A75AC888"/>
Parts of the Body: So it is in the myſtical Body of Chriſt, all the Members are Partakers of the Benefit of the Righteouſneſs of the Head; but 'tis according to the different Capacity and Place they have in the Body; and God determines that Place &amp; Capacity as he pleaſes; he makes whom he pleaſes the Foot, and whom he pleaſes the Hand, and whom he pleaſes the Lungs, &amp;c. 1 Cor. 12 18 <hi>God hath ſet the Members, every one of them, in the Body, as it hath pleaſed him.</hi> And God <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly</hi> determines the Place, and Capacity of every Member, by the different Degrees of Grace, and Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Improvement of it, here in this World: Thoſe that he intends for the higheſt Place in the Body, he gives them moſt of his Spirit, the greateſt Share of the divine Nature, the Spirit and Nature of Chriſt Jeſus <hi>the Head,</hi> and that Aſſiſtance whereby they perform the moſt excellent Works, and do moſt abound in them.</p>

                        <hi>Object</hi> 4 It may be objected againſt what has been ſuppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> That Rewards are given to our good Works only in Conſequence of an Intereſt in Chriſt, or in Teſtimony of God's Reſpect to the Excellency or Value of them in his Sight, as built on an Intereſt in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs already obtain'd, <hi>that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of an Intereſt in Chriſt it ſelf, as being given out of Reſpect to our moral Fitneſs.</hi> Matth. 10 37,38,39. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not</hi> worthy of me: <hi>He that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not</hi> worthy of me: <hi>He that taketh not up his Croſs, and followeth after me, is not</hi> worthy of me. <hi>He that findeth his Life ſhall loſe it, &amp;c.

The foremention'd Words don't imply that if a Man does love Chriſt above Father and Mother, &amp;c. that he would be worthy; the moſt they imply is, that ſuch a viſible Chriſtian ſhall be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thruſt out, as unworthy.

                     <p>And therefore, in Anſwer to the Objection, I would ſay, That when Repentance is ſpoken of in Scripture as the Condition of Pardon, thereby is not intended any particular Grace, or Act, properly diſtinct from Faith, that has a parallel Influence with it, in the Affair of our Pardon or Juſtification; but by Repentance is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended nothing diſtinct from active Converſion, (or Converſion actively conſidered,) as it reſpects the <hi>Term from which.</hi> Active Converſion is a Motion or Exerciſe of the Mind, that reſpects two <hi>Terms, viz.</hi> Sin and God: And by Repentance is meant this Converſion, or active Change of the Mind, ſo far as it is converſant about the <hi>Term from which,</hi> or about <hi>Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> This is what the Word <hi>Repentance</hi> properly ſignifies; which in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the New Teſtament is <hi>Metanoia</hi> which ſignifies <hi>a Change of the Mind,</hi> or which is the ſame Thing, the turning or the <hi>Converſion</hi> of the Mind. Repentance is this turning, as it reſpects what is turned from Acts 26. 20. <hi>Whereupon, O King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>I ſhewed unto them of</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>and at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and throughout all the Coaſts of</hi> Judea, <hi>and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould</hi> repent and turn to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Both theſe are the ſame turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but only with Reſpect to oppoſite <hi>Terms;</hi> in the former is expreſs'd the Exerciſe of Mind that there is about Sin in this Turning, in the other the Exerciſe of Mind towards God.</p>
                     <p>If we look over the Scriptures that ſpeak of evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Repentance, we ſhall preſently ſee that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is to be underſtood in this Senſe; as Matth. 9. 13. <hi>I am not come to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Luke 13 3. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe periſh;</hi> And Chap 15. 7, 10. <hi>There is Joy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over one Sinner that repenteth,</hi> i. e. over one Sinner

that is converted. Acts 11. 18. <hi>Then hath God, alſo to the Gentiles, granted Repentance unto Life.</hi> This is ſaid by the Chriſtians of the Circumciſion at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon <hi>Peter's</hi> giving an Account of the Converſion of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Family, and their embracing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, tho' <hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid nothing expreſly about their Sorrow for Sin. And again, Acts 17. 30. <hi>But now commandeth all Men, every where, to repent.</hi> And Luke 16. 30. <hi>Nay Father Abraham, but if one went to them from the Dead, they would repent.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9 <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his Promiſe, as ſome Men count Slackneſs, but is Long-ſuffering to us ward not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is the Condition of Juſtification, becauſe it is that great Change by which we are brought from Sin to Chriſt, and by which we become Believers in him: Agreeable to Matth. 21. 32. <hi>And ye when ye had ſeen it,</hi> repented <hi>not afterwards</hi> that ye might believe him. When we are directed to repent that our Sins may be blotted out, 'tis as much as to ſay, Let your Minds and Hearts be changed that your Sins may be blotted out: But if it be ſaid, <hi>Let your Hearts be changed</hi> that you may be juſtified; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But our Minds muſt be changed, that we may believe, and ſo may be juſtified.</p>
                     <p>And beſides, evangelical Repentance, being active Converſion, is not to be treated of as a particular Grace, properly and entirely diſtinct from Faith, as by ſome it ſeems to have been.

Soul that there is in Converſion, that reſpects Sin, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excluded out of the Nature of Faith in Chriſt: There is ſomething in Faith, or cloſing with Chriſt that reſpects Sin, and that is evangelical Repentance: That Repentance which in Scripture is called <hi>Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> is that very Principle or Operation of the Mind it ſelf, that i called Faith, ſo far as it is converſant about Sin. Juſtifying Faith in a Mediator, is converſant about two Things: It is converſant about Sin or <hi>Evil,</hi> to be rejected and to be delivered from by the Mediator, and about <hi>poſitive Good</hi> to be accepted and obtained by the Mediator; as converſant about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>That juſtifying Repentance has the Nature of Faith ſeems evident by Acts 19 4. <hi>Then ſaid Paul, John veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptiſed with the Baptiſm of Repentance, ſaying unto the People, that they ſhould believe on him that ſhould come after him, that is on Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The latter Words, <hi>Saying unto the People, that they ſhould believe on him</hi> &amp;c. are evidently exegetical of the former, and explain how he <hi>preached Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins:</hi> When it is ſaid that he preached Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sin, ſaying that they ſhould believe on Chriſt, it can't be ſuppoſed but that 'tis intended, that his ſaying that
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:004239_0114_10042C14F11C9220"/>
they ſhould believe on Chriſt, was as directing them what to do that they might obtain the Remiſſion of Sins. So 2 Tim. 2. 25. <hi>In Meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to the acknowleging of the Truth. That acknowleging of the Truth which there is in Believing, is here ſpoken of as what is attained in Repentance. And on the other Hand, that Faith includes Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in its Nature, is evident by the Apoſtle's ſpeaking of Sin as <hi>deſtroyed in Faith,</hi> Gal. 2. 18. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Verſes, the Apoſtle mentions an Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone, <hi>viz.</hi> that it tends to encourage Men in Sin, and ſo to make Chriſt the Miniſter of Sin: This Objection he rejects and refuſes with this, <hi>If I build again the Things that I deſtroyed, I make my ſelf a Tranſgreſſor.</hi> If Sin be deſtroyed by Faith, it muſt be by Repentance of Sin included in it; for we know that it is our Repentance of Sin, or the <hi>Metanoia,</hi> or turning of the Mind from Sin, that is our deſtroying our Sin.</p>
                     <p>That in juſtifying Faith, that directly reſpects <hi>Sin,</hi> or <hi>the Evil to be delivered from</hi> by the Mediator, is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>A Senſe of our own Sinfulneſs, and the Hatefulneſs of it, and an hearty Acknowlegement of its Deſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Concerning this, here deſcribed, three Things may be noted, 1. That 'tis the very ſame with that evangelical Repentance to which Remiſſion of Sins is promiſed in Scripture. 2.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>All of it is eſſential to evangelical Repentance, and is indeed the very Thing meant by that Repentance, to which Remiſſion of Sins is promiſed in the Goſpel.</hi> As to the former Part of the Deſcription, <hi>viz A Senſe of our own Sinfulneſs, and the Hatefulneſs of it, and an hearty

Acknowlegement of its Deſert of Wrath,</hi> none will deny it to be included in Repentance: But this don't compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the whole Eſſence of evangelical Repentance; but what follows does alſo properly and eſſentially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to its Nature, <hi>looking to the free Mercy of God in a Redeemer, for Deliverance from it, and the Puniſhment of it.</hi> That Repentance to which Remiſſion is promiſed not only always has this <hi>with it,</hi> but it is contained <hi>in</hi> it, as what is of the proper Nature and Eſſence of it: And Reſpect is ever had to <hi>this</hi> in the Nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whenever Remiſſion is promiſed to it; and it is eſpecially from Reſpect to this in the Nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that it has that Promiſe made to it: If this latter Part be miſſing, it fails of the Nature of that evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Repentance to which Remiſſion of Sins is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: If Repentance remains in Sorrow for Sin, and don't reach to a looking to the free Mercy of God in Chriſt for Pardon, 'tis not that which is the Condition of Pardon, neither ſhall Pardon be obtained by it Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Repentance is an Humiliation for Sin <hi>before God;</hi> but the Sinner never comes and humbles himſelf before God, in any other Repentance, but that which includes an hoping in his Mercy for Remiſſion: If his Sorrow be not accompanied with that, there will be no coming to God in it, but a flying further from him. There is ſome Worſhip of God in juſtifying Repentance; but that there is not in any other Repentance, but that which has a Senſe <hi>of,</hi> and Faith <hi>in</hi> the divine Mercy to forgive Sin. Pſalm 130 4. <hi>There is Forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayſt be feared.</hi> The Promiſe of Mercy to a true Penitent, in Prov. 28. 13. is expreſſed in theſe Terms, <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth, and forſaketh his Sins, ſhall have Mercy.</hi> But there is Faith in God's Mercy in that <hi>confeſſing.</hi> The Pſalmiſt in Pſalm 32 ſpeaking of the <hi>Bleſſedneſs of the Men whoſe Tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe Sin is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, to whom the Lord imputes not Sin,</hi> ſays, that <hi>while he kept Silence, his Bones waxed old, but then he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged his Sin unto God, his Iniquity he did not hide, he ſaid he would confeſs his Tranſgreſſion to the Lord, and then God forgave the Iniquity of his Sin.</hi> The Manner of
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004239_0116_100404952CA16E28"/>
Expreſſion plainly holds forth that then he began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage himſelf in the Mercy of God, when before his Bones waxed old, while he kept Silence; and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the 4 of <hi>Romans</hi> brings this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to confirm the Doctrine of Juſtification <hi>by Faith</hi> alone, that he had been inſiſting on. When Sin is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right confeſs'd to God, there is always Faith in that Act: That confeſſing of Sin that is join'd with Deſpair, ſuch as was in <hi>Judas,</hi> is not the Confeſſion to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made. In Acts 2. 38. the Direction that was given to thoſe that were pricked in their Heart, with a Senſe of the Guilt of Sin, was to <hi>repent &amp; be baptiſed in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſſion of their Sins.</hi> A being <hi>baptiſed in the Name of Chriſt</hi> for the Remiſſion of Sins, implied <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> for the Remiſſion of Sins. Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins, was typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of old by the Prieſts confeſſing the Sins of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple over the Scape-Goat, laying his Hands on him, <hi>Lev. 16. 21.</hi> denoting that 'tis that Repentance and Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sin only that obtains Remiſſion, that is made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Scape-Goat, over Chriſt the great Sacrifice, and with Dependance on him. Many other Things might be produced from the Scripture, that do in like manner confirm this Point, but theſe may be ſufficient.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>All the foremention'd Deſcription is of the Eſſence of juſtifying Faith, and not different from it, ſo far as it is converſant about Sin, or the Evil to be deliver'd from, by the Mediator.</hi> For it is doubtleſs of the Eſſence of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, to <hi>embrace Chriſt as a Saviour from Sin and its Puniſhment,</hi> and all that is contain'd in <hi>that Act</hi> is contain'd in <hi>the Nature of Faith it ſelf:</hi> But in <hi>the Act</hi> of embracing Chriſt as a Saviour from <hi>our Sin</hi> and its <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> is implied a Senſe of <hi>our Sinfulneſs,</hi> and a Hatred of <hi>our Sins,</hi> or a rejecting them with Abhorrence, and a Senſe of our Deſert of their <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> An <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing</hi> Chriſt as a Saviour from Sin implies the contrary Act towards Sin, <hi>viz. rejecting</hi> of Sin: If we fly to the Light to be delivered from Darkneſs, the ſame Act is contrary towards Darkneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> a rejecting of it.

we embrace Chriſt as a Saviour from Sin, in the ſame Proportion is the Abhorrence with which we reject Sin, in the ſame Act. Yea if we ſuppoſe there to be in the Nature of Faith as converſant about Sin, no more than the hearty embracing Chriſt as a Saviour from the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of Sin, this Act will imply in it the whole of the abovemention'd Deſcription. It implies <hi>a Senſe of our own Sinfulneſs:</hi> Certainly in the hearty embracing a Saviour from the Puniſhment of our Sinfulneſs, there is the Exerciſe of a <hi>Senſe of our Sinfulneſs,</hi> or that we be ſinful: We can't heartily embrace Chriſt as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour from the Puniſhment of that which we are not ſenſible we are guilty of. There is alſo in the ſame Act, <hi>a Senſe of our Deſert of the threaten'd Puniſhment:</hi> We can't heartily embrace Chriſt as a Saviour from that, which we be not ſenſible that we have deſerved: For if we are not ſenſible that we have deſerved the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhould not be ſenſible that we have any Need of a Saviour from it, or at leaſt, ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced but that the God that offers the Saviour, unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes him needful; and we can't heartily embrace ſuch an Offer. And further, there is implied in a hearty embracing Chriſt as a Saviour from Puniſhment, not only a Conviction of Conſcience, that we have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Puniſhment, ſuch as the Devils and Damned have; but there is a hearty Acknowlegement of it, with the Submiſſion of the Soul, ſo as with the Accord of the Heart, to own that God might be <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> in the Puniſhment. If the Heart riſes againſt the Act or Judgment of God, in holding us obliged to the Puniſhment, when he offers us his Son as a Saviour from the Puniſhment, we cannot with the Conſent of the Heart receive him in that Character: But if Perſons thus ſubmit to the Righteouſneſs of ſo dreadful a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Sin, this carries in it an Hatred of Sin.</p>

though it be true, that they ſtill bear the Name of Faith and Repentance, from thoſe general moral Virtues, that Repentance which is a Duty of natural Religion, and that Faith that was a Duty required under the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that are contained in this evangelical Act; which ſeverally appear, when this Act is conſider'd with Reſpect to its different Terms and Objects, that it is converſant about.</p>
                     <p>It may be objected here, that the Scripture ſometimes mentions Faith and Repentance together, as if they were entirely diſtinct Things; as in Mark 1. 15 <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye, and believe the Goſpel.</hi> But there is no need of underſtanding theſe as two diſtinct Conditions of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Words are exegetical one of another: It is to teach us after what Manner we muſt repent, <hi>viz.</hi> as believing the Goſpel, and after what Manner we muſt believe the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> as repenting: Theſe Words no more prove Faith and Repentance to be entirely diſtinct, than thoſe forementioned Matth. 21. 32 <hi>And ye when ye had ſeen it, repented not afterwards, that ye might believe him.</hi> Or thoſe 2 Tim. 2. 25. <hi>If peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God will give them Repentance, to the acknowleging of the Truth.</hi> The Apoſtle in <hi>Acts</hi> 19 4 ſeems to have Reference to theſe Words of <hi>John the Baptiſt, John baptiſed with the Baptiſm of Repentance, ſaying unto the People, that they ſhould believe,</hi> &amp;c. where the latter Words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we have already obſerved, are to explain how he preached Repentance.</p>
                     <p>Another Scripture, where Faith and Repentance are mentioned together, is Acts 20 21 <hi>Teſtifying both to the</hi> Jews, <hi>and alſo to the</hi> Greeks.

denominates it Repentance, has Reſpect to God as the Object, becauſe he is the Being offended by Sin, and to be reconciled, but that in this juſtifying Act, whence it is denominated Faith, does more eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Chriſt.—But let us interpret it how we will, the Objection of Faith being here ſo diſtinguiſhed from Repentance, is as much of an Objection againſt the Scheme of thoſe that oppoſe Juſtification by Faith alone, as againſt this Scheme; for they hold that the juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, includes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as has been already obſerved</p>

                     <p>And the Reaſon may be plain from what has been ſaid. We need not wonder that that in Faith, that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reſpects Sin, ſhould be eſpecially the Condition of Remiſſion of Sins; or that this Motion, or Exerciſe of the Soul, as it rejects and flies from <hi>Evil,</hi> and embraces Chriſt as a Saviour from it, ſhould eſpecially be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of being free from <hi>that Evil;</hi> in like manner as the ſame Principle or Motion, as it ſeeks <hi>good,</hi> and cleaves to Chriſt as the Procurer of <hi>that Good,</hi> ſhould be the Condition of obtaining that Good.

<pb n="114" facs="unknown:004239_0121_10040499F6E3D588"/>
Yea this rejecting Evil, is it ſelf an Act of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; 'tis accepting Freedom or Seperation from that Evil; and this Freedom or Seperation is the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit beſtowed in Remiſſion. No Wonder that that in Faith which immediately reſpects this Benefit, and is our Acceptance of this Benefit, ſhould be the ſpecial Condition of our having it: 'Tis ſo with Reſpect to all the Benefits that Chriſt has purchaſed. Truſting in God through Chriſt for ſuch a particular Benefit that we need, is the ſpecial Condition of obtaining that Benefit. When we need Protection from Enemies, the Exerciſe of Faith with Reſpect to ſuch a Benefit, or truſting in Chriſt for Protection from Enemies, is eſpecially the Way to obtain that particular Benefit, rather than truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt for ſomething elſe; and ſo of any other Benefit that might be mentioned. So Prayer, (which is the Expreſſion of Faith) for a particular Mercy needed, is eſpecially the Way to obtain that Mercy.<note n="*" place="bottom">If Repentance juſtifies, or be that by which we obtain Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin any other Way than this, it muſt be either as a Virtue or Righteouſneſs, or ſomething amiable in us; or elſe it muſt be, that our Sorrow and condemning what is paſt, is accepted as ſome Atonement for it; both which are equally contrary to the Goſpel-Doctrine of Juſtification by Chriſt.</note>

All will allow that in that Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of St. <hi>James, By Works a Man is juſtified, and not by Faith only,</hi> one of the Terms, either the Word <hi>Faith,</hi> or elſe the Word <hi>juſtify,</hi> is not to be underſtood pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in the ſame Senſe, as the ſame Terms when uſed by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> becauſe they ſuppoſe, as well as we, that it was not the Intent of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> to contradict St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in that Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone, that he had inſtructed the Churches in: But if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand both the Terms, as uſed by each Apoſtle, in <hi>preciſely</hi> the ſame Senſe, then what one aſſerts is a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,</hi> direct, and full Contradiction of the other, the one affirming and the other denying the very ſame Thing. So that all the Controverſy from this Text comes to this, <hi>viz.</hi> Which of theſe two Terms, ſhall be underſtood in a Diverſity from St. <hi>Paul. They</hi> ſay that it is the Word <hi>Faith;</hi> for they ſuppoſe, that when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſes the Word, and makes Faith that by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone we are juſtified, that then by it is underſtood a Compliance with, and Practice of Chriſtianity in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; ſo as to include all ſaving chriſtian Virtue and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> uſes the Word Faith in this Place, they ſuppoſe thereby is to be underſtood only an Aſſent of the Underſtanding to the Truth of Goſpel Doctrines, as diſtinguiſhed from good Works, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

We on the other hand ſuppoſe that the Word <hi>Juſtify</hi> is to be underſtood in a different Senſe from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> So that they are forced to go as far, in their Scheme, in altering the Senſe of Terms from <hi>Paul's</hi> Uſe of them, as we. But yet at the ſame Time, that they freely vary the Senſe of the <hi>former</hi> of them, <hi>viz. Faith,</hi> yet when we underſtand the <hi>latter, viz.

only to ſerve an Opinion? At this Rate a Man may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any Thing, tho' never ſo contrary to Scripture, and elude the cleareſt Text in the Bible!</hi> Tho' they don't ſhew us why we have not as good Warrant to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Word <hi>Juſtify</hi> in a Diverſity from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as they the Word <hi>Faith.</hi> If the Senſe of one of the Words muſt be varied on either Scheme, to make the Apoſtle <hi>James's</hi> Doctrine conſiſtent with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul's,</hi> and the varying the Senſe of one Term or the other, be all that ſtands in the Way of their agreeing with either Scheme, &amp; the varying the Senſe of the latter be in it ſelf <hi>as fair</hi> as of the former, then the Text lies <hi>as fair</hi> for one Scheme as the other, and can no more fairly be an Objection againſt our Scheme than theirs. And if ſo, what becomes of all this great Objection from this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>James?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. If there be no more Difficulty in varying the Senſe of one of theſe Terms than another, from any Thing in the Text it ſelf, ſo as to make the Words ſute with either Scheme, then certainly that is to be choſen, that is moſt agreable to the Current of Scripture, and other Places where the ſame Matter is more particularly and fully treated of; and therefore that we ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Word <hi>Juſtify,</hi> in this Paſſage of <hi>James,</hi> in a Senſe in ſome Reſpect diverſe from that in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſes it.

'Tis by Works that our Cauſe <hi>appears</hi> to be good; but by Faith our Cauſe not only <hi>appears</hi> to be good, but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes</hi> good; becauſe thereby we are united to Chriſt. That the Word <hi>Juſtify</hi> ſhould be ſometimes underſtood to ſignify the former of theſe, as well as the latter, is agreable to the Uſe of the Word in common Speech; as we ſay ſuch an one <hi>ſtood up to juſtify</hi> another, i. e. he endeavour'd to <hi>ſhew</hi> or <hi>manifeſt</hi> his Cauſe to be good. And 'tis certain that the Word is ſometimes uſed in this Senſe in Scripture, when ſpeaking of our being <hi>juſtified before God:</hi> as where it is ſaid we ſhall be juſtified by our Words; Matth. 12 37. <hi>For by thy Words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy Words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> It can't be meant that Men are accepted before God, <hi>on the Account</hi> of their <hi>Words;</hi> for God has told us nothing more plainly, than that 'tis the <hi>Heart</hi> that he looks at, and that when he acts as Judge towards Men, in order to juſtifying or condemning, <hi>he tries the Heart,</hi> Jer. 11.20. <hi>But, O Lord of Hoſts, that</hi> judgeſt righteouſly, <hi>that</hi> trieſt the Reins and the Heart, <hi>let me ſee</hi> thy Vengeance <hi>on them; for</hi> unto thee have I revealed my Cauſe. Pſalm 7. 8. 9. <hi>The Lord ſhall judge the People: judge me, O Lord, according to my Righteouſneſs, and according to mine Integrity that is in me. O let the Wickedneſs of the Wicked come to an End; but eſtablish the Juſt; for the righteous God</hi> trieth the Hearts and Reins. Verſe 11. <hi>God judgeth the Righteous.</hi> And many other Places to the like Purpoſe. And therefore Men can be juſtified by their Words, no otherwiſe than as <hi>Evidences</hi> or Manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:004239_0125_10042C2F45B77488"/>
of what is in the Heart. And 'tis thus that Chriſt ſpeaks of <hi>Words</hi> in this very Place, as is evident by the Context. Verſe 34, 35 <hi>Out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaketh. A good Man out of the good Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Heart,</hi> &amp;c. The Words, or Sounds themſelves, are neither Parts of Godlineſs, nor Evidences of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but as Signs of what is inward.</p>
                     <p>God himſelf when he acts towards Men as Judge, in Order to a <hi>declarative Judgment,</hi> makes uſe of Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo judges Men by their Works. And therefore at the Day of Judgment, God will judge Men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Works: For tho' God will ſtand in no Need of Evidence to inform him what is right, yet 'tis to be conſidered that he will then ſit in Judgment; not as earthly Judges do, to <hi>find out</hi> what is right in a Cauſe, but to <hi>declare</hi> and <hi>manifeſt</hi> what is right; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Day is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>the Day of the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2 5.</p>
                     <p>To be juſtified is to be approved and accepted: But a Man may be ſaid to be approved and accepted in two Reſpects; the one is to be approved <hi>really,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be approved and accepted <hi>declaratively.</hi> Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is twofold; 'tis either the Acceptance and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Judge it ſelf, or the Manifeſtation of that Approbation, by a Sentence or Judgment declared by the Judge, either to our own Conſciences, or to the World. If Juſtification be underſtood in the former Senſe, for the Approbation it ſelf, that is <hi>only that by which we become fit to be approved:</hi> But if it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the latter Senſe, for the Manifeſtation of this Approbation, it is <hi>by whatever is a proper Evidence of that Fitneſs.</hi> In the former, <hi>only Faith is concerned;</hi> becauſe 'tis by that only <hi>in us,</hi> that we become fit to be accepted and approved: In the latter, <hi>whatever is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

To <hi>juſtify</hi> has always, in common Speech, ſignified indifferently, either ſimply <hi>Approbation,</hi> or <hi>teſtifying that Approbation;</hi> ſometimes one, and ſometimes the other: And that becauſe they are both the ſame, only as one is <hi>outwardly,</hi> what the other is <hi>inwardly.</hi> So we, and it may be all Nations, are wont to give the ſame Names to two Things, when one is only declarative of the other.

Works is dead alſo.</hi> 'Tis much more rational and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, to underſtand him as ſpeaking of Works as the proper <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi> of the Reality, <hi>Life</hi> and Goodneſs of Faith. Not that the very Works or Actions done are properly the Life of Faith, as the Spirit in the Body; but 'tis the <hi>active, working Nature</hi> of Faith, of which the Actions or Works done are the Signs, that is it ſelf the Life and Spirit of Faith. The Sign of a Thing is often in Scripture Language ſaid to be that Thing. As it is in that Compariſon by which the Apoſtle illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates it. 'Tis not the Actions themſelves of a Body, that is properly the Life or Spirit of the Body; but 'tis the <hi>active Nature,</hi> of which thoſe Actions or Motions are the Signs, that are the Life of the Body. That which makes Men call any Thing alive, is that they obſerve that it has an active operative Nature in it; which they obſerve no otherwiſe than by the Actions or Motions that are the Signs of it. 'Tis plainly the Apoſtle's Aim to prove that Works are neceſſary from that, That if Faith hath not Works, 'tis a <hi>Sign</hi> that 'tis not a good Sort of Faith; which would not have been to his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if it was his Deſign to ſhew that it is not by Faith alone, <hi>tho' of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

'Tis evident by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Reaſoning, that the Neceſſity of Works that he ſpeaks of, is not as having a <hi>parallel</hi> Concern in our Salvation with Faith; but he ſpeaks of Works only as <hi>related to Faith,</hi> and <hi>expreſſive of it;</hi> which after all leaves Faith the <hi>alone fundamental</hi> Condition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Thing elſe having a parallel Concern with it in this Affair, and other Things Conditions, only as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Expreſſions, and Evidences of it.</p>

Expreſſion of that Approbation, what has been already ſaid concerning the Manner in which Acts of evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Obedience are concerned in the Affair of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, affords a very eaſy, clear, and full Anſwer: For if we take Works as Acts or Expreſſions of Faith, they are not excluded; ſo a Man is not juſtified by Faith only, but alſo by Works; i. e. he is not juſtified only by Faith as a Principle in the Heart, or in its firſt and more immanent Acts, but alſo by the effective Acts of it in Life, which are the Expreſſions of the Life of Faith, as the Operations and Actions of the Body are of the Life of that; agreable to <hi>Verſe 26.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What has been ſaid in Anſwer to theſe Objections, may alſo, I hope, abundantly ſerve for an Anſwer to that Objection, that is often made againſt this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That it encourages Licentiouſneſs in Life. For, from what has been ſaid, we may ſee, that the Scripture Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Juſtification by Faith alone, without any Manner of Goodneſs or Excellency of ours, does in no wiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, either the Neceſſity, or Benefit of a ſincere evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical univerſal Obedience: In that Man's Salvation is not only indiſſolubly connected with it, and Damnation with the Want of it, in thoſe that have Opportunity for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And beſides all this, the Degree of our Happineſs to all Eternity is ſuſpended on, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Degree of this. So that this Goſpel.

I come now to the</p>
                     <p>V. and laſt Thing propoſed, which is to conſider the <hi>Importance of this Doctrine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know there are many that make as tho' this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy was of no great Importance; that it is chiefly a Matter of nice Speculation, depending on certain ſubtil Diſtinctions, which many that make uſe of them don't underſtand themſelves; and that the Difference is not of ſuch Conſequence, as to be worth the being zealous about; and that more Hurt is done by raiſing Diſputes about it, than good.</p>
                     <p>Indeed I am far from thinking that it is of abſolute Neceſſity that Perſons ſhould underſtand, and be agreed upon, all the Diſtinctions needful particularly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and defend this Doctrine, againſt all Cavils and Objections; (tho' all Chriſtians ſhould ſtrive after an Increaſe of Knowlege; and none ſhould content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without ſome clear and diſtinct Underſtanding in this Point:) But that we ſhould believe in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, according to the clear and abundant Revelations of God's Word, that 'tis none of our own Excellency, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or Righteouſneſs, that is the Ground of our being received from a State of Condemnation into a State of Acceptance in God's Sight, but only Jeſus Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs, and Worthineſs, received by Faith. This I think to be of great Importance, at leaſt in Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to our ſelves; and that for the following Reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Scripture treats of this Doctrine, as a Doctrine of very great Importance. That <hi>there is</hi> a certain Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Juſtification by Faith, in Oppoſition to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Works of the Law, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſiſts upon as of the greateſt Importance, none will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; becauſe there is nothing in the Bible more apparent. The Apoſtle under the infallible Conduct of the Spirit of God, thought it worth his moſt ſtrenuous and <hi>zealous</hi> diſputing about and defending. He ſpeaks of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrine as fatal and ruinous to the Souls of Men, in the latter End of the ninth Chapter of <hi>Romans,</hi> and beginning of the tenth. He ſpeaks of it as <hi>ſubverſive of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and calls it <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:004239_0131_1004049BA5DD6BA0"/>
ſays concerning it, if any one, <hi>though an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven preach it, let him be accurſed.</hi> Gal 1. 6, 7, 8, 9. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the following Part of the Epiſtle. Certainly we muſt allow the Apoſtles to be good Judges of the Importance and Tendency of Doctrines; at leaſt the Holy Ghoſt in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And doubtleſs we are ſafe, and in no Danger of Harſhneſs and Cenſoriouſneſs, if we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow him, and keep cloſe to his expreſs Teachings, in what we believe and ſay of the hurtful and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tendency of any Error.—Why are we to blame, or to be cried out of, for ſaying what the Bible has taught us to ſay, or for believing what the Holy Ghoſt has taught us to that End that we might believe it?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The adverſe Scheme lays another Foundation of Man's Salvation than God hath laid. I don't now ſpeak of that ineffectual <hi>Redemption</hi> that they ſuppoſe to be univerſal, and what all Mankind are equally the Subjects of; but, I ſay, it lays intirely another Foundation of Man's <hi>actual, diſcriminating</hi> Salvation, or that Salvation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in true Chriſtians differ from wicked Men. We ſuppoſe the Foundation of this to be Chriſt's Worthineſs and Righteouſneſs: On the contrary, that Scheme ſuppoſes it to be Men's own Virtue; even ſo, that this is the Ground of a ſaving Intereſt in Chriſt it ſelf. It takes away Chriſt out of the Place of the bottom Stone, and puts in Men's own Virtue in the Room of him: So that Chriſt himſelf in the Affair of diſtinguiſhing actual Salvation, is <hi>laid upon</hi> this Foundation. And the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation being ſo different, I leave it to every one to judge whether the Difference between the two Schemes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only in <hi>Punctilios</hi> of ſmall Conſequence. The Foundations being contrary makes the whole Scheme exceeding Diverſe and Oppoſite; the one is a <hi>Goſpel</hi> Scheme, the other a <hi>legal</hi> one.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. 'Tis in this Doctrine, that the moſt eſſential Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence lies, between the Convenant of Grace, and the firſt Covenant. The adverſe Scheme of Juſtification ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that we are juſtified by our Works, in the very ſame Senſe wherein Man was to have been juſtified by his Works under the firſt Covenant. By that Covenant
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:004239_0132_10042C48D75FCB90"/>
our firſt Parents were not to have had eternal Life given them, for any <hi>proper Merit</hi> in their Obedience; becauſe their perfect Obedience was a Debt that they owed God: Nor was it to be beſtowed for any <hi>Proportion</hi> between the Dignity of their Obedience, and the Value of the Reward; but only it was to be beſtowed from a Regard to a moral Fitneſs in the Virtue of their Obedience, to the Reward of God's Favour; and a Title to eternal Life was to be given them, as a Teſtimony of God's Pleaſedneſs with their Works, or his Regard to the inherent Beauty of their Virtue. And ſo it is the very ſame Way that thoſe in the adverſe Scheme ſuppoſe that we are received into God's ſpecial Favour now, and to thoſe ſaving Benefits that are the Teſtimonies of it. I am ſenſible the Divines of that Side, intirely diſclaim the popiſh Doctrine of Merit; and are free to ſpeak of our utter Unworthineſs, and the great Imperfection of all our Services: But after all, 'tis our Virtue as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as it is, that recommends Men to God, by which good Men come to have a ſaving Intereſt in Chriſt, and God's Favour, rather than others; and theſe Things are beſtowed in Teſtimony of God's Reſpect to their Goodneſs. So that whether they will allow the Term <hi>Merit</hi> or no, yet they hold that we are accepted by our own <hi>Merit,</hi> in the ſame Senſe, tho' not in the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as under the firſt Covenant.</p>
                     <p>But the great and moſt diſtinguiſhing Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that Covenant, and the Covenant of Grace is, that by the Covenant of Grace we are not thus juſtified by our own Works, but only by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt. 'Tis on this Account chiefly that the new Covenant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Name of a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> as is evident by Rom 4 16 <hi>Therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace.</hi> And, Chap. 3 20, 24 <hi>Therefore by the Deeds of the Law there ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified in his Sight;—Being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And, Chap. 11. 6. <hi>And if by Grace, then it is no more of Works, otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace: But if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace, otherwiſe Work is no more Work.</hi> Gal. 5 4 <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:004239_0133_10042C4C01A63208"/>
of you are juſtified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle when he in the ſame Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſpeaks of the Doctrine of Juſtification by Works as another Goſpel, he adds, <hi>which is not another,</hi> Chap 1. Verſe 6, 7. 'Tis <hi>no Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel at all;</hi> 'tis Law: 'Tis no Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> but of <hi>Works:</hi> 'Tis not an <hi>evangelical,</hi> but a <hi>legal</hi> Doctrine. Certainly that Doctrine wherein conſiſts the greateſt and moſt eſſential Difference between the Covenant of Grace and the firſt Covenant, muſt be a Doctrine of great Importance. That Doctrine of the Goſpel by which above all others it is worthy of the Name of <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> is doubtleſs a very important Doctrine <hi>of the Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 This is the main Thing that fallen Men ſtood in Need of divine Revelation for, to teach us how we that have ſinn'd, may come to be again accepted of God; or which is the ſame Thing, <hi>How the Sinner may be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> Something beyond the Light of Nature is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, chiefly on this Account. Meer natural Reaſon afforded no Means by which we could come to the Knowledge of this, it depending on the ſovereign Pleaſure of the Being that we had offended by Sin. This ſeems to be the great Drift of that Revelation that God has given, &amp; of all thoſe Myſteries it reveals, all thoſe great Doctrines that are peculiarly Doctrines of Revelation, and above the Light of Nature. It ſeems to have been very much on this Account that it was requiſite that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> it ſelf ſhould be revealed to us; that by a Diſcovery of the Concern of the ſeveral divine Perſons, in the great Affair of our Salvation, we might the better underſtand and ſee how all our Dependence in this Affair is on God, and our Sufficiency all in him, and not in our ſelves; that he is all in all in this Buſineſs, agreable to that in 1 Cor. 1. 29, 30, 31. <hi>That no Fleſh ſhould glory in his Preſence: But of him, are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God, is made unto us, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. &amp; Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption.

Will it not betray a fooliſh exalting Opinion of our ſelves, and a mean one of God, to have a Thought of offering any thing of ours, to recommend us, to the Favour of being brought from wallowing like filthy Swine in the Mire of our Sins, and from the Enmity and Miſery of Devils in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hell, to the State of God's dear Children, in the everlaſting Arms of his Love, in heavenly Glory; or to imagine that that is the Conſtitution of God, that we ſhould bring our filthy Rags, and offer them to him as the Price of this?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The oppoſite Scheme does moſt directly tend to lead Men to truſt in their own Righteouſneſs for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which is a Thing fatal to the Soul. This is what Men are of themſelves exceeding prone to do, (and that tho' they are never ſo much taught the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) through the exceeding partial and high Thoughts they have of themſelves, and their exceeding Dulneſs of apprehending any ſuch Myſtery, as our being accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Righteouſneſs of another. But this Scheme does <hi>directly teach Men</hi> to truſt in their own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Juſtification; in that it teaches them that this
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:004239_0136_10042C5E8237EAB8"/>
is indeed what they muſt be juſtified by, being the Way of Juſtification that God himſelf has appointed So that if a Man had naturally no Diſpoſition to truſt in his own Righteouſneſs, yet if he embraced this Scheme, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſiſtent with it, it would lead him to it. But that truſting in our own Righteouſneſs, is a Thing fatal to the Soul, is what the Scripture plainly teaches us: It tells us that it will cauſe that Chriſt ſhall profit us nothing, and be of no Effect to us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4. For tho' the Apoſtle ſpeaks there particularly of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet (I have ſhown already, that) it is not meerly being circumciſed, but truſting in Circumciſion as a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that the Apoſtle has Reſpect to. He could not mean that meerly being circumciſed would render Chriſt of no Profit or Effect to a Perſon; for we read that he himſelf for certain Reaſons, took <hi>Timothy</hi> and circumciſed him, <hi>Acts</hi> 16 3. And the ſame is evident by the Context, and by the Reſt of the Epiſtle. And the Apoſtle ſpeaks of truſting in their own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as fatal to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 9 31, 32. <hi>But Iſrael, which followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs: Wherefore? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſought it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law; for they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling Stone.</hi> Together with Chap. 10. Verſe 3. <hi>For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the Righteouſneſs of God</hi> And this is ſpoken of as fatal to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> in the Parable of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee</hi> and the <hi>Publican,</hi> that Chriſt ſpake to them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for <hi>truſting in themſelves, that they were Righteous.</hi> The Deſign of the Parable is to ſhew them that the very Publicans ſhall be juſtified, <hi>rather than they;</hi> as appears by the Reflection Chriſt makes upon it, Luke 18. 14 <hi>I tell you this Man went down to his Houſe juſtified, rather than the other</hi> That is, this and not the other.—The fatal Tendency of it might alſo be proved from its Inconſiſtence with the Nature of juſtifying Faith, and alſo its Inconſiſtence with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Humiliation that the Scripture often ſpeaks
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:004239_0137_10042C630E818BF8"/>

That is the Account that we have of his Preaching, by the Evangeliſts, <hi>Repent,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand: Since that Time,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>the Kingdom of God is preached.

Harbinger of the Goſpel-Day; much as the Morning-Star is the Forerunner of the Sun. He had the moſt honourable Office of any of the Prophets; when as the other Prophets foretold Chriſt to come, he revealed him as already come, &amp; had the Honour to be that Servant that ſhould come immediately before him &amp; actually introduce him, &amp; even to be the Inſtrument concern'd in his ſolemn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration, as he was in Baptizing him.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may obſerve wherein his Succeſs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> in that ſince he began his Miniſtry, <hi>every Man preſſed</hi> into that Kingdom of God that he preached. The Greatneſs of his Succeſs appeared in two Things;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the Generalneſs of it, with Regard to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or the Perſons in whom the Succeſs appeared; <hi>every Man:</hi> Here is a Term of Univerſality; but 'tis not to be taken as univerſal with Regard to Individuals, but Kinds; as ſuch univerſal Terms are often uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. When <hi>John</hi> preached there was an extraordinary pouring out of the Spirit of God, that attended his preaching; and an uncommon Awakening, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for Salvation, appeared on the Minds of all ſorts of Perſons; and even in the moſt unlikely Perſons, and thoſe from whom ſuch a Thing might leaſt be expected; as the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were exceeding proud, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, and conceited of their own Wiſdom and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and looked on themſelves fit to be Teachers of others, and uſed to ſcorn to be taught; and the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees,</hi> who were a kind of Infidels, that denied any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Angel, or Spirit, or any future State: So that <hi>John</hi> himſelf ſeems to be ſurprized to ſee them come to him, under ſuch Concern for their Salvation; as in Mat. 3. 7. <hi>But when he ſaw many of the Phariſees and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees come to his Baptiſm, he ſaid unto them, O Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers, Who hath warned you to flee from the
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:004239_0141_10042C7BA5541F30"/>
Wrath to come?</hi> And beſides theſe, the <hi>Publicans</hi> who were ſome of the moſt infamous ſort of Men, came to him, inquiring what they ſhould do to be ſaved. And the <hi>Soldiers,</hi> that were doubtleſs a very profane, looſe, and profligate ſort of Perſons; they made the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry Luke 3 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 14. <hi>Then came alſo Publicans to be baptiſed, and ſaid unto him, Maſter, What ſhall we do? And the Soldiers likewiſe demanded of him, ſaying, And what ſhall we do?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. His Succeſs appear'd in the Manner in which his Hearers ſought the Kingdom of God, they <hi>preſſed into it:</hi> It is elſewhere ſet forth by their being <hi>violent</hi> for the Kingdom of Heaven, and <hi>taking it by Force.</hi> Matth. 11. 12 <hi>From the Days of</hi> John the Baptiſt <hi>until now, the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers Violence, and the Violent take it by Force.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The DOCTRINE that I obſerve from the Words is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>IT concerns every one that would obtain the Kingdom of God, to be preſſing into it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In diſcourſing on this Subject, I would</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Shew what is that Way of ſeeking Salvation that ſeems to be pointed forth, in the Expreſſion of <hi>preſſing into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Give the Reaſons why it concerns every one that would <hi>obtain</hi> the Kingdom of God, to ſeek it in this Way.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>then</hi> make Application.</p>
                     <p>I. I would ſhew what Manner of ſeeking Salvation ſeems to be denoted by preſſing into the Kingdom of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This Expreſſion denotes <hi>Strength of Deſire.</hi> Men in general, that live under the Light of the Goſpel, and be not Atheiſts, do deſire the Kingdom of God; that is, they deſire to go to Heaven rather than to Hell; but moſt of them are not much concerned about it; but on
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:004239_0142_10042C8686AB4680"/>
the contrary live a ſecure and careleſs Life. And there are thoſe that are many Degrees above theſe, that are under ſome Degrees of the Awakenings of God's Spirit, that yet are not <hi>preſſing into the Kingdom of God.</hi> But they that may be ſaid to be truly ſo have <hi>ſtrong Deſires</hi> to get out of a natural Condition, and to get an Intereſt in Chriſt: They have ſuch a Conviction of the Miſery of their <hi>preſent</hi> State, and of the extreme Neceſſity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a <hi>better,</hi> that their Minds are as it were poſſeſſed <hi>with,</hi> and wrapt up <hi>in</hi> Concern about it: To obtain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is deſired by them above all Things in the World: This Concern is ſo great that it very much ſhuts out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Concerns: They uſed before to have the Stream of their Deſires after other Things, or it may be had their Concern divided between this and them; but when they come to anſwer the Expreſſion in the Text, of <hi>preſſing into the Kingdom of God,</hi> this Concern prevails<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> above all others; it lays other Things low, and does in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner engroſs the Care of the Mind.—This ſeeking eternal Life ſhould not only be <hi>one</hi> Concern that our Souls are taken up about, <hi>with other Things;</hi> but Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be ſought as the <hi>one Thing</hi> needful, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. And as the <hi>one Thing</hi> that is <hi>deſired, Pſalm</hi> 27.4.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Preſſing into the Kingdom of Heaven denotes <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and Firmneſs of Reſolution.</hi> There ſhould be Strength of <hi>Reſolution,</hi> accompanying Strength of <hi>Deſire,</hi> as it was in the Pſalmiſt in the Place juſt now refer'd to; <hi>One Thing have I deſired, and that will I ſeek after.</hi> In order to a thorough Engagedneſs of the Mind in this Affair, both theſe muſt meet together; beſides Deſires after Salvation, there ſhould be an earneſt Reſolution in Perſons to purſue this Good as much as lies in their Power; to do all that in the Uſe of their utmoſt Strength they are able to do, in an Attendance on every Duty, and reſiſting and militating againſt all Manner of Sin, and to continue in ſuch a Purſuit.</p>
                     <p>There are two Things needful in a Perſon in order to theſe ſtrong Reſolutions in him: there muſt be a Senſe of the great Importance &amp; <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the Mercy ſought, and their muſt alſo be a Senſe of <hi>Opportunity</hi> to obtain
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:004239_0143_10042C8B103C3448"/>
it, or the Encouragement there is to ſeek it. The Strength of Reſolution depends on the Senſe which God gives the Heart of theſe Things. Perſons without ſuch a Senſe may ſeem to themſelves to take up Reſolutions; they may as it were force a Promiſe to themſelves, and ſay with in themſelves, <hi>I will ſeek as long as I live, I will not give out till I obtain,</hi> when they do but deceive themſelves, their Hearts are not in it; neither do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed take up any ſuch Reſolution as they ſeem to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do; 'tis the Reſolution of the Mouth more than of the Heart; their Hearts ben'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Firmneſs of Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies in the Fulneſs of the Diſpoſition of the Heart to do what is reſolved to be done. Thoſe that are <hi>preſſing into the Kingdom of God</hi> have a Diſpoſition of Heart to do every Thing that is required, and that lies in their Power to do, and to continue in it: They have not only Earneſtneſs, but Steadineſs of Reſolution: They don't ſeek with a wavering unſteady Heart, by Turns, or Fits, being off and on; but 'tis the conſtant Bent of the Soul, if poſſible, to obtain the Kingdom of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By preſſing into the Kingdom of God is ſignified <hi>Greatneſs of Endeavour.</hi> 'Tis expreſſed in Eccleſ. 9. 10. by <hi>doing what our Hand finds to do with our Might.</hi> And this is the natural and neceſſary Conſequence of the two foremention'd Things; where there is <hi>Strength of Deſire,</hi> and <hi>Firmneſs of Reſolution,</hi> there will be anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable <hi>Endeavours:</hi> Perſons thus engaged in their Hearts will <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> and will be <hi>violent for Heaven;</hi> their Practice will be agreable to the Counſel of the wiſe Man, in Prov. 2. at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>My Son, if thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

own Way: Their Preſſure is not forwards: Inſtead of getting along, they do but looſe their Time, and worſe than meerly looſe it; inſtead of fighting with the Giants that ſtand in the Way to keep them out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they ſpend away their Time and Strength in conflicting with Shadows, that appear by the Way ſide.</p>
                     <p>Hence we are not to judge of the Hopefulneſs of the Way that Perſons are in, or of the Probability of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in ſeeking Salvation, only by the Greatneſs of the Concern and Diſtreſs that they are in; for many Perſons have needleſs Diſtreſſes that they had much better be without. 'Tis thus very often with Perſons that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver run with the Diſtemper of Melancholly; whence the Adverſary of Souls is won't to take great Advantage. But then are Perſons in the moſt likely Way to obtain the Kingdom of Heaven, when the Intent of their Minds, and the Engagedneſs of their Spirits, is about their proper Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The Apoſtle tells us, 1 Cor. 9 26. that he did <hi>not fight as thoſe that beat the Air.</hi> Our Time is ſhort enough; we had not need to ſpend it in that which is nothing to the Purpoſe. There are real Difficulties and Enemies enough for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to encounter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to employ all their Strength; they had not need to waſte it in fighting with any Phantoms.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. By preſſing into the Kingdom of God is denoted <hi>a breaking through Oppoſition and Difficulties.</hi> There is in the Expreſſion a plain Intimation of Difficulty. If there were no Oppoſition, but the Way was all clear and open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there would be no Need of preſſing to get along. They therefore that are preſſing into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, go on with ſuch Engagedneſs, that they break through the Difficulties that are in their Way: They are ſo ſet for Salvation that thoſe Things by which others are diſcouraged, and ſtop'd, and turn'd back, don't ſtop <hi>them,</hi> but they preſs through them. Perſons ought to be ſo reſolved for Heaven, that if by any Means they can uſe they <hi>can</hi> obtain, they <hi>will</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.

Thus the Apoſtle, Philip 3. 11. <hi>If by any Means I might obtain the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> He tells us there in the Context, what Difficulties he broke through, that <hi>he ſuffered the Loſs of all Things,</hi> and was willingly <hi>made conformable</hi> even to Chriſt's <hi>Death,</hi> tho' that was attended with ſuch extreme Torment and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy.</p>

                     <p>I come now,</p>
                     <p>II. To ſhew <hi>way</hi> the Kingdom of Heaven ſhould be ſought in this Manner.</p>
                     <p>It ſhould be thus ſought</p>
                     <p n="1">1. On Account of the extreme <hi>Neceſſity</hi> we are in of getting into the Kingdom of Heaven. We are in a <hi>Periſhing Neceſſity</hi> of it: Without it we are utterly and eternally loſt. Out of the Kingdom of God is no Safety; there is no other hiding Place; this is the only City of Refuge, in which we can be ſecure from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger that purſues all the Ungodly. The Vengeance of God will purſue, overtake, and eternally deſtroy, them that are not in this Kingdom. All that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Incloſure will be ſwallowed up in an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiery Deluge of Wrath: They may ſtand at the Door and knock, and cry Lord, Lord, open to us, in vain; they will be thruſt back; and God will have no Mercy on them; they ſhall be eternally left of him; his fearful Vengeance will ſeize them; the Devils will lay hold on them; and all Evil will come upon them; and there will be none to pity or help; their Caſe will be utterly deſperate, and infinitely doleful: It will be a gone Caſe with them; all Offers of Mercy, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of divine Goodneſs will be finally withdrawn,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:004239_0148_10042CAD49D0C1A0"/>
and all Hope will be loſt: God will have no Kind of Regard to their Well-Being; will take no Care of them to ſave them from any Enemy, or any Evil; but himſelf will be their dreadful Enemy, and will execute Wrath with Fury, and will take Vengeance in an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly dreadful Manner. Such as ſhall be in this Caſe will be loſt and undone indeed! They will be funk down into Perdition, infinitely below all that we can think: For who knows the Power of God's Anger? And who knows the Miſery of that poor Worm, on whom that Anger is executed without Mercy?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. On Account of the <hi>Shortneſs</hi> and <hi>Uncertainty of the Opportunity</hi> for getting into this Kingdom. When a few Days are paſt, all our Opportunity for it will be gone. Our Day is limited; God has ſet our Bounds, and we know not where. While Perſons are out of this Kingdom, they are in Danger every Hour of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with Wrath. We know not how ſoon we ſhall get paſt that Line, beyond which there is no Work, Device, Knowlege, nor Wiſdom; and therefore we ſhould do what we have to do with our Might. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9 10.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. On Account of the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of getting into the Kingdom of God. There are innumerable Difficulties in the Way; ſuch as few conquer; moſt of them that try have not Reſolution, Courage, Earneſtneſs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy enough; but they fail, give out, and periſh. The Difficulties are too many, and too great for them that don't violently preſs forward, to grapple with; they never get along, but ſtick by the Way, or are turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and turned back, and ruin'd. Matth. 7. 14. <hi>Strait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Luke 13. 24 <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 The <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of obtaining. Tho' it be a Thing attended with ſo much Difficulty, yet 'tis not a Thing impoſſible. Acts 8 22. <hi>If perhaps the Thought of thine Heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 25. <hi>If peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God will give them Repentance, to the acknowleging
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:004239_0149_10042CB54AF870F0"/>
of the Truth.</hi> However ſinful a Perſon is, and whatever his Circumſtances are, there is notwithſtanding a Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his Salvation; he himſelf is capable of it; and God is able to accompliſh it, and has Mercy ſufficient for it; and there is ſufficient Proviſion made through Chriſt, that God may do it conſiſtent with the Honour of his Majeſty, Juſtice, and Truth: So that there is no Want either of Sufficiency in God, or Capacity in the Sinner, in order to this: The greateſt and vileſt, moſt blind, dead, hard hearted Sinner living, is a Subject ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſaving Light and Grace. Seeing therefore there is ſuch Neceſſity of obtaining the Kingdom of God, and ſo ſhort a Time, and ſuch Difficulty, and yet ſuch a Poſſibility, it may well induce us to preſs into it. <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. 8, 9.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. 'Tis meet that the Kingdom of Heaven ſhould be thus ſought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe of the great <hi>Excellency</hi> of it. We are willing to ſeek earthly Things, of trifling Value, with great Diligence, and through much Difficulty; it therefore certainly becomes us to ſeek that with great Earneſtneſs. which is of infinitely greater Worth and Excellence: And how well may God expect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of us, that we ſhould ſeek it in ſuch a Manner, in order to our obtaining it!</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Such a Manner of ſeeking is needful to <hi>prepare</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the Kingdom of God. Such Earneſtneſs and Thoroughneſs of Endeavours, is the ordinary Means that God makes Uſe of, to bring Perſons to an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with themſelves, to a Sight of their own Hearts, to a Senſe of their own Helpleſneſs, and to a Deſpair in their own Strength and Righteouſneſs. And ſuch Engagedneſs and Conſtancy in ſeeking the Kingdom of Heaven prepare the Soul to receive it the more joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and thankfully, and the more highly to prize and value it when obtained. So that 'tis in Mercy to us, as well as for the Glory of his own Name, that God has appointed ſuch earneſt Seeking, to be the Way in which he will beſtow the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

                        <p>The USE I would make of this Doctrine, is of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi> to all Chriſtleſs Perſons to preſs into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Some of you are inquiring what you ſhall do. You ſeem to deſire to know what is the Way wherein Salvation is to be ſought, and how you may be likely to obtain it: You have now heard the Way that the holy Word of God directs to.—Some are ſeeking, but it can't be ſaid of them that they are <hi>preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> into the Kingdom of Heaven. There are many that in Time paſt have ſought Salvation, but not in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſo they never obtain'd, but are now gone to Hell: Some of them ſought it Year after Year, but fail'd of it, and periſhed at laſt: They were overtaken with divine Wrath, and are now ſuffering the fearful Miſery of Damnation, and have no Reſt Day nor Night, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more Opportunity to ſeek, but muſt ſuffer and be miſerable throughout the never ending Ages of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Be exhorted therefore not to ſeek Salvation as they did, but let the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffer Violence from you.</p>

                        <p>Object. 1. <hi>Some may be ready to ſay, We can't do this of our ſelves, that Strength of Deſire, and Firmneſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that have been ſpoken of, is out of our Reach: If I endeavour to reſolve and to ſeek with Engagedneſs of Spirit, I find I fail: my Thoughts are preſently off from the Buſineſs, and I feel my ſelf dull, and my Engagedneſs relax'd in Spite of all I can do.</hi>

'Tis true, Perſons never will be thoroughly engaged in this Buſineſs unleſs it be by God's Influence; but God influences Perſons by Means:
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:004239_0151_10042CC3CA613618"/>
Perſons are not ſtirr'd up to a thorough Earneſtnes;s without ſome Conſiderations that move them to it: And if Perſons ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If we ſee Perſons ſlack, and unreſolved, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> ſteady, it is becauſe they don't enough conſider theſe Things.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Though ſtrong Deſires and Reſolutions of Mind be not in your Power, yet Painfulneſs of Endeavours is in your Power. 'Tis in your Power to take Pains in the Uſe of Means, yea very great Pains. You can be very painful and diligent in watching your own Heart, and ſtriving againſt Sin; though there is all Manner of Corruption in the Heart, that is continually ready to work, yet you can very laboriouſly watch and ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Corruptions; and 'tis in your Power, with great Diligence to attend the Matter of your Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards your Neighbour 'Tis in your Power to attend all Ordinances, and all publick and private Duties of Religion, and to do it with your Might. It would be a Contradiction to ſuppoſe that a Man can't do theſe Things with <hi>all the Might</hi> he has, tho' he can't do them with <hi>more might</hi> than he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. The Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Deadneſs of the Heart, and Slothfulneſs of Diſpoſition, don't hinder Men's being <hi>able</hi> to take Pains; tho' it hinders their being willing: That is one Thing wherein your Laboriouſneſs may appear, even ſtriving againſt your own Dulneſs. That Men have a dead and ſluggiſh Heart, don't argue that they be not able to take Pains; it is ſo far from that, that it gives Occaſion for Pains: It is one of the Difficulties in the Way of Duty, that Perſons have to ſtrive with, and that gives Occaſion for Struggling and Labour. If there were no Difficulties attended ſeeking Salvation there would be no Occaſion for Striving; a Man would have
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:004239_0152_10042CCFEA003668"/>
nothing to ſtrive about. There is indeed a great Deal of Difficulty attending all Duties required of thoſe that would obtain Heaven. 'Tis an exceeding difficult Thing for them to keep their Thoughts; 'tis a difficult Thing ſeriouſly, or to any good Purpoſe, to conſider of Matters of the greateſt Importance; 'tis a difficult Thing to hear, or read, or pray attentively: But it don't argue that a Man can't ſtrive in theſe Things becauſe they are difficult; nay, he could not ſtrive in them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

He that has an Heart earneſtly <hi>engaged,</hi> will <hi>take Pains;</hi> and he that is diligent and <hi>painful</hi> in all Duty, probably won't be <hi>ſo</hi> long, before he finds the <hi>Senſibleneſs</hi> of his Heart, and <hi>Earneſtneſs</hi> of his Spirit greatly increaſed.</p>
                        <p>Object. 2. <hi>Some may object that if they are earneſt, and take a great Deal of Pains, they ſhall be in Danger of truſting to what they do; they are afraid of doing their Duty for Fear of making a Righteouſneſs of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ</hi> There is ordinarily no Kind of Seekers that truſt ſo much to what they do, as ſlack and dull Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Though all that are ſeeking Salvation, that have never been the Subjects of a thorough Humiliation, do truſt in their own Righteouſneſs; yet ſome do it much more fully than others. Some tho' they truſt in their own Righteouſneſs, yet be not quiet in it. And thoſe that are moſt diſturbed <hi>in</hi> their Self-Confidence, and are therefore in the likelieſt Way to be wholly brought off from it, are not thoſe that go on in a remiſs Way of Seeking, but thoſe that are moſt earneſt and thoroughly engaged; partly becauſe in ſuch a Way Conſcience i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

theſe. And, <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe in this Way Perſons gain much more Knowlege of themſelves, and Acquaintance with their own Hearts, than in a negligent ſlighty Way of Seeking; for they have a great Deal <hi>more Experience</hi> of themſelves. 'Tis Experience <hi>of our ſelves,</hi> and finding what we are, that God commonly makes Uſe of as the Means of bringing us off from all Dependence <hi>on our ſelves:</hi> But Men never get Acquaintance with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo faſt, as in the moſt earneſt Way of Seeking. They that are in this Way, have more to engage them to think of their Sins, and ſtrictly to obſerve themſelves, and have much more to do with their own Hearts than others. Such an one has much more Experience of his own <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> than another that don't put forth, and try his <hi>Strength;</hi> and will therefore ſooner ſee himſelf dead in Sin: Such an one, though he hath a Diſpoſition continually to be flying to his own Righteouſneſs, yet finds Reſt <hi>in nothing;</hi> he wanders about from one Thing to another, ſeeking ſomething to eaſe his diſquieted Conſcience; he is driven from one Refuge to another, goes from Mountain to Hill, ſeeking Reſt and finding none; and therefore will the ſooner prove that there is no Reſt to be found, nor Truſt to be put, in any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Confidence whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>'Tis therefore quite a wrong Notion that ſome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the more they do, the more they ſhall depend on it: Whereas the Reverſe is true; the more they <hi>do,</hi> or the more thorough they are in <hi>ſeeking,</hi> the leſs will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Slackneſs in Religion, and their Truſt in their own Righteouſneſs, do ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh one another. Their Truſt in what they have done, and what they now do, ſettles them in a ſlothful Reſt and Eaſe, and hinders their being ſenſible of their Need of rouſing up themſelves and preſſing forward. And on the other Hand, their Negligence tends ſo to benumb them, and keep them in ſuch Ignorance of themſelves, that the moſt miſerable Refuges are ſtupidly reſted in as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Therefore we ſee that when Perſons have been going on for a long Time in ſuch a Way, and God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards comes more thoroughly to awaken them, and to ſtir them up to be in good Earneſt, he ſhakes all their old Foundation, and rouſes them out of their old Reſting Places; ſo that they cannot quiet themſelves with thoſe Things that formerly kept them ſecure.</p>
                        <p>I would now proceed to give ſome <hi>Directions</hi> how you ſhould preſs into the Kingdom of God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Be directed as it were to ſacrifice every Thing to your Souls eternal Intereſt. Let ſeeking this be ſo much your Bent, and what you are ſo reſolved in, that you will make every Thing give Place to it. Let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtand before your Reſolution of Seeking the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Whatever it be that you uſed to look upon as a Convenience, or Comfort, or Eaſe, or Thing deſireable on any Account, if it ſtands in the Way of this great Concern, let it be diſmiſs'd without Heſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if it be of that Nature that it is like always to be an Hindrance, then wholly have done with it, and never entertain any Expectation from it more. If in Time paſt, you have, for the ſake of worldly Gain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved your ſelf in more Care and Buſineſs than you find to be conſiſtent with your being ſo thorough in the Buſineſs of Religion as you ought to be, then get into ſome other Way, tho' you ſuffer in your worldly Intereſt by it. Or if you have heretofore been converſant with Company that you have Reaſon to think have been, and will be a Snare to you, and a Hindrance to this great Deſign, in any wiſe break off from their Society,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:004239_0155_10042CE2A216BEE0"/>
however it may expoſe you to Reproach from your old Companions, or let what will be the Effect of it. Or whatever it be that ſtands in the Way of your moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly ſeeking Salvation, if it be ſome dear ſinful Pleaſure, or ſtrong carnal Appetite, or if it be Credit and Honour, or if it be the Good-Will of ſome Perſon whoſe Friendſhip you Deſire, or a being accounted of by thoſe whoſe Eſteem and Liking you have highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, and there be Danger if you do as you ought, you ſhall be looked upon by them as odd, and ridiculous, and become contemptible in their Eyes; or if it be your Eaſe and Indolence, and Averſion to continual Labour; or if it be your outward Convenience in any Reſpect, whereby you might avoid Difficulties of one Kind or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; LET ALL GO; offer up <hi>all</hi> ſuch Things together, as it were in one Sacrifice to the Intereſt of your Soul: Let nothing ſtand in Competition with this, but make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing to fall before it. If the Fleſh muſt be croſs'd, then croſs it, ſpare it not, crucify it, and don't be afraid of being too cruel to it. Gal. 5. 24 <hi>They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts.</hi> Have no Dependence on any worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatſoever. Let Salvation be the one Thing with you. This is what is certainly required of you: and this is what many ſtick at; this giving up other Things for Salvation, is a ſtumbling Block that few get over. While others preſs'd into the Kingdom of God, at the preaching of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> there was <hi>Herod,</hi> one of his Hearers, that was pretty much ſtirr'd up by his Preaching; it is ſaid, <hi>he heard him, and obſerved him, and did many Things;</hi> but when he came to tell him that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

The rich young Man was conſiderably concern'd for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and accordingly was a very ſtrict Liver in many Things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> when Chriſt came to direct him to go and ſell all tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> he had, and give to the Poor, and come and follow him, he could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> find in his Heart to comply with it, but went away ſorrowful; he had great Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſet his Heart much on his Eſtate, &amp; could not
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:004239_0156_10042CE780A82AC8"/>
hear to part with it. It may be if Chriſt had directed him only to give away a conſiderable <hi>Part</hi> of his Eſtate, he would have done it; yea, perhaps, if he had bid him part with <hi>half</hi> of it, he would have complied with it; but when he directed him to throw up <hi>all,</hi> he could not grapple with ſuch a Propoſal. Herein the Straitneſs of the Gate very much conſiſts, and 'tis on this Account that ſo many ſeek to enter in, and are not able. There are many that have a great Mind to have Salvation, and ſpend great Part of their Time in wiſhing that they had it, but they will not comply with the neceſſary Means of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Be directed to forget the Things that are behind; that is, not to keep thinking and making much of what you have done, but let your Mind be wholly intent on what you have to do. In ſome Senſe you ought to look back; you ſhould look back on your Sins. Jer. 2. 23. <hi>See thy Way in the Valley, know what thou haſt done.</hi> You ſhould look back on the Wretchedneſs of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Performances, and conſider how you have fallen ſhort in them, and how exceedingly polluted all your Duties have been, and how juſtly God might reject and loath them, and you for them: But you ought not to ſpend your Time in looking back, as many Perſons do, thinking how much they have done for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what great Pains they have taken and how that they have done what they can, and don't ſee how they can do more, how long a Time they have been ſeeking, and how much more they have done than others, and even than ſuch and ſuch who have obtained Mercy; and ſo think with themſelves how hardly God deals with them, that he don't extend Mercy to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but turns a deaf Ear to their Cries; and hence diſcourage themſelves, and complain of God. Don't thus ſpend your Time in looking on what is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> forward, and conſider what is before you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                              </gap>hould do,</hi> and what God calls you ſtill <hi>to do,</hi> in order to your own Salvation. The Apoſtle in the third Chapter to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> tells us what Things he did while a <hi>Jew,</hi>
                           <pb n="150" facs="unknown:004239_0157_10042CEF5D56A690"/>
how much he had to boaſt of, if any could have any Thing of their own to boaſt of; but he tells us that he forgot thoſe Things, and all others that were behind, and reached forth towards the Things that were before, preſſing forwards, towards the Mark, for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Labour to get your Heart thoroughly diſpoſed to go on and hold out to the End. Many that ſeem to be earneſt have not a Heart thus diſpoſed. 'Tis a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Thing for Perſons to appear greatly affected for a little while; but all is ſoon paſt away, and there is no more to be ſeen of it. Labour therefore to obtain a thorough Willingneſs, and Preparation of Spirit, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Seeking, in the Uſe of your utmoſt Endeavours, without Limitation; and don't think your whole Life too long. And in order to this be adviſed to two Things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Remember that if ever God beſtows Mercy upon you, he will uſe his ſovereign Pleaſure about the Time when. He will beſtow it on ſome in a little Time, and on others not till they have ſought it long. If other Perſons are ſoon enlighten'd and comforted, while you remain long in Darkneſs, there is no other Way but for you to wait. God <hi>will</hi> act arbitrarily in this Matter, and you can't help it. You <hi>muſt</hi> e'en be content to wait, in a Way of laborious and earneſt Striving, till his Time comes. If you refuſe, you will but undo your ſelf; and when you ſhall hereafter find your ſelf undone, and ſee that your Caſe is paſt Remedy, how will you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your ſelf for foregoing a great Probability of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, only becauſe you had not Patience to hold out, and was not willing to be at the Trouble of a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Labour? And what will it avail before God, or your own Conſcience, to ſay that you could not bear to be obliged to ſeek Salvation ſo long, when God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it on others that ſought it but for a very ſhort Time? Though God may have beſtowed the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his Favour on others in a few Days, or Hours after they have begun earneſtly to ſeek it, how does that alter the Caſe as to you, if there proves to be a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:004239_0158_100404A978F94808"/>
of your laboriouſly ſeeking many Years before you obtain them? Is Salvation the leſs Worth the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>great Deal</hi> of Pains for, becauſe, through the ſovereign Pleaſure of God, others have obtained with comparatively but <hi>little</hi> Pains? If there are two Perſons, the one of which has obtain'd converting Grace with comparative Eaſe, and another that has obtained it after continuing for many Years in the greateſt and moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Labours after it, how little Difference does it make at laſt, when once Salvation is obtain'd! Put all the Labour, and Pains, and long continued Difficulties and Strugglings of the one, in the Scale <hi>againſt</hi> Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how little does it ſubſtract; and put the Eaſe with which the other has obtain'd, in the Scale <hi>with</hi> Salvation, and how little does it add? What is either added or ſubſtracted, is lighter than Vanity, and a Thing worthy of no Conſideration, when compar'd with that <hi>infinite</hi> Benefit that is obtain'd. Indeed if you were to live ten thouſand Years, and all that Time ſhould ſtrive and preſs forward with as great Earneſtneſs as ever a Perſon did for one Day, all this would bear no Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Importance of the Benefit, and would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs appear little to you, when once you come to be in actual Poſſeſſion of eternal Glory, and to ſee what that eternal Miſery is that you have eſcaped.—You muſt not think much of your Pains, and of the length of Time; you muſt preſs towards the Kingdom of God, and do your utmoſt, and hold out to the End, and learn to make no Account of it when you have done. You muſt undertake the Buſineſs of ſeeking Salvation upon theſe Terms, and with no other Expectation than this, that if ever God beſtows Mercy it <hi>will be</hi> in his own Time, and not only ſo, but alſo that when you have done all, God will not hold himſelf obliged to ſhow you Mercy at laſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Endeavour now thoroughly to weigh in your Mind the <hi>Difficulty,</hi> and to count the <hi>Coſt</hi> of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in ſeeking Salvation. You that are now ſetting out in this Buſineſs, (as there are many here that have very lately ſet about it;—Praiſed be the Name of
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:004239_0159_10042CFB5F458610"/>
God that he has ſtirr'd you up to it!) be exhorted to attend this Direction. Don't undertake in this Affair, with any other Thought, but of giving your ſelf wholly to it for the remaining Part of your Life, and going through many and great Difficulties in it. Take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eed that you don't engage ſecretly upon this Condition, that you ſhall obtain in a little Time, promiſing your ſelf that it ſhall be within this preſent Seaſon of the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of God's Spirit, or with any other Limitation of Time whatſoever. Many when they begin, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſet out very earneſtly, don't expect that they ſhall need to ſeek very long; and ſo don't prepare themſelves for it: And therefore when they come to find it otherwiſe, and meet with unexpected Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are found unguarded, and eaſily overthrown. But let me adviſe all that are now ſeeking their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, not to entertain any ſelf flattering Thoughts; but weigh the utmoſt Difficulties of Perſeverance, and be provided for them, having your Mind fix'd in it to go through them, let them be what they will. Conſider now beforehand, how tedious it would be, with utmoſt Earneſtneſs and Labour, to ſtrive after Salvation, for many Years, in the mean time receiving no joyful o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a great Temptation to Diſcouragement there probably would be in it; how apt you would be to yield the Caſe; how ready to think that 'tis in vain for you to ſeek any longer, and that God never intends to ſhew you Mercy, in that he has not yet done it; how apt you would be to think with your ſelf, <q>What an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Life do I live! how much more unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly do I ſpend my Time than others, that don't perplex their Minds about the Things of another World, but are at Eaſe, and take the Comfort of their worldly Enjoyments!</q> Conſider what a Temptation there would probably be in it, if you ſaw others brought in, that began to ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you, rejoycing in a Hope and Senſe of God's Favour after but little Pains, and a ſhort Time of Awakening; while you from Day to Day, and from Year to Year,

ſeem'd to labour in Vain. Prepare for ſuch Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions now: Lay in beforehand for ſuch Trials and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, that you may not think any ſtrange Thing has happen'd when they come.</p>
                        <p>I hope that thoſe that have given Attention to what has been ſaid, have by this Time conceived in ſome Meaſure what is ſignified by the Expreſſion in the Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after what Manner they ought to <hi>preſs into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> Here is this to induce you to a Compliance with what you have been directed to; if you ſit ſtill you die, if you go backward behold you ſhall ſurely die, if you go forward you may live. And though God has not bound himſelf to any Thing that a Perſon does, while deſtitute of Faith, &amp; out of Chriſt, yet there is great Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that in a Way of hearkening to this Counſel you <hi>will live,</hi> &amp; that by preſſing onward, &amp; perſevering, you will at laſt as it were by Violence take the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thoſe of you that have now heard me, that have not only <hi>heard</hi> the Directions that have been given, but ſhall, through God's merciful Aſſiſtance, <hi>practice</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, are thoſe that probably will overcome, that we may well hope at laſt to ſee <hi>ſtanding with the Lamb on Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>chathed in white Robes, with Palms in their Hands;</hi> when all your Labour and Toil will be abundantly compenſated, and you will not repent that you have taken ſo much Pains, and denied your ſelf ſo much, and waited ſo long: This Pains, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="2">2. God comes this Day and knocks at many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Doors, and at your Door among the Reſt. God ſeems to be come in a very unuſual Manner amongſt us, upon a gracious and merciful Deſign, a Deſign of ſaving a Number of poor miſerable Souls out of a loſt and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Condition, and bringing them into a happy State, in Safety from Miſery, and a Title to eternal Glory! This is offered to you, not only as it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been in the Word and Ordinances, but by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Influences of the Spirit of Chriſt awakening of you! This ſpecial Offer is made to many amongſt us; and <hi>you</hi> be not paſs'd over: Chriſt has not forgot or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looked you; but has come to <hi>your</hi> Door; and there as it were ſtands waiting for you to open to him. If you have Wiſdom &amp; Diſcretion to diſcern your own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, you will know that now is your Opportunity.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. How much more eaſily converting Grace is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſuch a Time, than at other Times. The Work is equally eaſy with GOD at all Times; but there is far leſs Difficulty in the Way, as to <hi>Men,</hi> at ſuch a Time, than at other Times. It is, as I ſaid before, a Day of God's gracious Viſitation, a Day that he has as it were ſet apart for the more liberally and bountifully diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Grace; a Day wherein God's Hand is opened wide: Experience ſhews it. God ſeems to be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to help, to give proper Convictions, to help againſt Temptations, and let in divine Light: He ſeems to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his Work, with a more glorious Diſcovery of his Power, and Satan is more chain'd up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than at other Times: Thoſe Difficulties &amp; Temptations that Perſons before ſtuck at, from Year to Year, they are ſoon helped over: The Work of God is carried on with greater Speed and Swiftneſs, and there are often Inſtances of ſudden Converſion at ſuch a Time.

Inſtances as that of the Jayler abounded then, in Fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Prophecy, Iſai. 66 7, 8. <hi>Before ſhe travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe brought forth; before her Pain came ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a Man child. Who hath heard ſuch a Thing? Who hath ſeen ſuch Things? For as ſoon as</hi> Zion <hi>travailed, ſhe brought forth her Children.</hi> So it is in ſome Degree, whenever there is an extraordinary pouring out of the Spirit of God; more or leſs ſo, in Proportion to the Greatneſs of that Effuſion. There is ſeldom ſuch quick Work made of it at other Times: Perſons are not ſo ſoon delivered from their various Temptations, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements; but are much longer wandring in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and groping in Darkneſs, And yet,</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There are probably ſome here preſent, that are now concerned about their Salvation, that never will obtain. 'Tis not to be ſuppoſed that all that are now <hi>moved</hi> and <hi>awaken'd,</hi> will ever be ſavingly <hi>converted:</hi> Doubtleſs there are many now ſeeking that will not be able to enter. When has it been ſo in Times paſt, when there have been Times of great Out pourings of God's Spirit, but that many that for a while, have inquired with others, what they ſhould do to be ſaved, have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and afterwards grown hard and ſecure? All of you that are now awaken'd, have a Mind to obtain Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and probably hope to get a Title to Heaven, in the Time of this preſent moving of God's Spirit: But yet, (though it be awful to be ſpoken, and awful to be thought) we have no Reaſon to think any other, than than ſome of you will burn in Hell to all Eternity. You all are afraid of Hell, and ſeem at preſent diſpoſed to take Pains to be delivered from it; and yet it would be unreaſonable to think any other, than that ſome of you will have your Portion in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone. Tho' there are ſo many that ſeem to obtain <hi>ſo eaſily,</hi> having been but a little while under Convictions, yet, for all that, ſome <hi>never</hi> will obtain. Some will ſoon looſe the Senſe of Things they now have; tho' their Awakenings ſeem to be very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the preſent, they wont hold; they have not Hearts diſpoſed to hold on through very many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:004239_0166_10042D23CF233E80"/>
Some that have ſet out for Heaven, and hope as much as others to obtain, are indeed but ſlighty and ſlack, even <hi>now,</hi> in the midſt of ſuch a Time as this: And others, that for the preſent ſeem to be more in Earneſt, will probably before long decline, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Convictions of ſome ſeem to be great, while that which is the Occaſion of their Convictions is new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which when that begins to grow old, will gradually decay, and wear off. Thus, it may be, the Occaſion of your Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has been the Hearing of the Converſion of ſome Perſon, or your ſeeing ſo extraordinary a Diſpenſation of Providence as this is, in which God now appears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; but by and by the Newneſs and Freſhneſs of theſe Things <hi>will be gone,</hi> and ſo won't affect your Mind as now they do; and it may be your Convictions will go away with it.</p>
                        <p>Tho' ſuch a Time as this, be a Time wherein God doth more liberally beſtow his Grace than at other Times, and ſo a Time of greater Advantage for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, yet there ſeems to be, upon ſome Accounts, greater Danger of Backſliding, than when Perſons are awaken'd at other Times. For commonly ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Times don't laſt long; and then when they ceaſe there are Multitudes that looſe their Convictions as it were together: As the Spirit of God departs, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenings eaſe off from the Minds of Perſons all over a Town.</p>
                        <p>We ſpeak of it as an happy Thing, that God is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be cauſing of it to be ſuch a Time amongſt us; and ſo it is indeed: but there are ſome that it will be no Benefit to; it will but be an Occaſion of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Miſery; they will wiſh they had never ſeen this Time; it will be more tolerable for thoſe that never ſaw it, or any Thing like it, in the Day of Judgment than for them. 'Tis an awful Conſideration, that there are probably thoſe here, that the great Judge will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after call to a ſtrict Account about this very Thing, why they no better improved this Opportunity, when he did <hi>ſo</hi> ſet open the Fountain of his Grace, and did ſo loudly

call upon them, and came and ſtrove <hi>with them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> by the Awakening Influences of his Spirit; and they will have no good Account to give to the Judge, but their Mouths will be ſtop'd, and they will ſtand Speechleſs before him.</p>
                        <p>You had need therefore to be earneſt, and very tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and reſolved in this Affair, that you may not be one of thoſe that ſhall thus fail, that you may ſo fight, as not uncertainly, and ſo run, as that you may win the Prize.</p>

                        <p n="6">6. Conſider, that 'tis very uncertain whether you will ever ſee ſuch another Time as this is. If there ſhould be ſuch another Time, 'tis very uncertain whether you will live to <hi>ſee</hi> it. Many that are now concerned for their Salvation amongſt us, will probably be in their Graves, and it may be in Hell before that Time; and if you ſhould miſs this Opportunity, it may be ſo with you. And what Good will that do you, to have the Spirit of God poured out upon Earth, in the Place where you once lived, while you are tormented in Hell? What will it avail you, that others are crying, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> while you are ſhut up for ever in the bottomleſs Pit, and are wailing and gnaſhing your Teeth in everlaſting Burnings?</p>

Wherefore improve this Opportunity, while God is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Spirit on Earth, &amp; you are on Earth, &amp; while you dwell in that Place where the Spirit of God is thus poured out, &amp; you your ſelf have the awakening Influences of it, that you may never wail and gnaſh your Teeth in Hell, but may ſing in Heaven for ever, with others that are redeemed from amongſt <hi>Men,</hi> and redeemed amongſt <hi>us.</hi>

                        <p n="7">7. If you ſhould ſee another ſuch Time, it will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der far greater Diſadvantages than you now ſee this Time. You will probably then be much older, and will have more harden'd your Heart; and ſo will be under leſs Probability of receiving Good. Some Perſons are ſo harden'd in Sin, and ſo left of God, that they can live through ſuch a Time as this, and not be much awaken'd or affected by it; they can ſtand their Ground, and be but Little moved. And ſo may it be with you, by another ſuch Time, if there ſhould be another amongſt us, and you ſhould live to ſee it. The Caſe in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hability will be greatly altered with you by that Time. If you ſhould continue Chriſtleſs and Graceleſs till then, you will be much further from the Kingdom of God, and much deeper involved in Snares and Miſery; and the Devil will probably have a vaſtly greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt you, to tempt and confound you.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. We don't know but that God is now gathering in his Elect, before ſome great and ſore Judgment.

So it was before the caſting off of the <hi>Jews</hi> from being God's People: There was firſt a very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable pouring out of the Spirit, and gathering in of the Elect, by the Preaching of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, as we read in the beginning of the <hi>Acts:</hi> But after this Harveſt, and it's Gleanings were over, <hi>the Reſt were blinded,</hi> and harden'd; the Goſpel had little Succeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and the Nation was given up, and caſt off from being God's People, and their City and Land was deſtroyed by the <hi>Romans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So we read in the beginning of the 7th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that God, when about to bring deſtroying Judgments on the Earth, firſt ſealed his Servants in the Forehead: He ſet his Seal upon the Hearts of the Elect, gave them the ſaving Influences and Indwelling of his Spirit, by which they were <hi>ſealed to the Day of Redemption.</hi> Rev. 7. 1, 2, 3. <hi>And after theſe Things, I ſaw four Angels, ſtanding on the four Corners of the Earth, holding the four Winds of the Earth, that the Wind ſhould not blow on the Earth, nor on the Sea, nor on any Tree. And I ſaw another Angel aſcending from the Eaſt, having the Seal of the living God: And he cried with a loud Voice, to the four Angels, to whom it was given to hurt the Earth, and the Sea, ſaying, Hurt not the Earth, neither the Sea, nor the Trees, till we have ſealed the Servants of our God in their Foreheads.</hi>

Will the Converſion of others move you?—There is indeed ſcarce any Thing that is found to have ſo great a Tendency to ſtir Perſons up as this: But this you have been tried with of late in frequent Inſtances; but are hitherto Proof againſt it. Will a general pouring out of the Spirit, and ſeeing a Concern about Salvation amongſt all Sorts of People do it? This Means you now have, but without Effect. Yea you have all theſe Things together; you have the ſolemn Warnings of God's Word, and awful Inſtances of Death, and the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others, and ſee a general Concern about Salvation: But all together don't move you to any great Concern, about your own precious, immortal, and miſerable Soul.

                        <p>You have heard that 'tis probable that ſome that are now <hi>awaken'd,</hi> will never obtain Salvation; how dark then does it look upon you that remain ſtupidly <hi>unawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd!</hi>—Thoſe that be not moved at ſuch a Time as this, that are come to adult Age, have Reaſon to fear whether or no they be not given up to judicial Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

You have loſt many Advantages that once you had, and now have not the ſame Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that others have: The Caſe is very different with you from what it is with many of your Neighbours. You above all had need to improve ſuch an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Now is the Time for you to beſtir your ſelf, and take the Kingdom of Heaven!</p>

Now God is dealing forth freely to all Sorts: His Hand is opened wide, and he don't paſs by old ones ſo much as he uſed to do. You are not under ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages as others are that are younger; but yet, ſo wonderfully has God ordered it, that now you are not deſtitute of great Advantage: Tho' old in Sin, God has put a new and extraordinary Advantage into your Hands. O, improve this Price that you have to get Wiſdom!
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:004239_0175_10042D4C5E8819E0"/>
You that have been long ſeeking to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, and yet remain without, now take your Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and preſs in! You that have been long in the Wilderneſs, fighting with various Temptations, and have been labouring under Diſcouragements, and have been ready to give up the Caſe, have been often tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Deſpair, now, behold the Door that God opens for you! Don't give Way to Diſcouragements now; this is not a Time for it: Don't ſpend Time in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you have done what you can already, and that you ſee Signs that you be not elected, and in giving Way to other perplexing, weakening, diſheartening Temptations: Don't waſte away this precious Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in ſuch a Manner: You have no Time to ſpare for ſuch Things as theſe: God calls you now to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: Improve this Time in ſeeking and ſtriving for Salvation, and not in that which tends to hinder it. 'Tis no Time now for you to ſtand talking with the Devil; but hearken to God, and apply your ſelf to that, which he does now ſo loudly call you to.</p>
                        <p>Some of you have often lamented the Loſs of paſt Opportunities: As particularly the Loſs of the Time of Youth, and have been wiſhing that you had ſo good an Opportunity again; have been ready to ſay, <hi>O! if I was young again, how would I improve ſuch an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage!</hi> That Opportunity that you have had in Time paſt, is irrecoverable; you can never have it again: but God can give you other Advantages of another Sort, that are very great, and he is ſo doing at this Day. He is now putting a new Opportunity into your Hands; tho' not of the <hi>ſame Kind</hi> with that which you once had, and have loſt, yet in ſome Reſpects as great of <hi>another Kind.</hi> If you lament, and are ready to cry out of your Folly in neglecting and looſing paſt Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, then don't be guilty of the Folly of neglecting the Opportunity which God now gives you. This Opportunity you could not have <hi>purchaſed,</hi> if you would have given all that you had in the World for it: But God is putting of it into your Hands, of himſelf, of his own free and ſovereign Mercy, <hi>without your purchaſing</hi>

of it. Therefore when you have it, don't neglect it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is a great deal more likely with Reſpect to ſuch Perſons than others, that this is their laſt Time. There will be a laſt Time of any ſpecial Offer of Salvation to impenitent Sinners. <hi>God's Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man,</hi> Gen. 6 3. God ſometimes continues long knocking at the Doors of wicked Men's Hearts; but there are the laſt Knocks, and the laſt Calls, that ever they ſhall have. And ſometimes God's laſt Calls are the loudeſt, and then if Sinners don't hearken, God finally leaves them. How long has God been knocking at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your Doors, that are old in Sin! 'Tis a great deal more likely that theſe are his laſt Knocks. You have reſiſted God's Spirit in Times paſt, and have har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd your Heart once and again; but God will not be thus dealt with always: There is Danger, that if now, after ſo long a Time, you won't hearken, he will utterly deſert you, and leave you to walk in your own Counſels.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems, by God's Providence, as tho' God had yet an elect Number amongſt old Sinners in this Place, that perhaps he is now about to bring in. It looks as tho' there were ſome that long lived under Mr.<hi>Stoddard'</hi>s Miniſtry, that God has not utterly caſt off, tho' they ſo ſtood it out under ſuch great Means as they then enjoyed. 'Tis to be hoped that God will now bring in a Remnant from among them. But 'tis the more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God is now about finiſhing with them, one Way or the other, for their having been ſo long the Subjects of ſuch extraordinary Means.

                        <p>Conſider two Things,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. You have all Manner of Advantages now centring upon you. It is a Time of great Advantage for all; but your Advantages are above others. There is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sort of Perſons, that have now ſo great and happy an Opportunity as you have. You have that great Advantage that is common to all that live in this Place, <hi>viz.</hi> That now it is a Time of the extraordinary pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Spirit of God; and alſo have that great Advantage, that you have the awakening Influences of the Spirit of God on you in particular; and beſides that, you have this peculiar Advantage, that you are now in your Youth: And added to this, you have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unſpeakable Advantage, that you now are under your firſt Convictions. Happy is he that never has har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened his Heart, and blocked up his own Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:004239_0178_10042D5D10B13180"/>
by <hi>backſliding,</hi> and has now the awakening Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of God's Spirit, if God does but enable him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly to improve them! Such above all in the World bid fair for the Kingdom of God. God is wont, on ſuch, above any Kind of Perſons, as it were eaſily and readily to beſtow the ſaving Grace and Comforts of his Spirit. Inſtances of ſpeedy and ſudden Converſion are moſt commonly found among ſuch—Happy are they that have the Spirit of God with them, and never have quenched it, if they did but know the Price they have in their Hands!</p>
                        <p>If you have a Senſe of your Neceſſity of Salvation, and the great Worth and Value of it, you will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take the ſureſt Way to it, or that which has the greateſt Probability of Succeſs; and that certainly is, thoroughly to improve your firſt Convictions: If you do ſo, it is not likely that you will fail; there is the greateſt Probability that you will ſucceed What is it not worth to have ſuch an Advantage in ones Hands, for obtaining <hi>eternal Life?</hi>—The preſent Seaſon of the pouring out of God's Spirit, is the firſt ſuch Seaſon that many of you that are now under Awakenings have ever ſeen, ſince you came to Years of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: On which Account, and becauſe it is the firſt Time that you have ever been ſtir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There are many here preſent that wiſh they had ſuch an Opportunity, but they never can obtain it; they can't buy it for Money; but you have it in your Poſſeſſion, and can improve it if you will.</p>
                        <p>But yet,</p>

There is on ſome Accounts greater Danger that ſuch as are in your Circumſtances will fail of thoroughly improving their Convictions, with Reſpect to Stedſaſtneſs and Perſeverance, than others. Thoſe that are young are more unſtable than elder Perſons: They that never had Convictions before, have leſs Experience of the Difficulty of the Work they have engaged in; they are more ready to think that they ſhall obtain Salvation

eaſily, and are more eaſily diſcouraged by Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and young Perſons have leſs Reaſon and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to fortify them againſt Temptations to Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding: You ſhould therefore labour now the more to guard againſt ſuch Temptations—By all Means be thorough now! Make but one Work of ſeeking Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Make thorough Work of it the firſt Time!—There are vaſt Diſadvantages that they bring themſelves under, that have ſeveral Turns of Seeking with great Intermiſſions: By ſuch a Courſe Perſons exceedingly wound their own Souls, and intangle themſelves in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Snares.—Who are thoſe that commonly meet with ſo many Difficulties, and are ſo long labouring in Darkneſs and Perplexity, but thoſe that have had ſeveral Turns at ſeeking Salvation, who have one while had Convictions, and then have quenched them, and then have ſet about the Work again, and have back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliden again, and have gone on after that Manner? The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would not have been forty Years in the Wilderneſs, if they had held their Courage, and had gone on as they ſet out; but they were of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Mind, and were for going back again into <hi>Egypt</hi> Otherwiſe if they had gone right forward, without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, as God would have led them, they would have ſoon entred, and taken Poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan:</hi> They had got to the very Borders of it, when they turned back, but then were thirty-eight Years after that, before they got through the Wilderneſs. Therefore as you regard the Intereſt of your Soul, don't run your ſelf into a like Difficulty, by Unſteadineſs, Intermiſſion, and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding; but preſs right forward, from henceforth, and make but one Work of ſeeking converting and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, however great, and difficult, and long a Work that may be.</p>

                        <hi>Naomi</hi> was now returning out of the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> into the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with her two Daughters-in-law, <hi>Orpah</hi> and <hi>Ruth;</hi> who well repreſent to us, two Sorts of Profeſſors of Religion; <hi>Orpah</hi> that Sort, that indeed make a fair Profeſſion, and ſeem to ſet out well, but dure but for a while, and then turn back; <hi>Ruth</hi> that Sort, that are ſound and ſincere, and therefore are ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and perſevering in the Way that they have ſet out in. <hi>Naomi,</hi> in the preceeding Verſes repreſents to theſe her Daughters the Difficulties of their leaving their own Country to go with her.

                     <p n="1">1. The remarkable Conduct and Behaviour of <hi>Ruth</hi> on this Occaſion; with what inflexible Reſolution ſhe cleaves to <hi>Naomi,</hi> and follows her. When <hi>Naomi</hi> firſt aroſe to return from the Country of <hi>Moab,</hi> into the Land

of <hi>Iſrael, Orpah</hi> and <hi>Ruth both</hi> ſet out with her: And <hi>Naomi</hi> exhorts them <hi>both</hi> to return: And they <hi>both</hi> of them wept, and ſeem'd as if they could not bear the Thoughts of leaving her, and appeared as if they were reſolved to go with her. Verſe 10. <hi>And they ſaid unto her, Surely we will return with thee, unto thy People.</hi> Then <hi>Naomi</hi> ſays to them again, <hi>Turn again my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> go your Way,</hi> &amp;c. And then they were greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected again, and <hi>Orpah</hi> returned and went back. Now <hi>Ruth'</hi>s Stedfaſtneſs in her Purpoſe had a greater Trial, but yet is not overcome: <hi>She clave unto her,</hi> Verſe 14. Then <hi>Naomi</hi> ſpeaks to her again, Verſe 15. <hi>Behold thy Siſter in law is gone back unto her People, and unto her gods; Return thou after thy Siſter in-law.</hi> And then ſhe ſhews her immoveable Reſolution in the Text and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſe.</p>

choſe before her own People) in her Poſterity, and (which is much more) of her Seed he raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt, in whom all the <hi>Families</hi> of the Earth are bleſſed.</p>
                     <p>From the Words thus opened, I obſerve this for the Subject of my preſent Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <q>When thoſe that we have formerly been converſant with, are turning to God, and joining themſelves to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it ought to be our firm Reſolution, that we will not leave them; but that their People ſhall be our People, and their God, our God.</q>
                     <p>It is ſometimes ſo, that <hi>of thoſe</hi> that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant one with another, that have dwelt together as Neighbours, and have been often together as Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or have been united in near Relation, and have been together in Darkneſs, Bondage, and Miſery, in the Service of Satan, <hi>ſome</hi> are inlighten'd and have their Minds changed, are made to ſee the great Evil of Sin, and have their Hearts turned to God, and are influenced by the Holy Spirit of God, to leave their Company that are on Satan's Side, to go and join themſelves with that bleſſed Company that are with Jeſus Chriſt; they are made willing to forſake the Tents of Wickedneſs, to dwell in the Land of Uprightneſs, with the People of God.</p>
                     <p>And ſometimes this proves a final Parting or Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them, and thoſe that they have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly converſant with. Though it may be no Parting in outward Reſpects, they may ſtill dwell together, and may converſe one with another, yet in other Reſpects it ſets them at a great Diſtance one from another: one is a <hi>Child</hi> of God, and the other the <hi>Enemy</hi> of God; one is in a miſerable, and the other in a happy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; one is a Citizen of the heavenly <hi>Zion,</hi> the other is under Condemnation to He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l. They are no longer together in thoſe Reſpects, wherein they uſed to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: They uſed to be of one Mind to ſerve Sin, and
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:004239_0184_10042D7E99A24950"/>
do Satan's Work; now they are of contrary Minds: They uſed to be together in Worldlineſs, and ſinful Vanity; now they are of exceeding different Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They are ſeperated as they are in different King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; the one remains in the Kingdom of Darkneſs, the other is tranſlated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son. And ſometimes they are <hi>finally</hi> ſeperated in theſe Reſpects: while one dwells in the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in the Houſe of God; the other, like <hi>Orpah,</hi> lives and dies in the Land of <hi>Moab.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now 'tis lamentable when it is thus: 'Tis awful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parted <hi>ſo:</hi> 'Tis doleful when of thoſe that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been together in Sin, ſome turn to God, and join themſelves with his People, that it ſhould prove a Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them and their former Companions and Acquaintance.—It ſhould be our firm and inflexible Reſolution in ſuch a Caſe, that it ſhall be no Parting, but that we will follow them, that their People ſhall be our People, and their God our God; and that for the following Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>I. Becauſe <hi>their God</hi> is a glorious God. There is none like him, who is infinite in Glory and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: He is the moſt high God, glorious in Holineſs, fearful in Praiſes, doing Wonders: His Name is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in all the Earth, and his Glory is above the Earth and the Heavens: Among the God's there is none like unto him; there is none in Heaven to be compared to him, nor are there any among the Sons of the Mighty, that can be liken'd unto him.—Their God is the Fountain of all Good, &amp; an inexhauſtible Fountain; he is an alſufficient God; a God that is able to protect and defend them, and do all Things for them: He is the King of Glory, the Lord ſtrong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle: A ſtrong Rock, and an high Tower. There is none like the God of <hi>Jeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>urun,</hi> who rideth on the Heaven in their Help, and in his Excellency on the Sky: The <hi>eternal God</hi> is their Refuge, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath are everlaſting Arms: He is a God that hath all Things in his Hand, and does whatſover he pleaſes:
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:004239_0185_10042D81AB161338"/>
He killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to the Grave, and bringeth up; he maketh poor, and maketh rich: The Pillars of the Earth are the Lord's.—Their God is an infinitely holy God: There is none holy as the Lord. And he is infinitely good and merciful. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that others worſhip and ſerve as God's, are cruel Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Spirits that ſeek the Ruin of Souls; but this is a God that delighteth in Mercy; his Grace is infinite, and endures for ever: He is Love it ſelf, an infinite Fountain and Ocean of it.</p>
                     <p>Such a God is their God! Such is the Excellency of <hi>Jacob!</hi> Such is the God of them, who have forſaken their Sins and are converted! They have made a wiſe Choice, who have choſen this God for their God. They have made an happy Exchange <hi>indeed,</hi> that have exchanged Sin, and the World, for ſuch a God!</p>
                     <p>They have an excellent and glorious Saviour, who is the only begotten Son of God; the Brightneſs of his Father's Glory; one in whom God from Eternity had infinite Delight; A Saviour of infinite Love; one that has ſhed his own Blood, and made his Soul an Offering for their Sins; and one that is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt.</p>
                     <p>II. <hi>Their People</hi> are an excellent and happy People. God has renewed them, and inſtamped his own Image upon them, and made them Partakers of his Holineſs. They are more excellent than their Neighbours, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 26 Yea, they are the excellent of the Earth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. 3 They are lovely in the Sight of the Angels; and they have their Souls adorned with thoſe Graces, that in the Sight of God him ſelf are of great Price.</p>
                     <p>The People of God are the moſt excellent and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Society in the World. That God whom they have choſen for their God, is their Father; he has pardoned all their Sins, and they are at Peace with him; and he has admitted them to all the Privileges of his Children. As they have devoted themſelves to God, ſo God has given himſelf to them: He is become their Salvation, and their Portion: His Power and Mercy, and all his
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:004239_0186_10042D8B168A2440"/>
Attributes are theirs. They are in a ſafe State, free from all Poſſibility of periſhing: Satan has no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to deſtroy them. God carries them on Eagles Wings, far above Satan's Reach, and above the Reach of all the Enemies of their Souls. God is with them <hi>in this World;</hi> they have his gracious Preſence: God is for them; Who then can be againſt them? As the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are round about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo JEHOVAH is round about them. God is their Shield, and their exceeding great Reward; and their Fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt: And they have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promiſe and Oath, that <hi>in the World to come,</hi> they ſhall dwell for ever in the glorious Preſence of God.</p>
                     <p>It may well be ſufficient to induce us to reſolve to cleave to thoſe that forſake their Sins and Idols, to join themſelves with this People, that God is with them. Zech. 8 23 <hi>Thus faith the Lord of Hoſts, In thoſe Days it ſhall come to paſs, that ten Men ſhall take hold, out of all Languages of the Nations; even ſhall take hold of the Skirt of him that is a Jew, ſaying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you.</hi> So ſhould Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as it were take hold of the Skirt of their. Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Companions, that have turn'd to God, and reſolve that they will go with them, becauſe God is with them.</p>
                     <p>III. Happineſs is no where elſe to be had, but in <hi>their God,</hi> and with <hi>their People.</hi> There are that are called gods many, and lords many. Some make gods of their Pleaſures; ſome chooſe Mammon for their god; ſome make gods of their own ſuppoſed Excellencies, or the outward Advantages they have above their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; ſome chooſe one Thing for their god, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers another: But Men can be happy in no other God, but the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He is the only Fountain of Happineſs. Other gods can't help in Calamity; nor can any of them afford what the poor empty Soul ſtands in need of. Let Men adore thoſe other gods never ſo much, and call upon them never ſo earneſtly, and ſerve
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:004239_0187_10042D8E5B05D8C0"/>
them never ſo diligently, they will never the leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main poor, wretched, unſatisfied, undone Creatures. All other People are miſerable, but that People whoſe God is the Lord.—The World is divided into two Societies: There are the People of God, the little Flock of Jeſus Chriſt, that Company that we read of, Rev. 14. 4. <hi>Theſe are they, which were not defiled with Women; for they are Virgins: Theſe are they, which follow the Lamb whitherſoever he g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eth: Theſe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from among Men, being the firſt Fruits unto God, and to the Lamb.</hi> And there are thoſe that belong to the Kingdom of Darkneſs; that are without Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aliens from the Common-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Covenants of Promiſe, having no Hope, and without God in the World. All that are of this latter Company, are wretched and undone; they are the Enemies of God, and under his Wrath and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They are the Devil's Slaves, that ſerve him blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and are beſool'd, and enſnared by him, and hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along in the broad Way to eternal Perdition.</p>
                     <p>IV. When thoſe that we have formerly been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with, are turning to God, and to his People, <hi>their Example</hi> ought to influence us. Their Example ſhould be looked upon as the Call of God to us, to do as they have done. God, when he changes the Heart of one, calls upon another; eſpecially does he loudly call on thoſe that have been their Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.—We have been influenced by their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Evil; and ſhall we ceaſe to follow them, when they make the wiſeſt Choice that ever they made, and do the beſt Thing that ever they did! If we have been Companions with them in Worldlineſs, in Vanity, in unproſitable and ſinful Converſation, it will be an hard Caſe, if there muſt be a Parting now, becauſe we be not willing to be Companions with them in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and true Happineſs. Men are greatly influenced by ſeeing one another's Proſperity in other Things. If thoſe that they have been much converſant with, grow rich, and obtain any great earthly Advantages, it awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:004239_0188_10042D95ED8C7A08"/>
their Ambition, and eager Deſire after the like Proſperity: How much more ſhould they be influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and ſtirred up to follow them, and be like them, when they obtain that ſpiritual and eternal Happineſs, that is infinitely more Worth than all the Proſperity and Glory of this World.</p>
                     <p>V. Our Reſolutions to cleave to and follow thoſe that are turning to God, and joining themſelves to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ought to be <hi>fix'd</hi> and <hi>ſtrong,</hi> becauſe of the great Difficulty of it. If we will cleave to them, and have their God for our God, and their People for our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we muſt mortify and deny all our Luſts, and croſs every evil Appetite and Inclination, and forever part with all Sin. But our Luſts are many and violent. Sin is naturally exceeding dear to us; to part with it is compared to plucking out our right Eyes. Men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from wanted Ways of Sin, for a little while, and may deny their Luſts in a partial Degree, with leſs Difficulty; but 'tis heart-rending Work, finally to part with all Sin, and to give our deareſt Luſts a Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, utterly to ſend them away. But this we muſt do, if we would follow thoſe that are truly turning to God: Yea, we muſt not only forſake Sin, but muſt, in a Senſe, forſake all the World, Luke 14. 33 <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> That is, he muſt forſake all <hi>in his Heart,</hi> and muſt come to a thorough Diſpoſition and Readineſs, <hi>actually</hi> to quit all for God, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſpiritual Privileges of his People, whenever the Caſe may require it; and that without any Proſpect of any Thing of the like Nature, or any worldly Thing whatſoever, to make amends for it; and all to go into a ſtrange Country, a Land that has hitherto been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen; like <hi>Abraham,</hi> who being called of God, <hi>went out of his own Country, and from his Kindred, and from his Father's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But ſo firmly reſolved was <hi>Ruth,</hi> that ſhe brake through all; ſhe was ſtedfaſt in it, that let the Difficulty be what it would, ſhe would not leave her Mother in law. So Perſons had need to be very firm in their Reſolution to conquer the Difficulties that are in the Way of cleaving to them, that are indeed turning from Sin to God.</p>
                     <p>VI. Our cleaving to them, and having their God for our God, and their People for our People, depends on our Reſolution and Choice: And that in two Reſpects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Firmneſs of Reſolution in uſing Means in order to it, is <hi>the Way to have Means effectual.</hi> There are Means appointed in order to our becoming ſome of the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and having their God for our God; and the <hi>thorough</hi> Uſe of theſe Means, is the Way to have Succeſs; but not a <hi>ſlack</hi> or <hi>ſlighty</hi> Uſe of them. And that we may be thorough, there is need of Strength of Reſolution, a firm and inflexible Diſpoſition, and bent of Mind to be univerſal in the Uſe of Means, and to do what we do with our Might, and to perſevere in it. Matth. 11. 12. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and the violent take it by Force.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. A chooſing of their God, and their People, with a full Determination, and with the whole Soul, is <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of an Union with them.</hi> God gives every Man his Choice in this Matter; as <hi>Orpah</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> had their Choice, whether they would go with <hi>Naomi</hi> into the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or ſtay in the Land of <hi>Moab.</hi> A natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man may chooſe Deliverance from Hell; but no Man doth ever heartily chooſe God, and Chriſt, and the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Benefits that Chriſt has purchaſed, and the Happineſs of God's People, till he is converted. On the contrary,

He is averſe to them; he has no Reliſh of them; and is wholly ignorant of the ineſtimable Worth and Value of them.</p>
                     <p>Many carnal Men do ſeem to chooſe theſe Things, but do it not really; as <hi>O pah</hi> ſeemed at firſt. to chooſe to forſake <hi>Moab</hi> to go into the Land of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> But when <hi>Naomi</hi> come to ſet before her the Difficulty of it, ſhe went back; and thereby ſhewed that ſhe was not fully determined in her Choice, and that her whole Soul was not in it, as <hi>Ruth'</hi>s was.</p>

                        <p>The USE that I ſhall make of what has been ſaid, is to move Sinners to this Reſolution, with Reſpect to thoſe amongſt us, that have lately turned to God, and joined themſelves to the Flock of Chriſt. It is ſo, thro' the abundant Mercy and Grace of God to us in this Place, that it may be ſaid of many of you, that are in a Chriſtleſs Condition, that you have lately been left by thoſe that were formerly with you in ſuch a State. There are thoſe that you have formerly been converſant with, that have lately forſaken a Life of Sin and the Service of Satan, and have turned to God, and fled to Chriſt, and joined themſelves to that bleſſed Company that are with him. They formerly were with you in Sin and in Miſery, but now they are with you no more, in that State or Manner of Life: They are changed, and have fled from the Wrath to come: They have choſen a Life of Holineſs here, and the Enjoyment of God hereafter. They were formerly your Aſſociates in Bondage, and were with you in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Buſineſs; but now you have their Company no longer, in theſe Things. Many of you have ſeen thoſe that you live with under the ſame Roof, turning from being any longer with you in Sin, to be with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Jeſus Chriſt. Some of you that are Husbands, have had your Wives; and ſome of you that are Wives, have had you Husbands; ſome of you that are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, have had your Parents; and Parents have had

your Children; many of you have had your Brothers and Siſters; and many your near Neighbours, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and ſpecial Friends; many of you that are young have had your Companions: I ſay, many of you have had thoſe that you have been thus concerned with, leaving you, forſaking that doleful Life, and wretched State that you ſtill continue in. God of his good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and wonderful Grace, hath lately cauſed it to be ſo, in this Place, that Multitudes have been forſaking their old Abodes in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> and under the gods of <hi>Moab,</hi> and going into the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to put their Truſt under the Wings of the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Though you and they have been nearly related, and have dwelt together, or have been often together, and intimately acquainted one with another, they have been taken, and you hitherto left! O let it not be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a final Parting! But earneſtly follow them; be firm in your Reſolution in this Matter. Don't do as <hi>Orpah</hi> did, who though at firſt ſhe made as though ſhe would follow <hi>Naomi,</hi> yet when ſhe had the Difficulty of it ſet before her, went back: But ſay as <hi>Ruth, I will not leave thee, but where thou go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>You that are old Sinners, that have lived long in the Service of Satan, have lately ſeen ſome that were <hi>with you,</hi> that have travell'd <hi>with you</hi> in the Paths of Sin, theſe many Years, that <hi>with you</hi> enjoyed great Means and Advantages, that have had Calls and Warnings <hi>with you,</hi> and have <hi>with you</hi> paſs'd through remarkable Times of the pouring out of God's Spirit in this Place, and have harden'd their Hearts, and ſtood it out <hi>with you,</hi> and <hi>with you</hi> have grown old in Sin; I ſay, you have ſeen ſome of them turning to God, i. e. you have ſeen thoſe Evidences of it in them, whence you may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally judge that it is ſo.

Condemnation; let it be your firm Reſolution, that, if poſſible, you will be with them ſtill, now they are in an holy and happy State, and that you will follow them into the holy and pleaſant Land.</p>
                        <p>You that tell of your having been ſeeking Salvation for many Years, though, without Doubt, in a poor, dull Way, in compariſon of what you ought to have done. You have ſeen ſome that have been with you in that Reſpect, that were old Sinners, and old Seekers, as you are, obtaining Mercy. God has lately rouſed them from their Dulneſs, and cauſed them to alter their Hand, and put them on more thorough Endeavours; and they have now, after ſo long a Time heard God's Voice, and have fled for Refuge to the Rock of Ages. Let this awaken Earneſtneſs, and Reſolution in you. Reſolve that you will not leave them.</p>
                        <p>You that are in your Youth, how many have you ſeen of your Age and Standing, that have of late, hopefully choſen God for their God, and Chriſt for their Saviour! You have follo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Let the following Things be here conſidered.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That your Soul is as precious as theirs. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal as theirs is; and ſtands in as much Need of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and can as ill bear eternal Miſery. You was born in the <hi>ſame</hi> miſerable Condition that they were, having the <hi>ſame</hi> Wrath of God abiding on you. You muſt ſtand before the <hi>ſame</hi> Judge; who will be as ſtrict in Judgment with you, as with them; and your own Righteouſneſs will ſtand you in no more Stead before him, than theirs; and therefore you ſtand in as abſolute Neceſſity of a Saviour as they. Carnal Confidences can no more anſwer your End than theirs; nor can this World or it's Enjoyments, ſerve to make you happy, without God, and Chriſt, more than them. When the Bridegroom comes, the fooliſh Virgins ſtand in as much Need of Oil, as the Wiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi>25 at the Beginning.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Unleſs you follow them, in their turning to God, their Converſion will be a Foundation of an eternal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration between you and them. You will be in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Intereſts, and in exceeding different States, as long as you live; they the Children of God, and you the Children of Satan: and you will be parted in another World; when you come to <hi>die,</hi> there will be a vaſt Seperation made between you. Luke 16. 26. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, between us and you, there is a great Gulf fixed; ſo that they that would paſs from hence to you, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence.</hi> And you will be parted at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You will be parted at Chriſt's firſt Appearance in the Clouds of Heaven: While they are caught up in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air, to be ever with the Lord, you will remain <hi>below,</hi> confined to this curſed Ground, that is kept in Store, reſerved unto Fire, againſt the Day of Judgment, and Perdition of ungodly Men. You will appear ſeperated from them, while you ſtand before the great Judgment Seat, they being at the Right Hard, while you are ſet at the left. Matth. 25. 32, 33. <hi>And before him ſhall be gathered all Nations; and he ſhall ſeperate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth his Sheep from the Goats; and he ſhall
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:004239_0194_10042DB42E593048"/>
ſet the Sheep on his Right Hand; but the Goats on the left.</hi> And you ſhall then appear in exceeding different Circumſtances: While you ſtand with Devils, in the Image and Deformity of Devils, and in ineffable Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Amamazement, they ſhall appear in Glory, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Thrones, as Aſſeſſors with Chriſt, and as ſuch paſſing Judgment upon you, I <hi>Cor</hi> 6. 2. And what Shame and Confuſion will then cover you, when ſo many of your Contemporaries, your Equals, your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Relations and Companions, ſhall be honoured, and openly acknowleged, and confeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Dan. 12. 2. <hi>Some ſhall riſe to everlaſting Life, and ſome to Shame and overlaſting Contempt.</hi> And what a wide Seperation will the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that ſhall be then paſſed and executed, make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and them? When you ſhall be ſent away out of the Preſence of the Judge, with Indignation and Abhorrence, as curſed and loathſome Creatures, and they ſhall be ſweetly accoſted, and invited into his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as his dear Friends, and the bleſſed of his Father!

How awful will it be to be parted ſo!</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Conſider the great Encouragement that God gives you, earneſtly to ſtrive for the ſame Bleſſing that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have obtained. There is great Encouragement in the <hi>Word</hi> of God to Sinners, to ſeek Salvation; in the Revelation that we have of the abundant Proviſion made for the Salvation even of the chief of Sinners, and in the Appointment of ſo many Means to be uſed <hi>with,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> Sinners, in order to their Salvation; and by the Bleſſing which God in his Word connects with the Means of his Appointment. There is hence great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for all, at all Times, that will be thorough in uſing of theſe Means.

How darkly and awfully will it look upon them!—If you ſhall be of that Company, how well may your Friends and Relations lament over you, and bemoan your dark and dangerous Circumſtances!—If you would not be one of them, make haſte, delay not, and look not behind you.—Shall all Sorts obtain, ſhall every one preſs into the Kingdom of God, while you ſtay loiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind, in a doleful undone Condition?

And the more clearly to evince this Doctrine, and ſhew the Reaſon of it, the Apoſtle, in the firſt Place, eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes that Point, that no Fleſh living can be juſtified by the Deeds of the Law. And to prove it, he is very large and particular in ſhewing, that all Mankind, not only Gentiles, but Jews, are <hi>under Sin,</hi> and ſo under
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:004239_0200_100405500705AF08"/>
the Condemnation of the Law; which is what he inſiſts upon from the beginning of the Epiſtle to this Place. He firſt begins with the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and in the firſt Chapter, ſhews that they are <hi>under Sin,</hi> by ſetting forth the exceeding Corruptions and horrid Wickedneſs, that overſpread the Gentile World: And then through the ſecond Chapter, and the former Part of this third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the Text and following Verſe, he ſhews the ſame of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they alſo are in the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with the Gentiles, in this regard. They had an high Thought of themſelves, becauſe they were God's Covenant People, and circumciſed, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham.</hi> They deſpiſed the Gentiles, as pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, condemned, and accurſed; but looked on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, on Account of their external Privileges, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial and moral Righteouſneſs, as a pure and holy People, and the Children of God; as the Apoſtle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in the ſecond Chapter. It was therefore ſtrange Doctrine to them, that they alſo were unclean and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in God's Sight, and under the Condemnation and Curſe of the Law. The Apoſtle does therefore, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their ſtrong Prejudices againſt ſuch Doctrine, the more particularly inſiſt upon it, and ſhews that they are no better than the Gentiles; as in the 9th Verſe of this Chapter, <hi>What then? Are we better than they? No in no wiſe; for we have before proved both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that they are all under Sin.</hi> And to convince them of it, he then produces certain Paſſages out of their own Law, or the Old-Teſtament, (whoſe Authority they pretended a great Regard to,) from the 9th Verſe to the Verſe wherein is our Text. And it may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Apoſtle, <hi>firſt,</hi> cites certain Paſſages to prove that Mankind are <hi>all</hi> corrupt, in the 10, 11, and 12. Verſes; as it is written, <hi>There is</hi> none <hi>righteous, no</hi> not one: <hi>There is</hi> none <hi>that underſtandeth: There is</hi> none <hi>that ſeeketh after God: They are</hi> all <hi>gone out of the Way: They are</hi> together <hi>become unprofitable: There is</hi> none <hi>that doth good; no</hi> not one. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he cites next, are to prove that not only are <hi>all</hi> corrupt, but each one <hi>

all over unclean, from the crown of his Head, to the Soles of his Feet; and therefore ſeveral particular Parts of the Body are mentioned, as the <hi>Throat,</hi> the <hi>Tongue,</hi> the <hi>Lips,</hi> the <hi>Mouth,</hi> the <hi>Feet,</hi> Verſes 13, 14, 15. <hi>Their</hi> Throat <hi>is an open Sepulchre, with their</hi> Tongues <hi>they have uſed Deceit, the Poiſon of Aſps is under their</hi> Lips; <hi>whoſe</hi> Mouth <hi>is full of Curſing and Bitterneſs, their</hi> Feet <hi>are ſwift to ſhed Blood.</hi> And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He quotes other Paſſages to ſhew, that <hi>each one</hi> is not only <hi>all over</hi> corrupt, but corrupt <hi>to a deſperate Degree,</hi> in the 16, 17, and 18. Verſes; in which the exceeding Degree of their Corruption is ſhewn, both by <hi>affirming</hi> and <hi>denying:</hi> By <hi>affirmatively</hi> expreſſing the moſt pernicious Nature and Tendency of their Wickedneſs, in the 16. Verſe. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Miſery are in their Ways</hi> And then by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> all Good, or Godlineſs, of them, in the 17, &amp; 18, Verſes, <hi>And the Way of Peace have they not known: There is no Fear of God before their Eyes.</hi> And then, leſt the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould think theſe Paſſages of their Law don't concern them, and that only the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in them, the Apoſtle ſhews in the Verſe of the Text, not only that <hi>they</hi> are not exempt, but that <hi>they</hi> eſpecially muſt be underſtood, <hi>Now we know, that whatſoever Things the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law.</hi> By thoſe that are <hi>under the Law,</hi> is meant the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by thoſe that are <hi>without Law;</hi> as appears by the 12th Verſe of the preceeding Chapter. There is ſpecial Reaſon to underſtand the Law, as ſpeaking <hi>to</hi> and <hi>of</hi> them, to whom it was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately given. And therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable in exempting themſelves. And if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Places of the Old Teſtament, whence theſe Paſſages are taken, we ſhall ſee plainly that ſpecial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is had to the Wickedneſs of the People of that Nation, in every one of them. So that the Law ſhuts all up in univerſal and deſperate Wickedneſs, <hi>that every Mouth may be ſtopped.</hi> The Mouths of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> notwithſtanding all thoſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges by which they were diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>

The Things that the Law ſays, are ſufficient to ſtop the Mouths of all Mankind, in two Reſpects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To ſtop them from <hi>boaſting</hi> of their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to do; as the Apoſtle obſerves in the 23. Verſe of the preceeding Chapter.—That the Apoſtle has Reſpect to ſtopping their Mouths in this Reſpect, appears by the 27th Verſe of the Context, <hi>Where is Boaſting then? It is excluded.</hi> The Law ſtops our Mouths from making of any Plea for Life, or the Favour of God, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. To ſtop them from making any <hi>Excuſe</hi> for our ſelves, or <hi>Objection</hi> againſt the Execution of the Sentence of the Law, or the Infliction of the Puniſhment that it threatens. That this is intended, appears by the Words immediately following, <hi>That all the World may become guilty before God.</hi> That is that they may <hi>appear</hi> to be guilty, and ſtand convicted before God, and juſtly lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Condemnation of his Law, as <hi>guilty of Death,</hi> according to the jewiſh Way of Speaking.</p>
                     <p>And thus the Apoſtle proves that no Fleſh can be juſtified in God's Sight, by the Deeds of the Law; as he draws the Concluſion in the following Verſe; and ſo prepares the Way for the eſtabliſhing of the great Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Juſtification by Faith alone, which he proceeds to do, in the next Verſe to that, and in the following Part of the Chapter, and of the Epiſtle.</p>

                        <hi>'Tis juſt with God eternally to caſt off, and deſtroy Sinners.</hi>

                     <p>—For this is the Puniſhment which the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns to; which the Things that the Law ſays may well ſtop every Mouth from all Manner of Objection againſt.</p>
                     <p>The Truth of this Doctrine may appear, by the joint Conſideration of two Things, <hi>viz. Man' Sinfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>God's Sovereignty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="unknown:004239_0203_100409B8B21E6220"/>
I. It appears from the Conſideration of Man's Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And that whether we conſider <hi>the infinitely evil Nature of all Sin,</hi> or <hi>how much Sin Men are guilty of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. If we conſider the infinite Evil, and Heinouſneſs of Sin in general. 'Tis not unjuſt in God to inflict what Puniſhment is deſerved; becauſe the very Notion of deſerving any Puniſhment is, that it may be juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: A deſerved Puniſhment and a juſt Puniſhment are the ſame Thing. To ſay that one deſerves ſuch a Puniſhment, and yet to ſay that he don't juſtly deſerve it, is a Contradiction; and if he juſtly deſerves it, then it may be juſtly inflicted.</p>
                     <p>Every Crime or Fault deſerves a greater or leſſer Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, in Proportion as the Crime it ſelf is greater or leſs. If any Fault deſerves Puniſhment, then ſo much the greater the Fault, ſo much the greater is the Puniſhment deſerved. The faulty Nature of any Thing, is the formal Ground and Reaſon of its Deſert of Puniſhment; and therefore the more any Thing hath of this Nature, the more Puniſhment it deſerves. And therefore the Terribleneſs of the Degree of Puniſhment, let it be never ſo terrible, is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Juſtice of it, if the Proportion does but hold, between the Heinouſneſs of the Crime, and the Dreadfulneſs of the Puniſhment. So that if there be any ſuch Thing as a Fault infinitely Heinous, it will follow that 'tis juſt to inflict a Puniſhment for it, that is infinitely dreadful.</p>
                     <p>A Crime is more or leſs Heinous, according as we are under greater or leſſer Obligations to the contrary. This is ſelf-evident, becauſe it is herein that the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalneſs, or Faultineſs of any Thing conſiſts, that it is contrary to what we are obliged or bound to, or what ought to be in us. So the Faultineſs of one Beings ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting another, is in Proportion to his Obligation to love him: The Crime of one Beings deſpiſing, and caſting Contempt on another, is proportionably more or leſs Heinous as he was under greater or leſſer Obligations to honour him: The Fault of diſobeying another, is greater or leſs,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:004239_0204_100404F76065B768"/>
as any one is under greater or leſſer Obligations to obey him. And therefore if there be any Being, that we are under infinite Obligations to love, and honour, and obey, the Contrary towards him muſt be infinitely Faulty.</p>
                     <p>Our Obligation to love, honour, and obey any Being, is in Proportion to his Lovelineſs, Honourableneſs, and Authority. For that is the very Meaning of the Words, when we ſay any one is very lovely; it is the ſame as to ſay, that he is one very much to be loved: Or if we ſay ſuch an one is more honourable than another; the Meaning of the Words is, that he is one that we are more obliged to honour. If we ſay any one has great Authority over us, 'tis the ſame as to ſay that he has great Right to our Subjection and Obedience.</p>
                     <p>But God is a Being infinitely lovely, becauſe he hath infinite Excellency and Beauty. To have infinite Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Beauty, is the ſame Thing as to have infinite Lovelineſs. He is a Being of infinite Greatneſs, Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory; and therefore is infinitely honourable. He is infinitely exalted above the greateſt Potentates of the Earth, and higheſt Angels in Heaven; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is infinitely more honourable than they. His Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over us is infinite; and the Ground of his Right to our Obedience, is infinitely ſtrong; for he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worthy to be obeyed in himſelf, and we have an abſolute univerſal and infinite Dependence upon him.</p>
                     <p>So that Sin againſt God being a Violation of infinite Obligations, muſt be a Crime infinitely heinous; and ſo deſerving of infinite Puniſhment.—Nothing is more agreable to the common Senſe of Mankind, than that Sins committed againſt any one, muſt be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably heinous, to the Dignity of the Being offended and abuſed; as 'tis alſo agreable to the Word of God. 1 Sam. 2 25. <hi>If one Man ſin againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him;</hi> (i. e. ſhall judge him, and inflict a finite Puniſhment, ſuch as finite Judges can inflict;) <hi>but if a Man ſin againſt the Lord. Who ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> for him!</hi> This was the Aggravation of Sin that made <hi>Joſeph</hi> afraid
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:004239_0205_100409BDA89C35B0"/>
of it, Gen 39 9. <hi>How ſhall I commit this great Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> This was the Aggravation of <hi>David's</hi> Sin, in compariſon of which he eſteemed all others as nothing, becauſe they were infinitely exceeded by it. Pſalm 51. 4 <hi>Againſt thee,</hi> thee only have I ſinned.—The Eternity of the Puniſhment of ungodly Men renders it infinite; and it renders it no more than infinite; and therefore renders no more than proportionable to the Heinouſneſs of what they are guilty of.</p>
                     <p>If there be <hi>any Evil</hi> or Faultineſs in Sin againſt God, there is certainly <hi>infinite Evil:</hi> For if it be any Fault at all, it has an infinite Aggravation, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an infinite Object. If it be ever ſo ſmall upon other Accounts; yet if it be any Thing, it has <hi>one</hi> infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Dimenſion; and ſo is an infinite Evil. Which may be illuſtrated by this: If we ſuppoſe a Thing to have infinite Length, but no Breadth and Thickneſs, but to be only a meer mathematical Line, it is nothing: But if it have any Breadth and Thickneſs at all, tho' never ſo ſmall, yet if it have but one infinite Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Length, the Quantity of it is infinite; it exceeds the Quantity of any Thing, however broad, thick and long, wherein theſe Dimenſions are all finite.</p>
                     <p>So that the Objections that are made againſt the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Puniſhment of Sin, from the Neceſſity, or rather previous Certainty of the Futurition of Sin, ariſing from the Decree of God, or unavoidable original Corruption of Nature, if they argue any Thing, don't argue againſt the <hi>Infiniteneſs of the Degree</hi> of the Faultineſs of Sin <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,</hi> and <hi>no otherwiſe</hi> than they argue againſt <hi>any</hi> Faultineſs <hi>at all:</hi> For if this Neceſſity or Certainty, leaves any Evil at all in Sin, that Fault muſt be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite by Reaſon of the infinite Object.</p>
                     <p>But every ſuch Objector, as would argue from hence, that there is no Fault at all in Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confutes himſelf, and ſhews his own Inſincerity in his Objection. For at the ſame Time that he objects, that Men's Acts are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from God's Decrees, and original Sin, and that this
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:004239_0206_100409C0495A7C48"/>
Kind of Neceſſity is inconſiſtent with Faultineſs in the Act, his own Practice ſhews that he don't believe what he objects to be true: Otherwiſe why does he at all blame Men? Or why are ſuch Perſons at all diſpleaſed with Men, for abuſive, injurious, and ungrateful Acts towards them? Whatever they pretend, by this they ſhew that indeed they do believe that there is no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in Men's Acts, from divine Decrees, or Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature, that is inconſiſtent with Blame. And if their Objection be this, That this previous Certainty is by God's <hi>own Ordering,</hi> and that where God orders an antecedent Certainty of Acts, he transfers all the Fault from the Actor on himſelf; their Practice ſhews, that at the ſame Time they don't <hi>believe this;</hi> but fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Contrary: For when they are abuſed <hi>by Men,</hi> they are diſpleaſed <hi>with Men,</hi> and not with God only.</p>
                     <p>The Light of Nature teaches all Mankind, that when an Injury is voluntary, it is Faulty, without any Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Conſideration of what there might be previouſly to determine the Futurition of that evil Act of the Will: And it really teaches this, as much to thoſe that object and cavil moſt, as to others; as their univerſal Practice ſhews. By which it appears that ſuch Objections are inſincere and perverſe—Men will mention others corrupt Nature in their own Caſe, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. That it is juſt with God eternally to caſt off wicked Men, may more abundantly appear, if we conſider how much Sin they are guilty of. From what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

ſaid, it appears, that if Men were guilty of Sin, but in one Particular, that is ſufficient Ground of their eternal Rejection and Condemnation: If they are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that is enough: Meerly this might be ſufficient to keep them from ever lifting up their Heads, and cauſe them to ſmite on their Breaſts, with the Publican that cried, <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> But ſinful Men are not only thus, but they are <hi>full of Sin;</hi> full of Principles of Sin, and full of Acts of Sin: Their Guilt is like great Mountains, heaped one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till the Pile is grown up to Heaven.

It was fit that it ſhould be at the Ordering of the divine Wiſdom and good Pleaſure, whether every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Man ſhould ſtand for himſelf, or whether the firſt Father of Mankind, ſhould be appointed as the moral and federal Head, and Repreſentative, of the Reſt. If God has not Liberty in this Matter to determine either of theſe two, as he pleaſes, it muſt be becauſe determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the firſt Father of Men ſhould repreſent the Reſt, and not that every one ſhould ſtand for himſelf, is injurious to Mankind. For if it be not injurious to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, how is it unjuſt? But it is not injurious to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for there is nothing in the Nature of the Caſe it ſelf, that makes it <hi>better</hi> for Mankind, that each Man ſhould ſtand for himſelf, than that all ſhould be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by their common Father; as the leaſt Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Conſideration will convince any one. And if there be nothing in the Nature of the Thing, that makes the former better for Mankind than the latter, then it will follow, that Mankind are not hurt in God's chooſing and appointing the latter, rather than the former; or which is the ſame Thing, that it is not injurious to Mankind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 When Men are fallen, and become ſinful, God by his Sovereignty has a Right to determine about their Redemption as he pleaſes. He has a Right to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether he will redeem <hi>any</hi> or no. He might, if he had pleaſed, have left all to periſh, or might have redeemed all. Or, he may redeem <hi>ſome,</hi> and leave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and if he doth ſo, he may take <hi>who he pleaſes,</hi> and leave who he pleaſes. To ſuppoſe that all have forfeited his Favour, and deſerved to periſh, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he may not leave any one individual of them to periſh, implies a Contradiction; becauſe it ſuppoſes that ſuch an one has a Claim to God's Favour, and is

Government, yet it has been in you; you have not been quiet in the Frame of your Mind; you have had the Heart of a Viper within, and have been ready to ſpit Venom at God: And 'tis well if ſometimes you have not actually done it, by tolerating blaſphemous Thoughts, and malignant Riſings of Heart againſt him; yea, and the Frame of your Heart in ſome Meaſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, in an impatient and fretful Behaviour.</p>

Here therefore I would endeavour to convince you that you are under a groſs Miſtake in this Matter. And 1. I would endeavour to ſhew the Weakneſs of the <hi>Grounds</hi> of your Miſtake. And, 2. To demonſtrate to you, that you have rejected, and do wilfully reject Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>1. That you may ſee the Weakneſs of the Grounds of your Miſtake, conſider,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There is a great Deal of Difference between a Willingneſs not to be damned, and a being willing to receive Chriſt for your Saviour. You have the former; there is no doubt to be made of that; no Body ſuppoſes that you love Miſery ſo well, as to chuſe an Eternity of it: And ſo doubtleſs you are willing to be ſaved from eternal Miſery. But that is a very different Thing from being willing to come to Chriſt: Perſons very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly miſtake the one for the other, but they are quite two Things: You may love the Deliverance, but hate the Deliverer. You tell of a <hi>Willingneſs;</hi> but conſider what is the Object of that Willingneſs: It don't reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Chriſt; the Way of Salvation by him is not at all the Object of it; but 'tis wholly terminated on your Eſcape from Miſery: The Inclination of your Will goes no further than <hi>ſelf,</hi> it never reaches Chriſt. You are willing not to be miſerable; that is you love your ſelf; and there your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> Choice terminates: And 'tis but a vain Pretence, and Deluſion, to ſay or think that you are willing to accept of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There is certainly a great Deal of Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a forced Compliance, and a free Willingneſs. Force and Freedom can't conſiſt together. Now that Willingneſs that you tell of, whereby you think you are willing to have Chriſt for a Saviour, is meerly a forced Thing. Your Heart does not go out after Chriſt of it ſelf; but you are forced and driven to ſeek an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him Chriſt has no Share at all in your Heart; there is no Manner of cloſing of the Heart with him. This forced Compliance is not what Chriſt ſeeks of you; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>If you refuſe thus to receive Chriſt, how juſt is it that Chriſt ſhould refuſe to receive you! How reaſonable are Chriſt's Terms, who offers to ſave all thoſe that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, or with a good Will, accept of him for their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our! Who can rationally expect that Chriſt ſhould force himſelf upon any Man, to be his Saviour? Or what can be looked for more reaſonable, than that all that would be ſaved by Chriſt, ſhould heartily and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertain him? And ſurely it would be very diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for Chriſt to offer himſelf upon lower Terms.</p>
                        <p>But I would now proceed,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To ſhew that 'tis really ſo that you are not willing to have Chriſt for a Saviour. To convince you of it, conſider,</p>
                        <p>1. How it is poſſible that you ſhould be willing to accept of Chriſt as a Saviour from the Deſert of a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that you are not ſenſible you have deſerved. If you are truly willing to accept of Chriſt as a Saviour, it muſt be as a Sacrifice to make Atonement for your Guilt: Chriſt came into the World on this Errand, to offer himſelf as an Atonement, to anſwer for our Deſert of Puniſhment. But how is it poſſible that you ſhould be willing to accept of Chriſt, as an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that Guilt that you be not ſenſible that you have? How can you be willing to have Chriſt for a Saviour from a Deſert of Hell, if you be not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that you have a Deſert of Hell? If you have not really deſerved everlaſting Burnings in Hell, then the very Offer of an Atonement for ſuch a Deſert is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon you. If you have no ſuch Guilt upon you, then the very Offer of a Satisfaction for that Guilt is an Injury, becauſe it implies in it a Charge of Guilt that you are free from. Now therefore 'tis impoſſible that a Man that is not convinced of his Guilt, can be willing to accept of an Offer; becauſe he can't be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to accept the Charge that the Offer implies: that
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:004239_0231_10042E28DD537A10"/>
he looks upon as injurious. A Man that is not convinced that he has deſerved ſo dreadful a Puniſhment, can't willingly ſubmit to be charged with it; if he thinks he is willing, it is but a meer forced, feigned Buſineſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in his Heart he looks upon himſelf greatly injured: And therefore he can't freely accept of Chriſt, under that Notion, of a Saviour from that Guilt, and from the Deſert of ſuch a Puniſhment; for ſuch an Acceptance is an implicit owning that he does deſerve ſuch a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                        <p>I don't ſay, but that Men may be willing to be ſaved from an undeſerved Puniſhment; they may rather not ſuffer it than ſuffer it: But a Man can't be willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one at God's Hands, under the Notion of a Saviour from a Puniſhment deſerved from him, that he thinks he has not deſerved; 'tis impoſſible that any one ſhould freely allow a Saviour under that Notion. Such an one can't like the Way of Salvation by Chriſt; for if he thinks he has not deſerved Hell, then he will think that Freedom from Hell is a Debt; and therefore can't willingly and heartily receive it as a free Gift.—If a King ſhould condemn a Man to ſome exceeding torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death, which the condemned Perſon thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not deſerving off, but looked upon the Sentence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and cruel, and the King, when the Time of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion drew nigh, ſhould offer him his Pardon, under the Notion of a very great Act of Grace and Clemency, the condemned Perſon never could willingly and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily allow it under that Notion, becauſe he judged himſelf unjuſtly condemned.</p>
                        <p>Now by this it is evident that you are not willing to accept of Chriſt as your Saviour; becauſe you never yet had ſuch a Senſe of your own Sinfulneſs, and ſuch a Conviction of your great Guilt in God's Sight, as to be indeed convinced that you lay juſtly condemned to the Puniſhment of Hell. You never was convinced that you had forfeited all Favour, and was in God's Hands, and at his ſovereign and arbitrary Diſpoſal, to be either deſtroyed or ſaved, juſt as he pleaſed. You never yet was convinced of the Sovereignty of God. Hence are
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:004239_0232_10042E2F930FB708"/>
there ſo many Objections ariſing againſt the Juſtice of your Puniſhment, from original Sin, and from God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, from Mercy ſhown to others, and the like.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That you be not ſincerely willing to accept of Chriſt as your Saviour, appears by this, That you never have been convinced that he is ſufficient for the Work; of your Salvation. You never had a Sight or Senſe of any ſuch Excellency or Worthineſs in Chriſt, as ſhould give ſuch great Value to his Blood and his Mediation with God, as that it was ſufficient to be accepted for ſuch exceeding guilty Creatures, &amp; thoſe that have ſo provoked God, and expoſed themſelves to ſuch amazing Wrath. A ſaying it is ſo, and a cuſtomary yielding &amp; allowing it to be as others ſay, is a very different Thing from being really convinced of it, and a being made ſenſible of it in your own Heart. The Sufficiency of Chriſt depends upon, or rather conſiſts in his Excellency. It is becauſe he is ſo excellent a Perſon, that his Blood is of ſufficient Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to atone for Sin, and 'tis hence that his Obedience is ſo worthy in God's Sight; 'tis alſo hence that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion is ſo prevalent; and therefore thoſe that never had any ſpiritual Sight or Senſe of Chriſt's Excellency, can't be ſenſible of his Sufficiency.</p>
                        <p>And that Sinners be not convinced that Chriſt is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Work he has undertaken, appears moſt manifeſtly when they are under great Convictions of their Sin, and Danger of God's Wrath. Though it may be before they thought they could allow Chriſt to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, (for it is eaſy to allow any one to be ſufficient for our Defence, at a Time when we ſee no Danger,) yet when they come to be ſenſible of their Guilt, and God's Wrath, what diſcouraging Thoughts do they entertain! How are they ready to draw towards Deſpair, as if there no Hope or Help for ſuch wicked Creatures as they! The Reaſon is, They have no Apprehenſion or Senſe of any other Way that God's Majeſty can be vindicated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only in their Miſery: To tell them of the Blood of Chriſt, ſignifies nothing, it don't relieve their ſinking deſpairing Hearts. This makes it moſt evident that
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:004239_0233_10042E0428A63448"/>
they are not convinced that Chriſt is ſufficient to be their Mediator.</p>
                        <p>And as long as they are unconvinced of this, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould be willing to accept of him as <hi>their Mediator</hi> and Saviour. A Man in diſtreſſing Fear won't willingly betake himſelf to a Fort that he judges not ſufficient to defend him from the Enemy: A Man won't willingly venture out into the Ocean, in a Ship that he ſuſpects is leaky, and will ſink before he gets through his Voyage.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. 'Tis evident that you are not willing to have Chriſt ſon your Saviour, becauſe you have ſo mean an Opinion of him, that you durſt not truſt his Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. One that undertakes to be the Saviour of Souls had need be faithful; for if he fails in ſuch a Truſt, how great is the Loſs! But you are not convinced of Chriſt's Faithfulneſs; as is evident, becauſe at ſuch Times as when you are in a conſiderable Meaſure ſenſible of your Guilt and God's Anger, you can't be convinced that Chriſt is willing to accept of you, or that he ſtands ready to receive you if you ſhould come to him, though Chriſt ſo much invites you to come to him, and has ſo fully declared that he won't reject you, if you do come; as particularly, John 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 37. <hi>He that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt cut.</hi> Now, there is no Man can be hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willing to truſt his eternal Welfare in the Hands of an unfaithful Perſon, or one whoſe Faithfulneſs he ſuſpects.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You are not willing to be ſaved in that Way by Chriſt, as is evident, becauſe you are not willing that your own Goodneſs ſhould be ſet at nought. In the Way of Salvation by Chriſt Men's own Goodneſs is wholly ſet at nought, there is no Account at all made of it. Now you can't be willing to be ſaved in a Way wherein your own Goodneſs is ſet at nought, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by that, that you make much of it your ſelf. You make much of your Prayers and Pains in Religion, and are often thinking of them; how conſiderable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do they appear to you, when you look back upon them! And how much are ſome of you in thinking how much more
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:004239_0234_10042DFC0A7ABD40"/>
you have done than ſome others, and in expecting ſome Reſpect or Regard that God ſhould manifeſt to what you do? Now, if you make ſo much of what you do your ſelf, 'tis impoſſible that you ſhould be freely wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that God ſhould make nothing of it. As we may ſee in other Things; if a Man is proud of a great Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, or if he values himſelf much upon his honourable Office, or his great Abilities, 'tis impoſſible that he ſhould like it, and heartily approve of it, that others ſhould make light of theſe Things, and deſpiſe them.</p>
                        <p>Seeing therefore that 'tis ſo evident that you refuſe to accept of Chriſt as your Saviour, Why is Chriſt to be blamed that he don't ſave you? Chriſt has offered himſelf to you to be your Saviour in Time paſt, and he continues offering himſelf ſtill, and you continue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him, and yet complain that he don't ſave you.—So ſtrangely unreaſonable, and inconſiſtent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are Goſpel Sinners!</p>
                        <p>But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>xpect that there are many of you, that in your Hearts ſtill object; your Mouths be not ſtopp'd.—Such an Objection as this, is probably now in the Hearts of many here preſent.</p>

                           <hi>Object.</hi> If it be ſo, that I am not willing to have Chriſt for my Saviour, yet I can't make my ſelf willing.</p>
                        <p>But I would give an Anſwer to this Objection, by laying down two Things, that muſt be acknowleged to be exceeding evident.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 'Tis no Excuſe that you can't receive Chriſt of your ſelf, unleſs you would if you could. This is ſo evident of it ſelf, that it ſcarce needs any Proof. Certainly if Perſons would not if they could, it is juſt the ſame Thing as to the Blame that lies upon them, whether they can or cannot. If you were willing, and then found that you could not, your being unable would alter the Caſe, and might be ſome Excuſe; becauſe then the Defect would not be in your Will, but only in your Ability: But as long as you will not, it is no Matter what the Ability is, whether you have Ability or no Ability.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="228" facs="unknown:004239_0235_100404F917213BF0"/>
If you be not willing to accept of Chriſt, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that you have no ſincere <hi>Willingneſs to be willing;</hi> becauſe the Will always neceſſarily approves <hi>of,</hi> and reſts <hi>in</hi> its own Acts. To ſuppoſe the Contrary would be to ſuppoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> a Contradiction; it would be to ſuppoſe that a Man's Will is contrary to it ſelf, or that he wills contrary to what he himſelf wills. So that as you are not willing to come to Chriſt, and can't make your ſelf willing, ſo you have no ſincere Deſire to be willing; and therefore may moſt juſtly periſh without a Saviour. There is no Excuſe at all for you; for ſay what you will about your Inability, the Seat of your Blame lies in your perverſe Will, that is an Enemy to the Saviour. 'Tis in vain for you to tell of your Want of Power, as long as your Will is found defective. If a Man ſhould hate you, and devour you, and exalt himſelf, and ſmite you in the Face, and tell you that he did it volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and becauſe he had a Mind to, but only ſhould tell you at the ſame Time, that he hated you ſo much that he could not help chuſing and willing ſo to do, would you take it the more patiently for that? Would not your Indignation be rather ſtirr'd up the more?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If you would be willing if you could, that is no Excuſe, unleſs your Willingneſs to be willing be ſincere. That which is hypocritical, and don't come from the Heart, but is meerly forced, ought wholly to be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, as worthy of no Conſideration, and that becauſe common Senſe teaches that that which is not hearty but hypocritical is indeed nothing, being only a Shew of what is not; but that which is good for nothing, ought to go for nothing. But if you ſet aſide all that is not free, &amp; call nothing a Willingneſs but a free hearty Willingneſs, then ſee how the Caſe ſtands, &amp; whether or no you have not loſt all your Excuſe for ſtanding out againſt the Calls of the Goſpel You ſay you would make your ſelf willing to accept if you could; but 'tis not from any good Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that you are willing for that; 'tis not from any free Inclination, or true Reſpect to Chriſt, or any Love to your Duty, or any Spirit of Obedience, or from the influence of any Manner of real Reſpect, or Tendency

in your Heart, towards any Thing that is good, or from any other Principle than ſuch as is in the Hearts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and would make them have the ſame Sort of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs in the ſame Circumſtances. It is therefore evident that there can be no Goodneſs in that <hi>woulding to be willing</hi> to come to Chriſt: And that which has no <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> can't be an Excuſe for any <hi>Badneſs.</hi> If there be no <hi>good</hi> in it, then it ſignifies nothing &amp; weighs nothing, when put into the Scales to counterbalance that which is <hi>bad.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sinners therefore ſpend their Time in fooliſh arguing and objecting, making much of that which is good for nothing, making thoſe Excuſes that be not worth offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—'Tis in vain to keep making Objections: You ſtand juſtly condemned: The Blame lies all at your Door: Thruſt it off from you as often as you will, it will return upon you: Sew Fig leaves as long as you will, your Nakedneſs will appear: You continue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wickedly rejecting Jeſus Chriſt, and won't have him for your Saviour, and therefore 'tis ſottiſh Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in you to charge Chriſt with Injuſtice that he don't ſave you.</p>
                        <p>Here is the Sin of Unbelief! Thus the Guilt of that great Sin lies upon you! If you never had thus treated a Saviour, you might moſt juſtly have been damned to all Eternity: It would but be exactly agreable to your Treatment of God. But beſides this, when God not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, has offered you his own dear Son to ſave you from this endleſs Miſery you had deſerved, and not only ſo, but to make you happy eternally in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf, you refuſed him, and would not have him for your Saviour, and ſtill refuſe to comply with the Offers of the Goſpel; what can render any Perſon more inexcuſeable? If you ſhould now periſh for ever, what can you have to ſay?</p>
                        <p>Hereby the Juſtice of God in your Deſtruction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in two Reſpects,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is <hi>more abundantly</hi> manifeſt <hi>that it is juſt that you ſhould be deſtroyed.</hi> Juſtice never appears ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous as it does after refuſed and abuſed Mercy. Juſtice
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:004239_0237_100409B345284060"/>
in <hi>Damnation</hi> appears abundantly the more clear and bright, after a wilful Rejection of offered <hi>Salvation.</hi> What can an offended Prince do more than freely offer Pardon to a condemned Male factor? And if he refuſes to accept of it, will any one ſay that his Execution is unjuſt?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>God's Juſtice</hi> will appear <hi>in your greater Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Beſides the Guilt that you would have had if a Saviour never had been offered, you bring that great additional Guilt upon you, of moſt ungratefully refuſing offered Deliverance. What more baſe and vile Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God can there be, than for you, when juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to eternal Miſery, and ready to be executed, &amp; God graciouſly ſends his own Son, who comes &amp; knocks at your Door with a Pardon in his Hand, and not only a Pardon, but a Deed of eternal Glory; I ſay, what can be worſe, then for you out of Diſlike, and Enmity againſt God, and his Son, to refuſe to accept thoſe Benefits at his Hands! How juſtly may the Anger of God be greatly incenſed and increaſed by it! When a Sinner thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully rejects Mercy, his laſt Error is worſe than the firſt; this is more heinous than all his former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and may juſtly bring down more fearful Wrath upon him.</p>
                        <p>The Heinouſneſs of this Sin of rejecting a Saviour eſpecially appears in two Things,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Greatneſs of the Benefits offered; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Greatneſs of the Deliverance, which is from inexpreſſible Degrees of <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> of Heart and Life, the leaſt Degree of which is infinitely Evil; and from Miſery that is everlaſting; and in the Greatneſs and Glory of the Inheritance purchaſed and offered, Heb. 2. 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Wonderfulneſs of the Way in which theſe Benefits are procured and offered. That God ſhould lay Help on his own Son, when our Caſe was ſo deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that Help could be had in no meer Creature; and that He ſhould undertake for us, and ſhould come into the World, and take upon him our Nature, and ſhould
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:004239_0238_1004054C17F3F540"/>
not only appear in a low State of Life, but ſhould die ſuch a Death, and endure ſuch Torments and Contempt for Sinners while Enemies, How wonderful is it! And what Tongue or Pen can ſet forth the Greatneſs of the Ingratitude, Baſeneſs and Perverſeneſs that there is in it, when a periſhing Sinner that is in the moſt extreme Neceſſity of Salvation, rejects it, after it is procured in ſuch a Way as this! That ſo glorious a Perſon ſhould be thus treated, and that when he comes on ſo gracious an Errand! That he ſhould ſtand ſo long offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and calling and inviting, as he has done to many of you, and all to no Purpoſe, but all the while be ſet at nought!—Surely you might juſtly be caſt into Hell without one more Offer of a Saviour! Yea, and thruſt down into the loweſt Hell! Herein you have exceeded the very Devils; for they never rejected the Offers of ſuch glorious Mercy; no, nor of any Mercy at all. This will be the diſtinguiſhing Condemnation of Goſpel Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, John 3. 18. <hi>He that hath not believed is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That outward Smoothneſs of your Carriage towards Chriſt, that Appearance of Reſpect to Him in your Looks, your Speeches, and Geſtures, don't argue but that you ſet him at nought in your Heart. There may be much of theſe outward Shews of Reſpect, and yet you be like <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed the Son of Man with a kiſs; and like thoſe Mockers that bowed the Knee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and at the ſame Time ſpit in his Face.</p>
                        <p>III. If God ſhould for ever caſt you off and deſtroy you, it would be <hi>agreable to your Treatment of others:</hi> It would be no other than what would be exactly anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable to your Behaviour towards your Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that have the ſame humane <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p n="1">1. You have many of you been <hi>oppoſite</hi> in your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>to the Salvation of others.</hi> There are ſeveral Ways

that natural Men manifeſt a Spirit of Oppoſition againſt the Salvation of others Souls It ſometimes appears by a Fear that their Companions, Acquaintance, and Equals will obtain Mercy, and ſo become unſpeakably happier than they. It is ſometimes manifeſted by an Uneaſineſs at the News of others having hopefully obtained. It appears when Perſons envy others for it, and diſlike them the more, and diſreliſh their Talk, and avoid their Company, and can't bear to hear their religious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and eſpecially to receive Warnings and Counſels from them. And it oftentimes appears by their Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to entertain charitable Thoughts of them, and their being difficultly brought to believe that it is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, that they have obtained Mercy, and a Forwardneſs to liſten to any Thing that ſeems to contradict it. The Devil hated to own <hi>Job'</hi>s Sincerity, <hi>Job 1. 7, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Verſes</hi> 3, 4, 5. There appears very often much of this Spirit of the Devil in natural Men. Sometimes they are ready to make a Ridicule of others pretended Godlineſs: They ſpeak of the Ground of others Hopes, as the Enemies of the <hi>Jews</hi> did of the Wall that they built. Neh. 4. 3 <hi>Now</hi> Tobiah <hi>the</hi> Ammonite <hi>was by him, and he ſaid, that which they build, if a Fox go up, he ſhall even break down their Stone Wall.</hi> There are many that join with <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and are of the ſame Spirit with them. There always was, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will be, an Enmity betwixt the Seed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and the Seed of the Woman. It appeared in <hi>Cain</hi> who hated his Brother, becauſe he was more acceptable to God than himſelf; and it appears ſtill in theſe Times, and in this Place. There are many that are like the elder Brother, who could not bear it that the Prodigal when he returned ſhould be received with ſuch Joy and good Entertainment, and was put into a Fret by it, both againſt his Brother that had returned, and his Father that made him ſo welcome. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</p>

How juſt therefore is it that God ſhould be oppoſite to your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation! If you have ſo little Love or Mercy in you, as to begrutch your Neighbours Salvation, whom you have no cauſe to hate, but the Law of God and Nature requires you to love, why is God bound to exerciſe ſuch infinite Love and Mercy to you, as to ſave you at the Price of his own Blood, that he is no Way bound to love, but that have deſerved his Hatred a thouſand &amp; a thouſand Times? You are not willing that others ſhould be converted, that have behaved themſelves injuriouſly towards you; and yet will you count it hard if God don't beſtow converting Grace upon you, that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ten thouſand Times as ill of God, as ever any of your Neighbours have of you? You are oppoſite to God's ſhewing Mercy to theſe and thoſe, that you think have been vicious Perſons, and are very unworthy of ſuch Mercy.—Is others Unworthineſs a juſt Reaſon why God ſhould not beſtow Mercy on them? And yet will God be hard, if notwithſtanding all your Unworthineſs, &amp; the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minableneſs of your Spirit &amp; Practice in his Sight, he don't ſhow <hi>you</hi> Mercy? You would have God beſtow liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on you, and upbraid not; but yet when he ſhews Mercy to others, you are ready to upbraid, as ſoon as you hear of it; you immediately are thinking with your ſelf how ill they have behaved themſelves; and it may be your Mouths on this Occaſion are open, enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating and aggravating the Sins they have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of.—You would have God bury all your Faults, and wholly blot out all your Tranſgreſſions; but yet if he beſtows Mercy on others, it may be you will take that Occaſion to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

will quarrel with God, and condemn him, and fret at his Diſpenſations, becauſe you think he ſeems oppoſite to ſhewing Mercy to you.—One would think that the Conſideration of theſe Things ſhould for ever ſtop your Mouth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Conſider how you have <hi>promoted others Damnation.</hi> Many of you by the bad Examples you have ſet, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Minds of others, by your ſinful Converſation, by leading them into Sin, or ſtrengthening them in Sin, and by the Miſchief that you have done in humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety other Ways that might be mentioned, have been guilty of thoſe Things that have tended to others Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. You have heretofore appeared on the Side of Sin and Satan, and have behaved your ſelf ſo as much to ſtrengthen their Intereſt, &amp; have been many Ways ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to others Sins, have harden'd others Hearts, and thereby have done what has tended to the Ruin of their Souls.</p>
                        <p>And without Doubt there are thoſe here preſent, that have been in a great Meaſure the Means of others Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Though it is true that it is determined of God who he will ſave, and who not, from all Eternity, yet one Man may really be a Means of others Damnation, as well as Salvation. Chriſt charges the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> with this, Matth. 23. 13. <hi>Ye ſhut up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven againſt Men; for ye neither go in your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entring to go in.</hi> We have no Reaſon to think that this Congregation has none in it, that are curſed from Day to Day, by poor Souls that are roaring out in Hell, whoſe Damnation they have been a Means of, or have greatly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to.</p>

Children? If their Children be not gone to Hell, 'tis no thank to them; 'tis not becauſe they have not done what has tended to their Deſtruction.—Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have had no more Regard to others Salvation, and have promoted their Damnation, how juſtly might God leave you to periſh your ſelf?</p>
                        <p>IV. If God ſhould eternally caſt you off, it would but be <hi>agreable to your own Behaviour towards your ſelf:</hi> And that in two Reſpects;</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In being ſo <hi>Careleſs of your own Salvation.</hi> You have refuſed to take Care for your Salvation, as God has <hi>counſell'd</hi> and <hi>commanded you,</hi> from Time to Time; and why may not God neglect it, now you <hi>ſeek it of him?</hi> Is God obliged to be more careful of your Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, than you are, either of your own Happineſs, or his Glory? Is God bound to take that Care for you, out of Love to you, that you won't take for your ſelf, either from Love to your ſelf, or Regard to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? How long, and how greatly, have you neglected the Welfare of your precious Soul, refuſing to take Pains and deny your ſelf, or put your ſelf a little out of your Way for your Salvation, while God has been calling upon you! Neither your Duty to God, nor Love to your own Soul, were enough to induce you to do little Things for your own eternal Welfare; and yet do you now expect that God ſhould do great Things, putting forth almighty Power, &amp; exerciſing infinite Mercy for it? You was urged to take care for your Salvation, and not to put it off: You was told that that was the beſt Time, before you grew older, and that it might be, if you would put it off, God would not hear you afterwards; but yet you would not hearken; you would run the Venture of it. Now how juſtly might God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſo, that it ſhould be too late, leaving you to ſeek in Vain! You was told that you would repent of it, if you delayed; but you would not hear: How juſtly therefore may God give you Cauſe to repent of it, by refuſing to ſhow you Mercy now! If God ſees you go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in Ways contrary to his Commands, and his Glory,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:004239_0243_10042E45A505F760"/>
and requires you to forſake them, and tells you that they are Ways that tend to the Deſtruction of your own Soul, and therefore Counſels you to avoid them, and you refuſe, how juſt would it be if God ſhould be provoked by it, henceforward to be as careleſs of the Good of your Soul as you are your ſelf!</p>
                        <p n="2">2. You have not only neglected your Salvation, but you <hi>have wilfully taken direct Courſes to undo your ſelf.</hi> You have gone on in thoſe Ways and Practices that have directly tended to your Damnation, and have been perverſe and obſtinate in it.—You can't plead Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; you had all the Light ſet before you that you could deſire; God told you that you was <hi>undoing</hi> your ſelf; but yet you would do it: He told you that the Path you was going in led to Deſtruction, and counſel'd you to avoid it; but you would not hearken: How juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore may God leave you to be <hi>undone!</hi> You have obſtinately perſiſted to travel in the Way that leads to Hell for a long Time, contrary to God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Counſels and Commands, till it may be at length you are got almoſt to your Journey's End, and are come near to Hell's Gate, and ſo begin to be ſenſible of your Danger and Miſery; and now account it unjuſt and hard, if God won't deliver you! You have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your ſelf, and deſtroyed your ſelf <hi>wilfully,</hi> contrary to God's repeated Counſels, yea, and deſtroyed your ſelf <hi>in fighting againſt God:</hi> Now therefore why do you Blame any but your ſelf, if you are deſtroyed? If you will undo your ſelf in oppoſing God, and while God oppoſes you by his Calls and Counſels, and, it may be too, by the Convictions of his Spirit, what can you object againſt it, if God now leaves you to be undone? You would have your own Way, and did not like that God ſhould oppoſe you in it, and your Way was to ruin your own Soul: How juſt therefore is it, if now at length, God ceaſes to oppoſe you, and falls in with you, and lets your Soul be ruin'd, and as you would deſtroy your ſelf, ſo ſhould put to his Hand to deſtroy you too! The Ways you went on in had a natural Tendency to your Miſery: If you would drink Poiſon, in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:004239_0244_1004050420424148"/>
to God, and in Contempt of him and his Advice, who can you Blame but your ſelf if you are poiſon'd, and ſo periſh? If you would run into the Fire againſt all Reſtraints both of God's Mercy and Authority, you muſt e'en blame your ſelf if you are burnt.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have propoſed ſome Things to your Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which if you are not exceeding blind, ſenſeleſs, and perverſe, will ſtop your Mouth, and convince you that you ſtand juſtly condemned before God, and that he would in no wiſe deal hardly with you, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtly, in denying you any Mercy, and in refuſing to hear your Prayers, let you pray never ſo earneſtly, and never ſo often, and continue in it never ſo long; and that God may utterly diſregard your Tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Object</hi> But here many may ſtill object, (for I am ſenſible 'tis an hard Thing to ſtop Sinners Mouths,) <q>God ſhews Mercy to others that have done theſe Things as well as I, yea, that have done a great Deal worſe than I.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That does not prove that God is any Way bound to ſhew Mercy to you, or them either. If God does beſtow it on others, he don't beſtow it <hi>on them</hi> becauſe he is bound to beſtow it: He might if he had pleaſed, with glorious Juſtice have denied it them. If God beſtows it <hi>on ſome,</hi> that does not prove that he is bound to beſtow it <hi>on any;</hi> and if he is bound to beſtow it on <hi>none,</hi> then he is not bound to beſtow it on <hi>you.</hi> God is in Debt to none, and if he gives to ſome that he is not in Debt to, becauſe 'tis his Pleaſure, that don't bring him into Debt to others.—It alters not the Caſe as to you, at all, whether others have it or have it
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:004239_0245_10042E4CC5369070"/>
not: You don't deſerve Damnation the leſs, than if Mercy never had been beſtowed on any at all. Matth. 20 15. <hi>Is thine Eye evil, becauſe mine is good?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. If this Objection be good, then the Exerciſe of God's Mercy is not in his own Right, and his Grace is not his own to give. That which God may not diſpoſe of as he pleaſes, is not his own; for that which is ones own, is at his own Diſpoſal: but if it be not God's own, then he is not capable of making a Gift or Preſent of it to any one; it is impoſſible to give a Debt.</p>
                        <p>What is it that you would make of God? Muſt the great God be tied up to that, that he muſt not uſe his own Pleaſure in beſtowing his own Gifts, but if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows them on one, muſt be looked upon obliged to beſtow them on another? Is not God worthy to have the ſame Right, with Reſpect to the Gifts of his Grace, that a Man has to his Money or Goods? Is it becauſe God is not ſo great, and ſhould be more in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection than Man, that this can't be allowed him? If any of you ſee Cauſe to ſhew Kindneſs to a Neighbour, do all the Reſt of your Neighbours come to you, and tell you that you owe them ſo much as you have given to ſuch a Man? But this is the Way that you deal with God! as though God were not worthy to have as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a Property in his Goods, as you have in your's!</p>
                        <p>At this Rate God can't make a Preſent of any Thing; he has nothing of his own to beſtow; if he has a Mind to ſhew peculiar Favour to ſome, or to lay ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons under peculiar Obligations to him, he can't do it; becauſe he has no ſpecial Gift, that his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtand in great need of, and that would tend great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Happineſs, at his own Diſpoſe.—If this be the Caſe, why do you pray to God to beſtow ſaving Grace upon you? If God don't do fairly to deny it you, becauſe he beſtows it on others, then 'tis not worth your while to pray for it, but you may go and tell him that he has beſtowed it on theſe and thoſe, as bad or worſe than you, and ſo demand it of him as a Debt.—And at this Rate Perſons never need to thank God for Salvation, when it is beſtowed; for what Occaſion is
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:004239_0246_10042E51B8A95B18"/>
there to thank God for that which was not at his own Diſpoſal, and that he could not fairly have denied.—The Thing at Bottom is, that Men have low Thoughts of God, and high Thoughts of themſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that they look upon God as having ſo little Right, and they ſo much. Matth. 20 15. <hi>Is it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to do what I will with mine own?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. God may juſtly ſhew greater Reſpect to others than to you, for you have ſhown greater Reſpect to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers than to God. You have ſhown greater Reſpect to <hi>Men</hi> than to God: You have rather choſen to offend God than offend Men. God only ſhews a greater Reſpect to others that are by Nature your Equals, than to you; but you have ſhown a greater Reſpect to thoſe that are infinitely inferiour to God, than to Him You have ſhown a greater Regard to <hi>wicked Men,</hi> than to God; you have honoured them more, loved them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and adhered to them rather than to Him. Yea, you have honoured the <hi>Devil,</hi> in many Reſpects, more than God; you have choſen his Will, and his Intereſt, rather than God's Will, and his Glory. You have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a little <hi>worldly Pelf,</hi> rather than God: You have ſet more by a <hi>vile Luſt,</hi> than by him You have choſen theſe Things, and rejected God: You have ſet your Heart on theſe Things, and caſt God behind your Back: And where is the Injuſtice if God is pleaſed to ſhew greater Reſpect to others than to you, or if he chooſes others and rejects you? You have ſhown great Reſpect to vile and worthleſs Things, and no Reſpect to God's Glory; and why may not God ſet his Love on others, and have no Reſpect to your Happineſs? You have ſhown great Reſpect to others, and not to God, that you are laid under infinite Obligations to reſpect above all; and why may not God ſhew Reſpect to others, and not to you, that never have laid him under the leaſt Obligation?</p>
                        <p>And will you not be aſhamed, notwithſtanding all theſe Things, ſtill to open your Mouth, to object and cavil about the Decrees of God, and other Things that you can't fully underſtand.—Let the Decrees of God
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:004239_0247_10042E559B427848"/>
be what they will, that alters not the Caſe as to your Liberty, any more than if God had only fore known.—And why is God to blame for decreeing Things? How unbecoming an infinitely wiſe Being, would it have been to have made a World and let Things run at Random, without diſpoſing Events, or fore ordering how they ſhould come to paſs? And what is that to you, how God has fore-ordered Things, as long as your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Experience teaches you, that that don't hinder your Liberty, or your doing what you chooſe to do. This you know, and your daily Practice and Behaviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men declares that you are fully ſenſible of it, with Reſpect to your ſelf and others. And ſtill to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, becauſe there are ſome Things in God's Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions above your Underſtanding, is exceeding unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Your own Conſcience charges you with great Guilt, and with thoſe Things that have been mention'd, let the ſecret Things of God be what they will. Your Conſcience charges you with thoſe vile Diſpoſitions, and that baſe Behaviour towards God, that you would at any Time moſt highly reſent in your Neighbour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and that not a Whit the leſs for any Concern thoſe ſecret Counſels and myſterious Diſpenſations of God, may have in the Matter.—It is in Vain for you to exalt your ſelf againſt an infinitely great, and holy, and juſt God: If you continue in it it will be to your eternal Shame and Confuſion, when hereafter you ſhall ſee at whoſe Door all the Blame of your Miſery lies.</p>
                        <p>I will finiſh what I have to ſay to natural Men, in the Application of this Doctrine, with a <hi>Caution</hi> not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Doctrine to Diſcouragement. For though it would be righteous in God forever to caſt you off, and deſtroy you, yet it will alſo be juſt in God to ſave you, in and through Chriſt, who has made compleat Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all Sin. Rom. 3 25, 26 <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Righteouſneſs, for the Remiſſion of Sins that are paſt, through the Forbearance of God; To declare, I ſay, at this Time his Righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Yea, God
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:004239_0248_10040506528541B8"/>
may through this Mediator, not only juſtly, but honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, ſhew you Mercy. The Blood of Chriſt is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that it is fully ſufficient to pay that Debt that you have contracted, and perfectly to vindicate the divine Majeſty from all that Diſhonour that has been caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, by thoſe many great Sins of yours that have been mentioned. It was as great, and indeed a much greater Thing, for Chriſt to die, than it would have been for you, and all Mankind, to have burnt in Hell to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Of ſuch Dignity and Excellency is Chriſt in the Eyes of God, that ſeeing he has ſuffered ſo much for poor Sinners, God is willing to be at Peace with them, however vile and unworthy they have been, and on how many Accounts ſo ever the Puniſhment would be juſt. So that you need not be at all diſcouraged from ſeeking Mercy, for there is enough in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Indeed it would not become the Glory of God's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to ſhew Mercy to you, that have been ſo ſinful and vile a Creature, for any Thing that you have done, for ſuch worthleſs and deſpicable Things as your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and other religious Performances; it would be very diſhonourable and unworthy of God ſo to do, and it is in vain to expect it: He will ſhew Mercy only on Chriſt's Account, and that according to his ſovereign Pleaſure, <hi>on whom</hi> he pleaſes, <hi>when</hi> he pleaſes, and <hi>in what Manner</hi> he pleaſes: You can't bring him under Obligation by your Works; do what you will, he will not look on himſelf obliged. But if it be his Pleaſure, he can honourably ſhew Mercy through Chriſt, to any Sinner of you all, not one in this Congregation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                        <p>Therefore here is Encouragement for you ſtill to ſeek and wait, notwithſtanding all your Wickedneſs; agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Samuel's</hi> Speech to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were terrified with the Thunder and Rain that God ſent, and their Guilt ſtared them in the Face, 1 Sam 12 20 <hi>Fear not; ye have done all this Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet turn not aſide from following the Lord; but ſerve the Lord with all your Hearts.</hi>

I would conclude this Diſcourſe, by improving the Doctrine in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, very briefly to put the godly in Mind of the Freeneſs and Wonderfulneſs of the Grace of God towards them. <hi>For ſuch were ſome of you.</hi>—The Caſe was juſt ſo with you, as you have heard; you had ſuch a wicked Heart, you lived ſuch a wicked Life, and it would have been moſt juſt with God for ever to have caſt you off: but he has had Mercy upon you; he hath made his glorious Grace appear in your everlaſting Salvation. You behaved your ſelf ſo as you have heard towards God; you had no Love to God, but yet he has exerciſed unſpeakable Love to you: You have contemned God, and ſet Light by him; but ſo great a Value has God's Grace ſet on you, and your Happineſs, that you have been redeemed at the Price of the Blood of his own Son: You choſe to be with <hi>Satan</hi> in <hi>his Service;</hi> but yet God hath made you a Joint-Heir with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>his Glory:</hi> You was ungrateful for paſt Mercies, but yet God not only continued thoſe Mercies, but beſtowed unſpeakably greater Mercies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: You refuſed to hear when <hi>God called;</hi> but yet God heard you, when <hi>you called:</hi> You abuſed the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs of God's Mercy to encourage your ſelf in Sin againſt God; but yet God has manifeſted the Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Mercy, in the Exerciſes of it towards you: You have r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p n="2">2. He is called a <hi>Lamb. John</hi> was told of a <hi>Lion</hi> that had prevailed to open the Book, and probably expected to ſee a <hi>Lion</hi> in his Viſion; but while he is expecting, behold a <hi>Lamb</hi> appears to open the Book, an exceeding diverſe Kind of Creature from a <hi>Lion!</hi> A <hi>Lion</hi> is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer, one that is wont to make terrible Slaughter of others; and no Creature more eaſily falls a Prey to him than a <hi>Lamb.</hi> And Chriſt is here repreſented not only as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> a Creature very <hi>liable to be ſlain,</hi> but a <hi>Lamb as it had been ſlain,</hi> that is, with the Marks of it's dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wounds appearing on it.</p>

There do meet in Jeſus Chriſt, infinite <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and infinite <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> Chriſt, as he is God, is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>great</hi> and <hi>high</hi> above all. He is higher than the Kings of the Earth; for he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. He is higher than the Heavens, and higher than the higheſt Angels of Heaven. So great is He, that all Men, all Kings and Princes, are as Worms of the Duſt before him, all Nations are as the Drop of the Bucket, and the light Duſt of the Balance; yea, and Angels themſelves are as nothing before him. He is ſo high, that he is infinitely above any Need of us; above our Reach, that we cannot be profitable to him, and above our Conceptions, that we cannot comprehend him. Prov. 30 4. <hi>What is his Name, and</hi> what is his Son's Name, <hi>if thou canſt tell?</hi> Our Underſtandings, if we ſtretch them never ſo far, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And yet he is one of infinite <hi>Condeſcenſion.</hi> None are ſo low, or in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eriour, but Chriſt's Condeſcenſion is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to take a gracious Notice of them. He condeſcends not only to the Angels, humbling himſelf to behold the Things that are done in Heaven, but he alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to ſuch poor Creatures as Men; and that not only ſo as to take Notice of Princes and great Men, but of thoſe that are of meaneſt Rank and Degree, <hi>the Poor of the World,</hi> James, 2 5. Such as are commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by their Follow Creatures, Chriſt don't deſpiſe.
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:004239_0256_10042E81F8054F00"/>
1 Cor. 1. 28. <hi>Baſe Things of the World, and Things that are deſpiſed, hath God choſen.</hi> Chriſt condeſcends to take Notice of <hi>Beggars, Luke.</hi> 16 22. and of <hi>Servants,</hi> and People of the moſt deſpiſed Nations: In Chriſt Jeſus is neither <hi>Barbarian, Sythian, Bond, nor Free,</hi> Col. 3. 11. He that is thus high, condeſcends to take a gracious Notice of <hi>little Children,</hi> Matth. 19. 14. <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me.</hi> Yea, which is much more, his Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion is ſufficient to take a gracious Notice of the moſt <hi>unworthy, ſinful</hi> Creatures, thoſe that have no good Deſervings, and thoſe that have infinite ill Deſervings.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſo great is his Condeſcenſion, that it is not only ſufficient to take ſome gracious Notice of ſuch as theſe, but ſufficient for every Thing that is an Act of Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. His Condeſcenſion is great enough to <hi>become their Friend:</hi> 'Tis great enough to become their <hi>Companion,</hi> to unite their Souls to him in ſpiritual Marriage: 'Tis great enough to <hi>take their Nature upon him,</hi> to become one <hi>of</hi> them, that he may be one <hi>with</hi> them: Yea, it is great enough to abaſe himſelf yet lower for them, even to expoſe himſelf to Shame and Spitting; yea, to yield up himſelf to an <hi>ignominious Death</hi> for them. And what Act of Condeſcenſion can be conceived of greater? Yet ſuch an Act as this, has his Condeſcenſion yielded to, for thoſe that are ſo low and mean, deſpicable and unworthy!</p>
                     <p>Such a Conjunction of ſuch <hi>infinite Highneſs,</hi> and <hi>low Condeſcenſion,</hi> in the ſame Perſon, is admirable. We ſee by manifold Inſtances, what a Tendency an high Station has in Men, to make them to be of a quite contrary Diſpoſition. If one Worm be a little exalted above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by having more Duſt, or a bigger Dunghill, how much does he make of himſelf! What a Diſtance does he keep from thoſe that are below him! And a <hi>little</hi> Condeſcenſion, is what he expects ſhould be made much of, and greatly acknowleged. Chriſt condeſcends to waſh our Feet; but how would great Men, (or rather the bigger Worms,) account themſelves debaſed by Acts of far leſs Condeſcenſion!</p>
                     <p n="2">

2. There meet in Jeſus Chriſt, infinite <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>Grace.</hi> As Chriſt is a divine Perſon he is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy and juſt, infinitely hating Sin, and diſpoſed to execute condign Puniſhment for Sin. He is the Judge of the World, and is the infinitely juſt Judge of it, and will not at all acquit the wicked, or by any Means clear the guilty.</p>
                     <p>And yet he is one that is infinitely gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful. Though his Juſtice be ſo ſtrict with Reſpect to all Sin, and every Breach of the Law, yet he has Grace ſufficient for every Sinner, and even the chief of Sinners. And it is not only ſufficient for the moſt unworthy to ſhow them Mercy, and beſtow <hi>ſome</hi> good upon them, but to beſtow the <hi>greateſt</hi> Good; yea, 'tis ſufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow <hi>all</hi> Good <hi>upon</hi> them, and to do all Things <hi>for</hi> them. There is no Benefit or Bleſſing that they can receive ſo great, but the Grace of Chriſt is ſufficient to beſtow it on the greateſt Sinner that ever lived. And not only ſo, but ſo great is his Grace, that nothing is too much as <hi>the Means</hi> of this Good: 'Tis ſufficient not only to <hi>do</hi> great Things, but alſo to <hi>ſuffer</hi> in order to it; and not only to ſuffer, but to ſuffer <hi>moſt extremely,</hi> even <hi>unto Death,</hi> the moſt terrible of natural Evils; and not only Death, but the moſt <hi>ignominious&amp;tormenting,</hi> and every Way the <hi>moſt terrible Death</hi> that Men could inflict; yea, and <hi>greater Sufferings than Men could inflict,</hi> who could only torment the Body, but alſo thoſe Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in his Soul, that were the more immediate Fruits of the Wrath of God againſt the Sins of thoſe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes for.</p>
                     <p>II. <hi>There do meet in the Perſon of Chriſt, ſuch</hi> really <hi>diverſe Excellencies, which otherwiſe would have been thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>terly incompatible in the</hi> ſame Subject; ſuch as are conjoined in no other Perſon whatever, either divine, human, or angelical; and ſuch as neither Men nor Angels would ever have imagined could have met together in the ſame Perſon, had it not been ſeen in the Perſon of Chriſt. I would give ſome Inſtances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the Perſon of Chriſt do meet together, infinite <hi>Glory,</hi> and the loweſt <hi>Humility.</hi> Infinite Glory, and
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:004239_0258_1004050C0E101900"/>
the Virtue of Humility, meet in no other Perſon but Chriſt. They meet in no created Perſon; for no created Perſon has infinite Glory: And they meet in no other divine Perſon but Chriſt. For though the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be infinitely abhorrent to Pride, yet Humility is not properly predicable of God the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, that exiſt only in the divine Nature; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a proper Excellency only of a created Nature; for it conſiſts radically in a Senſe of a comparative Lowneſs and Littleneſs before God, or the great Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Subject of this Virtue; but it would be a Contradiction to ſuppoſe any ſuch Thing in God.</p>
                     <p>But in Jeſus Chriſt, who is both God and Man, theſe two diverſe Excellencies, are ſweetly united. He is a Perſon infinitely exalted in Glory &amp; Dignity. Phil. 2. 6. <hi>Being in the Form of God, he thought it not Robbery to be equal with God.</hi> There is equal Honour due to him with the Father. John 5. 23.—<hi>That all Men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</hi> God himſelf ſays to him, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever,</hi> Heb. 1. 8. And there is the ſame ſupreme Reſpect, and divine Worſhip, paid to him by the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as to God the Father; as there, Verſe 6. <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But however he is thus <hi>above all,</hi> yet he is <hi>loweſt of all</hi> in Humility. There never was ſo great an Inſtance of this Virtue, among either Men or Angels, as <hi>Jeſus.</hi> None ever was ſo ſenſible of the Diſtance between God and him, or had a Heart ſo lowly before God, as the Man Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. What a wonderful Spirit of Humility appeared in him, when he was here upon Earth, in all his Behaviour! In his Contentment in his mean outward Condition, contentedly living in the Family of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Carpenter, and <hi>Mary</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for thirty Years together, and afterwards chooſing outward Meanneſs, Poverty and Contempt, rather than earthly Greatneſs; in his waſhing his Diſciples Feet, and in all his Speeches and Deportment towards them; in his cheerfully ſuſtaining the Form of a Servant thro' his whole Life, and ſubmitting to ſuch immenſe Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation at Death!</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="252" facs="unknown:004239_0259_10042E913745EED0"/>
2. In the Perſon of Chriſt do meet together, infinite <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and tranſcendent <hi>Meekneſs.</hi> Theſe again are two Qualifications that meet together in no other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but Chriſt. Meekneſs, properly ſo called, is a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue proper only to the Creature: We ſcarcely ever find Meekneſs mentioned as a divine Attribute in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; at leaſt not in the New Teſtament; for thereby ſeems to be ſignified, a Calmneſs and Quietneſs of Spirit ariſing from Humility, in mutable Beings, that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally liable to be put into a Ruffle, by the Aſſaults of a tempeſtuous and injurious World. But Chriſt being both God and Man, hath both infinite Majeſty and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative Meekneſs.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt was a Perſon of infinite <hi>Majeſty.</hi> It is he that is ſpoken of, Pſalm. 45. 3. <hi>Gird thy Sword upon thy Thigh, O moſt mighty, in thy Glory and thy Majeſty.</hi> 'Tis he that is mighty, that rideth on the Heavens, and in his Excellency on the Sky. 'Tis he that is terrible out of his holy Places; who is mightier than the Noiſe of many Waters, yea, than the mighty Waves of the Sea; before whom a Fire goeth, and burneth up his Enemies round about; at whoſe Preſence the Earth doth quake, and the Hills do melt; who ſitteth on the Circle of the Earth, and all the Inhabitants thereof are as Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; who rebukes the Sea and maketh it dry, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the Rivers; whoſe Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, from whoſe Preſence, and from the Glory of whoſe Power, the Wicked ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction; who is the bleſſed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that hath Heaven for his Throne, and the Earth for his Footſtool, and is the high and lofty One who inhabits Eternity, whoſe Kingdom is an everlaſting Kingdom, and of whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion there is no End.</p>
                     <p>And yet he was the moſt marvellous Inſtance of <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and humble <hi>Quietneſs</hi> of Spirit, that ever was, agreable to the Prophecies of him. Matth. 21. 4, 5. <hi>All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet, ſaying, Tell ye the Daughter of</hi> Sion, <hi>behold thy King cometh unto thee, Meek, and ſitting
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:004239_0260_10042E94DF259A30"/>
upon an Aſs, and a Colt the Fole of an Aſs.</hi> And agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what Chriſt declares of himſelf, Matth. 11. 29. <hi>I am meek and lowly of Heart.</hi> And agreable to what was manifeſt in his Behaviour here in this World. For there never was ſuch an Inſtance ſeen on Earth of a meek Behaviour, under Injuries &amp; Reproaches, &amp; towards Enemies; who when he was reviled, reviled not again; who was of a wonderful Spirit of Forgiveneſs, was ready to forgive his worſt Enemies, and prayed for them with ſervent and effectual Prayers. With what Meekneſs did he appear, when in the Ring of Soldiers, that were con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>mning and mocking him, when he was ſilent, and opened not his Mouth, but went as a <hi>Lamb</hi> to the Slaughter. Thus is Chriſt a <hi>Lion</hi> in Majeſty, and a <hi>Lamb</hi> in Meekneſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There meet in the Perſon of Chriſt, the deepeſt <hi>Reverence</hi> towards God, and <hi>Equality</hi> with God. Chriſt, when he was here on Earth, appeared full of holy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> towards the Father: He paid the moſt reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Worſhip to him, praying to him with Poſtures of Reverence. Thus we read of his <hi>kneeling down and praying,</hi> Matth. 22. 41. This became Chriſt, as he was one that had taken on him the human Nature. But at the ſame Time he exiſted in the divine Nature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his Perſon was in all Reſpects <hi>equal</hi> to the Perſon of the Father. God the Father hath no Attribute or Perfection, that the Son hath not, in <hi>equal</hi> Degree, and <hi>equal</hi> Glory. Theſe Things meet in no other Perſon but Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There are conjoined in the Perſon of Chriſt, infinite <hi>Worthineſs of Good,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Patience under Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Evil.</hi> He was perfectly innocent, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no Suffering. He deſerved nothing from God, by any Guilt of his own; and he deſerved no Ill from Men. Yea, he was not only harmleſs, and undeſerving of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but he was infinitely worthy, worthy of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Love of the Father, worthy of infinite and eternal Happineſs, and infinitely worthy of all poſſible Eſteem, Love, and Service from all Men. And yet he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly patient under the greateſt Sufferings, that ever
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:004239_0261_10042E9A512488D8"/>
were endured in this World. Heb. 6. 15. <hi>After he had patiently endured, he obtained the Promiſe.</hi> He ſuffered not from his Father, for <hi>his</hi> Faults, but <hi>ours;</hi> and he ſuffered from Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not for his <hi>Faults,</hi> but for thoſe Things, on Account of which, he was infinitely worthy of their Love and Honour; which made his Patience the more wonderful, and the more glorious. 1 Pet. 2. 20, &amp;c. <hi>For what Glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> it if when ye be buffeted for your Faults, ye ſhall take it patiently? But if when ye do well, and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with God: For even hereunto were ye called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an Example, that we ſhould follow his Steps; who did no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth; who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he ſuffered he threatened not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly: Who his own ſelf, bare our Sins in his own Body, on the Tree, that we being dead to Sin, ſhould live unto Righteouſneſs; by whoſe Stripes ye were healed.</hi> There is no ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Innocence, Worthineſs, and Patience under Sufferings, as in the Perſon of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the Perſon of Chriſt are conjoined, an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Spirit of Obedience,</hi> with <hi>ſupreme Dominion</hi> over Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. Chriſt is the Lord of all Things, in two Reſpects. He is ſo as he is God-Man, and Mediator; and ſo his Dominion is appointed, and given of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is by Delegation from God, and he is as it were the Father's <hi>Vicegerent</hi> But he is Lord of all Things in another Reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> as he is, (by his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature) God. And ſo he is by natural Right, the Lord of all, and ſupreme over all, as much as the Father. Thus he has Dominion over the World, not by Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but in his own Right: He is not an <hi>Under God,</hi> as the <hi>Asians</hi> ſuppoſe, but to all Intents and Purpoſes, ſupreme God.</p>
                     <p>And yet, in the ſame Perſon, is found the greateſt <hi>Spirit of Obedience</hi> to the Commands and Law of God that ever was in the Univerſe; which was manifeſt in his Obedience here in this World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> John. 14 31. <hi>As the Father gave me Commandment, even ſo I do.</hi> John. 15 10.
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:004239_0262_10042EA2D2846AE0"/>
                        <hi>Even as I have kept my Father's Commandments, and abide in his Love.</hi> The Greatneſs of his Spirit of Obedience appears in the Perfection of his Obedience, and in his obeying Commands of ſuch exceeding Difficulty. Never any one received Commands from God, of ſuch Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that were ſo great a Trial of Obedience, as Jeſus Chriſt. One of God's Commands to him was, that he ſhould yield himſelf to thoſe dreadful Sufferings that he underwent. See John 10. 18. <hi>No Man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf.—This Commandment received I of my Father.</hi> And Chriſt was throughly obedient to this Command of God. Heb. 5. 8. <hi>Though he were a Son, yet learned he Obedience by the Things that he ſuffered.</hi> Philip. 2 8. <hi>He humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs.</hi> Never was there ſuch an Inſtance of Obedience in <hi>Man nor Angel,</hi> as this; though he that obeyed was at the ſame Time, ſupreme Lord of both <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. In the Perſon of Chriſt are conjoined abſolute <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,</hi> and perfect <hi>Reſignation.</hi> This is another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Conjunction. Chriſt as he is God, is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>Sovereign</hi> of the World: He is the ſovereign Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of all Events. The Decrees of God are all his ſovereign Decrees; and the Work of Creation, and all God's Works of Providence, are his ſovereign Works. 'Tis he that worketh all Things according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his own Will. Col. 1. 16, 17. <hi>By him,</hi> and <hi>thro' him,</hi> and <hi>to him,</hi> are all Things. John. 15. 17. <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worketh hitherto, and I work.</hi> Matth. 8. 3. <hi>I will, be thou clean.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet Chriſt was the moſt wonderful Inſtance of <hi>Reſignation,</hi> that ever appeared in the World. He was abſolutely and perfectly reſigned, when he had a near, and immediate Proſpect of his terrible Sufferings, and the dreadful Cup that he was to drink, the Idea and Expectation of which, made his Soul exceeding Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, even unto Death, and put him into ſuch an Agony, that his Sweat was as it were great Drops, or Clots of Blood, falling down to the Ground. But in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, be was wholly reſigned to the Will of God.
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:004239_0263_1004050E61BD44A0"/>
Matth. 26. 39. <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me! Nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Verſe 42. <hi>O my Father, if this Cup may not paſs from me, except I drink it, Thy Will be done!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. In Chriſt do meet together, <hi>Self-ſufficiency,</hi> and an intire <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Reliance</hi> on God; which is another Conjunction peculiar to the Perſon of Chriſt. As he is a divine Perſon he is <hi>ſelf-ſufficient,</hi> ſtanding in Need of nothing; all Creatures are dependent on him, but he is dependent on none, but is abſolutely independent. His Proceeding from the Father in his eternal Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Filiation, argues no proper Dependance on the Will of the Father; for that Proceeding was natural and neceſſary, and not arbitrary. But yet Chriſt intirely <hi>truſted</hi> in God: His Enemies ſay that of him, <hi>He truſted in God that he would deliver him,</hi> Matth. 27. 43. And the Apoſtle teſtifies, 1 Pet. 2. 23. That <hi>he committed himſelf to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>III. <hi>Such diverſe Excellencies are expreſs'd in him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, that otherwiſe would have ſeem'd impoſſible to be exerciſed towards the</hi> ſame Object; as particularly theſe three, <hi>Juſtice, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> The ſame that are mentioned, Pſalm. 85. 10. <hi>Mercy and Truth are met together, Righteouſneſs and Peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> The ſtrict <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, and even his <hi>revenging Juſtice,</hi> and that <hi>againſt the Sins of Men,</hi> never was ſo gloriouſly manifeſted as in Chriſt. He manifeſted an infinite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Attribute of God's Juſtice, in that when he had a Mind to ſave Sinners, he was willing to undergo ſuch extreme Sufferings, rather than that their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be to the Injury of the Honour of that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute. And as he is the Judge of the World, he doth himſelf exerciſe ſtrict Juſtice; he will not clear the Guilty, nor at all acquit the Wicked in Judgment. And yet, how wonderfully is <hi>infinite Mercy</hi> towards Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, diſplayed in him! And what glorious and ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> have been, and are exerciſed by him, towards <hi>ſinful Men!</hi> Though he be the <hi>juſt Judge</hi> of a ſinful World, yet he is alſo the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World:

take on him a Nature infinitely below his original Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! And it appears yet more remarkably, in the low Circumſtances of his Incarnation: He was conceived in the Womb of a poor young Woman; whoſe Poverty appeared in that when ſhe came to offer Sacrifices for her Purification, ſhe brought what was allowed of in the Law, only in Caſe of Poverty; as Luke 2 34. <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which is ſaid in the Law of the Lord, a Pair of Turtle Doves, or two young Pidgeons.</hi> This was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed only in Caſe the Perſon was ſo Poor, that ſhe was not able to offer a Lamb. <hi>Levit. 12. 8.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though his infinite Condeſcenſion thus appear'd in the Manner of his Incarnation, yet his divine <hi>Dignity</hi> alſo appeared in it; for though he was conceived in the Womb of a poor Virgin, yet he was there conceived by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt. And his divine Dignity alſo appeared in the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of his Conception and Birth. Though he was conceived in the Womb of one of the corrupt Race of Mankind, yet he was conceived and born without Sin; as the Angel ſaid to the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, Luke 1. 35. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the Higheſt ſhall over ſhadow thee; therefore alſo, that holy Thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His infinite Condeſcenſion marvellouſly appeared in the <hi>Manner of his Birth.</hi> He was brought forth in a Stable, becauſe there was no Room for them in the Inn. The Inn was taken up by others, that were looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Perſons of greater Account. The bleſſed Virgin being poor and deſpiſed, was turned or ſhut out; tho' ſhe was in ſuch neceſſitous Circumſtances, yet thoſe that counted themſelves her Betters, would not give Place to her; and therefore in the Time of her Travail ſhe was forced to betake her ſelf to a Stable; and when the Child was born, it was wrapped in Swaddling Cloaths, and laid in a Manger; and there Chriſt lay a little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; and there he eminently appeared as a <hi>Lamb.</hi> But yet this feeble Infant that was born thus in a Stable, and laid in a Manger, was born to conquer and triumph over Satan, that roaring <hi>Lion:</hi> He came to ſubdue the mighty

                     <p>II.

                     <p>Thus in the Circumſtances of his Infancy, his outward Meanneſs appeared; yet there was ſomething then to ſhew forth his divine Dignity, in the wiſe Men's being ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

His Humility and Meekneſs wonderfully appeared in his Subjection to his Mother and reputed Father, when he was a Child: He herein appeared as a <hi>Lamb.</hi> But his divine Glory broke forth and ſhone, when at twelve Years old, he diſputed with the Doctors in the Temple: In that he appeared, in ſome Meaſure, as the <hi>Lion</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo after he entred on his publick Miniſtry, his marvellous Humility and Meekneſs was manifeſted in his chooſing to appear in ſuch mean outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and in being ſo contented in them, when he was ſo Poor that he had not where to lay his Head, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Charity of ſome of his Followers for his Subſiſtence; as appears by <hi>Luke.</hi> 8. <hi>at the begin.</hi> As alſo in his meek, condeſcending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and familiar Treatment of his

In healing the Sick, and opening the Eyes of the Blind, and unſtopping the Ears of the Deaf, and healing the Lame, he ſhewed that he was the God that framed the Eye, and created the Ear, and was the Author of the Frame of Man's Body. By the Dead's riſing at his Command, it appeared that he was the Author and Fountain of Life, and that <hi>God the LORD, to whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Iſſues from Death.</hi> By his walking on the Sea in a Storm, when the Waves were raiſed, he ſhewed himſelf to be that God, ſpoken of Job 9. 8. <hi>That tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the</hi> Waves <hi>of the Sea.</hi> By his ſtilling the Storm, and calming the Rage of the Sea, by his powerful Command, ſaying, <hi>Peace, be ſtill,</hi> He ſhewed himſelf to be he that has the Command of the Univerſe, and to be that God that brings Things to paſs by the Word of his Power, that ſpeaks and it is done, that commands and it ſtands faſt, &amp; he that is ſpoken of, Pſalm 65.7 <hi>Who ſtilleth the Noiſe of the Seas, the Noiſe of their Waves.</hi> And Pſalm 107. 29. <hi>That maketh the Storm a Calm; ſo that the Waves thereof are ſtill.</hi> And Pſalm 89. 8, 9. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, Who is a ſtrong Lord like unto thee, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

whom he may devour. He commanded them to come out, and they were forced to obey: They were terribly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of him; they fall down before him, and beſeech him not to torment them: He forces a whole Legion of them to forſake their old Hold, by his powerful Word; and they could not ſo much as enter into the Swine without his Leave.—He ſhewed the Glory of his Omniſcience, by telling the Thoughts of Men; as we have often an Account. Herein he appeared to be that God ſpoken of, Amos 4 13. <hi>That declareth unto Man what is his Thought.</hi> Thus in the midſt of his Meanneſs and Humiliation, his divine Glory appeared in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, John 2. 11. <hi>This beginning of Miracles did Jeſus in</hi> Cana <hi>of</hi> Galilee, <hi>and manifeſted forth</hi> his Glory.</p>
                     <p>And tho' Chriſt ordinarily appeared without outward Glory, and in great Obſcurity, yet at a certain Time he threw off the Veil, and appeared in his divine Majeſty, ſo far as it could be outwardly manifeſted to Men in this frail State, when he was transfigured in the Mount. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of it, 2 Pet. 1. 16, 17. ſpeaking there of himſelf, as one that was an <hi>Eye Witneſs of his Majeſty, when he received from God the Father, Honour and Glory, when there came ſuch a Voice to him, from the excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed; which Voice that came from Heaven,</hi> they <hi>heard, when</hi> they <hi>were with him in the holy Mount.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And at the ſame Time that Chriſt was wont to appear in ſuch Meekneſs, Condeſcenſion and Humility, in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Diſcourſes with his Diſciples, appearing therein as the <hi>Lamb</hi> of God, he was alſo wont to appear as the <hi>Lion</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> with divine Authority and Majeſty, in his ſo ſharply rebuking the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and other Hypocrites.</p>
                     <p>III. This admirable Conjunction of Excellencies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably appears, <hi>in his offering up himſelf a Sacrifice for Sinners in his laſt Sufferings.</hi> As this was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Thing in all the Work of Redemption, the greateſt Act of Chriſt in that Work; ſo in this Act eſpecially, does th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Then he was offered up to God as a <hi>Lamb</hi> without Blemiſh, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Spot: Then eſpecially did he appear to be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-type of the <hi>Lamb</hi> of the Paſſover: 1 Cor. 5. 7. <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover ſacrificed for us.</hi> And yet in that Act, he did in an eſpecial Manner appear as the <hi>Lion of the Tribe of Judah;</hi> yea, in this above all other Acts, in many Reſpects, as may appear in the following Things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Then was Chriſt in the greateſt Degree of his</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, <hi>and yet by that, above all other Things, his</hi> divine Glory <hi>appears</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Humiliation was great,</hi> in being born in ſuch a low Condition, of a poor Virgin, and in a Stable: <hi>His Humiliation was great,</hi> in being ſubject to <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Carpenter, and <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, and afterwards in living in Poverty, ſo as not to have where to lay his Head, and in ſuffering ſuch manifold and bitter Reproaches as he ſuffered, while he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout preaching and working Miracles: But his <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was never ſo great,</hi> as it was in his laſt Sufferings, beginning with his Agony in the Garden, till he expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Croſs. Never was he ſubject to ſuch igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny as then; never did he ſuffer ſo much Pain in his Body, or ſo much Sorrow in his Soul; never was he in ſo great an Exerciſe of his Condeſcenſion, Humility, Meekneſs, and Patience, as he was in theſe laſt Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; never was his divine Glory and Majeſty covered with ſo thick and dark a Veil; never did he ſo empty himſelf, and make himſelf of no Reputation, as at this—Time: And yet never was his divine Glory ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, by any Act of his, as in that Act, of yielding himſelf up to theſe Sufferings.—When the Fruit of it came to appear, and the Myſtery and Ends of it to be unfolded, in the Iſſue of it, then did the Glory of it appear; then did it appear, as the moſt glorious Act of Chriſt that ever he exerciſed towards the Creature. This Act of his is celebrated by the Angels and Hoſts of Heaven with peculiar Praiſes, as that which is above all others glorious, as you may ſee in the Context, Verſe 9. &amp;c.

And I beheld, and I heard the Voice of many Angels, round about the Throne, and the Beaſts, and the Elders, and the Number of them was ten thouſand Times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands, ſaying, with a loud Voice, Worthy is the Lamb THAT WAS SLAIN, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſſing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>He never in any Act gave ſo great a Manifeſtation of</hi> Love to God, <hi>and yet never ſo manifeſted his</hi> Love to thoſe that were Enemies to God, <hi>as in that Act.</hi> Chriſt never did any Thing whereby his <hi>Love to the Father</hi> was ſo eminently manifeſted, as in his laying down his Life, under ſuch inexpreſſible Sufferings, <hi>in Obedience to his Command, and for the Vindication of the Honour of his Authority and Majeſty;</hi> nor did ever any meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture give ſuch a Teſtimony of Love to God as that was: And yet this was the greateſt Expreſſion of all, of his <hi>Love to ſinful Men, that were Enemies to God,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. <hi>While we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the Death of his Son.</hi> The Greatneſs of Chriſt's Love to ſuch, appears in nothing ſo much, as in it's being <hi>dying Love.</hi> That Blood of Chriſt that was ſweat out, and fell in great Drops to the Ground, in his Agony, was ſhed from Love to God's Enemies, and his own. That Shame and Spitting, that Torment of Body, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Sorrow, even unto Death, that he endured in his Soul, was what he underwent from Love to Rebels againſt God, to ſave them from Hell, and to purchaſe for them eternal Glory.—Never did Chriſt ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſhew his Regard to God's Honour, as in offering up himſelf a Victim to revenging Juſtice, to vindicate God's Honour: And yet in this above all, he manifeſted his Love to them that diſhonoured God, ſo as to bring ſuch Guilt on themſelves, that nothing leſs than his Blood could atone for it.</p>

3. Chriſt never ſo eminently <hi>appeared for</hi> divine Juſtice, and yet never <hi>ſuffered</hi> ſo much <hi>from</hi> divine Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as when he offered up himſelf a Sacrifice for our Sins. In Chriſt's great Sufferings, did his infinite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Honour of God's Juſtice diſtinguiſhingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for it was from Regard to that, that he thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf: And yet in theſe Sufferings, Chriſt was the Mark of the vindictive Expreſſions of that very Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of God. Revenging Juſtice then ſpent all it's Force upon him, on the Account of our Guilt that was laid upon him; he was not ſpared at all; but God ſpent the Arrows of his Vengeance upon him, which made him ſweat Blood, and cry out upon the Croſs, and probably rent his Vitals, broke his Heart, the Fountain of Blood, or ſome other internal Blood Veſſels, and by the violent Fermentation turned his Blood to Water: For the Blood and Water that iſſued out of his Side, when pierced by the Spear, ſeems to have been extravaſated Blood; and ſo there might be a Kind of literal Fulfilment of that, in Pſalm. 22. 14. <hi>I am poured out like Water, and all my Bones are out of Joint: My Heart is like Wax, it is melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the midſt of my Bowels</hi>—And this was the Way and Means by which Chriſt ſtood up for the Honour of God's Juſtice, <hi>viz.</hi> By thus ſuffering it's terrible Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For when he had undertaken for Sinners, and had ſubſtituted himſelf in their Room, divine Juſtice could have it's due Honour, no other Way than by his Suffering it's Revenges.</p>
                     <p>In this the diverſe Excellencies that met in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt appeared, <hi>viz.</hi> His infinite Regard to God's Juſtice, and ſuch Love to thoſe that have expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, as induced him thus to yield himſelf a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Chriſt's <hi>Holineſs</hi> never ſo illuſtriouſly ſhone forth, as it did in his laſt Sufferings; and yet he never was to ſuch a Degree, treated as <hi>Guilty.</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Holineſs</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſuch a Trial, as it had then; and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſo great a Manifeſtation. When it was tried in this Furnace, it came forth as, Gold, or as Silver purified ſeven Times. His Holineſs then above all appeared in
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:004239_0272_10042EE340013498"/>
his ſtedfaſt Purſuit of the Honour of God, and in his Obedience to him: For his yielding himſelf unto Death was tranſcendently the greateſt Act of Obedience, that ever was paid to God, by any one ſince the Foundation of the World.</p>
                     <p>And yet then Chriſt was in the greateſt Degree treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>wicked Perſon.</hi> He was apprehended and bound as a Malefactor. His Accuſers repreſented him as a moſt wicked Wretch. In his Sufferings before his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion he was treated as if he had been the worſt and vileſt of Mankind; and then, he was put to a Kind of Death, that none but the worſt Sort of Malefactors were wont to ſuffer, thoſe that were moſt abject in their Perſons, and guilty of the blackeſt Crimes. And he ſuffered as though Guilty from God himſelf, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Guilt imputed to him; for he was made Sin for us, who knew no Sin; he was made Subject to Wrath as if he had been ſinful himſelf: He was made a Curſe for us.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt never ſo greatly manifeſted his Hatred of Sin, as againſt God, as in his dying to take away the Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that Sin had done to God; and yet never was he to ſuch a Degree ſubject to the terrible Effects of God's Hatred of Sin, and Wrath againſt it, as he was then—In this appears thoſe diverſe Excellencies meeting in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Love to God, and Grace to Sinners.</p>

And yet never gave ſo great a Manifeſtation of Love to God as then, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved. So Chriſt never ſuffered ſo much from the Hands of Men as he did then; and yet never was in ſo high an Exerciſe of Love to Men. He never was ſo ill treated by his Diſciples; who were ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about his Sufferings, that they would not watch with him one Hour, in his Agony; and when he was apprehended, all forſook him and fled, except <hi>Peter,</hi> who denied him with Oaths and Curſes.

come; but now they were ſuffered to work their Will upon him; he was in a great Degree delivered up to the Malice and Cruelty of both wicked Men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils: And therefore when Chriſt's Enemies came to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, he ſays to them, Luke 22. 53. <hi>When I was daily with you in the Temple, ye ſtretched forth no Hand againſt me: But this is your Hour and the Power of Darkneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet it was principally by Means of thoſe Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that he <hi>conquered and overthrew his Enemies.</hi> Chriſt never ſo effectually bruiſed Satan's Head, as when he bruiſed his Heel. The Weapon with which Chriſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt the Devil, and obtained a moſt compleat Victory and glorious Triumph over him, was the Croſs, the Inſtrument and Weapon with which he thought he had overthrown Chriſt, and brought on him ſhameful Deſtruction. Col. 2. 14, 15 <hi>Blotting out the Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Ordinances.—nailing it to</hi> his Croſs: <hi>And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, he made a Shew of them openly, triumphing over them</hi> in it.

The Devil had as it were ſwallowed up Chriſt, as the Whale did <hi>Jonah;</hi> but it was deadly Poiſon to him; he gave him a mortal Wound in his own Bowels; he was ſoon Sick of his Morſel, and forced to vomit him up again; and is to this Day Heart-ſick of what he then ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as his Prey.—In thoſe Sufferings of Chriſt, was laid the Foundation of all that glorious Victory that he has already obtained over Satan, in the Overthrow of his heatheniſh Kingdom, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and all the Succeſs the Goſpel has had ſince; and alſo of all his future and ſtill more glorious Victory that is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in all the Earth.—Thus <hi>Samſon'</hi>s Riddle is moſt eminently fulfilled, Judges 14. 14. <hi>Out of the Eater came forth Meat, and out of the Strong came forth Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And thus the true <hi>Samſon</hi> does more towards the Deſtruction of his Enemies at his Death, than in his Life,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:004239_0275_10042EF5830C3278"/>
in yielding up himſelf to Death, he pulls down the Temple of <hi>Dagon,</hi> and deſtroys many thouſands of his Enemies even while they are making themſelves Sport in his Sufferings; and ſo he whoſe Type was the Ark, pulls down <hi>Dagon,</hi> and breaks off his Head and Hands in his own Temple, even while he is brought in there as <hi>Dagon'</hi>s Captive.</p>
                     <p>Thus Chriſt appeared at the ſame Time, and in the ſame Act, as both a <hi>Lion</hi> and a <hi>Lamb.</hi> He appeared as a <hi>Lamb</hi> in the Hands of his cruel Enemies; as a <hi>Lamb</hi> in the Paws, and between the devouring Jaws of a roaring <hi>Lion;</hi> yea, he was a <hi>Lamb</hi> actually ſlain by this <hi>Lion:</hi> And yet at the ſame Time, as the <hi>Lion of the Tribe of Judah,</hi> he conquers and triumphs over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, deſtroying his own Devourer; as <hi>Samſon</hi> did the Lion that roared upon him, when he rent him as he would a Kid. And in nothing has Chriſt appeared ſo much as a <hi>Lion,</hi> in glorious Strength deſtroying his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as when he was brought as a Lamb to the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: In his greateſt Weakneſs, he was moſt Strong; and when he ſuffered moſt <hi>from his Enemies,</hi> he brought the greateſt Confuſion <hi>on his Enemies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus this admirable Conjunction of diverſe Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies was manifeſt in Chriſt, in his offering up himſelf to God in his laſt Sufferings.</p>

Will God reject his own Son, in whom his infinite Delight is, and has been, from all Eternity, and that is ſo united to him, that if he ſhould reject him he would reject himſelf?</p>

Would you have a Saviour that has given ſome great and extraordinary Teſtimony of Mercy and Love to Sinners, by ſome Thing that he has done, as well as by what he ſays?

                        <p>But further to induce you to accept of Chriſt as your Saviour, conſider two Things particularly.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>How much Chriſt appears as the Lamb of God, in his Invitations to you, to come to him and truſt in him.</hi> With what ſweet Grace and Kindneſs does he from Time to Time, call and invite you; as Prov. 8. 4 <hi>Unto you, O Men I call, and my Voice is to the Sons of Men.</hi> And Iſai. 55. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, Come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money, come ye, buy and eat, yea, come buy Wine and Milk, without Money, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Price.</hi> How gracious is he here in inviting <hi>every one that thirſts,</hi> and in ſo repeating his Invitation over and over, <hi>Come</hi> ye to the Waters, <hi>Come</hi> buy and eat, <hi>yea come!</hi> and in declaring the Excellency of that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment which he invites you to accept of, <hi>Come buy Wine and Milk!</hi> and in aſſuring you that your Poverty, and having nothing to pay for it, ſhall be no Objection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Come, he that hath no Money, come without Money, and without Price!</hi> And in the gracious Arguments and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations that he uſes with you! As it follows, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:004239_0283_10042F35A0A3F8E8"/>
do ye ſpend Money for that which is not Bread, and your Labour for that which ſatisfieth not? Hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your Soul delight it ſelf in Fatneſs.</hi> As much as to ſay, <q>'Tis altogether needleſs for you to continue labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and toiling for that which can never ſerve your Turn, ſeeking Reſt in the World, and in your own Righteouſneſs;—I have made abundant Proviſion for you, of that which is really good, and will fully ſatisfy your Deſires, and anſwer your End, and ſtand ready to accept of you: You need not be afraid; if you will come to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will engage to ſee all your Wants ſupplied, and you made an happy Creature.</q> As he promiſes in the third Verſe, <hi>Incline your Ear, and come unto me; Hear, and your Soul ſhall live; and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of David.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Prov. 9 at the Beg.</hi> How graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſweet is the Invitation there! <hi>Whoſo is ſimple, let him turn in hither;</hi> let you be never ſo poor, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and blind a Creature, you ſhall be welcome. And in the following Words, Chriſt ſets forth the Proviſion that he has made for you, <hi>Come eat of my Bread, and drink of the Wine which I have mingled.</hi> You are in a poor famiſhing State, and have nothing wherewith to feed your periſhing Soul; you have been ſeeking ſomething, but yet remain deſtitute; Hearken! how Chriſt calls you to eat of his Bread, and to drink of the Wine that he hath mingled! And how much like a <hi>Lamb</hi> does Chriſt appear, in Matth 11. 28, 29, 30. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt: Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye ſhall find Reſt to your Souls. For my Yoke is eaſy, and my Burden is light.</hi> O thou poor diſtreſſed Soul! Whoever thou art that art afraid that you never ſhall be ſaved, conſider that this that Chriſt mentions is your very Caſe, when he calls to them that labour and are heavy laden! And how he repeatedly promiſes you Reſt if you come to him! In the 28th Verſe he ſays, <hi>I will give you Reſt;</hi> and in the 29th Verſe, <hi>Ye ſhall find Reſt to your Souls.</hi>
                           <pb n="277" facs="unknown:004239_0284_10042F3BFAE656B0"/>
This is what you want! This is the Thing you have been ſo long in Vain ſeeking after! O how ſweet would Reſt be to you, if you <hi>could but obtain it!</hi> Come to Chriſt, and you <hi>ſhall obtain it.</hi> And hear how Chriſt, to encourage you, repreſents himſelf as a <hi>Lamb!</hi> He tells you that he is <hi>meek and lowly in Heart;</hi> and are you afraid to come ſuch an one? And again, Rev. 3. 20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the Door and knock: If any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and I will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Chriſt conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends not only to call you to him; but he comes to you, he comes to your Door, and there knocks. He might ſend an Officer, and ſeize you as a Rebel and vile Malefactor; but inſtead of that, he comes &amp; knocks at your Door, and ſeeks that you would receive him into your Houſe, as your Friend and Saviour. And he not only knocks at your Door, but he ſtands there waiting, while you are backward and unwilling. And not only ſo, but he makes Promiſes what he will do for you, if you will admit him, what Privileges he will admit you to; he will <hi>ſup with you, and you with him.</hi> And again, Rev. 22 16, 17. <hi>I am the Root, and the Offspring of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>the bright and the Morning Star. And the Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come: And let him that heareth, ſay, Come; and let him that is athirſt, Come: And whoſoever will let him come, and take of the Water of Life freely.</hi> How does Chriſt here graciouſly ſet before you his own winning attractive Excellency! And how does he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to declare to you, not only his own Invitation, but the Invitation of the Spirit and the Bride, if by any Means he might encourage you to come! And how does he invite every one that will, that they may <hi>take of the Waters of Life freely,</hi> that they may take it a free Gift, however precious it be, and though it be the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life!</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>If you do come to Chriſt he will appear as a</hi> Lion, <hi>in his glorious Power and Dominion, to defend you.</hi> All thoſe Excellencies of his in which he appears as a <hi>Lion,</hi> ſhall be yours, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

he will be as a <hi>Lion</hi> to fight againſt your Enemies: He that touches you, or offends you, will provoke his Wrath, as he that ſtirs up a <hi>Lion.</hi>—Unleſs your Enemies can conquer this Lion, they ſhall not be able to deſtroy or hurt you; unleſs they are ſtronger than he, they ſhall not be able to hinder your Happineſs. Iſai. 31. 4. <hi>For thus hath the Lord ſpoken unto me, like as the</hi> Lion, <hi>and the</hi> young Lion, <hi>roaring on his Prey, when a Multitude of Shepherds is called forth againſt him, he will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of their Voice, nor abaſe himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </p>
                        <p>III. <hi>Let what has been ſaid, be improved to induce you to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and chooſe him for your Friend and Portion.</hi> As there is ſuch an admirable Meeting of diverſe Excellencies in Chriſt, ſo there is every Thing in him to render him worthy of your Love and Choice, and to win and engage it. Whatſoever there is, or can be, that is <hi>deſireable</hi> to be in a Friend, is in Chriſt, and that to the higheſt Degree that can be <hi>deſired.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Would you chooſe a Friend that is a Perſon of great Dignity?—It is a Thing taking with Men to have thoſe for their Friends that are much above them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they look upon themſelves honoured by the Friendſhip of ſuch. Thus how taking would it be with an inferior Maid, to be the Object of the dear Love of ſome great and excellent Prince. But Chriſt is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above you, and above all the Princes of the Earth; for he is the King of Kings.—So honourable a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as this offers himſelf to you, in the neareſt and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Friendſhip.</p>
                        <p>And would you chooſe to have a Friend not only <hi>great</hi> but <hi>good?</hi>—In Chriſt infinite Greatneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs meet together, and receive Luſtre and Glory one from another. His Greatneſs is render'd love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Goodneſs. The greater any one is without Goodneſs, ſo much the greater <hi>Evil;</hi> but when infinite Goodneſs is joined with Greatneſs, it renders it a glorious
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:004239_0286_10042F46F1FF4548"/>
and adorable Greatneſs. So on the other Hand, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs receives Luſtre from his Greatneſs. He that is of great Underſtanding and Ability, and is withal of a good and excellent Diſpoſition, is deſervedly more eſteemed, than a lower and leſſer Being, with the ſame kind Inclination and Good Will. Indeed Goodneſs is excellent in whatever Subject it be found; it is Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Excellency it ſelf, and renders all excellent that are poſſeſſed of it; and yet more excellent when joined with Greatneſs; as the very ſame excellent Qualities of Gold, do render the Body in which they are inherent more precious, and of greater Value, when joined with greater, than when with leſſer <hi>Dimenſions.</hi> And how glorious is the Sight, to ſee him who is the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and ſupreme Lord of Heaven and Earth, full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, and tender Pity and Mercy, towards the mean and unworthy! His almighty Power, and infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Self Sufficiency render his exceeding Love and Grace the more ſurprizing. And how do his Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and Compaſſions endear his Majeſty, Power, and Dominion, and render thoſe Attributes <hi>pleaſant,</hi> that would otherwiſe be only <hi>terrible!</hi> Would you not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that your Friend, though great and honourable, ſhould be of ſuch Condeſcenſion and Grace, and ſo to have the Way opened to free Acceſs to him, that his Exaltation above you might not hinder your free En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his Friendſhip?</p>
                        <p>And would you chooſe, not only, that the infinite Greatneſs and Majeſty of your Friend ſhould be as it were mollified and ſweeten'd with Condeſcenſion and Grace; but would you alſo deſire to have your Friend <hi>in your own Nature,</hi> that he might be brought nearer to you? Would you chooſe a Friend <hi>far above you,</hi> and yet as it were <hi>upon a Level with you too?</hi> (Though it be taking with Men to have a near and dear Friend of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Dignity, yet there is alſo an Inclination in them to have their Friend a Sharer with them in Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.) Thus is Chriſt. Though he be the great God, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

he might not only be your Lord, but your Brother, and that he might be the more fit to be a Companion for ſuch a Worm of the Duſt.—This is one End of Chriſt's taking upon him Man's Nature, that his People might be under Advantages for a more familiar Converſe with him, than the infinite Diſtance of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would allow of. And upon this Account the Church longed for Chriſt's Incarnation, Cant. 8. 1. <hi>O thou that wert my Brother, that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </hi> But there is an Inclination in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not only to the Adoration of a Lord and Sovereign, but to Complacence in ſome one as a Friend, to love and delight in ſome one that may be convers'd with as a Compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ion. And Virtue and Holineſs don't deſtroy or weaken this Inclination of our Nature. But ſo hath God contrived in the Affair of our Redemption, that a <hi>divine Perſon</hi> may be the Object even of this Inclination of our Nature. And in order hereto, ſuch an one is come down to us, and has taken our Nature, and is become one of us, and calls himſelf our Friend, Brother, and Companion. Pſalm 122. 8. <hi>For my Brethren and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions Sake, will I now ſay, Peace be within thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But, is it not enough to invite and encourage to free Acceſs to a Friend ſo great and high, that he is one of infinite condeſcending Grace, and alſo has taken your own Nature, and is become Man? But would you further to embolden and win you, have him a Man of wonderful Meekneſs &amp; Humility? Why ſuch an one is Chriſt! He is not only become Man for you, but far the meekeſt and moſt humble of all Men, the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of theſe ſweet Virtues, that ever was, or will be. And beſides theſe, he has all other <hi>human</hi> Excellencies, in the higheſt Perfection. Theſe indeed are no proper <hi>Addition</hi> to his <hi>divine</hi> Excellencies. Chriſt has no more

Though his human Excellencies are but Communications and Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his divine; and though this Light, as reflected, falls infinitely ſhort of the divine Fountain of Light; in its immediate Glory; yet the Reflection ſhines not without its proper Advantages, as preſented <hi>to our View</hi> and <hi>Affection.</hi> As the Glory of Chriſt appears in the Qualifications of his human Nature, it appears to us in Excellencies that are of our own Kind, and are exerciſed in our own Way and Manner, and ſo, in ſome Reſpects, are peculiarly ſitted to invite our Acquaintance, and draw our Affection. The Glory of Chriſt as it appears in his Divinity, though it be far brighter, yet doth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is what tends to endear the divine and infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Holineſs of Chriſt to us, that theſe are Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of a Perſon that is in our Nature, that is one of us, that is become our Brother, and is the meekeſt and humbleſt of Men; it encourages us to look upon theſe divine Perfections, however high and great, yet as what we have ſome near Concern in, and more of a Right to, and Liberty freely to enjoy. And on the other Hand, how much more glorious and ſurprizing do the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Humility, Obedience, and Reſignation, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther human Excellencies of Chriſt appear, when we conſider that they are in ſo great a Perſon, as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, the Lord of Heaven and Earth!</p>

                        <p>When the Saints get to Heaven, they ſhall not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee Chriſt, and have to do with him as Subjects and Servants with a glorious and gracious Lord and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, but Chriſt will entertain them as Friends and Brethren. This we may learn from the Manner of Chriſt's converſing with his Diſciples here on Earth: Though he was their Sovereign Lord, and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, but required, their ſupreme Reſpect and Adoration, yet he did not treat them as earthly Sovereigns are wont to do their Subjects; he did not keep them at an awful Diſtance; but all along converſed with them with the moſt friendly Familiarity, as a Father amongſt a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Children, yea, as with Brethren. So he did with the twelve, and ſo he did with <hi>Mary, Martha</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> He told his Diſciples, that he did not call them Servants, but Friends, and we read of one of them that leaned on his Boſom. And doubtleſs he will not treat his Diſciples with leſs Freedom and Endearment in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: He won't keep them at a greater Diſtance for his being in a State of Exaltation; but he will rather take them into a State of Exaltation with him. This will be the Improvement Chriſt will make of his own Glory, to make his beloved Friends Partakers with him, to glorify them in his Glory, as he ſays to his Father, Joh. 17 22, 23. <hi>And the Glory which thou haſt given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                              </gap>, have I give them, that they may be one, even as we are one, I in them,</hi> &amp;c. We are to conſider, that though Chriſt is greatly exalted, yet he is exalted not as a private Perſon, for himſelf only, but as his People's Head; he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> exalted in their Name, and upon their Account, as the Firſt-Fruits, and as repreſenting the whole Harveſt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

<pb n="283" facs="unknown:004239_0290_10042F582902BBC8"/>
that they may be exalted with him. The Exaltation and Honour of the Head is not to make a greater Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance between the Head and the Members; but the Members have the ſame Relation and Union with the Head they had before, and are honoured with the Head; and inſtead of the Diſtance being greater, the Union ſhall be nearer, and more perfect. When Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers get to Heaven, Chriſt will conform them to himſelf; as he is ſet down in his Father's Throne, ſo they ſhall ſit down with him on his Throne, and ſhall in their Meaſure be made like him.</p>
                        <p>When Chriſt was going to Heaven, he comforted his Diſciples with that, that after a while, he would come again, and take them to himſelf, that they might be with him again. And we are not to ſuppoſe that when the Diſciples got to Heaven, they found him keeping a greater Diſtance, than he uſed to do. No, doubtleſs, he embraced them as Friends, and welcom'd them to his, and their, Father's Houſe, and to his, and their, Glory. They that had been his Friends in this World, that had been together with him here, and had together partook of Sorrows and Troubles, are now welcom'd by him to Reſt, and to partake of Glory with him. He took them and led them into his Chambers, and ſhewed them all h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>God ſent forth his</hi> Son, <hi>made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that are under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of</hi> Sons. <hi>And becauſe ye are</hi> Sons, <hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his</hi> Son <hi>into your Hearts, crying</hi> Abba, Father.—The Church is the Daughter of God, not only as he hath begotten her by his Word and Spirit, but as the is the Spouſe of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son.</p>
                        <p>So we being Members of the Son, are Partakers in our Meaſure, of the Father's Love to the Son, and Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in him. John 17. 23. <hi>I in them, and thou in me,—Thou haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me.</hi> And Verſe 26. <hi>That the Love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them.</hi> And Chap 16. 27. <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</hi> So we ſhall, according to our Capacities, be Partakers of the Son's Enjoyment of God, and have his Joy fulfilled in our ſelves, <hi>John</hi> 17. 13. And by this Means, we ſhall come to an immenſely higher, more intimate, and full Enjoyment of God, than otherwiſe could have been. For there is doubtleſs an infinite Intimacy between the Father and the Son; which is expreſſed by his being in the Boſom of the Father. And Saints being in him, ſhall, in their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Manner, partake with him in it, and of the Bleſſedneſs of it.</p>
                        <p>And thus is the Affair of our Redemption ordered, that thereby we are brought to an immenſely more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Kind of Union with God, and Enjoyment of him, both the Father and the Son, than otherwiſe could have been. For <hi>Chriſt being united to the human Nature,</hi> we have Advantage for a more free and full Enjoyment of him, than we could have had if he had remained only in the divine Nature.

                        </p>
                        <p>This was the Deſign of Chriſt, to bring it to paſs, that He, and his Father, and his People, might all be united in one.

And the Glory which thou haſt given me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made Perfect in one.</hi> Chriſt has brought it to paſs, that thoſe that the Father has given him, ſhould be brought into the Houſhold of God; that He, and his Father, and his People, ſhould be as it were one Society, one Family; that the Church ſhould be as it were admitted into the Society of the bleſſed Trinity.</p>

                  <p>From ſuch bleſſed Inſtances of the Succeſs of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as appear in this Narrative, we may learn much of the Way of the Spirit of God in his Dealing with the Souls of Men, in order to Convince Sinners, and reſtore them to his Favour and his Image by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his Son. We acknowledge that ſome particular Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Work of Converſion among Men may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the Miniſtry which they ſit under, whether it be of a more or leſs Evangelical Strain, whether it be more ſevere and affrighting, or more gentle and Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. But whereſoever God works with Power for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Minds of Men, there will be ſome Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of a Senſe of Sin, of the Danger of the Wrath of God, of the All ſufficiency of his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And if our Readers had Opportunity (as we have had) to peruſe ſeveral of the Sermons which were Preached during this glorious Seaſon, we ſhould find that it is the common plain <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without ſtretching towards the <hi>Antinomians</hi> on the one Side, or the <hi>Arminians</hi> on the other, that the Spirit of God has been pleaſed to honour with ſuch illuſtrious Succeſs.</p>

Such Scenes as theſe have ſometimes been made happily effectual to awaken <hi>Sinners</hi> in <hi>Zion,</hi> and the formal Profeſſor and the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> have been terrify'd with the Thoughts of divine Wrath breaking in upon them, <hi>Who ſhall dwell with everlaſting Burrings?</hi> But in the preſent Caſe the immediate Hand of God in the Work of his Spirit appears much more evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

cauſe there is no ſuch awful and threat'ning Providence attending it.</p>
                  <p>It is worthy alſo of our further Notice, that when many profane Sinners, and formal Profeſſors of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have been affrighted out of their preſent Careleſneſs and Stupidity by ſome aſtoniſhing Terrors approaching them, thoſe religious Appearances have not been ſo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, nor the real Change of Heart ſo thoroughly effected: Many of theſe ſort of ſudden Converts have dropt their religious Concerns in a great Meaſure when their Fears of the threat'ning Calamity are vaniſh'd. But it is a bleſſed Confirmation of the Truth of this preſent Work of Grace, that the Perſons who were divinely wrought upon in this Seaſon continue ſtill to profeſs ſerious Religion, and to practice it without returning to their former Follies.</p>
                  <p>It may not be amiſs in this Place to take Notice, that a very ſurprizing and threat'ning Providence has this laſt Year attended the People of <hi>Northampton,</hi> among whom this Work of divine Grace was ſo remarkable: Which Providence at firſt might have been conſtrued by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking World to be a ſignal Token of God's Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt that Town, or a Judgment from Heaven upon the People; but ſoon afterwards, like <hi>Paul's</hi> ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Viper off from his Hand, it diſcovered the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing Care and Goodneſs of God expreſs'd towards a Place where ſuch a Multitude of his young Converts were aſſembled: Nor can we give a better Account of it than in the Language of this very Gentleman, the Revd Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> Miniſter of that Town, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Upon the whole, we declare our Opinion, that this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch an extraordinary and illuſtrious Appearance of divine Grace in the Converſion of Sinners, is very like by the Bleſſing of God to have a happy Effect, towards the Honour and Enlargement of the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                     <hi>WHEN the Diſciples of our glorious Lord were filled with Sorrow upon the heavy Tidings of his Departure from them. He chear'd their drooping Spirits with that good Word, John</hi> 16. 7. Nevertheleſs, I tell you the Truth; it is expedient for you that I go away: For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you. <hi>And after his Aſcenſion, he fulfill'd this great and precious Promiſe by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Effuſion of his Spirit, under whoſe Conduct and Influence, the</hi> Apoſtles went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them: <hi>ſo that when we read the</hi> Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>we muſt ſay;</hi> Not by Might, nor by Power, but by the Spirit of the Lord of Hoſts. <hi>And tho', ſoon after the firſt Days of Chriſtianity, there was a dreadful Apoſtacy, yet God did not wholly take his Spirit from his People; but rais'd up faithful Witneſſes to teſtify againſt the Hereſies and Corruptions of the Times wherein they lived. And ſince Antichriſt</hi> that wicked One has been reveal'd, <hi>our Lord, according to his Word, has been gradually</hi> conſuming him with the Spirit of his Mouth, <hi>in the Reformation.</hi>

Very remarkable was the Work of God's Spirit ſtirring up our Fore Fathers to leave a pleaſant Land, and tranſport themſelves over a vaſt Ocean into this then howling Wilderneſs; that they might enjoy Communion with Chriſt in the Purity of his Ordinances, and leave their Children in the quiet

Yea when more lately, it pleaſed God to viſit many of our</hi> Towns <hi>with a</hi> very mortal Diſtemper, <hi>to that Time in a Manner unknown; whereby great Numbers of our hopeful Children and Youth have been cut off, many very ſuddenly, and with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances exceedingly diſtreſſing and awful: Yet alaſs! We have not generally ſeen, nor duly conſidered God's Hand ſtretched out againſt us; but have given him Reaſon to complain, as of his ancient People,</hi> Why ſhould ye be Stricken any more, ye will revolt more and more <hi>And accordingly His Anger is not turned away; but his Hand is ſtretched out ſtill.

A plain Proof of this awful Truth, that the moſt awakening Diſpenſations can no farther humble and do us good, than as it pleaſeth God to accompany them with his Spirit, and ſo command his Bleſſing upon them.

John 3. 8.</hi> The Wind bloweth where it lifteth, and thou heareſt the Sound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit. <hi>Such was his wonderful Work at</hi> Northampton, and the neighbouring Towns in the County of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, <hi>and ſome other Places. The Holy Spirit was in a plentiful and extraordinary Manner pour'd out on Perſons of every Age and Condition, without ſuch remarkable Providences going before to awaken them; as the</hi> Dew falls in the Night, <hi>and yet the Effects appear'd as the</hi> Light which goeth forth. <hi>So that we might well admiring ſay,</hi> What has God wrought! <hi>Great was the Number of them who publiſh'd the Wonders of the Divine Power &amp; Grace; declaring with Humility, what God had done for their Souls.

It is alſo a Pleaſure to us to hear what Acceptance the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Narrative has found in the other</hi> England, <hi>where it has had two Impreſſions already, and been honour'd with a recommendatory Preface, by two Divines of eminent Note in</hi> London, <hi>viz.  the Rev.

And as this wonderful Work may be conſider'd as an Earneſt of what God will do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Cloſe of the Goſpel Day, it affords great Encouragement to our Faith and Prayer in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Promiſes which relate to the glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Flouriſhing of the Kingdom of Chriſt upon Earth, and have not yet had their full and final Accompliſhment.

                  <p>HAVING ſeen your <hi>Letter</hi> to my honoured Uncle <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield</hi> of <hi>July 20,</hi> wherein you inform him of the <hi>Notice</hi> that has been taken of the late <hi>wonderful Work of God,</hi> in this, and ſome other Towns in this <hi>County;</hi> by the Rev. Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> and Dr. <hi>Guyſe</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and the Congregation to which the laſt of theſe preached on a monthly Day of ſolemn Prayer; as alſo, of your deſire to be more perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, by ſome of us on the ſpot: and having
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004239_0310_10042FC282E79F30"/>
been ſince informed by my Uncle <hi>Williams,</hi> that you deſire me to undertake it; I would now do it, in as <hi>juſt and faithful a Manner</hi> as in me lies.</p>
                  <p>The People of the <hi>County,</hi> in general, I ſuppoſe, are as <hi>ſober,</hi> and <hi>orderly,</hi> and good ſort of People, as in any Part of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England;</hi> and I believe they have been preſerved the freeſt by far, of any Part of the Country, from <hi>Error,</hi> and variety of <hi>Sects</hi> and Opinions. Our being ſo far <hi>within</hi> the Land, at a diſtance from <hi>Sea-ports,</hi> and in a Corner of the Country, has doubtleſs been one <hi>Reaſon</hi> why we have not been ſo much corrupted with <hi>Vice,</hi> as moſt other Parts. But without queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Religion,</hi> and good Order of the <hi>County,</hi> and their Purity in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> has, under God, been very much owing to the great Abilities, and eminent Piety, of my venerable and honoured Grandfather <hi>Stoddard.</hi> I ſuppoſe we have been the freeſt of any Part of the Land from unhappy <hi>Diviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,</hi> and <hi>Quarrels</hi> in our accleſiaſtical and religious Affairs, till the late lamentable<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Springfield</hi> Contention relates to the Settlement of a Miniſter there, which occaſion'd too warm Debates between ſome, both Paſtors and People, that were for it, and others that were againſt it, on account of their different Apprehenſions about his Principles, and about ſome Steps that were taken to procure his Ordination.</note> 
                     <hi>Springfield Contention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We being much ſeparated from other Parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and having comparatively but little Intercourſe with them, have from the beginning, till now, always managed our eccleſiaſtical Affairs within our ſelves: 'tis the way in which the County, from its Infancy, has gone on, by the practical Agreement of all, and the way in which our Peace and good Order has hither to been maintained.</p>
                  <p>The Town of <hi>Northampton</hi> is of about 82 <hi>Years</hi> ſtanding, and has now about 200 <hi>Families;</hi> which moſtly dwell more <hi>compactly</hi> together than any Town of ſuch a Bigneſs in theſe Parts of the Country; which probably has been an Occaſion that both our <hi>Corruptions,</hi> and <hi>Reformations</hi> have been, from
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004239_0311_10042FC8CC7F18C0"/>
time to time, the more <hi>ſwiftly</hi> propagated, from one to another, through the Town. Take the <hi>Town</hi> is general, and ſo far as I can judge, they are as <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding</hi> a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as moſt I have been acquainted with: Many of them have been <hi>noted</hi> for Religion, and particularly, have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their diſtinct <hi>Knowledge</hi> in things that relate to <hi>Heart</hi> Religion, and Chriſtian <hi>Experience,</hi> and their great <hi>Regards</hi> thereto.</p>
                  <p>I am the <hi>third Miniſter</hi> that has been ſettled in the Town: the Rev. Mr. <hi>Eleazer Mather,</hi> who was the <hi>firſt,</hi> was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>July,</hi> 1669. He was one whoſe Heart was <hi>much</hi> in his Work, abundant in <hi>Labours</hi> for the good of precious Souls; he had the high Eſteem and great Love of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and was bleſſed with no ſmall <hi>Succeſs.</hi> The Rev. Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> who ſucceeded him, came firſt to the Town the <hi>November</hi> after his Death, but was not ordained till <hi>September</hi> 11. 1672, and died <hi>Feb.</hi> 11. 1728. 9. So that he continued in the Work of the Miniſtry here, from his firſt coming to Town, near 60 Years. And as he was eminent and <hi>renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> for his Gifts and Grace; ſo he was bleſſed, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, with <hi>extraordinary Succeſs</hi> in his Miniſtry, in the Converſion of many Souls. He had <hi>five Harveſts,</hi> as he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: The <hi>first</hi> was about 57 Years ago; the <hi>ſecond</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 53 Years; the <hi>third</hi> about 40; the <hi>fourth</hi> about 24; the <hi>fifth</hi> and laſt about 18 Years ago. <hi>Some</hi> of theſe Times were much more remarkable than others, and the ingathering of Souls more plentiful. Thoſe that were about 53, and 40, and 24 Years ago, were much greater than either the <hi>firſt</hi> or the <hi>laſt:</hi> but in <hi>each</hi> of them, I have heard my <hi>Grandfather</hi> ſay, the <hi>bigger</hi> Part of the <hi>young</hi> People in the Town, ſeemed to be mainly concerned for their eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>laſt</hi> of theſe came a far more degenerate time, (at leaſt among the young People) I ſuppoſe, than ever before. Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> indeed, had the Comfort before he died, of ſeeing a time where there were no ſmall Appearences of a divine Work amongſt ſome, and a conſiderable <hi>Ingathering</hi> of Souls, even after I was ſettled with him in the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> which was about <hi>two</hi> Years before his Death; and I have reaſon to <hi>bleſs</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004239_0312_10042F8D2E4AFF78"/>
God for the great Advantage I had by it. In theſe <hi>two</hi> Years there were near <hi>twenty</hi> that Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> hoped to be ſavingly converted; but there was nothing of any <hi>General Awakening.</hi> The greater Part ſeemed to be at that time very inſenſible of the things of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and engaged in other Cares and Purſuits. Juſt after my Grandfather's Death, it ſeemed to be a time of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Dulneſs</hi> in Religion: <hi>Licentiouſneſs</hi> for ſome Years greatly prevailed among the <hi>Youth</hi> of the Town; they were many of them very much addicted to <hi>Night-walking,</hi> and frequenting the <hi>Tavern,</hi> and <hi>lend</hi> Practices, wherein ſome, by their Example exceedingly corrupted others. It was their Manner very frequently to get together, in Conventions of both <hi>Sexes,</hi> for Mirth and Jollity, which they called <hi>Frolicks;</hi> and they would often ſpend the greater part of the <hi>Night</hi> in them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to any <hi>Order</hi> in the Families they belonged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Town. It was become very cuſtomary with many of our young People, to be <hi>Indecent</hi> in their Carriage at <hi>Meeting,</hi> which doubtleſs, would not have prevailed to ſuch a degree, had it not been that my <hi>Grandfather,</hi> through his <hi>great Age,</hi> (tho' he retained his <hi>Powers</hi> ſurprizingly to the <hi>laſt</hi>) was not ſo able to <hi>Obſerve</hi> them. There had alſo long prevailed in the Town, a Spirit of Contention between <hi>two Parties,</hi> into which they had for many Years been <hi>divided,</hi> by which, was maintain'd a <hi>Jealouſy</hi> one of the other, and they were prepared to <hi>oppoſe</hi> one another in all publick Affairs.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Years after Mr. <hi>Stoddard'</hi>s Death, there began to be a ſenſible Amendment of theſe Evils; the <hi>young People</hi> ſhew'd more of a Diſpoſition to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Counſel, and by degrees left off their <hi>Frolicking,</hi> and grew obſervably more <hi>Decent</hi> in their Attendance on the publick Worſhip, and there were more that manifeſted a <hi>Religious Concern</hi> than there uſed to be.</p>
                  <p>At the latter end of the Year 1733. there appeared a very unuſual flexibleneſs, and yielding to Advice, in our young People. It had been too long their manner

                  <p>Preſently after this, there began to appear a <hi>remarkable Religious Concern</hi> at a little <hi>Village,</hi> belonging to the Congregation, Call'd <hi>Paſcommuck,</hi> where a few Families were ſettled, at about <hi>three Miles</hi> diſtance from the main Body of the Town. At this place, a number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſeemed to be ſavingly wrought upon. In the <hi>April</hi> following, <hi>Anno</hi> 1734, there happen'd a very <hi>ſudden and awful Death of a young Man,</hi> in the Bloom of his Youth; who being violently ſeized with a <hi>Pleuriſy,</hi> and taken immediately very <hi>delirious,</hi> died in about <hi>two Days;</hi> which (together with what was preached pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly on that Occaſion) much <hi>affected</hi> many young People. This was followed with another Death of a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004239_0314_10042FCEAC1AFC30"/>
young married <hi>Woman,</hi> who had been conſiderably <hi>exerciſed</hi> in Mind, about the Salvation of her <hi>Soul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was ill, and was in great <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of her Illneſs; but ſeemed to have <hi>ſatisfying Evidences</hi> of God's ſaving <hi>Mercy</hi> to her, before her Death; ſo that ſhe died very full of <hi>Comfort,</hi> in a moſt earneſt and moving Manner <hi>warning,</hi> and counſelling others. This ſeem'd much to <hi>contribute</hi> to the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the Spirits of many young Perſons: and there began evidently to appear more of a <hi>Religious Concern</hi> on People's Minds.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Fall</hi> of the Year, I propoſed it to the <hi>young People,</hi> that they ſhould agree among themſelves to ſpend the <hi>Evenings after Lectures</hi> in <hi>ſocial</hi> Religion, and to that end divide themſelves into ſeveral Companies to meet in various parts of the Town; which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corgingly done, and thoſe <hi>Meetings</hi> have been ſince continued, and the <hi>Example</hi> imitated by <hi>elder</hi> People. This was follow'd with the Death of an <hi>elderly</hi> Perſon, which was attended with many <hi>unuſual</hi> Circumſtances, by which many were much moved and affected.</p>
                  <p>About this time, began the great <hi>Noiſe</hi> that was in this Part of the Country, about <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> which ſeemed to appear with a very <hi>threatning</hi> Aſpect upon the Intereſt of Religion here. The Friends of vital Piety trembled for fear of the Iſſue; but it ſeemed, contrary to their Fear, ſtrongly to be <hi>over-ruled</hi> for the promoting of Religion. Many who looked on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelve as in a <hi>Chriſtleſs</hi> Condition, ſeemed to be awaken'd by it, with fear that God was about to withdraw from the Land, and that we ſhould be given up to <hi>Heterodoxy,</hi> and corrupt Principles; and that then their <hi>Opportunity</hi> for obtaining Salvation would be paſt; and many who were brought a little to <hi>doubt</hi> about the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> they had hitherto been taught, ſeem'd to have a kind of a trembling <hi>Fear</hi> with their Doubts, leſt they ſhould be led into <hi>By-paths,</hi> to their eternal undoing: And they ſeem'd with much Concern and Engagedneſs of Mind, to enquire what was indeed the Way in which they muſt come to be accepted with God.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004239_0315_10040530F7BC4B98"/>
There were then ſome things ſaid <hi>publickly</hi> on that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, concerning <hi>Juſtification by Faith alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Altho' great <hi>Fault</hi> was found with <hi>meddling</hi> with the <hi>Controverſy</hi> in the Pulpit, by ſuch a Perſon, and at that time, and tho' it was ridiculed by many <hi>elſewhere;</hi> yet it proved a Word ſpoken in ſeaſon here; and was moſt evidently attended with a very remarkable <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of Heaven to the Souls of the People in this Town. They received thence a general ſatisfaction with reſpect to the main thing in queſtion, which they had been in trembling doubts and concern about; and their Minds were engag'd the more earneſtly to ſeek that they might come to be accepted of God, and ſaved in the Way of the Goſpel, which had been made evident to them to be the true and only Way. And <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n</hi> it was, in the latter part of <hi>December, that the Spirit of God</hi> began extraordinarily to ſet in, and <hi>wonderfully</hi> to work amongſt us; and there were, very <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> one after another, five or ſix Perſons, who were to all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſavingly converted, and ſome of them wrought upon in a very remarkable manner.</p>
                  <p>Particularly, I was ſurprized with the relation of a <hi>young Woman,</hi> who had been one of the greateſt Company-Keepers in the whole Town: When ſhe came to me, I had never heard that ſhe was become in any wiſe ſerious, but by the Converſation I then had with her, it appeared to me, that what ſhe gave an account of, was a glorious Work of God's infinite Power and ſovereign Grace; and that God had given her a <hi>new</hi> Heart, truly broken and ſanctified. I could not then doubt of it, and have ſeen much in my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with her ſince to confirm in.</p>
                  <p>Tho' the Work was <hi>glorious,</hi> yet I was filled with concern about the <hi>Effect</hi> it might have upon others: I was ready to conclude (tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> was the <hi>Reverſe,</hi> to a wonderful degree; God made it, I ſuppoſe, the <hi>greateſt occaſion of awakening</hi> to others, of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004239_0316_10042FD3CEB66350"/>
any thing that ever came to paſs in the Town. I have had abundant Opportunity to know the Effect it had, by my private Converſation with many. The news of it ſeemed to be almoſt like a <hi>flaſh of Lightning,</hi> upon the Hearts of young People, all over the Town, and upon many others. Thoſe Perſons amongſt us, who uſed to be <hi>fartheſt</hi> from ſeriouſneſs, and that I moſt feared would make an ill Improvement of it, ſeemed greatly to be <hi>awakened</hi> with it; many went to talk with her, concerning what ſhe had met with; and what appeared in her ſeemed to be to the Satisfaction of all that did ſo.</p>
                  <p>Preſently upon this, a great and earneſt Concern about the great things of Religion, and the eternal World, became <hi>univerſal</hi> in all parts of the Town, and among Perſons of all Degrees, and all Ages; the Noiſe amongſt the <hi>Dry Bones</hi> waxed louder and louder: All other talk but about ſpiritual and eternal things, was ſoon thrown by; all the Converſation in all Companies, and upon all occaſions, was upon theſe things only, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſo much as was neceſſary for People, carrying on their ordinary ſecular Buſineſs. Other Diſcourſe than of the things of Religion, would ſcarcely be tolerated in any Company. The Minds of People were wonderfully taken off from the <hi>World,</hi> it was treated amongſt us as a thing of very little Conſequence: They ſeem'd to follow their worldly Buſineſs, more as a part of their Duty, than from any Diſpoſition they had to it; the <hi>Temptation</hi> now ſeemed to lie on that hand, to <hi>neglect</hi> worldly Affairs too much, and to ſpend too much Time in the immediate Exerciſe of Religion: Which Thing was exceedingly miſrepreſented by Reports that were ſpread in diſtant Parts of the Land, as tho' the People here had wholly thrown by all worldly Buſineſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves entirely to Reading, and Praying, and ſuch like religious Exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>But altho' People did not ordinarily neglect their worldly Buſineſs; yet there then was the Reverſe of what commonly is: <hi>Religion</hi> was with all ſorts the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and the <hi>World</hi> was a thing only by the Bye. The
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004239_0317_10042FD5541EE100"/>
only Thing in their view was to get the Kingdom of Heaven, and every one appeared preſſing into it: The Engagedneſs of their Hearts in this great Concern cou'd not <hi>be hid,</hi> it appear'd in their very <hi>Countenances.</hi> It then was a dreadful Thing amongſt us to lie out of Chriſt, in danger every day of dropping into Hell; and what Perſons minds were intent upon was to <hi>eſcape for their Lives,</hi> and to <hi>fly from the Wrath to come.</hi> All would eagerly lay hold of Opportunities for their Souls; and were wont very often to meet together in private Houſes, for religious Purpoſes: And ſuch Meetings when appointed were wont greatly to be thronged.</p>
                  <p>There was ſcarcely a ſingle Perſon in the Town, either old or young, that was left unconcerned about the great Things of the eternal World. Thoſe that were wont to be the vaineſt, and looſeſt, and thoſe that had been moſt diſpoſed to think, and ſpeak ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of vital and experimental Religion, were now generally ſubject to great awakenings. And the Work of <hi>Converſion</hi> was carried on in a moſt <hi>aſtoniſhing</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and increaſed more and more; Souls did as it were come by Flocks to Jeſus Chriſt. From Day to Day, for many Months together, might be ſeen evident Inſtances of Sinners brought <hi>out of Darkneſs into marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Light,</hi> and delivered <hi>out of an horrible Pit, and from the miry Clay, and ſet upon a Rock,</hi> with a <hi>new Song of Praiſe to God in their mouths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Work of God, as it was carried on, and the Number of true Saints multiplied, ſoon made a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Alteration in the Town; ſo that in the Spring and Summer following, <hi>Anno</hi> 173<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

his <hi>Tabernacles</hi> were <hi>amiable.</hi> Our publick <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> were then beautiful; the Congregation was <hi>alive</hi> in God's Service, every one earneſtly intent on the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, every <hi>Hearer</hi> eager to drink in the Words of the <hi>Miniſter</hi> as they came from his Mouth; the Aſſembly in general were from time to time, <hi>in Tears</hi> while the Word was preached; <hi>ſome</hi> weeping with Sorrow and Diſtreſs, <hi>others</hi> with Joy and Love, <hi>others</hi> with Pity and Concern for the Souls of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                  <p>Our publick <hi>Praiſes</hi> were then greatly; enliven'd; God was then ſerved in our <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> in ſome meaſure, in the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs.</hi> It has been obſervable, that there has been ſcarce <hi>any part</hi> of Divine Worſhip, wherein good Men amongſt us have had <hi>Grace ſo drawn forth,</hi> and their Hearts <hi>ſo lifted up</hi> in the Ways of God, as <hi>in ſinging</hi> his Praiſes: Our Congregation excell'd all that ever I knew in the <hi>external</hi> Part of the Duty before, generally carrying regularly, and well, <hi>three Parts of Muſick,</hi> and the <hi>Women</hi> a Part by themſelves: But now they were evidently wont to ſing with <hi>unuſual Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of Heart and Voice, which made the Duty pleaſant indeed.</p>
                  <p>In all <hi>Companies</hi> on <hi>other</hi> Days, on whatever <hi>Occaſions</hi> Perſons met together, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be heard of and ſeen in the midſt of them. Our <hi>young People,</hi> when they met, were wont to ſpend the Time in talking of the <hi>Excellency</hi> and dying <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> the Gloriouſneſs of the way of <hi>Salvation,</hi> the wonderful, free, and ſovereign <hi>Grace</hi> of God, his glorious Work in the <hi>Converſion</hi> of a Soul, the <hi>Truth</hi> and Certainty of the great Things of God's Word, the Sweetneſs of the Views of his <hi>Perfections, &amp;c.</hi> And even at <hi>Weddings,</hi> which formerly were meerly occaſions of Mirth and Jollity, there was now no diſcourſe of any thing but the things of Religion, and no appearance of any, but <hi>ſpiritual Mirth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe amongſt us that had been <hi>formerly converted,</hi> were greatly enliven'd and renew'd with freſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Incomes of the Spirit of God; tho' ſome

much more than others, <hi>according to the meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt:</hi> Many that before had laboured under <hi>Difficulties</hi> about their own State, had now their <hi>Doubts</hi> removed by more ſatisfying Experience, and more clear Diſcoveries of God's Love.</p>
                  <p>When this Work of God firſt appeared, and was ſo extraordinarily carried on amongſt <hi>us</hi> in the Winter, <hi>others</hi> round about us, ſeemed not to know <hi>what</hi> to make of it; and there were many that ſcoffed at and ridiculed it; and ſome compared what we called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, to certain <hi>Diſtempers.</hi> But it was very obſervable of many, that occaſionally came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Notice that was taken of it by the People that came to Town on occaſion of the <hi>Court,</hi> that ſat here in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> was very obſervable. And thoſe that came from the Neighbourhood to our publick <hi>Lectures,</hi> were for the moſt part remarkably affected. Many that came to Town, on one occaſion or other, had their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſmitten, and awaken'd, and went home with wounded Hearts, and with thoſe Impreſſions that never wore off till they had hopefully a ſaving Iſſue; and thoſe that before had ſerious Thoughts, had their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings and Convictions greatly increaſed. And there were many Inſtances of Perſons that came from abroad, on Viſits, or on Buſineſs, that had not been long here before to all Appearance they were ſavingly wrought upon, and partook of that Shower of divine Bleſſing that God rained down here, and went home Rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 'till at length the <hi>ſame Work</hi> began evidently to appear and prevail in ſeveral other Towns in the <hi>County.</hi>

                  <p>In the Month of <hi>March,</hi> the People in <hi>South-Hadley</hi> began to be ſeized with deep Concern about the Things of Religion; which very ſoon became univerſal:
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004239_0320_10042FDF2A47F598"/>
And the Work of God has been very wonderful <hi>there;</hi> not much, if any thing, ſhort of what it has been here, in proportion to the bigneſs of the Place. About the ſame Time, it began to break forth in the Weſt part of <hi>Suffield,</hi> (where it has alſo been very great,) and it ſoon ſpread into all parts of the Town. It next appear'd at <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and ſoon overſpread the Town; and I believe was, for a Seaſon, not leſs remarkable than it was here. About the ſame time, it began to appear in a part of <hi>Deerfield,</hi> called <hi>Green-River,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fill'd the Town, and there has been a <hi>glorious</hi> Work there: It began alſo to be manifeſt, in the South part of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> in a place called the <hi>Hill,</hi> and after that the <hi>whole Town,</hi> in the ſecond Week in <hi>April,</hi> ſeemed to be ſeized, as it were at once, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about the Things of Religion; and the Work of God has been <hi>great</hi> there. There has been alſo a very general Awakening at <hi>Weſt Springfield,</hi> and <hi>Long-Meadow;</hi> and in <hi>Enfield,</hi> there was for a time no ſmall Concern amongſt ſome that before had been very looſe Perſons.

of ſuch a ſwift, and extraordinary Propagation, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this Work, did doubtleſs for a time ſerve to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Work amongſt us.

                  <p>This remarkable <hi>pouring out of the Spirit of God,</hi> which thus extended from one end to the other of this <hi>County,</hi> was not confin'd to it, but many Places in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> have partook in the ſame Mercy: As for inſtance, the <hi>firſt Pariſh in Windſor,</hi> under the paſtoral Care of the Rev.

                  <p>Something of this Work appeared in ſeveral other <hi>Towns</hi> in thoſe Parts, as I was informed when I was there, the laſt <hi>Fall.</hi> And we have ſince been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſomething very remarkable of this nature at another Pariſh in <hi>Stratford</hi> call'd <hi>Ripton,</hi> under the paſtoral Care of the Rev.

Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> the Miniſter there, and by others: And by a Letter which I very lately receiv'd from Mr <hi>Noyes,</hi> and alſo by Information we have had otherwiſe, this flouriſhing of Religion ſtill continues, and has lately much increaſed: Mr. <hi>Noyes</hi> writes, that <hi>many this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer have been added to the Church,</hi> and particularly mentions ſeveral young Perſons that belong to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Families of that Town.</p>
                  <p>There has been a degree of the ſame Work at a Part of <hi>Guilford;</hi> and very conſiderable at <hi>Mansfield,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Miniſtry of the Rev.

                  </p>
                  <p>This ſeems to have been a very <hi>extraordinary</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Providence: God has in many Reſpects gone out of, and much beyond his uſual, and <hi>ordinary Way.</hi> The Work in this Town, and ſome others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, has been extraordinary on account of the <hi>Univerſality</hi> of it, affecting all ſorts, ſober and vicious, high and low, rich and poor, wiſe and unwiſe; it reach'd the moſt conſiderable Families and Perſons, to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, as much as others. In former ſtirrings of this nature, the Bulk of the <hi>young</hi> People have been greatly affected; but <hi>old Men,</hi> and <hi>little Children</hi> have been ſo now.

hope it has had a ſaving Effect: We have about ſix hundred and twenty <hi>Communicants,</hi> which include almoſt all our adult Perſons. The Church was very <hi>large</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but Perſons never <hi>thronged</hi> into it, as they did in the late extraordinary Time:—Our <hi>Sacraments</hi> are eight Weeks aſunder, and I receiv'd into our Communion about an <hi>hundred</hi> before one Sacrament, and <hi>fourſcore</hi> of them at one time, whoſe Appearance, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves together to make an open explicit <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of Chriſtianity, was very affecting to the Congregation:—I took in near ſixty before the next Sacrament Day: But it muſt be noted that it is not the Cuſtom here, as it is in many other Churches in this Country, to make a credible Relation of their inward Experiences the ground of Admiſſion to the Lord's Supper.</p>
                  <p>I am far from pretending to be able to determine how many have lately been the Subjects of ſuch Mercy; but it I may be allowed to declare any thing that appears to me probable in a thing of this nature, I hope that more than three Hundred Souls were ſavingly brought home to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in this Town, in the ſpace of half a Year, (how many more I don't gueſs) and about the ſame Number of Males as Females; which, by what I have heard Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> ſay, was far from what has been uſual in Years paſt, for he obſerved that in his Time, many more Women were converted than Men. Thoſe of our young People, that are on other accounts moſt likely and conſiderable, are moſtly, as I hope, truly Pious, and leading Perſons in Ways of Religion. Thoſe that were formerly looſer young Perſons, are generally to all Appearance, become true Lovers of God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſpiritual in their Diſpoſitions. And I hope that by far the greater part of Perſons in this Town, above 16 years of Age, are ſuch as have the ſaving knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and ſo by what I heard I ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I ſuppoſe there were upwards of <hi>fifty</hi> Perſons in this Town above 40 years of Age; and more than <hi>twenty</hi> of them above 50, and about <hi>ten</hi> of them above 60, and <hi>two</hi> of them above 70 years of Age.</p>
                  <p>It has heretofore been looked on as a ſtrange Thing, when any have ſeem'd to be ſavingly wrought upon, and remarkably changed in their Childhood; but now I ſuppoſe, near <hi>thirty</hi> were to Appearance ſo wrought upon between 10 and 14 Years of Age, and <hi>two</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 9 and 10, and <hi>one</hi> of about 4 years of Age; and becauſe I ſuppoſe this laſt will be moſt difficultly believed, I will hereafter give a particular Account of it.

There are ſeveral Negroes, that from what was ſeen in them then, and what is diſcernable in them ſince, appear to have been truly born again in the late remarkable Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>God has alſo ſeemed to have gone out of his uſual way, in the <hi>Quickneſs</hi> of his Work, and the ſwift Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs his Spirit has made in his Operations on the Hearts of many: 'Tis wonderful that Perſons ſhould be ſo ſuddenly, and yet ſo greatly changed: Many have been taken from a looſe and careleſs way of Living, and ſeized with ſtrong Convictions of their Guilt and

Miſery, and in a very little time old Things have paſſed away, and all Things have become new with them.</p>
                  <p>God's Work has alſo appeared very extraordinary, in the <hi>Degrees</hi> of the Influences of his Spirit, both in the Degree of <hi>Awakening</hi> and <hi>Conviction,</hi> and alſo in the Degree of <hi>ſaving Light,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> that many have experienced. It has alſo been very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in the <hi>Extent</hi> of it, and its being ſo ſwiftly propagated from Town to Town. In former Times of the pouring out of the Spirit of God on this Town, tho' in ſome of them it was very Remarkable, yet it reached no further than this Town, the neighbouring Towns all around continued unmoved.</p>
                  <p>The Work of God's Spirit ſeemed to be at its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Height in this Town, in the former part of the <hi>Spring,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> at which time God's Work in the Converſion of Souls was carried on amongſt us in ſo wonderful a manner, that ſo far as I, by looking back, can judge from the particular Acquaintance I have had with Souls in this Work, it appears to me probable, to have been at the Rate, at leaſt, of four Perſons in a Day, or near thirty in a Week, take one with another, for five or ſix Weeks together: When God in ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a manner took the Work into his own Hands, there was as much done in a Day or two, as at or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Times, with all Endeavours that Men can uſe, and with ſuch a Bleſſing as we commonly have, is done in a Year.</p>
                  <p>I am very ſenſible how apt many would be, if they ſhould ſee the Account I have here given, preſently to think with themſelves that I am very fond of making a great many Converts, and of magnifying and aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

might not be beſide my Duty to declare this amazing Work, as it appear'd to me, to be indeed Divine, and to conceal no part of the Glory of it, leaving it with God to take care of the Credit of his own Work, and running the venture of any cenſorious Thoughts, which might be entertain'd of me to my diſadvantage: But that diſtant Perſons may be under as great Advantage as may be, to judge for themſelves of this Matter, I would be a little more large, and particular.</p>
                  <p>I therefore proceed to give an Account of the <hi>manner</hi> of Perſons being wrought upon; and here there is a <hi>vaſt Variety,</hi> perhaps as manifold as the Subjects of the Operation; but yet in many Things there is a <hi>great Analogy</hi> in all.</p>
                  <p>Perſons are firſt awaken'd with a Senſe of their miſerable Condition by Nature, the Danger they are in of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternally, and that it is of great Importance to them that they ſpeedily eſcape, and get into a better State. Thoſe that before were ſecure and ſenſeleſs, are made ſenſible how much they were in the way to ruin in their former Courſes. <hi>Some</hi> are more ſuddenly ſeized with Convictions; it may be, by the News of others Converſion, or ſomething they hear in publick, or in private Conference, their Conſciences are ſuddenly ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as if their Hearts were pierced through with a Dart: <hi>Others</hi> have Awakenings that come upon them more gradually, they begin as firſt to be ſomething more thoughtful and conſiderate, ſo as to come to a Concluſion in their Minds, that 'tis their beſt and wiſeſt way to delay no longer, but to improve the preſent Opportunity; and have accordingly ſet themſeves ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to meditate on thoſe Things that have the moſt awakening Tendency, on purpoſe to obtain <hi>Convictions;</hi> and ſo their Awakenings have increaſed, till a Senſe of their Miſery, by God's Spirit ſetting in therewith, has had faſt hold of them. <hi>Others</hi> that, before this wonderful time, had been ſomething religious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for their Salvation, have been awaken'd in a new manner, and made ſenſible that their ſlack and dull way of ſeeking was never like to attain their Purpoſe, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004239_0328_10042FF285BBB278"/>
ſo have been rouſed up to a greater Violence for the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

                     </gap>. And the <hi>other</hi> Effect was, that it put them on earneſt Application to the means of Salvation, Reading, Prayer, Meditation, the Ordinances of God's Houſe, and private Conference; their Cry was, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> The place of Reſort was now altered, it was no longer the Tavern, but the Miniſter's Houſe; that was thronged far more than ever the Tavern had been wont to be.</p>
                  <p>There is a very great variety as to the Degree of Fear and Trouble that Perſons are exerciſed with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they obtain any comfortable Evidences of Pardon and Acceptance with God: ſome are from the beginning carried on with abundantly more Encouragement and Hope than others: ſome have had <hi>ten</hi> times leſs trouble of Mind than others, in whom yet the Iſſue ſeems to be the ſame. Some have had ſuch a Senſe of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God, and the great Danger they were in of Damnation, that they could not ſleep at Nights; and many have ſaid that when they have laid down, the Thoughts of ſleeping in ſuch a Conditon have been f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ightful to them, and they have ſcarcely been free from Terrour while they have been aſleep, and they have awaked with Fear, Heavineſs, and Diſtreſs ſtill abiding on their Spirits. It has been very common, that the deep and fixed Concern that has been on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004239_0329_10042FF531A38CD0"/>
Minds, has had a painful Influence on their Bodies, and had given Diſturbance to animal Nature.</p>
                  <p>The awful Apprehenſions Perſons have had of their Miſery, have for the moſt part been increaſing, the nearer they have approached to Deliverance; tho' they often paſs through many Changes, and Alterations in the Frame, and Circumſtances of their Minds: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they think themſelves wholly ſenſleſs, and fear that the Spirit of God has left them, and that they are given up to judicial Hardneſs; yet they appear very deeply exerciſed about that Fear, and are in great earneſt to obtain <hi>Convictions</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>Together with thoſe Fears, and that Exerciſe of Mind which is rational, and which they have juſt ground for, they have often ſuffer'd many needleſs Diſtreſſes of Thought, in which <hi>Satan</hi> probably has a great hand, to entangle them, and block up their way; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Diſtemper of Melancholy has been evidently mixed; of which when it happens, the Tempter ſeems to make great advantage, and puts an unhappy Bar in the way of any good Effect; One knows not how to deal with ſuch Perſons, they turn every Thing that is ſaid to them the wrong way, and moſt to their own Diſadvantage: And there is nothing that the Devil ſeems to make ſo great a handle of, as a melancholy Humour, unleſs it be the real Corruption of the Heart.</p>
                  <p>But it has been very remarkable, that there has been far leſs of this Mixture in this time of extraordinary Bleſſing, than there was wont to be in Perſons under awakenings at other Times; for it is evident that many that before had been exceedingly involved in ſuch Difficulties, ſeem'd now ſtrangely to be ſet at liberty: Some Perſons that had before, for a long time, been exceedingly entangled with peculiar Temptations, of one ſort or other, and unprofitable and hurtful Diſtreſſes, were ſoon helped over former Stumbling Blocks, that hinder'd any Progreſs towards ſaving Good; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions have wrought more kindly, and they have been ſucceſsfully carried on in the way to Life. And thus <hi>Satan</hi> ſeemed to be reſtrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

end of this wonderful Time, when God's Spirit was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to withdraw.</p>
                  <p>Many times Perſons under great Awakenings were concerned, becauſe they thought they were not awaken'd, but miſerable, hard-hearted, ſenſeleſs, ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tiſh Creatures ſtill, and ſleeping upon the brink of Hell: The ſenſe of the Need they have to be awaken'd, and of their comparative Hardneſs, grows upon them with their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings; ſo that they ſeem to themſelves to be very <hi>ſenſeleſs,</hi> when indeed moſt <hi>ſenſible.</hi> There have been ſome Inſtances of Perſons that have had as great a Senſe of their Danger and Miſery, as their Natures could well ſubſiſt under, ſo that a little more would probably have deſtroyed them; and yet they have expreſt themſelves much amazed at their own Inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Sottiſhneſs, in ſuch an extraordinary Time as it then was.</p>
                  <p>Perſons are ſometimes brought to the Borders of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and it looks as black as Midnight to them a little before the Day dawns in their Souls; ſome few Inſtances there have been of Perſons, who have had ſuch a Senſe of God's Wrath for Sin, that they have been overborn, and made to cry out under an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Senſe of their Guilt, wondering that God ſuffers ſuch guilty Wretches to live upon Earth, and that he doth not immediately ſend them to Hell; and ſometimes their Guilt does ſo glare them in the Face, that they are in exceeding Terrour for fear that God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly do it; but more commonly the Diſtreſſes under legal Awakenings have not been to ſuch a Degree. In ſome theſe Terrours don't ſeem to be ſo ſharp, when near Comfort, as before; their Convictions have not ſeem'd to work ſo much that way, but they ſeem to be led further down into their own Hearts, to a further Senſe of their own univerſal Depravity, &amp; Deadneſs in Sin.</p>
                  <p>The Corruption of the Heart has diſcover'd it ſelf in various Exerciſes, in the time of legal Convictions; ſometimes it appears in a great Struggle, like ſomething rouſed by an Enemy, and <hi>Satan</hi> the old Inhabitant ſeems to exert himſelf, like a Serpent diſturbed and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004239_0331_10042FF8406DAE20"/>
enraged. Many in ſuch Circumſtances, have felt a great Spirit of Envy, towards the Godly, eſpecially towards thoſe that are thought to have been lately converted, and moſt of all towards Acquaintance and Companions, <hi>when they</hi> are thought to be converted: Indeed, ſome have felt many Heart-riſings againſt God, and murmurings at his ways of Dealing with Mankind, and his Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with themſelves in Particular. It has been much inſiſted on, both in publick and private, that Perſons ſhould have the utmoſt dreard of ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Thoughts, which if allowed tend exceedingly to quench the Spirit of God, if not to provoke him finally to forſake them. And when ſuch a Spirit has much prevailed, and Perſons have not ſo earneſtly ſtrove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it as they ought to have done, it has ſeem'd to be exceedingly to the hindrance of the Good of their Souls: but in ſome other Inſtances, where Perſons have been much terrified at the Sight of ſuch Wickedneſs in their Hearts, God has brought Good to them out of Evil; and made it a Means of convincing them of their own deſperate Sinfulneſs, and bringing them off from all Self-confidence.</p>
                  <p>The drift of the Spirit of God in his <hi>legal</hi> ſtrivings with Perſons, has ſeem'd moſt evidently to be, to make way for, and to bring to, a Conviction of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Dependance on his ſovereign Power and Grace, and univerſal Neceſſity of a Mediator, by leading them more and more to a Senſe of their exceeding Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Guiltineſs in his ſight; the Pollution and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of their own Righteouſneſs, that they can in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As they are gradually more and more convinced of the Corruption and Wickedneſs of their Hearts, they ſeem to themſelves to grow worſe and worſe, harder and blinder, and more deſperately wicked, inſtead of growing better; they are ready to be diſcouraged by

it, and oftentimes never think themſelves ſo <hi>far off</hi> from Good as when they are <hi>neareſt.</hi> Under the ſenſe which the Spirit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> God gives them of their Sinfulneſs, they often think that they differ from all others; their Hearts are ready to ſink with the thought, that they are the worſt of all, and that none ever obtained Mercy that were ſo wicked as they.</p>
                  <p>When Awakenings <hi>firſt begin,</hi> their Conſciences are commonly moſt exerciſed about their outward vicious Courſe, or other Acts of Sin; but <hi>afterwards</hi> are much more burdened with a ſenſe of Heart ſins, the dreadful Corruption of their Nature, their Enmity againſt God, the Pride of their Hearts, their Unbelief, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Chriſt, the Stubbornneſs and Obſtinacy of their Wills; and the like. In many, God makes much uſe of their own Experience, in the courſe of their Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Endeavours after ſaving Good, to convince them of their own vile Emptineſs and univerſal Depravity.</p>
                  <p>Very often under firſt Awakenings, when they are brought to reflect on the Sin of their paſt Lives, and have ſomething of a terrifying ſenſe of God's Anger, they ſet themſelves to walk more ſtrictly, and confeſſ their Sins, and perform many religious Dutys, with a ſecret Hope of appeaſing God's Anger and making up for the Sins they have committed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and oftentimes, at firſt ſetting out, their Affections are moved, and they are full of Tears, in their Confeſſions and Prayers, which they are ready to make very much of, as tho' they were ſome Attonement, and had Power to move cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent Affections in God too: and hence they are for a while big with Expectation of what God will do for them; and conceive that they grow better apace, and ſhall ſoon be thoroughly converted. But theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are but ſhort-lived, they quickly find that they fail, and then they think themſelves to be grown worſe again; they don't find ſuch a Proſpect of being ſoon converted, as they thought: inſtead of being <hi>nearer,</hi> they ſeem to be <hi>farther off;</hi> their Hearts they think are grown harder, and by this means their fears of periſhing greatly increaſe. But tho' they are diſappointed, they
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004239_0333_10042FFFF738D740"/>
renew their Attempts again and again; and ſtill as their Attempts are Multiplied, ſo are their Diſappointments; all fails, they ſee no token of having inclin'd God's Heart to them, they don't ſee that he hears their Prayers at all, as they expected he would; and ſometimes there have been great Temptations ariſing hence to leave off ſeeking, and to yield up the Caſe. But as they are ſtill more terrify'd with Fears of periſhing, and their former Hopes of prevailing on God to be merciful to them in a great meaſure fail; ſometimes their religious Affections have turn'd into Heart-riſings againſt God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he won't pity them, and ſeems to have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard to their Diſtreſs, and piteous Cries, and to all the Pains that they take; They think of the Mercy that God has ſhown to others, how ſoon, and how eaſily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have obtained Comfort, and thoſe too that were worſe than they, and have not labour'd ſo much as they have done, and ſometimes they have had even dreadful blaſphemous Thoughts, in theſe Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>But when they reflect on theſe wicked Workings of Heart againſt God, if their Convictions are continued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Spirit of God, is not provoked utterly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, they have more diſtreſſing Apprehenſions of the Anger of God <hi>towards thoſe,</hi> whoſe Hearts work af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a ſinful manner <hi>about him;</hi> and it may be have great Fears that they have committed the unpardonable Sin, or that God will ſurely never ſhew Mercy to them that are ſuch Vipers; and are often tempted to leave off in deſpair. But then perhaps by ſomething they read or hear of the infinite Mercy of God, and All-ſufficiency of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the chief of Sinners; they have ſome Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Hope renewed; but think that as yet they are not fit to come to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they are ſo wicked that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will never accept of them: and then it may be they ſet themſelves upon a new Courſe of fruitleſs Endeavours in their own Strength to make themſelves better, and ſtill meet with new Diſappointments: They are earneſt to enquire what they ſhall do? They don't know but there is ſomething elſe to be done, in order to their obtaining converting Grace, that they have never done yet.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004239_0334_10040535F0628920"/>
It may be they hope that they are ſomething better than they were; but then the pleaſing Dream all vaniſhes again. If they are told, that they truſt too much to their own Strength and Righteouſneſs, they go about to ſtrive to bring themſelves off from it, and it may be, think they have done it, when they only do the ſame thing under a new diſguiſe, and ſtill find no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any Good, but all looks as dark as Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to them. Thus they wander about from Mountain to Hill, ſeeking reſt, and finding none: when they are beat out of <hi>one</hi> Refuge they fly to <hi>another,</hi> till they are as it were debilitated, broken, and ſubdued with legal Humblings; in which God gives them a Conviction of their own utter Helpleſſneſs and Inſufficiency, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the true Remedy.</p>
                  <p>When they begin to ſeek Salvation, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly profoundly ignorant of themſelves; they are not ſenſible how blind they are, and how little they can do <hi>towards</hi> bringing themſelves to ſee ſpiritual things aright, and <hi>towards</hi> putting forth gracious Exerciſes in their own Souls: they are not ſenſible how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>remote they are from Love to God, and other holy Diſpoſitions, and how dead they are in Sin. When they ſee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Pollution in their own Hearts, they go about to waſh away their own Defilements and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves clean; and they weary themſelves in vain, till God ſhows them that 'tis in vain, and that their help is not where they have ſought it, but elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>But ſome Perſons continue wandering in ſuch a kind of Labyrinth, ten times as long as others, before their own Experience will convince them of their Inſufficiency; and ſo it appears not to be their own Experience only, but the convincing Influence of God's Spirit with their Experience, that attains the Effect: and God has of late abundantly ſhown, that he don't need to wait to have Men convinced by long and often repeated fruitleſs Trials; for in multitudes of Inſtances he has made a ſhorter work of it: he has ſo awakened and convinced Perſons Conſciences, and made them ſo ſenſible of their exceeding great Vileneſs, and given 'em ſuch a ſenſe of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004239_0335_1004300180834D48"/>
his Wrath againſt Sin, as has quickly overcome all their vain Self-confidence, and born them down into the Duſt before a holy and righteous God.</p>
                  <p>There have been ſome who have not had great Terrors, but have had a very quick Work. Some of thoſe that han't had ſo deep a Conviction of theſe things before their Converſion, have, it may be, much more of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. God has appeared far from limiting himſelf to any certain Method in his Proceedings with Sinners under legal Convictions. In <hi>ſome</hi> Inſtances it ſeems eaſy for our reaſoning Powers to diſcern the methods of divine Wiſdom, in his Dealings with the Soul under awakenings: in <hi>others</hi> his Foot-ſteps can't be traced, and his Ways are paſt finding out: and ſome that are <hi>leſs diſtinctly</hi> wrought upon, in what is preparatory to Grace, appear <hi>no leſs eminent</hi> in gracious experiences after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>There is in nothing a greater Difference, in different Perſons, than with reſpect to the <hi>Time</hi> of their being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Trouble; ſome but a few Days, and others for Months or Years.

with Souls, in a Flock under ſuch Circumſtances as this was in the laſt Year, I can't but think he will ſoon find himſelf under a Neceſſity, greatly to inſiſt upon it with them, that God is under no manner of Obligation to ſhew Mercy to any natural Man, whoſe Heart is not turn'd to God: and that a Man can challenge nothing, either in <hi>abſolute Juſtice,</hi> or by <hi>free Promiſe,</hi> from any Thing he does before he has believed on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or has true Repentance begun in him. It appears to me, that if I had taught thoſe that came to me under Trouble, any other Doctrine, I ſhould have taken a moſt direct Courſe utterly to have undone them; I ſhould have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly croſs'd what was plainly the Drift of the Spirit of God in his Influence upon them; for if they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved what I ſaid, it would either have promoted Self-flattery and Careleſſneſs, and ſo put an End to their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings; or cheriſhed and eſtabliſhed their Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Strife with God, concerning his Dealings with them and others, and block'd up their Way to that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation before the Sovereign Diſpoſer of Life and Death, whereby God is wont to prepare them for his Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And yet thoſe that have been under Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, have oftentimes plainly ſtood in need of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, by being told of the infinite and all-ſufficient Mercy of God in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that 'tis God's Manner to ſucceed Diligence, and to bleſs his own Means, that ſo <hi>Awakenings</hi> and <hi>Encouragements, Fear</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> may be duly mixed, and proportion'd to preſerve their Minds in a juſt Medium between the two Extreams of <hi>Self-flattery</hi> and <hi>Deſpondence,</hi> both which tend to Slackneſs, and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and in the End to Security. I think I have found that no Diſcourſes have been more remarkably bleſſed, than thoſe in which the Doctrine of God's abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sovereignty with Regard to the Salvation of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and his juſt Liberty, with Regard to his anſwering the Prayers, or ſucceeding the Pains of natural Men, continuing ſuch, have been inſiſted on.

                  <p>In thoſe in whom Awakenings ſeem to have a ſaving Iſſue, commonly the firſt Thing that appears after their legal Troubles, is a Conviction of the Juſtice of God in their Condemnation, in a Senſe of their own exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinfulneſs, and the Vileneſs of all their Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: In giving Account of this, they expreſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very variouſly; ſome, that God was Sovereig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Some</hi> are brought to this Conviction by a great Senſe of their Sinfulneſs, in general, that they are ſuch vile wicked Creatures in Heart and Life: <hi>Others</hi> have the Sins of their Lives in an extraordinary Manner ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, Multitudes of them coming juſt then freſh to their Memories, and being ſet before them with their Aggravations; ſome have their Minds eſpecially fixed, on ſome particular wicked Practice, they have indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſome are eſpecially convinced by a Sight of the Corruption and Wickedneſs of their Hearts; ſome, from a View they have of the Horridneſs of ſome particular Exerciſes of Corruption, which they have had in the Time of their Awakenings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby the Enmity of the Heart

againſt God has been manifeſted; ſome are convinced eſpecially by a ſenſe of the Sin of Unbelief, the Oppoſition of their Hearts to the Way of Salvation by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and their Obſtinacy in rejecting him and his Grace.</p>
                  <p>There is a great deal of difference as to Perſons <hi>Diſtinctneſs</hi> here; ſome, that han't ſo clear a Sight of God's Juſtice in their Condemnation, yet mention things that plainly imply it. They find a Diſpoſition to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God to be juſt and righteous in his Threatnings, and that they are deſerving of nothing: And many times, tho' they had not ſo particular a Sight of it at the Beginning, they have very clear Diſcoveries of it ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, with great Humblings in the Duſt before God.</p>
                  <p>Commonly Perſons Minds immediately before this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of God's Juſtice are exceeding reſtleſs, and in a kind of Struggle and Tumult, and ſometimes in meer An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; but generally, as ſoon as they have this Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it immediately brings their Minds to a Calm, and a before unexpected Quietneſs and Compoſure; and moſt frequently, tho' not always, <hi>then</hi> the preſſing weight upon their Spirits is taken away, and a general Hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, that ſome time or other God will be gracious, even before any diſtinct and particular Diſcoveries of Mercy; and often they then come to a Concluſion within themſelves, that they will lie at God's Feet, and wait his Time, and they reſt in that, not being ſenſible that the Spirit of God has now brought them to a Frame whereby they are prepared for Mercy: for 'tis remarkable that perſons, when they firſt have this ſenſe of the Juſtice of God, rarely in the time of it, think any thing of its being that <hi>Humiliation</hi> that they have often heard inſiſted on, and that others experience.</p>
                  <p>In many Perſons, the firſt Conviction of the Juſtice of God in their Condemnation, which they <hi>take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of,</hi> and probably the firſt diſtinct Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it that they <hi>have,</hi> is of ſuch a Nature, as ſeems to be above any thing meerly legal; Tho' it be after legal Humblings, and much of the ſenſe of their own Helpleſſneſs and of the Inſufficiency of their own Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet it does not appear to be forced by meer legal

Terrors and Convictions; but rather from an high Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Grace, in ſaving Repentance, and evangelical Humiliation; for there is in it a ſort of Complacency of Soul, in the <hi>Attribute</hi> of God's Juſtice, as diſplay'd in his Threatnings of eternal Damnation to Sinners. Sometimes at the Diſcovery of it, they can ſcarcely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear crying out, 'TIS JUST! 'TIS JUST! Some expreſs themſelves, that they ſee the Glory of God would <hi>ſhine bright</hi> in their own Condemnation; and they are ready to think that if they are damned, they could take part with God againſt themſelves, and would glorify his Juſtice therein. And when it is thus, they commonly have ſome evident ſenſe of free and all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grace, tho' they give no diſtinct Account of it, but 'tis manifeſt, by that great degree of Hope and Encouragement that they then conceive, tho' they were never ſo ſenſible of their own Vileneſs and Illdeſervings as they are at that time.</p>
                  <p>Some, when in ſuch Circumſtances; have felt that ſenſe of the Excellency of God's Juſtice, appearing in the vindictive Exerciſes of it, againſt ſuch Sinfulneſs as theirs was, and have had ſuch a Submiſſion of Mind in their <hi>Idea</hi> of this Attribute, and of thoſe Exerciſes of it, together with an exceeding loathing of their own Unworthineſs, and a kind of Indignation againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they have ſometimes almoſt call'd it a <hi>Willingneſs to be damned;</hi> tho' it muſt be owned they had not clear and diſtinct Ideas of Damnation, nor does any Word in the Bible require ſuch Self denial as this. But the truth is, as ſome have more clearly expreſt it, that Salvation has appeared <hi>too good for them, that they were worthy of nothing but Condemnation,</hi> and they could <hi>not tell how to think of Salvation's being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them,</hi> fearing it was <hi>inconſiſtent with the Glory of God's Majeſty, that they had ſo much contemned and affronted.</hi>

                  <p>That Calm of Spirit that ſome Perſons have found after their legal Diſtreſſes, continues ſome time before any ſpecial and delightful Manifeſtation is made to the Soul of the Grace of God, as revealed in the Goſpel;

but very often ſome comfortable and ſweet View of a merciful God, of a ſufficient Redeemer, or of ſome great and joyful things of the Goſpel, immediately follows, or in a very little time: And in ſome, the firſt Sight of their juſt Deſert of Hell, and God's Sovereignty with reſpect to their Salvation, and a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of all-ſufficie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe gracious Diſcoveries that are given, whence the firſt ſpecial Comforts are derived, are in many reſpects very various; more frequently <hi>Chriſt</hi> is diſtinctly made the Object of the Mind, in his All-ſufficiency and Willingneſs to ſave Sinners: But ſome have their Thoughts more eſpecially fixed on God, in ſome of his ſweet and glorious Attributes manifeſted in the Goſpel, and ſhining forth in the Face of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Some view the All-ſufficiency of the Mercy and Grace of God; ſome chiefly the infinite Power of God, and his Ability to ſave them, and to do all things for them; and ſome look moſt at the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God: In <hi>ſome,</hi> the Truth and Certainty of the Goſpel in general is the firſt joyful Diſcovery they have; in <hi>others,</hi> the certain Truth of ſome particular Promiſes; in ſome, the Grace and Sincerity of God in his Invitations, very commonly in ſome particular Invitation in the Mind, and it now appears real to them that God does indeed invite them.

Such Longings as I ſpeak of, are commonly attended with firm Reſolutions to purſue this Good for ever, together with a hoping, waiting Diſpoſition. When Perſons have begun in ſuch Frames, commonly other Experiences and Diſcoveries have ſoon followed, which have yet more clearly manifeſted a change of Heart.</p>
                  <p>It muſt needs be confeſt that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not always <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly</hi> and <hi>explicitly</hi> thought of in the firſt ſenſible Act of Grace, (tho' moſt commonly he is;) but ſometimes he is the Object of the Mind only <hi>implicitly.</hi> Thus ſometimes when Perſons have ſeem'd evidently to be ſtript of all their own Righteouſneſs, and to have ſtood ſelf condemned as guilty of Death, they have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with a joyful and ſatisfying View, that the Mercy
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004239_0342_10043011BB122D58"/>
and Grace of God is ſufficient for them; that their Sins, tho' never ſo great, ſhall be no Hindrance to their being accepted; that there is Mercy enough in God for the whole World, and the like, when they give no Account of any particular or diſtinct Thought of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but yet when the Account they give is duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they are a little interrogated about it, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Revelation of the Mercy of God in the Goſpel, is the Ground of this their Encouragement and Hope; and that it is indeed the Mercy of God thro' <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is diſcovered to them, and that 'tis depended on <hi>in him,</hi> and not in any wiſe moved by any thing <hi>in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſometimes diſconſolate Souls amongſt us, have been revived and brought to reſt in God, by a ſweet ſenſe given of his Grace and Faithfulneſs, in ſome ſpecial Invitation or Promiſe, in which is no particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor is it accompanied with any diſtinct Thought of him, in their Minds; but yet it is not received as <hi>out of Chriſt,</hi> but as one of the Invitations or Promiſes made of God to poor Sinners <hi>through</hi> his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as it is indeed: and ſuch Perſons have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards had clear and diſtinct Diſcoveries of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> accompanied with lively and ſpecial Actings of Faith and Love towards him.</p>
                  <p>It has more frequently been ſo amongſt us, that when Perſons have firſt had the Goſpel Ground of Relief for loſt Sinners diſcovered to them, and have been entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Minds with the ſweet Proſpect, they have thought nothing at that time of their being converted: To ſee that there is ſuch an All-ſufficiency in God, and ſuch plentiful Proviſion made in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after they have been borne down, and ſunk with a ſenſe of their Guilt and Fears of Wrath, exceedingly refreſhes them; the View is joyful to them, as 'tis in its own nature glorious, and gives them quite new, and more delightful <hi>Ideas</hi> of God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and greatly encourages them to ſeek Converſion, and begets in them a ſtrong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to give up themſelves, and devote their whole Lives to God and his Son, and patiently to wait till
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004239_0343_10043016ED2B9D28"/>
God ſhall ſee fit to make all effectual; and very often they entertain a ſtrong Perſuaſion, that he will in his own time do it for them.</p>
                  <p>There is wrought in them a holy Repoſe of Soul in God through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a ſecret Diſpoſition to fear and love him, and to hope for Bleſſings from him in this Way: and yet they have no Imagination that they are now converted, it don't ſo much as come into their Minds: and very often the Reaſon is, that they don't ſee that they do <hi>accept</hi> of this ſufficiency of Salvation, that they behold in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> having entertain'd a wrong Notion of <hi>Acceptance;</hi> not being ſenſible that the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and joyful Entertainment which their Hearts give to this Diſcovery of Grace, is a real Acceptance of it: They know not that the ſweet Complacence they feel in the Mercy and complete Salvation of God, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Pardon and Sanctification, and is held forth to them only through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is a true receiving of this Mercy, or a plain Evidence of their receiving it. They expected I know not what Kind of Act of Soul, and perhaps they had no diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> of it themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it appears very plainly in ſome of them, that before their own Converſion they had very <hi>imperfect Ideas</hi> what Converſion was: It is all new and ſtrange, and what there was no clear Conception of before. 'Tis moſt evident as they themſelves acknowledge, that the Expreſſions that were uſed to deſcribe Converſion, and the Graces of God's Spirit, ſuch as <hi>a ſpiritual Sight of Chriſt, Faith in Chriſt, Poverty of Spirit, Truſt in God, Reſignedneſs to God,</hi> &amp;c. were Expreſſions that did not convey thoſe ſpecial and diſtinct <hi>Ideas</hi> to their Minds, which they were intended to ſignify, in ſome reſpects no more than the Names of Colours are to convey the <hi>Ideas</hi> to one that is blind from his Birth.</p>
                  <p>This Town is a Place where there has always been a great deal of Talk of Converſion, and ſpiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences; and therefore People in general had before form'd a Notion in their own Minds what theſe things were; but when they come to be the Subjects of them themſelves, they find themſelves much confounded in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004239_0344_10043019A57D32D0"/>
their Notions, and overthrown in many of their former Conceits. And it has been very obſervable, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the greateſt Underſtanding, and that had ſtudied moſt about things of this nature, have been more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded than others. Some ſuch Perſons that have lately been converted, declare that all their former Wiſdom is brought to nought, and that they appear to have been meer Babes, who knew nothing It has appear'd that none have ſtood more in need of Enlightning and Inſtruction, even of their Fellow Chriſtians, concerning their own Circumſtances and Difficulties, than they: and it has ſeem'd to have been with delight, that they have ſeen themſelves thus brought down and become <hi>nothing,</hi> that free Grace, and divine Power may be <hi>exalted</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>It was very wonderful to ſee after what manner Perſons Affections were ſometimes moved and wrought upon, when God did as it were, ſuddenly open their Eyes and let into their Minds, a ſenſe of the Greatneſs of his Grace, and Fulneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his readineſs to ſave, who before were broken with Apprehenſions of divine Wrath, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In ſome even the View of the Glory of God's Sovereignty in the Exerciſes of his Grace has ſurprized the Soul with ſuch Sweetneſs, as to produce the ſame Effects. I remember an Inſtance of one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, reading ſomething concerning God's ſovereign way of ſaving Sinners, as being ſelf-moved, and having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Men's own Righteouſneſs as the Motive of his Grace, but as magnifying himſelf and abaſing Man, or to that purpoſe, felt ſuch a ſudden Rapture of Joy and Delight in the Conſideration of it: and yet then ſuſpected himſelf to be in a Chriſtleſs Condition, and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004239_0345_1004301B2B1AF920"/>
had been long in great Diſtreſs for fear that God would not have mercy on him.</p>
                  <p>Many continue a long time in a Courſe of gracious Exerciſes and Experiences, and don't think themſelves to be converted, but conclude themſelves to be otherwiſe; and none knows how long they would continue ſo, were they not helped by particular Inſtruction.

                  <p>Converſion is a great and glorious Work of God's Power, at once Changing the Heart, and infuſing Life into the dead Soul; tho' that Grace that is then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted does more gradually diſplay it ſelf in ſome than in others But as to fixing on the <hi>preciſe Time</hi> when they put forth the very firſt Act of Grace, there is a great deal of difference in different Perſons; in ſome it ſeems to be very diſcernable when the very Time of this was; but others are more at a loſs. In <hi>this reſpect</hi> there are very many that don't know the Time, (as has been already obſerved) that when they have the firſt Exerciſes of Grace, don't know that <hi>it is</hi> the Grace of Converſion, and ſometimes don't think it to be ſo till a long time after: And many, even when they come to entertain great Hope that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted if they remember what they experienced in the firſt Exerciſes of Grace, they are at a loſs whether it

ſeems to me neceſſary to ſuppoſe, that there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Influence of the Spirit of God, oftentimes in bringing Texts of Scripture to the Mind: Not that I ſuppoſe 'tis done in a way of immediate Revelation, without any manner of uſe of the Memory; but yet there ſeems plainly to be an immediate and extraordinary Influence, in leading their Thoughts ſo ſuch and ſuch Paſſages of Scripture, and exciting them <hi>in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</hi> Indeed in ſome God ſeems to bring Texts of Scripture to their Minds no otherwiſe than by leading them into ſuch Frames and Meditations, as harmonize with thoſe Scriptures; but in many Perſons there ſeems to be ſomething more than this.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that, while under legal Convictions, have had the greateſt Terrors, have not always obtain'd the greateſt Light and Comfort; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> have they always Light moſt ſuddenly communicated; but yet, I think, the time of Converſion has generally been moſt ſenſible in ſuch Perſons. Oftentimes, the firſt ſenſible Change after the Extremity of Terrors, is a Calmneſs, and then the Light gradually comes in; <hi>ſmall Glimpſes</hi> at firſt, after their midnight Darkneſs, and <hi>a word or two of Comfort,</hi> as it were ſoftly ſpoken to 'em; they have a <hi>little Taſte</hi> of the Sweetneſs of divine Grace, 'and the Love of a Saviour, when Terror and Diſtreſs of Conſcience begins to be turned into an humble, meek Senſe of their own Unworthineſs before God; and there is felt inwardly, perhaps, ſome Diſpoſition to praiſe God; and after a little while the Light comes in more clearly and powerfully. But yet, I think more frequently, great Terrors have been followed with more ſudden and great Light, and Comfort; when the Sinner ſeems to be as it were ſubdued and brought to a Calm, from a kind of Tumult of Mind, then God lets in an extraordinary Senſe of his great Mercy thro' a Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>The converting Influences of God's Spirit very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bring an extraordinary Conviction of the Reality and Certainty of the great Things of Religion; (tho' in ſome this is much greater, ſome time after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, than at firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) they have that ſight and taſte of

the Divinity, or divine Excellency, that there is in the Things of the Goſpel, that is more to convince them, than reading many Volumes of Arguments without it. It ſeems to me that in many Inſtances amongſt us, when the divine Excellency and Glory of the Things of Chriſtianity have been ſet before Perſons, and they have at the ſame time as it were ſeen, and taſted, and felt the Divinity of them, they have been as far from doubting of the Truth of them, as they are from doubting whether there be a Sun, when their Eyes are open upon it in the midſt of a clear Hemiſphere, and the ſtrong Blaze of his Light overcomes all Objections againſt his Being. And yet many of them, if we ſhould ask them why they believed thoſe Things to be true, would not be able well to expreſs, or communicate a ſufficient Reaſon, to ſatisfy the Enquirer, and perhaps would make no other Anſwer but that they ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Some are thus convinced of the Truth of the Goſpel in general, and that the Scriptures are the Word of God: Others have their Minds more eſpecially fixed on ſome particular great Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſome particular Truths that they are <hi>meditating</hi> on; or are in a ſpecial manner convinced of the Divinity of the Things they are <hi>reading</hi> of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſome portion of Scripture. Some have ſuch Convictions in a much more remarkable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than others: And there are ſome that never had ſuch a ſpecial Senſe of the Certainty of divine Things, impreſſed upon them with ſuch inward Evidence and Strength, have yet very clear Exerciſes of Grace; <hi>i. e.</hi> of Love to God, Repentance and Holineſs. And if they be more particularly examined, they appear plainly to have an inward firm Perſuaſion of the Reality of divine Things, ſuch as they don't uſe to have before their Converſion. And thoſe that have the moſt clear Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of divine Truth, in the manner that has been

ſpoken of, can't have this always in view. When the Senſe and Reliſh of the divine Excellency of theſe Things fades, on a withdraw of the Spirit of God, they han't the medium of the Conviction of their Truth at command: In a dull Frame they can't recall the <hi>

                        </gap>ea,</hi> and inward Senſe they had, prefectly to mind; Things appear very dim to what they did before: And tho' there ſtill remains an habitual ſtrong Perſuaſion; yet not ſo as to exclude Temptations to Unbelief, and all poſſibility of Doubting, as before: But then at particular Times, by God's Help, the ſame Senſe of Things revives again, like Fire that lay hid in Aſhes.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe the grounds of ſuch a Conviction of the Truth of divine Things to be juſt and rational, but yet in ſome God makes uſe of their own Reaſon much more ſenſibly than in others. Oftentimes Perſons have (ſo far as could be judged) receiv'd the firſt ſaving Conviction from reaſoning, which they have heard <hi>from the Pulpit;</hi> and often in the courſe of Reaſoning, which they are led into <hi>in their own Meditations</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Arguments</hi> are the <hi>ſame</hi> that they have heard hundreds of times; but <hi>the Force of the Arguments, and their Conviction by 'em,</hi> is altogether new; they come with a new and before unexperienced Power: Before they <hi>heard it</hi> was ſo, and they <hi>allow'd it</hi> to be ſo; but now they <hi>ſee it</hi> to be ſo indeed. Things now look exceeding plain to 'em, and they wonder that they did not ſee 'em before.</p>
                  <p>They are ſo greatly taken with their new Diſcovery, and Things appear ſo plain, and ſo rational to 'em, that they are often at firſt ready to think they can convince others; and are apt to engage in talk with every one they meet with,<hi>almoſt</hi> to this End; and when they are diſappointed, are ready to wonder that their Reaſonings ſeem to make no more Impreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Many fall under ſuch a Miſtake as to be ready to doubt of their good Eſtate, becauſe there was ſo much uſe made of their own Reaſon in the Convictions they have receiv'd; they are afraid that they have no Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above the natural Force of their own Faculties:
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004239_0352_1004302B70AFC690"/>
And many make that an Objection againſt the Spirituality of their Convictions, that 'tis ſo eaſy to ſee Things as they now ſee them. They have often heard that Converſion is a work of mighty Power, manifeſting to the Soul what no Man nor Angel can give ſuch a Conviction of; but it ſeems to them that the Things that they ſee are ſo plain, and eaſy, and rational, that any body can ſee them: And if they are enquired of, why they never ſaw ſo before; they ſay, it ſeems to them it was becauſe they never thought of it. But very often theſe Difficulties are ſoon removed by thoſe of another nature; for when God withdraws, they find themſelves as it were blind again, they for the preſent loſe their realizing Senſe of thoſe Things that looked ſo plain to 'em, and by all that they can do they can't recover it, till God renews the Influences of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Perſons after their Converſion often ſpeak of Things of Religion as ſeeming <hi>new</hi> to them; that Preaching is a <hi>new</hi> thing; that it ſeems to them they never heard Preaching before; that the Bible is a <hi>new</hi> Book: They find there <hi>new</hi> Chapters, <hi>new</hi> Pſalms, <hi>new</hi> Hiſtories, becauſe they ſee them in a new Light. Here was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtance of an aged Woman that had ſpent moſt of her Days under Mr. <hi>Stoddard's</hi> powerful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; who reading in the New Teſtament, concerning <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Sufferings for Sinners, ſeem'd to be ſurprized and aſtoniſhed at what ſhe read, as at a Thing that was real and very wonderful, but quite <hi>new</hi> to her, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that at firſt, before ſhe had time to turn her Thoughts, ſhe wonder'd within her ſelf that ſhe had never heard of it before; but then immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected her ſelf, and thought that ſhe had often heard of it, and read it, but never till now ſaw it as a thing real; and then caſt in her Mind, how wonderful this was, that the Son of God ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſuch things for Sinners, and how ſhe had ſpent her Time in ungratefully ſinning againſt ſo good a God, and ſuch a Saviour; tho' ſhe was a Perſon, as to what was viſible, of a very blameleſs and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Life, And ſhe was ſo overcome by thoſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004239_0353_1004302F4813EAB8"/>
that her Nature was ready to fail under them: Thoſe that were about her, and knew not what was the matter, were ſurprized, and thought ſhe was a dying.</p>
                  <p>Many have ſpoken much of their Hearts being drawn out in Love to God and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and their Minds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrapt up in delightful Contemplation of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and wonderful Grace of God, and the Excellency, and dying Love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and of their Souls going forth in longing Deſires <hi>after God and Chriſt</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of our young Children have expreſſed much of this; and have manifeſted a Willingneſs to leave Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother and all Things in the World, to go to be with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Some Perſons have had longing Deſires after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which have riſen to that degree, as to take away their natural Strength. Some have been ſo overcome with a Senſe of the dying Love of <hi>Chriſt, </hi> to ſuch poor, wretched, and unworthy Creatures, as to weaken the Body. Several Perſons have had ſo great a Senſe of the Glory of God, and Excellency of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that Nature and Life has ſeemed almoſt to ſink under it; and in all probability, if God had ſhewed them a little more of himſelf, it would have diſſolved their Frame. I have ſeen ſome, and been in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with them in ſuch Frames, who have certainly been perfectly ſober, and very remote from any thing like enthuſiaſtick Wildneſs: And have talk'd, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeak, of the Glory of God's Perfections, and the wonderfulneſs of his Grace in Chriſt, and their own Unworthineſs, in ſuch a manner that can't be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly expreſſed after them. Their Senſe of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding littleneſs and vileneſs, and their Diſpoſition to abaſe themſelves before God, has appeared to be great in proportion to their Light and Joy. Such Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us as have been thus diſtinguiſhed with the moſt extraordinary Diſcoveries of God, have commonly in no wiſe appeared with the aſſuming, &amp; ſelf-conceited, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Airs of Enthuſiaſts, but exceedingly the contrary; and are eminent for a Spirit of Meekneſs, Modeſty, Self diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and low Opinion of themſelves: No Perſons ſeem to be ſo ſenſible of their need of Inſtruction, and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004239_0354_1004053DCD3AF298"/>
ſo eager to receive it, as ſome of them; nor ſo ready to think others better than themſelves. Thoſe that have been thought to be converted amongſt us have <hi>generally</hi> manifeſted a longing to lie low, and in the duſt before God; withal complaining of their not being able to lie low enough. They very often ſpeak much of their Senſe of the Excellency of the way of Salvation, by free and ſovereign Grace, through the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone; and how it is with delight that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their own Righteouſneſs, and rejoice in having no Account made of it Many have expreſſed themſelves to this purpoſe, that it would leſſen the Satisfaction they hope for in Heaven to have it by their own Righteouſneſs, or in any other way than as beſtowed by free Grace, and for <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſake alone. They ſpeak much of the <hi>Inexpreſſibleneſs</hi> of what they experience, how their Words fail, ſo that they can in no wiſe declare it: and particularly ſpeak with exceeding Admiration of the ſuperlative Excellency of that pleaſure and delight of Soul, which they ſometimes, enjoy; how a little of it is ſufficient to pay 'em for the Pains and Trouble they have gone through in ſeeking Salvation; and how far it exceeds all earthly Pleaſures: And ſome expreſs much of the Senſe which theſe ſpiritual Views give 'em of the Vanity of earthly Enjoyments, how mean and worthleſs all theſe Things appear to 'em.</p>
                  <p>Many, while their Minds have been fill'd with ſpiritual Delights, have as it were forgot their Food; their bodily Appetite has fail'd, while their Minds have been entertain'd with <hi>Meat to eat that</hi> others <hi>knew not of.</hi> The Light and Comfort which ſome of them enjoy, gives a new reliſh to their common Bleſſings, and cauſes all Things about 'em to appear as it were beautiful, ſweet and pleaſant to them: All Things abroad, the Sun, Moon and Stars, the Clouds and Sky, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth, appear as it were with a Caſt of divine Glory and Sweetneſs upon them. The ſweeteſt Joy that theſe good People amongſt us expreſs, is not that which conſiſts in a Senſe of the Safety of their own State, and that now they are out of danger of Hell;
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004239_0355_10043030CCA81108"/>
frequently, in times of their higheſt ſpiritual Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, this ſeems to be as it were forgotten. The ſupreme Attention of their Minds is to the glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which they have in view; not but that there is very often a raviſhing Senſe of God's Love accompanying a Senſe of his Excellency, and they rejoice in a Senſe of the Faithfulneſs of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as they reſpect the future eternal Enjoyment of God.</p>
                  <p>The Joy that many of them ſpeak of as that, to which none is to be parallel'd; is that which they find when they are loweſt in the Duſt, emptied moſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as it were annihilating themſelves before God, when they are nothing, and God is all, are ſeeing their own Unworthineſs, depending not at all on themſelves, but alone on <hi>Christ,</hi> and aſcribing all Glory to God: Then their Souls are moſt in the Enjoyment of ſatisfying Reſt; excepting that, at ſuch times, they apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be not ſufficiently ſelf-abaſed, for then above all times do they long to be lower. Some ſpeak much of the exquiſite Sweetneſs, and Reſt of Soul that is to be found in the exerciſes of a Spirit of Reſignation to God, and humble Submiſſion to his Will. Many expreſs earneſt Longings of Soul to praiſe God; but at the ſame time complain that they can't praiſe him as they would do, and they want to have others help them in praiſing him: They want to have <hi>every one</hi> praiſe God, and are ready to call upon <hi>every thing</hi> to praiſe him. They expreſs a longing Deſire to live to God's Glory, and to do ſomething to his Honour; but at the ſame time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>While God was ſo remarkably preſent amongſt us by his Spirit, there was no Book ſo delighted in as the Bible; eſpecially the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the Prophecy of <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſo prized as the Lord's-Day, and <hi>no Place</hi> in this World ſo deſired as God's Houſe. Our Converts <hi>then</hi> remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably appeared united in dear Affection to one another, and many have expreſſed much of that Spirit of Love which they felt toward all Mankind; and particularly to thoſe that had been leaſt friendly to them. Never, I believe, was ſo much done in confeſſing Injuries, and making up Differences as the laſt Year. Perſons after their own Converſion, have commonly expreſſed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding deſire for the Converſion of others: Some have thought that they ſhould be willing to die for the Converſion of any Soul, tho' of one of the meaneſt of their Fellow-Creatures, or of their worſt Enemies; and many have indeed been in great Diſtreſs with Deſires and Longings for it. This Work of God had alſo a good Effect to unite the People's Affections much to their Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Perſons that I have been acquainted with, but more eſpecially two, that belong to other Towns, that have been ſwallowed up exceedingly with a Senſe of the awful Greatneſs and Majeſty of God; and both of them told me to this purpoſe, that if they in the time of it, had had the leaſt Fear that they were not at at peace with this ſo great a God, they ſhould inſtantly have died.</p>
                  <p>It is worthy to be remarked, that ſome Perſons by their Converſion ſeem to be greatly helped as to their doctrinal Notions of Religion; it was particulary remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable in one, who having been taken captive in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, was train'd up in <hi>Canada,</hi> in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion; and ſome Years ſince returned to this his native Place, and was in a meaſure brought off from <hi>Popery:</hi> but ſeem'd very awkward and dull of receiving any true and clear Notion of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Scheme, till he was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then he was remarkably altered in this reſpect.</p>
                  <p>There is a vaſt difference, as has been obſerv'd in the <hi>Degree,</hi> and alſo in the particular <hi>Manner</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Experiences, both <hi>at,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> Converſion; <hi>ſome</hi> have Grace working more ſenſibly in one way, <hi>others</hi> in another. <hi>Some</hi> ſpeak more fully of a Conviction of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004239_0357_100430362DCF62F0"/>
the Juſtice of God in their Condemnation; <hi>others</hi> more of their conſenting to the way of Salvation by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſome more of the Actings of Love to God and <hi>Chriſt: Some</hi> more of Acts of Affiance, in a ſweet and aſſured Conviction of the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God in his Promiſes; <hi>others</hi> more of their chooſing and reſting in God as their whole and everlaſting Portion, and of their ardent and longing Deſires after God, to have Communion with him; <hi>others</hi> more of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of themſelves for their paſt Sins, and earneſt Longings to live to God's Glory for the time to come: <hi>Some</hi> have their Mind fixed more on God; <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as I have obſerved before, but it ſeems evidently to be the <hi>ſame Work,</hi> the <hi>ſame Thing done,</hi> the <hi>ſame habitual Change</hi> wrought in the Heart; it all tends the ſame way, and to the <hi>ſame End:</hi> and 'tis plainly the <hi>ſame Spirit</hi> that breathes and acts in <hi>various</hi> Perſons. There is an endleſs <hi>Variety</hi> in the particular manner and circumſtances in which Perſons a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> wrought on, and an opportunity of ſeeing ſo much of ſuch a Work of God, will ſhew that God is further from confining himſelf to certain Steps, and a particular Method, in his Work on Souls, than it may be ſome do imagine. I believe it has occaſion'd ſome good People amongſt us, that were before too ready to make their own Experiences a Rule to others, to be leſs cenſorious and more extended in their Charity. The Work of God has been glorious in its Variety, it has the more diſplayed the manifold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unſearchableneſs of the Wiſdom of God, and wrought more Charity among his People.</p>
                  <p>There is a great Difference among thoſe that are converted as to the Degree of <hi>Hope and Satisfaction</hi> that they have concerning their own <hi>State.</hi> Some have a high degree of Satisfaction in this Matter almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly: And yet it is rare that any do enjoy ſo full an Aſſurance of their Intereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that Self-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination ſhould ſeem needleſs to them; unleſs it be at particular Seaſons, while in the actual enjoyment of ſome great Diſcovery, that God gives of his Glory and rich Grace in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the drawing forth of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004239_0358_10043038DE1DCEF0"/>
acts of Grace. But the greater part, as they ſometimes fall into dead Frames of Spirit, are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed with Scruples and Fears concerning their Condition.</p>
                  <p>They generally have an awful Apprehenſion of the Dreadfulneſs and undoing Nature of a falſe Hope; and there has been obſervable in moſt a great Caution, left in giving an account of their Experiences, they ſhould ſay too much, and uſe too ſtrong Terms: And many after they have related their Experiences, have been greatly afflicted with Fears, left they have play'd the Hypocrite, and uſed ſtronger Terms than their Caſe would fairly allow of; and yet could not find how they could correct themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I think that the main ground of the Doubts and Fears that Perſons, after their Converſion, have been exerciſed with about their own State, has been that they have found ſo much Corruption remaining in their Hearts. At firſt their Souls ſeem to be all alive, their Hearts are fixed, and their Affections flowing; they ſeem to live quite above the World, and meet with but little Difficulty in religious Exerciſes; and they are ready to think it will always be ſo: Tho' they are truly abaſed under a Senſe of their Vileneſs by reaſon of former Acts of Sin, yet they are not then ſufficiently ſenſible what Corruption ſtill remains in their Hearts; and therefore are ſurprized when they find that they begin to be in dull and dead Frames, to be troubled with wandering Thoughts in the time of publick and private Worſhip, and to be utterly unable to keep themſelves from 'em; alſo when they find themſelves unaffected at Seaſons in which, they think there is the greateſt Occaſion to be affected; and when they feel worldly Diſpoſitions working in them, and it may be Pride, and Envy, and ſtirrings of Revenge, or ſome ill Spirit towards ſome Perſon, that has injured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>other workings of indwelling Sin: Their Hearts are almoſt ſunk with the Diſappointment, and they are ready preſently to think that all this they have met with is nothing, and that they are mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They are ready to argue, that if God had indeed done ſuch great Things for them, as they hoped, ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude would be inconſiſtent with it: They cry out of the hardneſs and wickedneſs of their Hearts; and ſay there is ſo much Corruption, that it ſeems to them <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that there ſhould be any Goodneſs there:</hi> and many of them ſeem to be much more ſenſible how corrupt their Hearts are, than ever they were before they were convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſome have been too ready to be impreſs'd with Fear, that inſtead of becoming better, they are grown much worſe, and make it an Argument againſt the Goodneſs of their State. But in truth the Caſe ſeems plainly to be, that now they feel the pain of their own Wound; they have a watchful Eye upon their Hearts, that they don't uſe to have: They take more notice what Sin is there, and Sin is now more burdenſome to 'em, they ſtrive more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and feel more of the Strength of it.</p>
                  <p>They are ſomewhat ſurpriz'd that they ſhould in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect find themſelves ſo different from the <hi>Idea</hi> that they generally had entertained of godly Perſons; for tho' Grace be indeed of a far more excellent nature than they imagin'd; yet thoſe that are godly have much leſs of it, and much more remaining Corruption, than they thought. They never realized it, that Perſons were wont to meet with ſuch Difficulties, after they were once converted. When they are thus exerciſed with Doubts about their State, through the Deadneſs of their Frames of Spirit, as long as theſe Frames laſt, they are commonly unable to ſatisfy themſelves of the Truth of their Grace, by all their Self-examination. When they hear of the Signs of Grace laid down for 'em to try themſelves by, they are often ſo clouded, that they don't know how to apply them: they hardly know whether they have ſuch and ſuch things in them or no, and whether they have experienced them or not: That which was ſweeteſt, and beſt, and moſt diſtinguiſhing in their Experiences, they can't recover a ſenſe or <hi>Idea</hi> of. But on a Return of the Influences of the Spirit of God, to revive the lively Actings of Grace, the Light breaks through the Cloud, and Doubting and Darkneſs ſoon vaniſh away.</p>

Perſons are often revived out of their dead and dark Frames, by religious Converſation: while they are talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divine things, <hi>or ever</hi> they are <hi>aware,</hi> their <hi>Souls</hi> are carried away into holy Exerciſes with abundant Pleaſure. And oftentimes, while they are relating their paſt Experiences to their Chriſtian Brethren, they have a freſh ſenſe of them revived, and the ſame Experiences in a Degree again renewed. Sometimes while Perſons are exerciſed in Mind with ſeveral Objections againſt the Goodneſs of their State, they have Scriptures, one after another, coming to their Minds, to anſwer their Scruples, and unravel their Difficulties, exceeding appoſite and proper to their Circumſtances; by which means their Darkneſs is ſcattered; and often before the Beſtowment of any new remarkable Comforts, eſpecially after long continued Deadneſs and ill Frames, there are renewed Humblings, in a great ſenſe of their own exceeding Vileneſs and Unworthineſs, as before their firſt Comforts were beſtowed.</p>
                  <p>Many in the Country have entertain'd a mean Thought of this great Work that there has been amongſt us, from what they have heard of <hi>Impreſſions</hi> that have been made on Perſons <hi>Imaginations.</hi> But there have been exceeding great Miſrepreſentations, and innumerable falſe Reports concerning that Matter.

                     </gap> ſpiritual Perfections, there has ariſen in the Mind an <hi>Idea</hi> of one of glorious Majeſty, and of a ſweet and a gracious Aſpect: So ſome when they have been greatly affected with <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death, have at the ſame time a lively <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hanging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, and of his Blood running from his Wounds; which things won't be wondred at by them that have obſerved how ſtrong Affections about temporal Matters will excite lively <hi>Ideas</hi> and Pictures of different things in the Mind.</p>
                  <p>But yet the vigorous Exerciſe of the Mind, does doubtleſs more ſtrongly impreſs it with imaginary <hi>Ideas,</hi> in ſome than others, which probably may ariſe from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Conſtitution, and ſeems, evidently in ſome, partly to ariſe from their peculiar Circumſtances: When Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been exerciſed with extreme Terrors, and there is a ſudden change to Light and Joy, the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems more ſuſceptive of ſtrong <hi>Ideas,</hi> and the inferior Powers, and even the Frame of the Body, is much more affected and wrought upon, than when the ſame Perſons have as great ſpiritual Light and Joy afterwards; of which it might, perhaps, be eaſy to give a Reaſon. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Rev.

myſterious to me, and I have been at a loſs about them; for tho' it has been exceeding evident to me by many things that appear'd in them, both then (when they related them) and afterwards, that they indeed had a great ſenſe of the ſpiritual Excellency of Divine Things accompanying them; yet I have not been able well to ſatisfy myſelf, whether their imaginary <hi>Ideas</hi> have been more than could naturally ariſe from their ſpiritual Senſe of things. However, I have uſed the utmoſt Caution in ſuch Caſes; great Care has been taken both in publick and in private to teach Perſons the difference between what is <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and what is merely <hi>imaginary.</hi> I have often warned Perſons not to lay the ſtreſs of their Hope on any <hi>Ideas</hi> of any outward Glory, or any external thing whatſoever, and have met with no Oppoſition in ſuch Inſtructions. But 'tis not ſtrange if ſome weaker Perſons, in giving an account of their Experiences, have not ſo prudently diſtinguiſhed between the ſpiritual and imaginary Part; which ſome that have not been well affected to Religion, might take advantage of.</p>
                  <p>There has been much talk in many parts of the Country, as tho' the People have ſymbolized with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the <hi>Quakers themſelves</hi> have been moved with ſuch Reports; and came here, once and again, hoping to find good Waters to fiſh in; but without the leaſt Succeſs, and ſeem to be diſcouraged, and have left off coming. There have alſo been Reports ſpread about the Country, as tho' the firſt Occaſion of ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a Concern on People's Minds here, was an Apprehenſion that the World was near to an end, which was altogether a falſe Report: Indeed after this Stirring and Concern became ſo general and extraordinary, as has been related, the Minds of ſome were filled with Speculation, what ſo great a Diſpenſation of divine Providence might forebode: and ſome Reports were heard from abroad, as tho' certain Divines and others thought the Conflagration was nigh: but ſuch Reports were never generally looked upon worthy of Notice.</p>
                  <p>The Work that has now been wrought on Souls is evidently the ſame that was wrought in my venerable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor's
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004239_0363_1004304661BE6D80"/>
Days; as I have had abundant Opportunity to know, having been in the Miniſtry here two Years with him, and ſo converſed with a conſiderable Number that my Grandfather thought to be ſavingly converted in that time; and having been particularly acquainted with the Experiences of many that were converted under his Miniſtry before. And I know no one of them, that in the leaſt doubts of its being the ſame Spirit, and the ſame Work. Perſons have now no otherwiſe been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Impreſſions on their Imaginations, than formerly: The Work is of the ſame nature, and has not been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any extraordinary Circumſtances, excepting ſuch as are analogous to the extraordinary degree of it before deſcribed. And God's People, that were formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, have now partook of the ſame Shower of divine Bleſſing, in the <hi>renewing, ſtrengthening, edifying Influences</hi> of the Spirit of God, that others have in his <hi>converting Influences;</hi> and the Work here has alſo been plainly the ſame with that, which has been wrought in thoſe of other Places that have been mentioned, as partaking of the ſame Bleſſing I have particularly converſed with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons about their Experiences that belong to all parts of the County, and in various parts of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> where a religious Concern has lately appear'd; and have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the Experiences of many others by their own Paſtors.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſily perceived by the foregoing Account that 'tis very much the Practice of the People here, to converſe freely one with another of their ſpiritual Experiences, which is a thing that many have been diſguſted at. But however our People <hi>may have,</hi> in ſome reſpects, gone to extremes in it, yet 'tis doubtleſs a Practice that the Circumſtances of this Town, and neighbouring Towns, has naturally led them into. Whatſoever People are in ſuch Circumſtances, where all have their Minds engaged to ſuch a Degree, in the ſame Affair, that 'tis ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in their Thoughts; they will naturally make it the Subject of Converſation one with another when they get together, in which they will grow more and more free: Reſtraints will ſoon vaniſh; and they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004239_0364_1004304800E2BEE0"/>
from one another what they meet with. And it has been a Practice which, in the general, has been attended with many good Effects, and what God has greatly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt us: But it muſt be conteſt, there may have been ſome ill Conſequences of it; which yet are rather to be laid to the indiſcreet Management of it, than to the Practice it ſelf; and none can wonder, if among ſuch a multitude ſome ſail of exerciſing ſo much Prudence in chooſing the time, manner, and occaſion of ſuch Diſcourſe, as is deſireable.</p>

She continued thus till <hi>Thurſday;</hi> and then there was a ſudden Alteration, by a great Increaſe of her Concern, in an extraordinary ſenſe of her own Sinfulneſs, particularly the Sinfulneſs of her Nature, and Wickedneſs of her Heart, which came upon her (as ſhe expreſſed it) as a Flaſh of Lightning, and ſtruck her into an exceeding Terror.

                  <p>While her Mind was in this Poſture, her Heart, ſhe ſaid, ſeem'd to fly to the Miniſter for Refuge, hoping that he could give her ſome Relief. She came the ſame Day to her Brother, with the Countenance of a Perſon in diſtreſs, expoſtulating with him, why he had not told her more of her Sinfulneſs, and earneſtly enquiring of him what ſhe ſhould do. She ſeem'd that Day to feel in herſelf an Enmity againſt the Bible, which greatly affrighted her.

                  <p>She had great Longings to die, that ſhe might be with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which increaſed 'till ſhe thought ſhe did not know how to be patient to wait till God's time ſhould come. But once when ſhe felt thoſe Longings, ſhe thought with her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>If I long to die, why do I go to Phyſicians?</hi> Whence ſhe concluded that her Longings for Death were not well regulated After this ſhe often put it to herſelf, which ſhe ſhould chooſe, whether to live or to die, to be ſick, or to be well; and ſhe found ſhe could not tell, till at laſt ſhe found herſelf diſpoſed to ſay theſe Words; <hi>I am quite willing to live, and quite willing to die; quite willing to be ſick, and quite willing to be well; and quite willing for any thing that God will bring upon me! And then,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I felt my ſelf perfectly eaſy,</hi> in a full Submiſſion to the Will of God. She then lamented much, that ſhe had been ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in her Longings for Death, as it argued want of ſuch a Reſignation to God, as ought to be. She ſeem'd hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward to continue in this reſigned Frame till Death.</p>
                  <p>After this her Illneſs increaſed upon her: and once af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had before ſpent the greater Part of the Night in extreme Pain, ſhe waked out of a little ſleep with theſe Words in her Heart and Mouth; <hi>I am willing to ſuffer for Chriſt's ſake, I am willing to ſpend and be ſpent for Chriſt's ſake; I am willing to ſpend my Life, even my very Life for Chriſt's ſake!</hi> And tho' ſhe had an extraordinary Reſignation, with reſpect to Life or Death, yet the Thoughts of Dying were exceeding ſweet to her. At a time when her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was reading in <hi>Job,</hi> concerning Worms feeding on the dead Body, ſhe appear'd with a pleaſant Smile; and being enquired of about it, ſhe ſaid, it was ſweet to her to think of <hi>her</hi> being in ſuch Circumſtances. At another time, when her Brother mention'd to her the Danger there ſeem'd to be that the Illneſs ſhe then labour'd under, might be an Occaſion of her Death, it fill'd her with Joy that almoſt overcame her. At a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time, when ſhe met a Company following a

Corpſe to the Grave, ſhe ſaid, it was ſweet to her to think, that they would in a little time follow her in like manner.</p>
                  <p>Her Illneſs in the latter part of it was ſeated much in her Throat; and ſwelling inward, fill'd up the Pipe, ſo that ſhe could ſwallow nothing but what was perfectly liquid, and but very little of that, and with great and long Strugglings and Stranglings, that which ſhe took in, flying out at her Noſtrils, till ſhe at laſt could ſwallow nothing at all: She had a raging Appetite to Food, ſo that ſhe told her Siſter, when talking with her about her Circumſtances, that the worſt Bit that ſhe threw to her Swine, would be ſweet to her: but yet when ſhe ſaw that ſhe could not ſwallow it, ſhe ſeem'd to be as perfectly contented without it, as if ſhe had no Appetite to it. Others were greatly moved to ſee what ſhe underwent, and were fill'd with Admiration at her unexampled Patience. At a Time when ſhe was ſtriving in vain to get down a little Food, ſomething liquid, and was very much ſpent with it; ſhe look'd up on her Siſter with a Smile, ſaying, <hi>O Siſter, this is for my Good!</hi> At another time, when her Siſter was ſpeaking of what ſhe underwent, ſhe told her, that ſhe <hi>liv'd an Heaven upon Earth for all that</hi> She uſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſay to her Siſter, under her extreme Sufferings, <hi>It is good to be ſo!</hi> Her Siſter once asked her, why ſhe ſaid to, <hi>why,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>becauſe God would have it ſo: It is beſt that things ſhould be as God would have 'em: It looks beſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>She had long been infirm, and often had been exerciſed with great Pain; but ſhe died chiefly of Famine. It was, doubtleſs, partly owing to her bodily Weakneſs, that her Nature was ſo often overcome, and ready to ſink with gracious Affection; but yet the truth was, that ſhe had more Grace, and greater Diſcoveries of God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than the preſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Her Parents did

not know of it at that time, and were not wont, in the Counſels they gave to their Children, particularly to direct themſelves to her, by reaſon of her being ſo young, and as they ſuppoſed not capable of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: but after her Brother had talked to her, they obſerved her very earneſtly to liſten to the Advice they gave to the other Children; and ſhe was obſerved very conſtantly to retire, ſeveral times in a Day, as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, for ſecret Prayer; and grew more and more engaged in Religion, and was more frequent in her Cloſer; till at laſt ſhe was wont to viſit it five or ſix times in a Day: and was ſo engaged in it, that nothing would at any Time divert her from her ſtated Cloſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Exerciſes. Her Mother often obſerved and watched her, when ſuch Things occurr'd, as ſhe thought moſt likely to divert her, either by putting it out of her Thoughts, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe engaging her Inclinations; but never could obſerve her to fail. She mention'd ſome very remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>

But on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the laſt Day of <hi>July,</hi> about the middle of the Day, the Child being in the Cloſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, where it uſed to retire, its Mother heard it ſpeaking aloud; which was unuſual, and never had been obſerved before: And her Voice ſeemed to be as of one exceeding importunate and engaged; but her Mother could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly here only theſe Words, (ſpoken in her childiſh Manner, but ſeemed to be ſpoken with extraordinary earneſtneſs, and out of Diſtreſs of Soul,) <hi>PRAY BLESS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED LORD give me Salvation!

Her Mother very earneſtly asked her ſeveral times, what the matter was, before ſhe would make any Anſwer; but ſhe continued exceedingly crying, and wreathing her Body to and fro, like one in anguiſh of Spirit. Her Mother then asked her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe was afraid that God would not give her Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She anſwered <hi>yes, I am afraid I ſhall go to

Hell!</hi> Her Mother then endeavoured to quiet her, and told her ſhe <hi>would not have</hi> her <hi>cry,</hi> ſhe <hi>muſt be a good Girl, and pray every Day, and</hi> ſhe <hi>hoped God would give her Salvation.</hi> But this did not quiet her at all; but ſhe continued thus earneſtly crying, and taking on for ſome time, till at length ſhe ſuddenly ceaſed crying, and began to ſmile, and preſently ſaid with a ſmiling Countenance, <hi>Mother, the Kingdom of Heaven is come to me!</hi> Her Mother was ſurprized at the ſudden Alteration, and at the Speech; and knew not what to make of it, but at firſt ſaid nothing to her. The Child preſently ſpake again, and ſaid, <hi>there is another come to me, and there is another, there is three;</hi> and being asked what ſhe meant, ſhe anſwered <hi>one is, Thy will be done, and there is another, Enjoy him for ever;</hi> by which it ſeems that when the Child ſaid <hi>there is three come to me,</hi> ſhe meant three Paſſages of its Catrchiſm that came to her Mind.</p>
                  <p>After the Child had ſaid this, ſhe retired again into her Cloſet; and her Mother went over to her Brother's, who was next Neighbour; and when ſhe came back, the Child, being come out of the Cloſet, meets her Mother with this chearful Speech, <hi>I can find God now!</hi> referring to what ſhe had before complain'd of that ſhe could not find God. Then the Child ſpoke again and ſaid, <hi>I love God!</hi> Her Mother asked her, <hi>how well</hi> ſhe loved God, whether ſhe loved God <hi>better than her Father and Mother,</hi> ſhe ſaid <hi>yes.</hi> Then ſhe asked her whether ſhe loved God <hi>better than her little Siſter</hi> Rachel?

This ſtill'd her a little while; but preſently ſhe broke out again into an exceeding Fit of Crying: Her Mother asked her <hi>what</hi> made her <hi>cry again? Why</hi> ſhe cryed <hi>now, ſince</hi> they had asked <hi>leave? What</hi> it was that troubled her now? And asked her ſeveral times very earneſtly, before ſhe made any Anſwer; but at laſt ſaid, <hi>it was becauſe BECAUSE IT WAS SIN.</hi> She continued a conſiderable time cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſaid ſhe would not <hi>go again if Eunice</hi> asked her <hi>an hundred Times;</hi> and ſhe retain'd her Averſion to that Fruit for a conſiderable time, under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of her former Sin.</p>
                  <p>She at ſome times appears greatly affected, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with Texts of Scripture that come to her mind. Particularly, about the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> the laſt Year, that Text came to her mind, <hi>Rev.</hi> iii.20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the Door and knock: If any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in, and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> She ſpoke of it to thoſe of the Family, with a great appearance of Joy, a ſmiling Countenance, &amp; Elevation of Voice, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe went into another Room, where her Mother overheard her talking very earneſtly to the Children about it, and particularly heard her ſay to them, three or four times over, with an air of exceeding Joy and Admiration, <hi>Why it is to SUP WITH GOD.</hi> At ſome time about the middle of Winter, very late in the Night, when all were a bed, her Mother perceived that ſhe was awake, and heard her, as tho' ſhe was weeping. She
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:004239_0379_10043069117592F0"/>
called to her, and asked her what was the matter. She anſwered with a low Voice, ſo that her Mother could not hear what ſhe ſaid; but thinking that it might be occaſion'd by ſome ſpiritual Affection, ſaid no more to her; but perceived her to lie awake, and to continue in the ſame Frame, for a conſiderable time. The next Morning, ſhe asked her whether ſhe did not cry the laſt Night: The Child anſwered <hi>yes, I did cry a little, for I was thinking about God and Chriſt, and they loved me,</hi> Her Mother asked her whether <hi>to think of God and Chriſt's loving</hi> her <hi>made</hi> her <hi>cry:</hi> She anſwered <hi>yes, it does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She has often manifeſted a great Concern for the good of others Souls: and has been wont many times affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to counſel the other Children. Once about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>September,</hi> the laſt Year, when ſhe and ſome others of the Children where in a Room by themſelves, a husking <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, the Child, after a while, came out and ſat by the Fire. Her Mother took notice that ſhe appeared with a more than ordinary ſerious and penſive Countenance, but at laſt ſhe broke ſilence, and ſaid, I have been talking to <hi>Nabby</hi> and <hi>Eunice:</hi> Her Mother asked her what ſhe had ſaid to 'em Why ſaid ſhe, I <hi>told 'em they muſt pray, and prepare to die,</hi> that they had <hi>but a little while to live in this World, and</hi> they <hi>muſt be always ready</hi> When <hi>Nabby</hi> came out, her Mother asked her whether ſhe had ſaid that to them. <hi>Yes</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>ſhe ſaid that, and a great deal more.</hi> At other times, the Child took her Opportunities to talk to the other Children about the great Concern of their Souls, ſometimes, ſo as much to affect them, and ſet them into Tears. She was once exceeding importunate with her Mother to go with her Siſter <hi>Naomi</hi> to pray: Her Mother endeavoured to put her off; but ſhe pulled her by the Sleeve, and ſeem'd as if ſhe would by no means be denied. At laſt her Mother told her, that <hi>Amy muſt go and pray her ſelf; but,</hi> ſays the Child, <hi>ſhe will not go;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted earneſtly to beg of her Mother to go with her.</p>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She took much notice of it, and it wrought exceedingly on her Compaſſions: And after ſhe had attentively heard him a while, ſhe went away to her Father, who was in the Shop, and intreated him to give that Man a Cow: and told him that <hi>the poor Man</hi> had <hi>no Cow!</hi> that <hi>the Hunters or ſomething elſe</hi> had <hi>kill'd his Cow!</hi> and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to give him one of theirs.

                  <p>In the former part of this great Work of God amongſt us, till it got to its height, we ſeemed to be wonderfully ſmiled upon and bleſſed in all reſpects. <hi>Satan</hi> (as has
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004239_0381_100430701636D420"/>
been already obſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) ſeemed to be unuſually reſtrain'd: Perſons that before had been involved in Melancholy, ſeemed to be as it were waked up out of it; and thoſe that had been entangled with extraordinary Temptations, ſeemed wonderfully to be ſet at liberty; and not only ſo, but it was the moſt remarkable time of Health, that ever I knew ſince I have been in the Town. We ordinarily have ſeveral Bills put up, every Sabbath, for Perſons that are ſick; but now we had not ſo much as one for many Sabbaths together. But after this it ſeemed to be otherwiſe, when this Work of God appear'd to be at its greateſt Height, a poor weak Man that belongs to the Town, being in great ſpiritual Trouble, was hurried with violent Temptations to cut his own Throat, and made an Attempt; but did not do it effectually. He after this continued a conſiderable Time exceeding overwhelmed with Melancholy; but has now of a long time been very greatly deliver'd, by the Light of God's Countenance lifted up upon him, and has expreſſed a great Senſe of his Sin in ſo far yielding to Temptation; and there are in him all hopeful Evidences of his having been made a Subject of ſaving Mercy.</p>
                  <p>In the latter part of <hi>May,</hi> it began to be very ſenſible that the Spirit of God was gradually withdrawing from us, and after this Time <hi>Satan</hi> ſeemed to be more let looſe, and raged in a dreadful manner. The firſt Inſtance wherein it appear'd, was a Perſon's putting an end to his own Life, by cutting his Throat. He was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of more than common Underſtanding, of ſtrict Morals, religious in his Behaviour, and an uſeful ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Perſon in the Town; but was of a Family that are exceeding prone to the Diſeaſe of Melancholy, and his Mother was killed with it. He had, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this extraordinary Time, been exceedingly concern'd about the State of his Soul, and there were ſome Things in his Experience, that appeared very hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; but he durſt entertain no Hope concerning his own good Eſtate. Towards the latter part of his Time, he grew much diſcouraged, and Melancholy grew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

upon him, till he was wholly overpower'd by it, and was in great meaſure paſt a Capacity of receiving Advice, or being reaſoned with to any purpoſe: The Devil took the advantage, and drove him into deſpairing Thoughts. He was kept awake a-nights, medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ating Terror; ſo that he had ſcarce any Sleep at all, for a long time together. And it was obſerved at laſt, that he was ſcarcely well capable of managing his ordinary Buſineſs, and was judged delirious by the Coroner's Inqueſt. The News of this extraordinarily affected the Minds of People here, and ſtruck them as it were with Aſtoniſhment. After this, Multitudes in this, and other Towns, ſeemed to have it ſtrongly ſuggeſted to 'em, and preſſed upon 'em, to do as this Perſon had done. And many that ſeemed to be under no Melancholy, ſome pious Perſons, that had no ſpecial Darkneſs, or Doubts about the goodneſs of their State, nor were under any ſpecial Trouble or Concern of Mind about any thing Spiritual or Temporal, yet had it urged upon 'em, as if ſomebody had ſpoke to 'em, <hi>Cut your own Throat, now is a good Opportunity.</hi> Now; now! So that they were oblig'd to fight with all their might to reſiſt it, and yet no Reaſon ſuggeſted to 'em why they ſhould do it.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time, there were two remarkable Inſtances of Perſons led away with ſtrange Enthuſiaſtick Deluſions: one at <hi>Suffield,</hi> another at <hi>South-Hadley:</hi> That which has made the greateſt noiſe in the Country was of the Man at <hi>South-Hadley,</hi> whoſe Deluſion was, that he thought himſelf divinely inſtructed to direct a poor Man in melancholy and deſpairing Circumſtances, to ſay certain Words in Prayer to God, as recorded in <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxvi 4. for his own Relief. The Man is eſteemed a pious Man: I have ſince this Error of his, had a particular Acquaintance with him; and I believe none would queſtion his Piety, that had had ſuch an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He gave me a particular Account of the Manner how he was deluded; which is too long to be here inſerted. But in ſhort, he was exceedingly rejoiced and
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004239_0383_10043076B62E6C20"/>
elevated with this extraordinary Work, ſo carried on in this part of the Country: and was poſſeſſed with an Opinion that it was the beginning of the glorious Times of the Church ſpoken of in Scripture: And had read it as the Opinion of ſome Divines, that there would be many in theſe Times that ſhould be endued with extraordinary Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and had embraced the Notion; tho' he had at firſt no Apprehenſions that any beſides Miniſters would have ſuch Gifts. But he ſince exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly laments the Diſhonour he has done to God, and the Wound he has given Religion in it, and has lain low before God and Man for it.</p>
                  <p>After theſe things the Inſtances of Converſion were rare here in compariſon of what they had before been, (tho' that remarkable Inſtance of the little Child was after this,) and the Spirit of God not long after this time, appear'd very ſenſibly withdrawing from all parts of the County; (tho' we have heard of its going on in ſome Places of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and that it continues to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on even to this Day.) But Religion remain'd here, and I believe in ſome other Places, the main Subject of Converſation, for ſeveral Months after this. And there were ſome Turns, wherein God's Work ſeem'd ſomething to revive, and we were ready to hope that all was going to be renewed again: yet in the main there was a gradual Decline of that general, engaged, lively Spirit in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which had been before. Several things have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd ſince, that have diverted Peoples Minds, and turn'd their Converſation more to others Affairs, particularly his <hi>Excellency</hi> the Governour's coming up, and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> of <hi>General Court,</hi> on the Treaty with the <hi>Indians;</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Springfield</hi> Controverſy; and ſince that, our People in this Town have been engaged in the building of a new Meetting-houſe: and ſome other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences might be mentioned, that have ſeem'd to have this Effect. But as to thoſe that have been thought to be converted among us, in this time, they generally ſeem to be Perſons, that have had an abiding Change wrought on them: I have had particular acquaintance
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004239_0384_10043078423BDE70"/>
with many of them ſince, and they generally appear to be Perſons that have a new Senſe of Things, new Apprehenſions and Views of God, of the divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the great Things of the Goſpel: They have a new Senſe of the Truth of them, and they affect them in a new manner; tho' it is very far from being always alike with them, neither can they revive a Senſe of things when they pleaſe. Their Hearts are often touched, and ſometimes fill'd, with new Sweetneſſes and Delights; there ſeems to be an inward Ardour and burning of Heart that they expreſs, the like to which they never experienced before; ſometimes, perhaps, occaſioned only by the Mention of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Name, or ſome one of the Divine Perfections: There are new Appetites, and a new kind of Breathings and Pantings of Heart, <hi>and Groanings that cannot be uttered.</hi> There is a new kind of inward Labour and Struggle of Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven and Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Some that before were very rough in their Temper and Manners, ſeem to be remarkably fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And ſome have had their Souls exceedingly filled, and overwhelmed with Light, Love, and Comfort, long ſince the Work of God has ceaſed to be ſo remarkably carried on in a general way: and ſome have had much greater Experiences of this nature than they had before. And there is ſtill a great deal of religious Converſation continued in the Town, amongſt young and old; a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſpoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A great part of the Country have not received the moſt favourable Thoughts of this Affair; and to this day many retain a Jealouſy concerning it, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt it: I have Reaſon to think that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakneſs of the Inſtrument, that has been made uſe of in this Town, has prejudiced many againſt it; it don't appear to me ſtrange that it ſhould be ſo: But yet this Circumſtance of this great Work of God, is analogous to other Circumſtances of it: God has ſo ordered the manner of the Work in many Reſpects, as very ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and remarkably to ſhew it to be his own peculiar and immediate Work, and to ſecure the Glory of it wholly to his own Almighty Power, and Sovereign Grace. And whatever the Circumſtances and Means have been, and tho' we are ſo unworthy, yet <hi>ſo</hi> hath it pleaſed God to work! And we are evidently a People bleſſed of the Lord!

Thus, <hi>Rev.

I ſhould have ſent it much ſooner, had I not been greatly hindered by Illneſs in my Family, and alſo in myſelf.

But I would leave it entirely with your Wiſdom to make what uſe of it you think beſt, to ſend a part of it to <hi>England,</hi> or all, or none if you think it not worthy; or otherwiſe to diſpoſe of it as you may think moſt for God's Glory, and the Intereſt of Religion. If you are pleaſed to ſend any thing to the Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Dr. <hi>Guyſe,</hi> I ſhould be glad to have it ſignify'd to him as my humble Deſire, that ſince he, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to which he preach'd have been pleaſed to take ſo much notice of us, as they have, that they would alſo think of us at the Throne of Grace, and ſeek there for us, that God would not forſake us, but enable us to bring forth Fruit anſwerable to our Profeſſion, and our Mercies, and that our <hi>Light may ſhine before Men, that others ſeeeing our good Works, may glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
