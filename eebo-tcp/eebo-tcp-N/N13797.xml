            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>APPLICATION having been made to me, by the young men of this Society who are engaged in the preſent War, for the term of three years, that I ſhould on this morning addreſs them in publick (they expecting to ſet off in the afternoon for camp) In compliance with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, I ſhall attempt to ſuggeſt a few things to their conſideration and improvement, which however im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly treated, will be well aimed, even for their profiting.</p>
            <p>The words choſen, when juſtly attended to, and conſidered, may be judged, as containing things ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

but forevery denomination of men, conſidered as chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Their primary uſe and immediate direction, it ſeems, were to the miniſters of the goſpel, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to Timothy. St. Paul directs, or rather gives in charge to him thus, "Thou therefore my ſon, be ſtrong in the grace which is in Chriſt Jeſus; and the things that thou haſt heard of me, among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithful men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo." And then ſolemnly charges him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus, as in the verſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceeding the text, "Thou therefore endure hardneſs, as a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt." And this he illuſtrates by introducing and pointing out the duty of a faithful ſoldier, who, having harnaſſed himſelf goeth ſorth to war: No ſuch man entangleth himſelf with the affairs of this life, that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a ſoldier, that is, no man, who undertaketh and is faithful in the cauſe of his country, entangleth himſelf with the affairs of this life; ſuch a ſoldier leaves the affairs and buſineſs that he was formerly occupied in, and gives up, and devotes himſelf to the duties that belong to his character as a ſoldier, that he may pleaſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and anſwer the juſt expectation of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers for the country's defence: And thus St. Paul would have Timothy be faithful, as a good chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſoldier to his divine Commander, even Jeſus the captain of our ſalvation, would, from the weightieſt reaſons, have him exert himſelf in the beſt manner, to promote the good deſigned by the goſpel mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and therefore would not have him entangle himſelf with the affairs of this life, would not have him plunge himſelf into the buſy and perplexing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017438_0006_0FA11D5FE891F898"/>
concernments of this life and world, leaſt the duties of his office as a miniſter, and character as a chriſtian, ſhould not be diſcharged.</p>
            <p>His maſter Chriſt, who had choſen him to be a ſoldier, to oppoſe his enemies and the enemies of his kingdom, and into whoſe ſervice he had engaged, expected he would approve himſelf faithful, and in this way pleaſe him; that he would be ſtudious and ready at all times to pleaſe him by his fidelity, as the good ſoldier in the field is to pleaſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander whom he loves and fears.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the primary uſe and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe words were to Timothy and other miniſters of the goſpel, they may be applied to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon chriſtians; they may in ſome ſort be applied to us all, whether miniſters, common chriſtians or ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and teach us the duties we owe to Chriſt our divine Commander.</p>
            <p>For let our ſtation and occupation in life, be what it may, we ought to think ourſelves as indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly bound to war a good warfare, to quit our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like men, and with the goſpel armour oppoſe our ſpiritual, which are our moſt dangerous foes. The direction of the Apoſtle is this, 1. Tim. i. 18, 19. —War a good warfare, holding faith and a good conſcience.</p>
            <p>When men go forth to war againſt their common enemy, they are not to think they have no other duty to perform, but that of approving themſelves as obedient and faithful ſoldiers to their reſpective
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017438_0007_0FA11D61DDB6B080"/>
officers; but as chriſtians, to remember the duties they owe to their divine Commander, and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſee to it, they do not live in the neglect hereof. For this notion and opinion which hath been inſtilled into ſome of the military character, that if a man dies in battle, having there acquitted himſelf with honor in oppoſing the enemy, he ſhall be ſaved, becauſe he dies in a good cauſe, let his character be as it may in other reſpects: I ſay, this opinion is to be exploded as not founded in truth.</p>
            <p>A man may be a good ſoldier in his country's cauſe, do his tour of duty and fight valiantly, when called to it, and yet not be a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt; not war the chriſtian warfare, not oppoſe his ſpiritual enemies, but tamely ſubmit to the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin and ſatan: And ſurely if this moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant warfare be not warred, how can men in the exerciſe of calm reaſon, expect to be ſaved, altho' they may have been good ſoldiers in other reſpects!</p>
            <p>However, I mean not to ſay any thing to leſſen a ſenſe of duty in reſpect to fidelity, acting as ſoldiers in the defence of our country's liberties, but to urge it; and at the ſame time hold up to view the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of acting as chriſtians, or, in other words, to endure hardneſs as good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, to oppoſe the enemies of his kingdom and our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual foes, with all that care, precaution and vigilance which come into the account of ſelf-defence and fidelity to Chriſt.—My principal aim in the ſequel will be, to point out to the young men whom I am to addreſs in this diſcourſe, the duties they owe to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017438_0008_0FA11D61F1FD9B80"/>
Chriſt their divine commander, who may be ſaid to have choſen them to be ſoldiers; but ſhall firſt touch upon their duty, conſidered as ſoldiers in their country's cauſe. In this view, ſhall point out the reaſon why they are not to entangle themſelves with the affairs of this life: For, no doubt, the Apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this illuſtration of the duty of Timothy in his calling, means to compare it to the duty which a ſoldier in the field owes to his commander and to his country, and therefore of ſuch an one ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No man that warreth, that is, no man who ſtrives lawfully and faithfully, entangleth himſelf with the affairs of this life, that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a ſoldier.—If he entangleth himſelf with theſe things, he cannot acquit himſelf with honor and advantage.</p>
            <p>A ſoldier, who undertakes with a true deſign to be faithful, entangleth, or embarraſſeth not himſelf with ſuch things as are foreign from the department into which he hath voluntarily inliſted himſelf. Such a ſoldier leaves the affairs of this life; leaves his farm, his trade, and his merchandiſe, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever kind of buſineſs he had before employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in: he leaves his dear friends and connections, all his circle of agreeable acquaintance (except thoſe that accompany him in the ſame undertaking) yea, he leaves all his domeſtic concernments and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular endearments, and ſenſible of his duty and the preſſing call of Providence, goes forth to do thoſe ſervices of the camp, and in the field, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he is called, that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a ſoldier.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:017438_0009_0FA11D6434573738"/>And here it may not be out of place, to conſider who hath choſen him to be a ſoldier. And will not this naturally occur, that his employers choſe him, the people for whom he undertook? Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in him, as one who would be true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, intrepid and valiant, ready to endure hardneſs and encounter danger for the good of the country, and for the protection, defence and ſafety of his friends, his own and their property, which he leaves behind; the people, his employers, thus confiding in him, chooſe him to be a ſoldier. Moreover, a ſoldier of ſuch truſt and confidence, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as choſen by the commander in chief and his reſpective officers. For, if they are of the ſame approved character, true and faithful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> intrepid and valiant, ready to endure hardneſs and encounter danger for the common good, they doubtleſs chooſe and welcome ſuch a ſoldier, and will manifeſt their approbation of and attachment to him, not only by common tenderneſs and reſpect, but will aim to promote and honor him according to merit. Theſe things being conſidered, the ſoldier has ſet before him no ſmall motive to exert himſelf to pleaſe him or them who have choſen and welcomed him to be a ſoldier.</p>
            <p>But to return and ſpeak a little more to this, viz. He entangleth not himſelf with the affairs of this life, i. e. he engages not in, nor ſpends his time about ſuch things as enervate and diſqualify from performing the duties of his ſtation. The good ſoldier therefore muſt be temperate, pure, chaſte, and not ſpend his time in gaming, intemperance, lewdneſs and debauchery; leſt through the want of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017438_0010_0FA11D66078EEFC0"/>
virtue and fidelity, the great end of being choſen a ſoldier ſhould be fruſtrated, and the enemy get advantage, which has often been the caſe, where ſoldiers, unmindful of the duties of their character, have entangled themſelves with ſuch kind of things. The evils and vices above mentioned may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the affairs of this life, which the good ſoldier will be careful not to be encumbered with: And every man that ſtriveth for the maſtery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible, 1. Cor. ix. 25. It is the plain duty of the ſoldier, as he would approve himſelf faithful to himſelf and his country, to be temperate, brave and virtuous, being ready for every tour of duty and enterprize to which he is called by his commanding officer.</p>
            <p>As a ſoldier, his daily care muſt be to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for and to do the buſineſs of his ſtation from early to late, as it was induſtriouſly to go through his labor and domeſtic concernments, before he aſſumed the character of a ſoldier.</p>
            <p>In the camp, it may be, that the occaſions and circumſtances of an army do not call for that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, labour, fatigue and enterprize at ſome times which they may at others, yet in the moſt leiſure and uninterrupted ſpaces, the faithful ſoldier is not to entangle himſelf with thoſe things that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judical to his health, honor and ſafety; but is ever ſo to govern himſelf and paſſions as to be in a ready, eaſy and alert poſture of defence and action, though ſuddenly and in the uſual hours of repoſe, called to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017438_0011_0FA11D6796BB2338"/>Moreover if the occaſions and circumſtances of an army ſhould at ſome particular periods, call for long and inceſſant fatigue and hardſhip, the faithful ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is not to ſhrink back or deſert his colours. He is not to harbour a wiſh to return back to the affairs of this life, though his own eaſe, pleaſure and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral emolument may prompt him.</p>
            <p>The compleat character of a faithful ſoldier, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſtituted ſhort of his being willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure hardneſs, when the exigence of affairs make it neceſſary. A cauſe ſo great and important, as that of ſecuring the liberties and maintaining the lives and properties of a great and good country, as this is, is not to be deſerted becauſe ſome very hard, fatiguing and dangerous things are to be encountered. For conſider, if ſo great and good a cauſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, on whatever pretence, the conſequence, in all probability, would be vaſtly more diſtreſſing and terrible, than to continue, bearing the greateſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable fatigues and hardſhips, that ſoldiers, engaged in ſuch a glorious cauſe, are ever called to. It is not eaſy to figure to ourſelves the deplorable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which this country would be involved, ſhould the noble ardour in the cauſe of liberty, which hath pervaded every part, and catched in every generous breaſt, be now extinguiſhed. The conſequence of relaxing and abating that zeal and proweſs with which our fellow citizens and brave ſoldiers have ſo long oppoſed our enemies and defended America. The conſequence (I ſay) of a relexation <hi>now,</hi> will be to let in our oppreſſors like a flood upon us, and tamely ſubmit to conqueſt. It is eaſy to conceive whether this is not a condition infinitely worſe than to bear thoſe burdens and endure thoſe fatigues to which
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017438_0012_0FA11D680A619BA8"/>
we are called during the conteſt. Alarmed with theſe conſequences, the good ſoldier will carefully cheriſh that noble ardour, that love of liberty, love of his country, which has ſupported us from the beginning of the conteſt to the preſent day, and with which every patriotic mind conſents to endure hardneſs 'till it ends in our favour and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our independence.</p>
            <p>In a word, faithfulneſs and a ſenſe of honor, together with this country's ſafety and well being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will prevail upon every good ſoldier, to bear patiently thoſe intervals of hardſhip and to encounter thoſe particular inſtances of danger, to which his lot as a ſoldier will at any time expoſe him; and if he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth not himſelf with thoſe things that are foreign from his department, he then is the man of honor and virtue, who pleaſes him who hath choſen him to be a ſoldier; he anſwers the juſt expectation of his employers, who confided in him, and pleaſes his good commander whom he obeys.</p>
            <p>Thus have I conſidered the duty of a man in the character of a ſoldier in his country's cauſe. I proceed now to conſider what is ſtill more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, viz. What duties the ſoldier owes to his divine commander, who may be ſaid to have choſen men to be ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>It may with good reaſon be judged that Chriſt has choſen men to be ſoldiers in defence of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when invaded by an unrighteous and cruel foe; or in other words he may approve, yea, make it the duty of men to go to war in certain caſes and circumſtances. If not, the undertaking of our young men, to compoſe the army, is wrong, and ought not to have been; but it is preſumed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017438_0013_0FA11D68B477ABD0"/>
none of the undertakers once doubt the lawfulneſs of the war on our part. If the enemy have wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly begun and proſecuted the war againſt America without juſt provocation, this ſuppoſes our right and duty to oppoſe them by arms, with ſuch weapons as God has provided for us, that we may defend our lives, liberties and properties.</p>
            <p>To defend ourſelves againſt the unreaſonable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments and invaſion of others is the plain dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of reaſon; and revelation will vindicate the ſentiment. If a defenſive war is lawful, and if this war in which we have ſo unanimouſly taken a part to aſſert our rights and privileges againſt the claims of the enemy; if it is a neceſſary defenſive war on our part, the enemy having firſt drawn the ſword unprovoked; then the war is lawful which we are carrying on, and if lawful, then approved of by God, for he ever approves of what is lawful: And Chriſt came not to deſtroy but to fulfil the law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt ever approves of that which is lawful and right, yea, has made it our duty to vindicate our natural rights and privileges, and therefore has choſen men or called them to ſerve in their country's cauſe, and for it's ſafety and defence, as alſo has choſen us all to ſerve under him, he has invited us all to inliſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his banner; and would he invite us to be his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers unleſs it was his choice that we ſhould be ſo? If he has invited all, then the ſoldier engaged in his country's defence is alſo choſen to be a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt, and he is bound to perform the duties which he owes to him.</p>
            <p>The religion of our Saviour is as worthy and neceſſary to be regarded by gentlemen of the military line, as any claſs of men whatever, their ſouls being
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017438_0014_0FA11D6974F290C0"/>
equally precious and their ſalvation equally impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. We find particular notice taken of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and ſuppliant poſture of a ſoldier who came to Jeſus for a particular favour, which I would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in this place for the improvement of all who bear the name of ſoldiers in this age. See Mat. viii. 5.—"And when Jeſus was entered into Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum, there came unto him a Centurion, beſeeching him, and ſaying, Lord, my ſervant lieth at home ſick of the palſy, grievouſly tormented; and Jeſus ſaith unto him, I will come and heal him: The Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion anſwered and ſaid, Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt come under my roof, but ſpeak the word only, and my ſervant ſhall be healed; for I am a man under authority, having ſoldiers under me, and I ſay to this man go, and he goeth, and to another come, and he cometh, and to my ſervant do this, and he doth it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Notwithſtanding the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion ranked as an officer, one in command, ſee! how he humbles himſelf in the preſence of Chriſt, exalts him whilſt he debaſes himſelf, and ſee! what notice Jeſus took of this eminent man who was a ſoldier. —"When Jeſus heard it, he marvelled and ſaid to them that followed, Verily I ſay unto you, I have not found ſo great ſaith, no not in Iſrael." This Centurion paid more honor and reſpect to Chriſt, than to his commander in the field, as may be judged from Chriſt's approbation of him, and thus every ſoldier is bound to do; for whoſe commands ſhould moſt impreſs our minds, whether thoſe of a human or divine commander? Whilſt the ſoldier ſhould be ready to obey all the lawful commands of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective officers, he is not to be unmindful of but ſtrictly regard the authority of Jeſus his divine
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017438_0015_0FA11D6A372320A8"/>
Captain. This will lead the ſoldier to conſider what enemies he has to oppoſe, as he would be a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſpiritual, which are the moſt dangerous. As the ſoldier is to be vigilant to eſpy out his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural enemies ſo as to be the better prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive their attack, and to repel their force, ſo the chriſtian ſoldier under Jeſus Chriſt is to be vigilant to eſpy and ready to reſiſt his ſpiritual foe; the direction given by the Apoſtle, is to be heeded in making this reſiſtance, 1 Peter v. 8, 9. "Be ſober be vigilant, becauſe your adverſary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour," and whom think ye he will devour, except it be thoſe who are not ſober and vigilant? If ye are rude, vain and wicked, not on your guard againſt the attack of Satan, ye are in danger of falling an eaſy prey to his malevolent deſigns. You need therefore be more ſtrictly on your guard againſt this your ſpiritual foe, than your natural and bodily enemies, whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith. Faith is the powerful weapon, or inſtrument with which the deſigns of this evil and dangerous foe can be beſt warded off. If the Centurion had great faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to his honor, being a ſoldier, it is equally important that all others ſhould have faith in order to get true honor and the beſt victory. "This is the victory that overcometh, even our faith," John v. 4. But that the well diſpoſed ſoldier may be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the enemies of his ſoul and know what armour he muſt put on and be clad with, in order to make head againſt them, he will do well to hearken to and comply with that ſkilful and excellent advice of the Apoſtle, Epheſ. 6 chap. "Finally, brethren,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017438_0016_0FA11D6B6CBA16A8"/>
be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the devil. For we wreſtle not with fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in high places." Here the enemies of our ſouls are reckoned up as being numerous, potent and dangerous. Theſe, we are to wreſtle with and oppoſe with ſuch kind of armour as will beſt ſucceed. The armour is next mentioned. "Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withſtand in an evil day, and having done all to ſtand; ſtand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breaſt-plate of righteouſneſs, and your feet ſhod with the preparation of the goſpel of peace; above all taking the ſhield of faith, wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of ſalvation and the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God." The whole chriſtian armour is here delineated, with which the chriſtian ſoldier being clad, he is completely furniſhed to receive the attacks of his ſpiritual enemies, and to make a ſucceſsful war againſt them, in which he ſhall finally come off victor.</p>
            <p>The helmet of ſalvation and the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God, is an eſſential part of that armour which the chriſtian ſoldier is to take. The ſword of the ſpirit is ſaid to be the word of God; and it may juſtly be conſidered as the great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the uſe of which the Spirit of God operates for the ſaving good of men, and agreeable to this is that anſwer given to the queſtion propounded in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017438_0017_0FA11D6C23311820"/>
the 119th Pſalm, 9. "Wherewith ſhall a young man cleanſe his way?" The anſwer is direct, viz. "By taking heed thereto according to thy word." This is the way for the young man, the good ſoldier, to cleanſe himſelf and to be ſaved from the evils, ſnares and temptations to which his ſoul is expoſed. By taking heed, in the uſe and improvement of the word of God—praying always with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance, the good ſoldier is well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, fortified and guarded againſt his worſt enemies. This then is the ſalutary advice to be given to the young man who would get the victory over them, and pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a ſoldier; the urgent advice is, that he would take the word of God with him and make a prayerful and diligent uſe of it. By no means think the Bible and religion as things unworthy and what do not concern him in his military profeſſion and character.</p>
            <p>Religion and the fear of God is truly the beſt ornament and greateſt ſafeguard to the young as well as aged, and except the ſoldier be acquainted with and poſſeſſed of it, he cannot be ſaid to be a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt; without it, he cannot be ſuppoſed to pleaſe Chriſt who has choſen him to be a ſoldier —Under whom has the ſoldier to ſerve? and who is he bound to pleaſe? Let it be attended to, that it is not merely under an human, but a divine commander. The orders and commands of the latter are ſtrictly and conſcientiouſly to be obſerved: But how will the orders and expreſs will of this ſupreme Leader be known, without frequent recourſe to the word of God? As having recourſe to general
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017438_0018_0FA11D6E1E103A60"/>
orders in the army is neceſſary to know preciſely what they are, ſo is it no leſs neceſſary frequently to turn to the word of God to know what the will and commands of Chriſt are. It may then be judged an affair of no ſmall concernment to know, make ſerious uſe of, and improve the word of God. In this way the good ſoldier will be clad with the richeſt and ſafeſt armour, an armour in which he need not fear the attacks of his ſpiritual foes, and if theſe be vanquiſhed, great and important, rich and glorious will be the victory when obtained.</p>
            <p>What remains will be an addreſs to the ſoldiers at whoſe requeſt I have ſpoken in ſuch a ſort.</p>
            <p>My young friends and youth of my flock. The cauſe in which you have engaged is ſo good, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and laudable, that it reflects honor upon any name to have it enrolled in the liſt of American troops, whoſe commander is the great, the virtuous and intrepid WASHINGTON. Him and all who are actuated by his patriotic ſpirit are you ſtudiouſly to pleaſe, which you will do, whilſt you readily and faithfully diſcharge the duties of your honourable ſtation as ſoldiers; you will remember the character of the truſty ſoldier who goeth forth to war is not to entangle himſelf with the affairs of this life, that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a ſoldier.</p>
            <p>You have already heard it hinted who have choſen and welcomed you to be ſoldiers, viz. your employers, your fellow-citizens, your country, and further, your reſpective officers chooſe and welcome you; yea, more, the Lord God of hoſts, the God of armies, chooſes and invites you into this important and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017438_0019_0FA11D6EB66FAB40"/>
work of defending your much injured and greatly threatned country. It being a fixed principle and the voice of millions that our cauſe is good, that the ſweets of liberty ought to be contended for at the riſk of life and expence of much treaſure; hence we agree, it is a duty for ſome to turn out to ſerve in the war; a duty made plain by the voice of God's providence, that ſuch a number, as is proportioned for the common ſafety and defence, ſhould harneſs themſelves, and with an eager deſire graſp the ſword and manfully wield it till the enemy hearken to terms, and America be rid of her invaders: The ſword in the hands of our brave ſons, determined to be free, or to fall as precious victims to the ſhrine of liberty; the ſword in ſuch choſen hands may oppoſe, yea vanquiſh our enemy and recover and eſtabliſh our indiſputable rights, but to ſheathe the ſword before the work and buſineſs be done for which it was firſt aſſumed, will be to deſerve the fate of cowardly apoſtates whoſe end is worſe than their beginning. <hi>Now</hi> in ſpecial, are we called to <hi>arms,</hi> to ſupply thoſe vacancies, which the enemy have flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves we ſhould not be able to do — To convince them we can bring an army into the field by actually effecting it, and that ſeaſonably, will probably diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert and diſappoint them, and afford an happy proſpect of terminating the war in our favour, and agreeable to our moſt ardent wiſh. You, my young friends, and reſpectable auditors, have attended to the call of your country, and to the call of providence. Seaſonably have you offered yourſelves to this important ſervice, are this day to take your leave of us, and proceed to join the continental army: May the duty of a faithful ſoldier
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017438_0020_0FA11D7085E4BA60"/>
from this day impreſs your minds, and each of you uniformly and perſeveringly act the part of ſuch a character: You will remember, that in the deſcription of a good ſoldier, he is not to entangle himſelf with the affairs of this life, not to embarraſs himſelf with ſuch things as are foreign from his department. Theſe, in part, you have formally given up by your engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Suffer me to repeat it; you leave your farms, your trade, and ſuch kind of buſineſs of life as you before had employed yourſelves in; you leave your dear friends and connections, all your circle of agreeable acquaintance, and all your domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments; and theſe would be but entanglements to you, conſidered as ſoldiers: Theſe, though you may leave with ſome reluctance, yet, conſidering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of our cauſe and the neceſſary defence of this great and flouriſhing country, you will forego your own eaſe and domeſtic convenience, and with manly courage, with fortitude to face every danger, you will proceed, take and bear the common lot of good ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>Further, you will remember that as you would not entangle yourſelves with the affairs of this life, you are not to ſpend your time in ſuch things, ſuch hurtful evils as tend to enervate and diſqualify from performing the duties that belong to a ſoldier. Be you then adviſed not to ſpend that time (which ſhould be better employed) in the ſins of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, gaming, profaneneſs, debauchery, and the like, leſt, through the want of virtue and fidelity, the end of your undertaking ſhould not be anſwered, and leſt the enemy get advantage of an unguarded hour. But of you, reſpectable ſoldiers, I would
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017438_0021_0FA11D73B14E48B0"/>
hope better things, though I thus warn you. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, you will take this into thought, that though there be leiſure and but little fatigue and hardſhip at ſome times, yet that the occaſions and cicumſtances of an army at others, may require long and laborious taſks. But nevertheleſs, you will not in ſuch times of exigency and painful trial ſhrink back and deſert the cauſe; you are to expect nothing leſs than to endure hardneſs, if you would be reckoned into the claſs of good ſoldiers who would preſerve their credit and honor, and get the maſtery.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, and in the beſt ſenſe of the term ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, ſee that you conſcientiouſly diſcharge the duties of ſuch under Chriſt your divine commander: It is important and neceſſary that each of us who tarry at home be good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, as we would pleaſe him and be accepted of him, and it is no leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant that you, who go forth into the perilous and high places of the field, be good, obedient and faithful ſoldiers under Jeſus your greateſt captain and leader. —Think for a moment the ſafety of your condition in caſe you enliſt under the banner of Chriſt, and be his true, tho' young diſclples. Then, although it might be your lot to fall in battle, you die not only honourably, but moſt happily, for Jeſus the glorious captain of your ſalvation ſhall give you a crown of glory that ſhall never fade away; but if you pay no regard to your divine commander, if you chooſe not this man to reign over you and will not be ſubject to his authority and moſt reaſonable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, your condition is very unſafe and alarming. Be you then now adviſed and fully perſuaded to put on the chriſtian armour as already directed—
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017438_0022_0FA11D75436FA768"/>
Take the helmet of ſalvation and that moſt defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and uſeful <hi>ſword,</hi> the <hi>ſword</hi> of the ſpirit, which is the word of God.—And be much in prayer, that ye may vanquiſh your ſpiritual which are your moſt deſtructive foes. Go to your divine captain the prince of peace, in the humble ſubmiſſive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the renowned Centurion, that eminently good ſoldier, who frankly owned himſelf unworthy that Chriſt ſhould come under his roof. In a word, be religious in early life, be ſober-minded, vigilant and temperate, fear God and fear an oath, let no profaneneſs proceed from your lips, your honor is better preſerved in a pure than in an unhallowed uſe of language; as good ſoldiers, who are ſtudious to pleaſe your divine leader Jeſus (rather than to be governed by the wicked cuſtom of profane ſwearing) Swear not at all, ſeeing he has expreſsly forbid it. Then may you go and proſper, and in God's time return in ſafety, that you and your dear friends, who now part for a time, may meet again and mutually rejoice in a land delivered and ſaved of the Lord.— We wiſh you the bleſſing of the Lord God of hoſts, the God of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mies, in the ſhadow of whoſe wings may you and each one of us ever truſt and make our refuge.</p>
            <p>To cloſe, May the happy time ſoon come, when the preſent diſtreſſing war ſhall be fully and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly terminated—when you and all our friends may return to domeſtic life, peace and endearment, and ſit under our vines and fig-trees, in a long uninterrupted peace, there being none to make us afraid.
