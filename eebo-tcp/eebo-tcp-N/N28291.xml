            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the courſe of the Providential diſpenſations of Almighty God, our nation is called to contemplate an event, which arreſts the powers, and awakens the moſt pathetic ſenſibilities of the human heart. Alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for a conſiderable time, have our eyes witneſſed the tokens of general mourning, and our ears been aſſailed with the language of public grief. From ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery part of our common country, does the plaint of ſorrow ariſe, and every gale, as it paſſes by, is loaded with the groans and ſighs of a diſtreſſed people. Not only do our ſanctuaries of juſtice and of law, and our ſacred aſylums of religion, mourn; not only do our officers of ſtate, our diſtinguiſhed citizens, and the war-worn veteran, appear in the badges of woe; but all, from the aged who remembers the deeds of former times, to the youth who anticipates the future; all of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037709_0005_100EF1AF12BA24C8"/>
every deſcription and every rank, feel an oppreſſive heavineſs at the heart. And, when we look around upon this great and reſpectable aſſembly, and mark the eye ſuddenly ſuffuſed with the tear of ſad recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; when eſpecially we reflect that on <hi>this</hi> day, a whole nation, moved by the impulſe of one great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, is engaged in the obſervance of ſolemnites, of which theſe before us form a part, we are conſtrained to conclude, that ſome diſaſtrous change has occurred, that ſome dreadful loſs has been ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>What then thou nation highly favored of heaven! what has produced this univerſal appearance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs? From thy loftieſt mountains, and thy lovelieſt vales, why aſcends to the ſky, the plaintive concert of <hi>weeping, lamentation</hi> and <hi>woe</hi>? Has the enemy rolled like a flood upon thy peaceful ſhores, and threatened to deluge with crimes and blood, thine extenſive plains? Are thine old men devoted to death, thy daughters to ſhame, thy ſons to ſlavery? Has the arm of tyranny ſeized upon thy rights, and extinguiſhed the hallowed flame upon thine altars of freedom?— No!—But the leader of our armies—the founder of our infant republic—the guide of our councils—the patriot, who united and ſwayed all hearts—is no more! The great, the illuſtrious WASHINGTON, the pride of his country, the ornament of mankind—ſleeps in duſt!</p>
            <p>Draw near, ye companions of his toils, ye who
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037709_0006_100EF1B09AF07430"/>
fought by his ſide, who were animated by his patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, and breathed his martial ſpirit; draw near, ye counſellors, who ſhone in the cabinet, and aſſiſted his efforts by your wiſdom and your virtue; draw near, ye ſons and daughters of America, whoſe ſacred birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right he defended with his ſword, and guaranteed by the bulwark of his impregnable name; draw near, with ſolemn ſtep to his tomb. Here, behold once more, your hero, friend, father; and while the copious tear bedews your cheek, and the ſtrong beat of the heart, checks your utterance, look a long—a painful—a laſt adieu. Auguſt in death, "his form has not yet loſt all her original greatneſs." Firmneſs, prudence, valor, reſignation, ſtill are ſeated upon that countenance, now fixed and pale, where they lately ſhone in the moſt vivid expreſſion; for they preſided over all the emotions and energies of his heart. But the immortal <hi>ſpirit has returned to God who gave it,</hi> and left the earthly habitation to aſſimilate with its native duſt. That eye no more beams on virtue, with the cheering ray of friendſhip; nor with its piercing glance, unnerves the ſtrength of vice, and overawes the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of baſe ambition. That great heart, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beat in uniſon, with the impulſe of patriotiſm, and glowed with love for his country, is now lifeleſs as the tongue of calumny, and cold as the clay which ſurrounds it. His arm is deprived of its vigor, and his
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037709_0007_100EF1B337577EE8"/>
ſword, the terror of our foes, ſleeps harmleſs at his ſide. That ſingular aſſemblage of virtues and of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which conſtituted the unprecedented glory of his character—which was more than a hoſt for the defence of a nation's rights—more efficacious than the force of law, ſanctioned with the dread of penalty, to repreſs the licentious daring of faction—and which, under the guidance and patronage of Providence, aſſerted our lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties, and achieved our independence—is now, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly removed from the terreſtrial ſphere, which it illumined and adorned. It can now no longer be diſplayed in the wiſdom of counſel, in the ſplendor of action, in the conſummation of great deſign. Placed beyond our view, it flouriſhes and expands in thoſe regions where <hi>mortal puts on immortality,</hi> and perfection is added to perfection.</p>
            <p>While therefore as men, and as Americans, we lament the loſs which our country and the world has ſuſtained, let us mingle the tears of joy with the tears of grief, and with the ſadneſs of ſorrow unite the ſentiment of gratitude—that humanity is ſuſceptible of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, and that America can boaſt ſuch a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant character, as appeared in that illuſtrious perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, whoſe exit we deplore, but whoſe pre-eminent greatneſs we can never ceaſe to admire. Let us not forget to praiſe that Almighty and Merciful Being, who is good, both in what he gives and in what he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037709_0008_100EF1B5134FC960"/>
takes away. Let us thank him that WASHINGTON has been continued ſo long with us; and that he has <hi>died in a good old age, full of days, riches and honor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Through numberleſs toils, and imminent dangers, he has been preſerved, by the protection of Providence, to be a moſt diſtinguiſhed inſtrument of bleſſings to his country. At the commencement of his bright ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, at the origin of that grand movement, which gave birth to a nation, and laid the broad baſis of a mighty empire; what impenetrable darkneſs hovered over the proſpects of adventurous hope! What certain deſtruction ſeemed to threaten the bravery which ſhould dare to reſiſt oppreſſion! At that eventful cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, when inſult and wrong goaded a patient and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering people into deſperation, and urged them to ſeek redreſs by an appeal to arms, America called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her WASHINGTON, and placed her intereſts under his guardianſhip. Go, unfurl my banners—fight my battles—ſeek the poſt of danger—gain laſting renown by victory—or die, covered with glory. He bowed, and received the ſhining blade from her hand, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignia of office from her authority, and the honor of high reſponſibility, from her unlimited confidence, in his virtue. Already does the lambent flame begin to play around his head—pledge of that ſplendor which was ſoon to irradiate and encircle his name. Already does his country feel the animation of hope, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037709_0009_100EF1B7448E07E8"/>
an early and ſucceſsful iſſue of the eventful conteſt.</p>
            <p>But before this hope could be realized, he muſt firſt aſcend thoſe "ſteep acclivities of fame," where the deathleſs laurel had never yet been plucked by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal band. Who can juſtly eſtimate and duly praiſe that diſintereſted and ſublime magnanimity, which, had it met with final defeat, muſt have encountered death, and more hateful ignominy? For, the nobleſt motives, the pureſt principles of action, and the very heaven of virtues, when marſhalled againſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, cannot fail to be deteſtable to tyrants, and devoted to infamy by their adherents and their ſlaves. What would have been the unhappy fate of that hero, whom God and man now delight to honor, had not ſucceſs crowned his exertions, I leave you to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the rewards of defeated patriotiſm, in other ages and among other nations. But nothing moves his firm mind. The danger of infamy vaniſhes, and the hedious ſpectacle of ignominious death, appears inveſted with the badges of renown, when he turns his eye upon his country. The ſcene before him is truly grand; but it is the grandeur of terror. It is the ocean tempeſted into fury, and ſhrowded with the mantle of ſevenfold night! Such a ſcene, nothing but fortitude, rendered invincible by truſt in God, could have contemplated with compoſure, much leſs have launched into it, with the dependant intereſts of millions yet unborn.</p>

To oppoſe this front of menacing danger, he had an army, not deſtitute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of patience, of principle, and of native va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; but, collected from the plough, and the various employments of domeſtic tranquillity, where was that ſtrict dicipline, that conſummate military know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that prompt and accurate obedience to orders, the effect only of experience and martial habit, which communicate to an army the identity of one ſoul, and the momentum of one great exertion? All was wanting with thoſe whom he led to the field. All muſt be ſupplied by his ever-active valor, by the wiſdom of plan, by the choice of poſition, by the all-important precautions of his unfailing prudence, by a fortitude which diſaſter could never depreſs, nor proſperity elate, by the unwearied and wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a quick, comprehenſive, divining genius, in a word, by inſpiring his fellow ſoldiers with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which no diſappointments could ſhake, and no ſuſpicions undermine.</p>

moment to defeat the enemy by ſurprize; or, in avoiding battle, to conquer him by delay. Now he exerts his undaunted <hi>fortitude</hi>—deaths ſurround him,—thick darkneſs covers—deſtruction threatens his country. Now, we ſee him exerciſe his large and conſummate <hi>knowledge of the human heart,</hi> in ſilencing murmurs, in allaying fears, in rekindling hope, in communicating to a ſmall, deſtitute, defeated army, a portion of that greatneſs which upheld, and that patriotiſm which inflamed his ſoul. He was the ſpring which moved, the very ſpirit which informed and actuated that ſyſtem of meaſures, which wrought our political redemption. Had he then fallen, who but could have predicted the diſaſtrous conſequences? Then, you my fellow citizens, would have fallen— thou my country—never more to riſe! Had he then fallen, the American eagle, who hovered with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime wing over the ſtandard of freedom, would have dropped the immortal wreath from his beak, and the thunders from his graſp, and been no more a bird of war.</p>
            <p>But that God, who loved our country, protected her moſt favored ſon. The winged death which proſtrates thouſands, on his right hand and on his left, harms not him; for the ANGEL of the LORD of HOSTS interpoſes his ſhield, and averts from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of our chieftain, the perilous ſtroke.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:037709_0012_100EF1BC456E6180"/>He lived to ſee the proſpects of hope brighten into reality. After experiencing the various fortunes of war, be ſaw his country victorious; riſe reſplendent among the nations, and repoſe upon the boſom of peace. Through eight years of toil, embarraſſment and blood; led by the unexampled perſeverance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bending fortitude, unerring prudence, and ardent pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm of her beloved WASHINGTON, ſhe advanced with augmented greatneſs, with increaſing proweſs and ſplendor, to independence, liberty, glory. On her progreſs, the eyes of the juſt and good, of every clime, were fixed, with the moſt painful ſolicitude. On the great reſult, the nations of the earth gaze with growing wonder. Such a combination of virtues had been diſplayed; ſuch feats of valor had been achieved; ſuch exhauſtleſs hatred to tyranny, and ſuch unquenchable love of liberty had pervaded the country, that the whole ſeries of events connected with the revolution, and their ſplendid conſummation, proclaimed the diſtinguiſhed interference of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But while many partook of the acquired renown, WASHINGTON ſhone the moſt magnificent object of a nation's love, and a world's admiration. Victory, he had won in the field; but he had gained a more noble conqueſt over the hearts of his countrymen. The flood tide of his fortune was now full, and could have

borne him to empire, accompanied with acclamation and ſurrounded with fame.—But, no darkneſs gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon the diſk of his glory. High authority, he poſſeſſed, but he exerciſed it only for the public good. Great power, he wielded, but after the ends for which it had been conferred were accompliſhed, he depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, with the badges of ſupreme command, on the altar of his country. The laurels which covered him, now ſhot forth into bloom, and he retired from office, "bearing his bluſhing honors thick upon him."— <q>Sublime ſpectacle! more elevating to the pride of virtue, than the ſovereignty of the globe, united to the ſceptre of ages! Enthroned in the hearts of his countrymen, the gorgeous pageantry of prerogative, was unworthy the majeſty of his dominion.</q>

Had he been ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſelfiſh principles, which rouſed the ſoul of a Caeſar; which animated the bravery of an Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which nouriſhed the guile, and governed the conduct of a Cromwell; with equal eclat your battles might have been fought, and your victories won; but

            </p>
            <p>No! his ſword thirſted not for blood. His arm was not lifted up for conqueſt. While he fought for the <hi>defence</hi> of all you hold moſt dear, the havoc ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for attaining ſucceſs, he ſincerely deplored. Amid the din of arms, the carnage of death, and the hotteſt rage of battle, he liſtened to the <hi>ſtill ſmall voice</hi> of humanity in his breaſt. In the midſt of his moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant exploits, his eye was turned toward the ſhades, and his heart panted for the tranquillity of domeſtic ſcenes. He lived to gratify this ardent, inherent deſire; and with the unaſpiring dignity of the firſt of citizens, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his humble retirement, purſued by the tears, the prayers, the affections of an emancipated, a grateful people. There repoſe, thou magnanimous hero! There feaſt upon the ſweet recollection of the paſt, and the delightful hope of the future. There cultivate thoſe virtues which always governed thine own great heart; and cheriſh that divine religion, which afforded thee unfailing ſupport in the ſevereſt

emergencies; and which thy conduct and thy death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs name, honor with perpetual eulogy. There, let the growing ſplendors of thy greatneſs, continually ſurround and guard the retreat of hallowed ſolitude.</p>
            <p>But no! Heaven ſaw fit to counteract this predom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inant inclination—for the orb of his glory was not yet full. Heaven had made him for diſtinguiſhed uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs—had raiſed him up and furniſhed him with the moſt admirable qualifications, for enlarging the ſphere of human happineſs. Again he is called upon by his country; again he deems it the voice of God. His moſt favorite purſuits are inſtantly abandoned, and he appears once more, with the renewed and ſwelling-applauſe of the people whom he loved, on the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did theatre of action. Again—but why need I rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſent him preſiding over thoſe deliberations of the collected wiſdom of America, which gave birth to a conſtitution, free in its principles; wiſe in its divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, arrangement and balance of power; admirable for the energy which it communicates to authority, and for thoſe wholeſome reſtraints, to which that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is ſubjected: a conſtitution, not only the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the preſent age, but deſtined to command the reverence of poſterity, to the lateſt generations? Why need I mention, that, after a free people had ſanctioned with their high approbation, this ſacred charter of their rights, he was choſen by unanimous
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037709_0016_100EF1C4EB34F578"/>
ſuffrage, to fill the chair of Chief Magiſtrate; to give the firſt impulſe to a grand and comprehenſive ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; to enter upon a new and untried field of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; to expoſe his untarniſhed laurels to the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew of calumny; and under the burden of encreaſed years, to wield, to adjuſt, to harmonize the various intereſts of a widely-extended empire? Shall I endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to delineate the features of that wiſdom, which was quick to diſcern, and of that prudence, which was prompt to purſue, the only path of ſafety and honor, amid the jealouſies and contentions of rival nations, and the commotions of the moſt aſtoniſhing revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ever ſhook and appalled the earth? Muſt you be informed, that like the angel, "who rides in the whirlwind, and directs the ſtorm," he reigned over the inflamed paſſions of men; and by the mighty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic of his influence, reſtrained and aſſuaged the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of faction? Standing upon the broad baſis of his own impregnable virtues, he could hear unmoved the cenſures of miſtaken zeal, and pity, while his duty obliged him to oppoſe, that blind affection and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid gratitude, which would have plunged our country into the whirlpool of European politics? Need you be told, that he did not aim at popularity, riches, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but that the invariable object of his purſuit, was the real intereſts of his country? Yes, Americans, the peace which we now enjoy, and the tranquillity with
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037709_0017_100EF1C6E258B598"/>
which we are bleſſed, are, under the kind Providence of Heaven, to be aſcribed to that anticipating wiſdom, that rectitude of principle, that undeviating juſtice, which were conſpicuous in all the prominent features of his adminiſtration. And, whatever variety of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, excited by circumſtance, or produced by time, may have tranſiently prevailed in the breaſts of his fellow-citizens, and diffuſed a foreign tinge over the face of ſociety, the opinion was never uttered, nor <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> which dared to impeach the invulnerable puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his intentions.</p>
            <p>Though continually "admoniſhed by the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weight of years, that the calm of retirement was as neceſſary for him, as it would be welcome," yet he continues with unabated vigilance, and unwearied labor at his arduous poſt, until the improved ſtate of things made his duty compatible with his repoſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain we ſee him ſeek the ſolitude on which his heart was unalterably ſet. After communicating to you the maxims of ſound policy and the inſtructions of good advice, which were the reſult of long experience and mature reſearch; and after expreſſing the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe which he entertained of his country's love, and calling down upon her boſom the bleſſings of the ETERNAL, he diveſts himſelf of his high authority; and bowing under the vaſt burden of his honors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires beneath the ſhades of Vernon—and ſoon finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037709_0018_100EF1C8E5D8FED0"/>
his earthly courſe, ariſes to receive his heavenly crown.</p>
            <p>But he has departed <hi>in a good old age, full of days, riches and honor.</hi> The annals of nations are not adorned with ſo illuſtrious and finiſhed a character. We ſee and admire particular traits of excellence, in men of renown, who flouriſhed in the days of former times. But, which of them exhibits ſuch a conſiſtent and harmonious whole, as is here preſented to our contemplation? To the ſplendid round of official duties and civic virtues, which diſplayed themſelves, without effort, and without oſtentation, in the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful tenor of his life, he added as the crown of all, a regular and exemplary reſpect to the GOSPEL of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS; a uniform and ſincere piety to GOD. Religion was the ſtar of ſuperior radiance, which reflected a celeſtial and inextinguiſhable luſtre through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation of all his virtues. On every proper occaſion, he acknowledges an overruling Providence, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to its guidance and defence, the ſucceſs of his efforts and the independence of his country.<note n="*" place="margin">See his farewell orders to the Army.</note> In his circular letters to the particular States, he ſpeaks in the higheſt terms of eulogy reſpecting the word of revelation, and in the higheſt expreſſions of honor, reſpecting the Divine Redeemer. He knew that his talents and exaltation came from God, and he was
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037709_0019_100EF1CA8C3B6C88"/>
not aſhamed to acknowledge before the world, the author of his benefactions. Hear him again, in his parting addreſs, dictated by the warmeſt affection for his people, earneſtly inculcate, with all the fervor and authority of parental concern, the neceſſity of morality and religion to the proſperity of nations, and the neceſſity of religion to the exiſtence of morality. He knew, from long experience, that their influence upon the ſoul was a feaſt of delight. In the midſt of his moſt urgent employments, even during the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults of war, you behold him conſciencious and reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular in devoting a certain portion of every day to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. This uniform retreat, we have reaſon to believe was ſacred to meditation and to God. The unhallowed foot of officious preſumption, was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to intrude; and the ſweet inſinuations of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip were never ſuffered to ſteal upon thoſe hours, conſecrate to heaven. He ſtands a monument for the admiration of the world, for the inſtruction of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages, for an example to heroes, legiſlators and kings.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not of thoſe wiſe political maxims, thoſe rules calculated to make a nation great and happy, which lie ſcattered through his writings, but are more particularly bequeathed to us in his valedictory ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. I need not repeat his animated exhortations to the obſervance of juſtice, to the love of liberty, to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037709_0020_100EF1CD12492318"/>
the extenſion of literature, to the exerciſe of fraternal affection, to the cultivation of the principles of our union. I need not mention his excellent advice, to guard againſt the poiſon of party aſperity; the ſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agems of ever-working, ever lying faction; the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from cumbrous, unneceſſary, overgrown military eſtabliſhments; the contagion of foreign influence, and the enchantment of intimate foreign connexion: for he, <hi>though dead, yet ſpeaketh,</hi> and his warning voice is heard in deep toned majeſty from the tomb.</p>
            <p>Fellow Citizens, he loved you to the laſt. He bore your intereſts on his heart, when he encountered the hoſtility of peril. The welfare of his country, was the theme of his prayers, whenever he bowed in the preſence of his God. The recollection of her tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, and the proſpect of her happineſs, ſmoothed the path of his age, and gilded the gloom of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting hour.</p>
            <p>Illuſtrious ſhade, farewell! firſt of men, thy name is immortal. Father, Deliverer, Friend—the aged patriot mourns thy loſs! The valiant youth, erewhile animated by thy virtues, looks with ſpeechleſs agony upon thy grave, and claſps his hands in the extacy of grief.
