         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HUBBUB, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE oldeſt man living at Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Aſhby, cannot call to mind ſuch another Hubbub as that which happened there ſome months ago, on the common, juſt before the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe door. A number of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children, had formed a ring round one farmer Ruſſel, a ſullen, down looking fellow, whom no one loved, and every one feared: for his love of money had led him to be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, and his power over the poor
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037162_0003_100CD61574CAD0F8"/>
had made him inſolent. Never was there ſuch a hiſſing and hooting, and hallooing heard. Many of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had been grievouſly oppreſſed by the farmer, and now they had him in their power, they ſeemed reſolved to ſhew him little mercy.</p>
            <p>Betty Jobbins beat the frying-pan with the key of the door, Sally Gore pounded the peſtle and mortar, Nelly Shepſton rung the warming pan, Dick Devonſhire blew the Ram's-horn, whilſt Nick Stafford and others gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the ſheep's bells.</p>
            <p>It ſo happened that one Mr. Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton rode up at the inſtant to enquire what was the matter, of two poor women who were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the porch of the poor-houſe. One of them, Amy Talbot, ſeemed to be about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of age, but time had not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Amy of goſſiping, or taught her
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037162_0004_100CD618ED3A1C18"/>
to mend her cloaths. As ſhe had no turn for induſtry in her youth, ſhe ſoon eat, and drank up the little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty left her by her parents, which might now have afforded her a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable maintenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but no, Amy's tongue was always abuſive and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways buſy, whilſt her fingers were ſeldom employed. Wherever there was a goſſiping in the pariſh, thither ran Amy with her rags flying about her, like a ſcare-crow in a cherry tree. Her ſkin, which was quite tawny, was never waſhed; her hair had work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf through the holes of her mob, half the border of which was loſt, and the flaps of it were always flying behind her; the pigs had one day eaten a hole through her hat as it lay on the ground, and a piece of it now hung over her eye like a black patch, her petticoats were all tatters, and her gown reached but little below her knees; it had been torn away bit
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037162_0005_100CDE9440B01DF0"/>
by bit, till it was ravelled out to the above dimenſions; her ſtockings had no feet, and her feet were ſlipped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a miſerable pair of ſhoes, which ſhe had not taken the trouble to draw up at he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, even when they were new; in one hand ſhe clenched her rags together, whilſt with the other, ſhe held a ſhort pipe in her mouth reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her elbow on her knee, as ſhe ſat croſs legged.</p>
            <p>The other poor woman whoſe name was Apſley, was of a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent caſt from Amy; ſhe was the picture of cleanlineſs, and good houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery; ſhe was mending her apron, which though very coarſe, was as white as the driven ſnow; this good woman never ſat at the door to take the air, but ſhe was doing ſomething; "it is a duty," ſhe would ſay, "to turn our time to the beſt account we
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037162_0006_100CDE970D607BF8"/>
can," and when her other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was over ſhe would read a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in her Bible. Mr. Britton aſked her what occaſioned the uproar, and at the ſame time ſlipped half a crown into her hand, giving afterwards a few halfpence to Amy, which he thought was more than ſuch a dirty woman deſerved.</p>
            <p>"Why, ſir," cried Amy pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her pence, "I'll tell you all how and about it; don't you ſee that ſulky ill-looking fellow of a farmer ſo hoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by the people? he is a fine rare cruſty old blade, and has hectored over the pariſh at a fine rate; he is always at law with the Parſon about tithes, and with his neighbours upon the ſlighteſt provocation; beſides, Sir, he is Overſeer of the poor, and a poor time we have had on't, but thanks be praiſed, 'tis come home to the wretch at laſt," then ſhe fell to hooting and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037162_0007_100CDE98ADBC7B18"/>
hiſſing, till ſhe foamed at the mouth again; which having wiped off with the corner of her gown, ſhe ſaid, "now, Sir, I'll tell you: that fellow's ſtomach has been well filled with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing of the beſt, whilſt he has ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved poor we almoſt to death, but 'tis likely to come home to him at laſt, and he may chance to ſwing for it, and then we ſhall all be revenged of him," and again ſhe fell to clapping her hands.</p>
            <p>"Prithee Amy;" replied dame Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley very calmly, "don't give way to ſuch evil tempers; we have been hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed by the farmer to be ſure, but if we are chriſtians, we muſt learn to forget and forgive," "If ever I forgive the villain," cried Amy, knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duſt out of her pipe, "may I never get another quartern of tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co; revenge is ſweet, Sir, revenge is ſweet."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037162_0008_100CDE9A64592918"/>
"To an unchriſtian temper I grant it is," ſaid Mr. Britton, "but revenge is the worſt paſſion that can enter the human breaſt, it is the very ſpirit of Satan."</p>
            <p>"It is a very fine remark truly, Sir," ſaid dame Apſley, "for to my thinking, a man who is always nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up an evil paſſion in his boſom, is as if he cheriſhed a ſerpent there, which muſt ſting him to death at laſt; yet, Sir, I muſt be bold to ſay, much as I want money, I would not accept of farmer Ruſſel's fortune if I muſt take up the heavy burden of his crimes into the bargain." Ah! dame, dame," interrupted Amy, "preach as you pleaſe, I am glad at heart 'tis come home to the villain at laſt, things can't go on worſe with us."</p>
            <p>'Nor perhaps much better," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſw'red dame Apſley, "for, after all,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037162_0009_100CDE9D435BF470"/>
'tis a very unthankful office to have much to do with poor people, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they have not the fear of God before their eyes; becauſe then they are abuſive and ungrateful to thoſe who are guardians over them; for the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ter of that, Amy, have we not ſeveral old people in this poor houſe, who have been drunken, idle, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming people all their lives: and though we live ſo near to the church, not one of them has ſeen the inſide of it for many years paſt, unleſs when there has been Chriſtmas gifts, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be given away; but I think if I were the parſon, Amy, every Lord's day I would drive the whole poſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to church before me, if they were able to ſet one foot before another." "My good woman," ſaid Mr. Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, "I am mightily pleaſed to ſee how uſefully you employ your time, for you have continued your work
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037162_0010_100CDE9ED815F078"/>
ever ſince we have been chatting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether." "Time, Sir, is the gift of God, and I muſt account to him for it; beſides, Sir, often when I am bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily employed at my needle, I can ponder on ſome text of Scripture; and I can ſay with King David, "As for me, when I am poor and in heavineſs, thy help, O God, ſhall lift me up." Now, Sir, although I am very poor, that is no reaſon why I ſhould not be very clean; if my cloathing be coarſe, that is no excuſe for its being ragged, and if I am lame in my feet, that is no cauſe for my fingers being idle; beſides, Sir, a ſtitch in time ſaves nine, and I frequently get a ſhilling by mending ſtays, or quilting of ſervants' petticoats, when my health will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit."</p>
            <p>"Ah! well," interrupted Amy, "I never had the heart to work, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037162_0011_100CDEA09B194180"/>
leſs I were better paid for it. But I ſay dame; I will ſay, that I am glad at heart farmer Ruſſel is in hold at laſt; "live, and let live," is my noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thing; but no, he went on from day to day, cribbing and ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſomething out of every body; and no ſooner did he get a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh in the world, than he took no more account of poor we, than if we had been ſo many hedge-hogs, for all he was born and bred amongſt us; but for the matter of that, he han't been much kinder to his own family, for you muſt know, Sir, his bitter tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſed his only ſon to run away from him, nor has any tale or tidings ever been heard of him." Here again A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my began hiſſing and hooting the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, inſomuch, that Mr. Britton began to think he ſhould never get at the end of the ſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:037162_0012_100CDEA31D6976F8"/>
"Now, Sir," cried Amy at laſt, whilſt ſhe filled her pipe, "now I have got breath again, I'll tell you all how and about it. You muſt know laſt hard winter, Sir, when bread was ſo dear, and coals were ſo ſcarce, farmer Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel would not let the pariſh be at the expence of mending the thatch on our houſe, ſo that when the ſnow melted, it ran in ſtreams down on dame's bed, by which ſhe loſt the uſe of her limbs, and ſhe has hobbled with crutches ever ſince: yet ſhe, fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh woman, ſeldom complains; but off ſhe goes to her Bible for comfort, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother body would to a glaſs of gin, or a pot of beer, when things go amiſs."</p>
            <p>"The troubles of life," ſaid Dame Apſley, "are but as ſhadows which paſs away; but the chriſtian's reſt will be eternal; and certain I am, Sir, my weak nature would often have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven way to ſinful murmurings, but
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037162_0013_100CDEA540041AC8"/>
for the gracious promiſe, of better things in the life to come." O! Sir," continued ſhe, "I have found it much more for my ſoul's good to bleſs Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for what I have, than to murmur for what I have not; though, to be ſure, I have ſeen better days," wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron.</p>
            <p>"Indeed has ſhe, Sir," cried Amy, "for dame's huſband was a man well to paſs in the world; he rented a ſmall farm, and was accounted one of the moſt induſtrious men in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and as to dame herſelf, up early and down late was her maxim when all of a ſudden comes that knaviſh ſcoundrel there, farmer Ruſſel, and takes farmer Apſley's eſtate over his head, who was ſoon after obliged to take up with day-labouring to maintain his family: by-and-by ſickneſs came on,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037162_0014_100CDEA6D4CB9FA8"/>
want followed next, farmer Ruſſel ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed farmer Apſley's goods for a little debt, and at the end of a long fit of ſickneſs, he and his whole family were brought here to the poor-houſe, where the man ſoon after died of a broken heart; and yet, Sir, dame is for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving the farmer all this."</p>
            <p>"That I do," replied ſhe, "ſince my bleſſed Saviour not only forgave his enemies; but prayed to his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father to forgive them alſo; and I ſhould read my Bible to little profit, Amy, if I learnt nothing from ſo bright an example; but, good Sir," ſaid ſhe, turning to Mr. Britton, "your patience muſt be quite tired, not to be yet made acquainted with all the Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub yonder; but moſt folks are ſo fond of telling their own ſtories, that they do not think of other people. There is, Sir, a poor ſoldier found
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037162_0015_100CDEA94B0E9CB8"/>
dead this morning in the next pariſh, and it is thought that farmer Ruſſel has had ſome concern in the matter, ſo the people are now going to carry him before a juſtice to be examined."</p>
            <p>"And I hope he will be hanged, I hope he will be hanged," cried Amy, clapping her hands,"—"and I hope he will live to repent," cried dame Apſley, wiping her eyes. Mr. Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's curioſity was now raiſed, and he attended the mob to the juſtice's.</p>
            <p>Juſtice Carter was an upright gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, juſt ſuch a man as a juſtice of the peace ought to be. Before he adminiſtered an oath to an ignorant perſon; "Think a moment, my friend," he would ſay, "before you kiſs this book, whether you can ſtand to the truth of what you are going to ſwear, when you are called to be judged for
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037162_0016_100CDEAB76274FD0"/>
it, before the God of Heaven and earth." No temptation could ever prevail on his worſhip unjuſtly to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any man: the laws, he ſaid, muſt take their courſe; if they were found ſevere, he did not make them: it was his duty to adminiſter them.</p>
            <p>"And, pleaſe your worſhip," cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Jones, who ſeemed to be the ring-leader of the mob," "we all hope that you will now take revenge for us on the farmer, for all the ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tricks he has played us."</p>
            <p>"I ſhould make but an ill uſe of power, Jones" replied the juſtice, "if I were to do any thing from heat or paſſion; if the law acquits farmer Ruſſel, I ſhall readily diſmiſs him."</p>
            <p>"Well, to be ſure," cried the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all in a breath, "your Worſhip
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037162_0017_100CDEAE16063EA0"/>
muſt be a very fine Chriſtian to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and forgive at this rate, for to our certain knowledge the farmer has been a plague to you yourſelf theſe ten years, ſneering at you many times, and ſaying, that neither you nor the law could take hold of him." "Now, do not you ſee," "replied the juſtice," "that all that has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the preſent matter?"</p>
            <p>Then turning over a great book as big as a church bible, the witneſs was called, who depoſed upon oath, that the laſt evening juſt between light and dark, he ſaw farmer Ruſſel dragging a poor ſoldier-like looking man over Compton bridge, clear out of his own pariſh into the next, that he there laid him down by the ſide of the ditch; that at firſt he the witneſs, believed the man to be dead; but that in a ſhort time he found the poor fellow had only fainted through weakneſs;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037162_0018_100CDEAFCC7F8238"/>
that the witneſs had lent the poor ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier all the aſſiſtance in his power; but that he was obliged ſoon after to follow his cattle.</p>
            <p>Here the witneſs's evidence cloſed. "And could you," ſaid the juſtice to farmer Ruſſel, "drag a poor dying tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller out of your pariſh in this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner? In order to ſave your own pariſh a trifling expence, you did not ſcruple to riſk the life of this poor traveller. You thought indeed, that the darkneſs concealed you; but remember, though it ſeemed dark, yet the broad eye of the Almighty was upon you.</p>
            <p>The farmer then in a ſurly tone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eplied, that the man had no buſineſs in his pariſh, and that as for himſelf, no one could ſay he was unkind to the poor, for he paid three times as
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037162_0019_100CDEB24D3C8108"/>
much to the poor-rates as any man in the pariſh, (the lord of the manor only excepted) "And reaſon good," cried ragged Amy," who had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mob; "becauſe you are the greateſt renter in it; for by diſhoneſt practices you have got all the ſmall farms into your own hands; but far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; no one has heard you ever gave a penny out of your own pocket to the poor when the laws did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel you, ſo no thanks for your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And pleaſe your Worſhip, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one here knows, that whenever a kind gentleman and lady ſent a few ſhillings to be divided amongſt us, if the farmer heard of it he would ſtop our pay till it was gone."</p>
            <p>Both the Juſtice and Mr. Britton quite ſhuddered at this act of cruelty, and every one preſent hoped his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would not fail to take ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on the farmer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:037162_0020_100CDEB463B5A1D0"/>
"My friends," ſaid the Juſtice again, "if my breaſt harboured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge againſt any man, I ſhould be unfit for a magiſtrate; did you never ſee the picture of Juſtice painted in my great hall? ſhe is there repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as holding a pair of ſcales with the balance quite even."</p>
            <p>The Juſtice wiſhing to know ſome more circumſtances about the man's death, the whole poſſe now moved off to the place where the corpſe lay, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Mr. Britton; by the way they accuſed the farmer of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry crime; ſome of which he had not, and others which he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. "Ah!" ſaid one, "who ſold cider for the very beſt, when it was proved it had been half filled up with water?" "Who," ſaid another, "ſold his hay-ricks, all warranted good, and when they were cut open
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037162_0021_100CDEB66C554228"/>
they were found crammed with muſty ſtuff, fit only for littering cattle?" "And who," cried a third, "carried the beſt ſamples of wheat to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and afterwards fobbed the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er off with the very worſt?" "And who," bawled out a fourth, "turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own child out of doors, and mayhap murdered him, for no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings have been heard of him ſince?"</p>
            <p>Much after this manner they went on, and ſoon after the coroner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a verdict of <hi>natural death,</hi> no marks of violence being found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body. The farmer now bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened up at once, and, ſticking his hands in his waiſtcoat pockets, he caſt a malignant grin of triumph on all around him; "Now touch me if you dare," cried he, "but if my name be Ruſſel, I'll have my revenge of every man and woman's child of you;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037162_0022_100CDEB86D063AD8"/>
and I'll lay an action againſt you, John Hoſkins, for defamation; you have accuſed me with the murder of my own child; now prove your words if you can." Poor Hoſkins turned as pale as death, well knowing the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's unforgiving temper.</p>
            <p>Here ſome one ſearching the pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of the deceaſed, was ſurprized to find in them a letter not ſealed, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to farmer Ruſſel, of Compton Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. The letter was offered to the farmer, but he refuſed to take it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving always thought it unlucky to touch any thing belonging to the dead. For the cruel are naturally ſuperſtitious. The people then requeſted Mr. Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton to read it aloud, which he at length conſented to do.</p>

                  <p>I have faithfully ſerved his Majeſty King George in his wars for many years; but falling into the ſame diſorder of which my poor mother died, the conſumption; my commanding officer who has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved like a father to me, has kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted me a furlow, to try what my native air will do for me, giving me at the ſame time a golden guinea out of his own pocket to bear my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences on the road, he having always taken a great fancy to me, ſeeing as how, I ever made it my delight to obey him. So I began my match homeward, although with great fear and trembling, pondering in my mind
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037162_0025_100CDEBF4ABB8348"/>
the laſt words I ever heard you ſpeak; which were, 'That you wiſhed I might drop down dead if I ever da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to darken your doors again;' and calling down heavy curſes on yourſelf if ever you forgave me; and now, as my offence, dear father, was but a ſlight, one, and much have I repented of it, and much ſhall we all have to be forgiven when we ſhall appear before God in judgement, ſo I humbly truſt you will receive me kindly when you ſee how ſick, and how very weak I am. I have fallen down once or twice on the road, and having ſpent all my money, have been for two days living by charity. I therefore write theſe few lines from the Swan at Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, where I have ſtopped, in order that they may, in caſe I ſhould not be able to reach home alive, be ſent to you after my death. Oh, my dear father! my hour glaſs is almoſt run, and death will now be welcome to me,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037162_0026_100CDEC0DF325018"/>
for my life has been little elſe than pain and ſorrow. O! father, nothing becomes a chriſtian-man like ſorrow for ſin, even when he is found in health, and his worldly concerns flouriſhing round him. Pray, dear father, think of theſe things. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this life is nearly over with me, yet I have a comfortable hope and truſt in my Saviour that the joys of the next will ſoon open upon me.</p>
                  <p>"Farewell, for ever, my dear and honoured father: ſhould we meet no more in this world, I humbly pray we may meet in the next. I beg pardon for all my faults, and with my dying breath ſubſcribe myſelf, your ever dutiful ſon,</p>

Britton read the letter. "My good friends," ſaid he, when he had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. "let me now give you a word of advice: Whenever a ſick and poor traveller, (and eſpecially when a brave ſoldier or ſailor, who has ſhed his blood in fighting for you in foreign parts, and is perhaps eſcaped from an enemy's priſon,) knocks at your door to aſk for charity, do not refuſe him a cup of beer, or a plentiful ſlice of bread and cheeſe: to you who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound it is little, to him it may be much; and henceforward let us all learn to look upon every man in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs as a child or a brother; and let us do by him as we would wiſh to be done by, if we were in his condition. As for you, farmer Ruſſel," continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, "no reproof from me is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the event that has happened is of itſelf the moſt bitter of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs."</p>

"O my ſon! my ſon!" at length cried the farmer, wringing his hands, and tearing his hair with grief, "my own curſes have brought on my own deſtruction! Wretch! wretch that I am," here attempting to riſe, he ſunk down by the body of his ſon, and then fell into ſuch ſtrong convulſion fits, that ſix of the ſtouteſt men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent could not hold him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his limbs were diſtorted, his face turned black, his eyes looked as if they were burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his head; ſo dreadful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was his ſituation, that thoſe who but a moment before hated and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, were now ready to pity him. "What an affecting ſight," ſaid Mr. Britton "have we now before us! God grant that it may prove a leſſon to us all. It was but a few moments ago that this miſerable man, who now lies ſtruggling in the toils of death before you, was proudly rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037162_0029_100CDEC7EBFE9A90"/>
that he had eſcaped the laſh of the law."</p>
            <p>The farmer's waggon now arrived to carry him home, and it was a moſt moving ſight, to ſee it followed by the corpſe of his ſon. A doctor was ſent for, who the moment he ſaw the farmer, ſaid he feared he could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him. Mr. Britton watched by him all night, and when the fits went off for a few minutes, he was heard thus to mutter to himſelf.</p>
            <p>"Of what uſe to me are all the riches in the world, now the afflicting hand of Heaven is upon me? My puniſhment is great, great alſo has been my crime.—I ſuffered my own child to periſh for want, whilſt I was in plenty, and now my own hand has helped to kill him; how hard have I been to the poor; the Lord has

ſmitten me for it! The curſes I have often uttered againſt them are now come upon myſelf. I muſt die! The jaws of Hell ſeem opening to devour me!"</p>
            <p>After this the farmer uttered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be underſtood, though he languiſhed near three weeks in a ſtate of miſery which excited the pity of all who ſaw him, and then expired, a dreadful inſtance of the juſt judgment of God.</p>
