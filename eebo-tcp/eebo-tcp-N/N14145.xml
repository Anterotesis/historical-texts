            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is now going on three years ſince I firſt wrote this piece. Great and glorious events have ſince taken place in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical affairs; and, I hope, the day is not far diſtant when peace, on the moſt honourable and advantageous terms, for America, ſhall be proclaimed throughout theſe United States. However, not knowing now much longer the war, by reaſon of our ſins, might be continued, I concluded it might not be amiſs to caſt my mite into the treaſury, in order to vindicate the conduct of all thoſe brave officers and men who have already, and may yet fall in the American war, in defence of our rights and liberties, civil and religious; and alſo to clear up the doubts and ſcruples of tender conſciences, as to the lawfulneſs of taking up arms in any caſe whatſoever. I acknowledge that there have already been many able pens employed in ſtating the juſtice of our cauſe, and none, in my opinion, merits more our thanks than the author of Common Senſe; but none, that I have ſeen, has, to my ſatisfaction, cleared up the lawfulneſs of the uſe of defenſive arms againſt tyrants and tyranny, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they ſhall endeavour to deprive a people of their liberty and property.

               </gap>e, who might have done greater juſtice to the cauſe. All that I have, or chuſe, to ſay, in praiſe of the performance, is, that the author means honeſtly, and ſhall ever pray for the ſucceſs of the American arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thoſe of her allies, in the preſent juſt defenſive war; and that he never has, nor never means to ſpare himſelf, whenever he may be called upon to face the enemies of his country, if even it ſhould, as it may, coſt him his life; for where could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

of the American war from April 19, 1775, to June, 17, 1779, and we ſhall not be wanting of inſtances of many ſuffering by the hands of Britiſh tyranny, for maintaining this principle of ſelf defence, in defence of our lives and liberties. It is well known that the Americans did not haſtily, nor violently, ruſh in to the preſent war.

            <p>I ſhall now endeavour to conſider it more complexly and extenſively, and plead both for reſiſtance againſt the abuſe of a lawful power are againſt the uſe and uſurpation of a tyrannical power, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſtimable bleſſings into the devouring jaws of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; which if we ſhould be tame enough to do, ſhall we not bring on us the curſe of Meroz and the curſe of our brethren's blood, crying for vengeance on the heads of the ſhedders thereof, and upon all who being in a capacity came not to their reſcue;—and the curſe of poſterity would have been upon us for not tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that liberty whereof we were, by the valour of our worthy forefathers, put and left in poſſeſſion of. I ſhall not, therefore, reſtrict myſelf to the queſtion propounded ordinarily, to wit, whether or not, when a limited king doth really injure, oppreſs, and invade his ſubjects civil rights and liberties, and ſends out his bloody emiſſaries, with armed violence againſt them; and when all redreſs, or hope, by any addreſs or petition, is rendered void; then, and in that caſe, may a community of ſuch ſubjects defend themſelves and their liberties by arms, in reſiſting his bloody emiſſaries. But to bring it home to our preſent caſe, and anſwer the laxneſs of the adverſaries poſition of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulableneſs of every one that wears a crown, I ſhall ſlate it thus, whether or not it is a duty for a community to endeavour, in the defence of their lives, laws, and liberties, to reſiſt the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of prevailing dominators, uſing and abuſing their power, to the ſubverting and invading the liberties and overturning the fundamental laws of the country?—I hold to the affirmative, and ſhall attempt to prove it; and, in proſecuting this ſubject, I ſhall firſt premit ſome conceſſory conſiderations to clear it, and then bring reaſons to prove it.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place for clearing of this truth, and taking of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, then conceſſions may be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt. I do allow that the ordinance of majeſtracy, which is of God, is not to be reſiſted; no, not ſo much as by diſobedience
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017905_0005_0FA37A4C42DD0070"/>
or non-obedience; nay, not ſo much as menta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly, by curſing in the heart. Eccleſ. x. 20. But a perſon clothed therewith abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his power, may be ſo far reſiſted; but tyrants, or magiſtrates turning tyrants, are not God's ordinances; and there is no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of damnation for reſuſing to obey their unjuſt commands; but rather, the hazard of that is in walking willingly after the commandment, when the ſtatutes of Omri are kept; ſo that what is objected from Eccleſ. viii. 2. 4. <hi>I counſel thee to keep the king's commandments, &amp;c.</hi> Is to be underſtood only of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful commands of lawful things.</p>
            <p>Second. I do allow that rebellion is a damnable ſin, except: where the word is taken in a lax ſenſe, as Iſrael of old is ſaid to have rebelled againſt Rehoboam and good Hezekiah againſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib, which was a good rebellion and a clear duty. Being taken there for reſiſtance and revolt, in this ſenſe, the Americans riſing in arms may be called rebellion, for it is right and lawful, to all intents and purpoſes, to rebel againſt tyrants, as all are who offer, or attempt, to govern contrary to the laws of the land; for where law ceaſes, tyranny begins. But becauſe the word is generally taken in an evil ſenſe, many do not make the proper diſtinction between a lawful rebellion againſt tyrants, and an unlawful one againſt lawful authority. As I ſaid before, I do allow that rebellion againſt lawful magiſtrates is a moſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſin, which was of old moſt exemplarily puniſhed in Ko<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ah and his company, who rebelled againſt Moſes and in Sheba and Abſalom, who rebelled againſt David. <hi>For to puniſh the juſt is not good, nor to ſtrike princes for equity.</hi> Prov. xvii. 26. <hi>And they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi> Rom. xiii. 2. So that this objection, brought from this place, as if the apoſtle was commanding their ſubjection, without reſiſtance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>o and ſuch like tyrants as he, is very impertinent; and to explain this a little, I ſhall ſhew that the apoſtle was here vindicating chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity from that reproach of caſting off, or refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing ſubjection to all magiſtrates, as if chriſtian liberty had deſtroyed that religion, or that they were not to be ſubject to heathen magiſtrates; where upon, to undeceive them in this point he binds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his duty of ſubjection to magiſtrates for conſcience ſake in general; and it is very conſiderable what Buchanan ſays in his book <hi>(De Jure regni:)</hi> that Paul did not write to the kings themſelves becauſe they were not chriſtians, and therefore the more might be ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne with from them, though they ſhould not underſtand the duty of magiſtrates. But upon ſuppoſition there had been ſome chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an king who had turned tyrant and a limited one alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ho by
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017905_0006_0FA37A4D044B5D80"/>
his tyrannical proceedings, was endeavouring to overturn the laws, charters, and liberties of his ſubjects, what would he have written then? Surely if he had been like himſelf he would have denied that he ſhould be owned for a king; and would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted all chriſtian communion with him; and that they ſhould account him no king, but ſuch as they were to have no fellowſhip with according to the law of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Second. The apoſtle here was, no doubt, ſpeaking of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rulers, not tyrants; but of all ſuch as are defined and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied here, being powers ordained of God, terrors to evil works, miniſters of God for good. Yea, but ſay tories and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, theſe are only motives of ſubjection to all powers, not qualifications of the powers. To which I anſwer, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed motives, but ſuch as can be extended to none but to thoſe powers that are ſo qualified.</p>
            <p>Third. He ſpeaks of lawful powers indefinitely in the plural number, not ſpecifying any kind or degree of them, as if only kings and emperors were here meant. It cannot be proved that the power of the ſword is only in them, neither was there, at that time, at Rome a plurality of kings and emperors to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to. It is clear to me, that if he had meant the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he would have deſigned him in the ſingular number; for all the reaſons of the text agree to inferior judges. Alſo, for they are ordained of God; they are called rulers in ſcripture, and God's miniſters, revengers by office, who judge not for man but for the Lord. And inferior magiſtrates alſo are not to be reſiſted when doing their duty, 1 Peter, ii. 13. Yet all will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, when they go beyond their bounds, and turn little tyrants, they may be withſtood.</p>
            <p>Fourth. He does not ſpeak of Nero, concerning whom it cannot be proved, that at this time he had the ſovereign power, at the famous and learned Mr. Prin ſhews; or if he had, that he was a tyrant at this time; and if he meant him at all, it was only as he was obliged to be by right, not as he was indeed: all men know, and none condemns the fact of the ſenate hat reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>o at length, without tranſgreſhing this precept. Yea, I ſhould rather think the ſenate is the power that the apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies this text to, if he appled it to any in particular.</p>
            <p>Fifth. The ſubjection here required is the ſame with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the fifth command, where of this is an expoſition, and is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

is not here required, ſo neither unlimited ſubjection.</p>
            <p>Third. I do allow paſſive ſubjection, in ſome caſes, even to tyrants, when the Lord lays on that yoke; and, in effect, ſays he will have us lie under it awhile, as he of old commanded the Jews to be ſubject to Nebuchadnezzar. Of which paſſage, adduced to prove ſubjection to tyrants univerſally, Buchanan as above infers, that if all tyrants are to be ſubjected to becauſe God by his prophet commanded his people to be ſubject to one tyrant, then it muſt be likewiſe concluded that all tyrants ought to be killed, becauſe Ahab's houſe was commanded to be deſtroyed by Jehu. But paſſive ſubjection, when people are not in a capacity to reſiſt, is neceſſary; but I do not ſay paſſive obedience, which is a mere chimera, invented in the brains of ſuch ſycophants and jack aſſes as would make the world ſlaves to tyrants. Whoſoever ſuffereth, if he can ſhun it, is an enemy to his own being, and is a firſt couſin to a ſelf-murderer; for every natural thing muſt ſtrive to preſerve itſelf againſt what annoyeth it; and alſo, he ſins againſt the order of God who, in vain, hath ordained ſo many lawful means for the preſervation of our being, if we ſuffer it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, having power to help it.</p>
            <p>Fourth. I do abhor all war of ſubjects, profeſſedly declared againſt a lawful king, who governs and rules according to law; as alſo all war againſt lawful authority, founded upon, or deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for maintaining princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of a king to lead them. Alſo, it is proper h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e to obſerve that people have this privilege of nature to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves, and their rights and liberties, as well as kings; and had it before they erected and conſtituted kings; for I affirm, that there is no diſtinction of quality in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of nature, though there be in civil order; but ſelf defence is not an act of civil order, in ſuch intereſt people muſt not depend upon the priority of their ſuperiors, nor ſuſpend the duties they owe to

themſelves and their neighbours, upon the manuduction of other mens greatneſs the law of nature allowing ſelf defence, and the defence of our brethren, againſt all unjuſt violence, which fully juſtifies the conduct of the different ſtates appearing in and flying to arms in defence of our diſtreſſed and injured brethren of the Maſſachuſetts Bay ſtate, in the year 1775, when Britain laid her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hand of tyranny and oppreſſion upon them. It is a great and incumbent duty on all people to defend their religion and liberties, and thoſe of their countrymen, againſt king <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> who ſhall attempt to deſtroy the rights and liberties of the ſubjects for all the power of a king or ruler is ſurely cumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, not privative, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orſe condition of a ruler ought not to be by producing. Why then ſhall the king, betraying his truſt, wrong the cauſe of the people whoſe truſtee be is? Nay if it were not lawful for people to defend their religion, lives, and liberties againſt the unjuſt encroachments of a tyrannical king, then I ſay the people would be in a worſe ſituation with a king than without him, for they have done it before they had them, and ſo had better be without them ſtill. But it is as clear as the ſun at noon day in the firmament, that it is lawful to reſiſt kings when they, by their mal adminiſtration, forfeit their ſubjects allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as the king of England, by his has ſurely done. Poor foul, I believe he repents, but it is like poor Eſau's all too late.</p>
            <p>Fifth. I do diſallow all war, without real neceſſity and great wrongs ſuſtained; and that it ought not to be declared or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken upon ſuppoſed grounds, or pretended cauſes; and ſo the queſtion is impertinently ſtated by the to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, whether or not it be lawful for ſubjects, or a party of them, when they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves injured, or to be in a capacity, to reſiſt or oppoſe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of a nation? For the queſtion is not if, when they think themſelves injured, they may reſiſt; but when the injuries are real. Neither is it every reality of injuries will juſtify a people's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; but when their deareſt and neareſt liberties are invaded, eſpecially when ſuch an invaſion is made as threatens the total ſubverſion of them. Nor do I ſay that a people, eſteeming themſelves in a capacity, or their being really in a capacity, doth make reſiſtance a duty, except all alike they have a call, as well as a capacity, which requires real neceſſity, and a right to he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; and the things contended for to be real and legal. Rights really and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ally encroached upon their capacity, gives them only a convenience to go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bout the duty that is previouſly lawful upon a moral ground. No man need to ſay who ſhall be judge the king or people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:017905_0007_0FA37A4DC5463840"/>
For firſt. All who have eyes in their head may, I think, judge whether the ſun ſhines or not; and all who have common ſenſe may judge in this caſe; for when it comes to a neceſſity of reſiſtance, it is to be ſuppoſed that the grievances complained of, and ſought to be redreſſed by arms, are not hid, but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. Now it cannot be ſo with a people only pretending their ſuffering wrong. As to the grievances of the good people of America, it is ſo manifeſt to the world, that ſome of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof have eſpouſed our righteous cauſe, and the reſt ſeems to be ſilent.</p>
            <p>Second. There is no need of the formality of a judge in things evident to nature's eye, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s graſs is not tyranny. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining and overturning religion and liberty, muſt be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the acts of neceſſitated reſiſtance. In ſuch a caſe is judge, party, accuſer, witneſs, and all. Neither is it an act of judgment for people to defend their own. Defence is no act of juriſdiction, but a privilege of nature. Hence ariſes theſe common ſayings, all laws permits force to be repelled by force; and the great and firſt law of nature allows ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence. I ſay, that the defence of life is neceſſary, and ſlows from the law of nature.</p>
            <p>Third. Be judge who will, the tyrant cannot be judge in the caſe; for in thoſe tyrannical acts that forces people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, he cannot be acknowledged as king, and of courſe no judge; for it is always ſuppoſed that the judge is abſent when he is the party that does the wrong; as ſuch, is inferior to the innocent.</p>
            <p>Fourth and laſtly. Let God be judge, and all the world take cognizance of the juſtneſs of our cauſe.</p>
            <p>Sixth. I condemn all riſing to revenge private injuries, whereby a country may be covered with blood, for ſome pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty wrongs done to ſome perſons great of ſmall. I alſo abhor all revengeful uſurping of the magiſtrates ſword, to avenge our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for perſonal injuries, as David's ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of Saul would have been. I Sam. xxiv. 10, 12, 13. Ibid xxvi. 9, 10. To object this, in this caſe, were very impertinent; for it would have been an act of offence, in a remote defence, if Saul had been immediately aſſaulting of him, it could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by no means, be deemed to have been lawful; and it would have been an act of private revenge, for a perſonal injury, and a ſinful prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's promiſe of David's ſucceſſion, by a ſcandalous aſſaſſination; but it is clear then, David was reſiſting him and that is enough for my argument; and he ſuppoſes he might
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017905_0008_0FA37A4E8393C580"/>
deſcend into battle and periſh. I Sam. xxvi. 10. Not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding but that he might periſh in battle againſt himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting. I do allow, indeed, that we are commanded, in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not to reſiſt evil, but whoſoever ſhall ſmite us on the one cheek, to turn to him the other alſo. Mat v 39. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o recompence to no man evil for evil. Rom. xii. 17. But this doth not condemn ſelf defence, and reſiſting of tyrants, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently endangering our lives, laws, religion, and liberties; but only reſiſtance by way of private revenge and retaliation; and enjoins patience, when the clear call and diſpenſation do inevitably call unto ſuffering, but not to give way to all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to the ſubverting of religion and liberty. Theſe texts do no more condemn private perſons retaliating the magiſtrates than magiſtrates retaliating private perſons; unleſs magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates be exempted from this precept, and conſequently be not among Chriſt's followers; yea, they do no more forbid private perſons to reſiſt the unjuſt violence of a king than to reſiſt the unjuſt violence of any private perſon. That objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from our Lord's reproving Peter. Matt. xxvi. 3, 2. Put up thy ſword for all they that take the ſword ſhall periſh by the ſword. Hath no weight here, for this condemns only mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of the ſword either by way of private revenge, or uſurping the uſe of it without authority, and ſo condemns all tyrants, which private ſubjects do not want to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their religion, and liberty, or uſing it without neceſſity, which was not Peter's caſe, both becauſe Chriſt was able to defend himſelf, and becaſe he was willing to deliver up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Pools ſynops critic in l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cum.</hi> Chriſt could eaſily have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf, but he would not, and, therefore, in courſe there was not the leaſt neceſſity for Peter's raſhneſs.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſh precipitating, and preventing the call of God, to acts of reſiſtance. But otherwiſe it is plain it was not Peter's fault to defend his maſter, but a neceſſary duty. The reaſon our bleſſed Lord gives for that inhibition at that time was twofold, one expreſſed Matt. xxvi. 52. For they that take the ſword. &amp;c. Which do not belong to Peter, as if he was hereby threatened, but to thoſe that were coming to take Chriſt. They it were that, indeed, uſurped the ſword of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical violence, and therefore are threatened with deſtruction by the bloody ſword of the Romans. So is that commination to be underſtood of anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> which my father hath given me ſhall I not drink. Which clearly repels that objection of Chriſt's non-reſiſtance. To which it is anſwered, that ſuffering was the end of his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſuſcepted humiliation, and his grand errand to the world, appointed by the father, and freely undertaken by himſelf, which is not the rule of our practice; though it be true that, even in his ſuffering, he left us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps. 1 Pet. ii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter the ſame manner, for then it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for us to flee, as well as to reſiſt, becauſe he would notifies at that time.</p>
            <p>Seven. I do alſo diſclaim all riſing in arms for trifles of our own things, or ſmall injuries done to ourſelves, but in a caſe of pure neceſſity, for the preſervation of our lives, religion, laws, and liberties, when all that is dear to us as men and chriſtians, are in hazard. So I am not for riſing in arms to force any people to be of any particular religion, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my own, and my country's religion and liberties, from unjuſt force and violence, againſt kings and tyrants, that may encroach thereon. I do not believe that it is the way that Chriſt hath appointed to propa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate religion by arms. Let perſecutors and lambs of antichriſt take that to them. But I am convinced that it is a privilege that Chriſt hath allowed to mankind, to defend and preſerve their religion and liberties by arms, eſpecially when they have been eſtabliſhed by ſolemn charters, and the laws and conſtitution of the land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become a land right, and the deareſt and moſt precious of all rights and intereſt we have to contend for. It is true, faith Chriſt. John xviii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But the good confeſſion he witneſſes here before Pilate, is, that he hath a kingdom which, as it is not in oppoſition to any Ceſarean majeſty, muſt not be uſurped by any king of clay; but is ſpecially diſtinct from all the kingdoms of the world, and ſubordinate to no earthly power, being of a ſpiritual nature, whereof this is a demonſtration, and ſufficient ſecurity for earthly kingdoms, that his ſervants, as ſuch, that is as chriſtians and as miniſters, were not appointed by him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate it by arms, not to deliver him their king, at that time, becauſe he would not ſuffer his glorious deſign of redemption to be any longer retarded. But this doth not ſay that though they are not to propagate it as chriſtians and as miniſters, by carnal weapons, yet they may preſerve it with ſuch weapons as men. Hence that old ſaying may be vindicated, prayers and tears are the arms of the church. I grant they are ſo, the only beſt prevailing arms, and without which all others would be ineffectual, and that they, together with preaching and church diſcipline, are the only ecc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And ye my flock, the flock of my paſture, are men, faith the Lord. Ezek xxxiii 31. And from this I ſhall take an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that if it be lawful for private ſubjects to reſiſt a tyrant by prayers and tears, than it is lawful alſo to reſiſt them by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but the former is true, therefore the latter. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal reſiſtance by violence is as conſiſtent with that command, Rom. xiii. 1, 2. Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Whoſoever, therefore, reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God; as reſiſtance by prayer is with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Tim. ii. 1, 2. I exhort that ſupplication be made for kings and for all that are in authority. If the king be good, the one reſiſtance is as unlawful as the other; and is a ſinful reſiſtance of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, to pray againſt him no leſs than the other to fight againſt him. Therefore, when a king turns a tyrant, and a deſtroyer of the religion and liberties of the people, I may not pray for him, except conditionally, but againſt him as an enemy, ſo I may alſo fight againſt him. As ſuch the tyrant of Britain, I mean George the III, and his burning bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy emiſſaries, who do, at leaſt, by their actions, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the reſiſtance made againſt them, by the prayers and tears of the faithful, is more powerful and effectual than that made by arms.

God. What has become of one or two near Springfield, in the ſtate of New-Jerſey, when they murdered the miniſter's wife there? How have they deſtroyed two at Somerſet, in ſaid ſtate? Alſo, at Crumpond, and Bedford in the ſtate of New-York? And no doubt many more that at preſent does not occur to my mind. And farther, the law uſed to make the one reſiſtance as treaſonable as the other, and that very deſervedly too, when the king was doing his duty. But when he turns tyrant, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe methods of reſiſtance can juſtly be condemned.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being admitted, I ſhall now come to the thing in hand, and endeavour to prove this truth, that it is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty for a people to endeavour, in the defence of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

I propoſe to be as ſhort as poſſible, becauſe I think this truth inſufficiently confirmed already, to convince any but theſe who are determined not to be convinced; yet I propoſe to hint at ſome others, and proſecute them in the following order. Firſt, I ſhall produce ſome arguments from the law of nature and nations. Secondly, From the common practices of all chriſtian people. Thirdly, From expreſs ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The arguments of the firſt claſs are very multifarious. I ſhall endeavour to reduce them to a few as compendiouſly as may be, and only give the ſtrength of them in a ſyllogiſtical form, without expatiating, ſave where the matter requires.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The great antagoniſts of this truth, through the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, are forced to aſſert and grant ſuch particulars as will, by conſequence, juſtify this plea. Firſt, Barclay, <hi>contra monarchum,</hi> is cited by the <hi>Apal Relat,</hi> and <hi>Jus Populi,</hi> aſſerting, <q>That if a king will alienate, and ſubject his kingdom, without his ſubjects conſent, or be carried with a hoſtile mind to the deſtruction of his people, his kingdom is actually loſt, and the people may not only lawfully reſiſt, but alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him.</q> 
               <hi>Grotius de jure Belli, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap</hi> 4. aſſerts the ſame, and adds, 'If he but attempt to do ſo, he may be reſiſted.' The Surveyor of Naphtali grants the ſame. P. 23. 24. Yea, this has been granted in many of the councils and open courts of chriſtian nations, that in caſe of the king's alienating his kingdom, he may be reſiſted; which will fully juſtify the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican reſiſtance; for ſurely Britain, by her conduct, was about to ſell or deſtroy her liberties and property; and has effectually eſtranged and drawn off our affections from her, even to the world's wonder. I need ſay no more than this, that a king's
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017905_0010_0FA37A50054E4E90"/>
carrying a hoſtile mind, to the deſtruction of his people and kingdom, does give the people a right to reſiſt him. Doctor Ferne acknowledgeth, <q>That perſonal defence is lawful againſt the ſudden, illegal, and inevitable aſſaults of the kings meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or of himſelf, ſo far as to ward off his blows, or hold his hands; as alſo he alloweth private perſons liberty to deny ſubſidies and tribute to the prince, when he employeth it to the deſtruction of the commonwealth.</q> From hence I argue, if one may defend himſelf againſt the ſudden, illegal and inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſaults of the king or his meſſenger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then may many men, in defence of their lives and liberties, defend themſelves againſt the ſurprizing maſſacre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Bodin de Repub. lib.</hi> 2. chap. 5. granteth, <q>If a king turn tyrant, he may lawfully, at his ſubjects requeſt, be invaded, reſiſted, condemned, or ſlain by a foreign prince</q>—Hence, if a foreign prince may lawfully help a people opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted, then alſo all contrajudical violence againſt law or reaſon, muſt be oppoſed, for that is more grievous, and all their violences, wherein they do not act as judges, muſt be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and that is altogether, for in none of them they can act as judges; but the former is true, therefore the latter. If a woman may defend her chaſtity againſt the king, leſt her non-reſiſtance make her guilty, then may a nation, or any part of it, reſiſt a king's attempt upon their religion and liberties, enticing them to fornication, leſt their non reſiſtance make them guilty; but the former is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore the latter.</p>
            <p>Five, That ſame <hi>Arniſaeus,</hi> cap. 4. ſaith of the former, to wit, <q>He who is called a tyrant in title, it is determined by all, without any difficulty, that he may be lawfully repulſed, <hi>or</hi> if by force he be gotten into the throne, he may warrantably be then<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e removed, becauſe he hath not any jot of power which is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017905_0010_0FA37A50054E4E90"/>
not illegitimate, and unto which reſiſtance is forbidden, for the fear of God and for conſcience ſake; and therefore he is no further to be looked at than as an enemy</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sixth. <hi>Grotious de jure belli</hi> lib i. cap. 4. Granteth, <q>the law of not reſiſting does not bind, when the danger is moſt weighty and certain;</q> and I do not plead for it in any other caſe. And further, he faith, <q>the law of non-reſiſtance ſeemeth to have flowed from them who firſt combined together into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and from whom ſuch as did command, did derive their power. Now if it had been aſked of ſuch whether they would choſe to die, rather than in any caſe to reſiſt the ſuperior with arms, I know not if they would have yielded thereto, unleſs with this addition, if they could not be reſiſted but with the greateſt perturbation of the common wealth, and deſtruction of many innocents. And afterwards he hath the words, Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I ſcarce dare condemn every one, or the leſſer part, which may only be done, at utmoſt extremity; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſpect is to be had to the common good</q> From all which I need not make the leaſt inference, the conceſſion is ſo large, that it does to all intents and purpoſes confirm my arguments.</p>
            <p>Seventh. The ſurveyor of Naphtali, in the place above cited, <q>grants legal ſelf-defence, againſt the ſovereign, by way of plea in court, for ſafety of a man's perſon or eſtate; as alſo is the caſe of moſt habited not our and compleat tyranny, againſt law to the deſtruction of the body of a people; and of all known legal liberties, and the being of religion, according to law, and in caſe of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not being in his right wits.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hence I argue, that if it be lawful to reſiſt the king by a plea in law, for an eſtate, yea the law will allow, by actual force if he come to take poſſeſſion of it illegally; then it muſt be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for their lives and eſtates, liberties and religion, to reſiſt him by force, when the legal reſiſtance is not admitted; but the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmer is true therefore the latter. The reaſon of the connexion is, the municipal law permits the one, and the law of na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> and nations, which no municipal law can infringe, will warrant the other. He hath no more right to be both judge and party in this caſe, than in the other. Second. If it be lawful to reſiſt tyranny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt law, to the deſtruction of the rights of the people, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and liberties, then I want no more to prove the lawfulneſs of the American reſiſtance againſt the tyranny of Britain, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for years paſt againſt us, which has proven the deſolation and ruin of many hundreds of families, beſides all the rivers of blood that have been drawn from the veins of our dear country men;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017905_0011_0FA37A50C24F3F60"/>
and all this perpetrated for the profeſt purpoſe of ſubverting our religion and liberties, and to eſtabliſh an arbitrary government. And here I think it proper to anſwer an objection that ſome may make, viz. That I have blended religious liberty with civil, as a cauſe of the American reſiſtance, when the former was not in the leaſt invaded by any Britiſh act of parliament that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of; but all freedom left to the conſcience in that reſpect, and therefore I ought not to have made uſe of the word in this piece. In anſwer whereof, I offer the following as my reaſon for ſo doing: I do freely acknowledge that I have not ſeen or heard of any Britiſh act of parliament that did, in direct terms, and in ſo many words, declare that the people of America ſhould all be of one uniform religion, upon pain of death and confiſcation of goods; but I have ſeen and read one that carried all that in it's bowels, to wit. The declaratory act, wherein they declare they had a right to bind the Americans in all caſes whatſoever; which if once they could have put into full execution, what would there be left we could call our own any longer than at the will and pleaſure of a tyrannical king and parliament, for there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the word whatſoever? Beſides, whoever knew or heard of a people's enjoying their religious liberties when their civil was taken from them? They were born twins, knit together, therefore if-one of them dies, the other cannot live; at leaſt this is my opinion, and every one has a right to judge for themſelves. Now under the full conviction of this, and that had our civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties been taken from us, our religious ones would not long ſurvived. I was led to blend them together, and ſhall through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this piece.</p>
            <p>Third. Suppoſe the king ſhould run mad, and out of his wits, and then ſhould run upon an innocent man to kill him, or make an attempt to cut his own throat, would it then, and in that caſe, be lawful to reſiſt him? Yea, it would be a great ſin not to do it. Then ſurely, when in a mad rage, he is ſeeking to deſtroy many hundred of the good people of America, he may and ought to be reſiſted. But the former is true therefore the latter. It is eaſily to be ſeen by the above conceſſions of adverſaries to my principles, that the abſolute ſubjection they talk of will not hold good, nor the prerogative be ſo uncontroulable in every caſe as they would pretend; and that in many caſes the ſafety of the people hath the ſupremacy above it, and that alſo in theſe caſes the people muſt be judges whether they may reſiſt or not.</p>
            <p>Second. From the law of nature I may argue. Firſt. If God the fountain of all power, and author of all right, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017905_0011_0FA37A50C24F3F60"/>
unto man both the power, and the right of, and reaſon to manage ſelf-defence, and hath no ways interdicted it in his word, to be put forth againſt tyrants, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n it is duty to uſe it againſt him upon occaſion; but the former is true, therefore the latter. Second. If this power and right were reſtrained in man againſt the unjuſt violence of any, it would either be by policy or grace, or ſome expreſs prohibition in the word of God; but none of theſe can be ſaid, therefore policy cannot deſtroy nature, but is rather cumulative to it. A man entering into a politic incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, does not loſe the privilege of nature. If one particular nature may defend itſelf againſt deſtroying violence out of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then muſt many of theſe natures, combined in ſociety have the ſame right; and ſo much the more that their relative duties ſuperadd an obligation of mutual aſſiſtance. Grace does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the right of ſinleſs nature, though it reſtrains corruption. But ſelf-defence is no corruption. Grace makes a man more a man than he was, and nothing can be more diſhonourable to the goſpel than that, by the law of nature, it is lawful to reſiſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. But we are bound by religion from withſtanding their cruelty. The laws of God do not interfere one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Third. That law which alloweth comparative <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, ſo as to kill rather than be killed, teache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> reſiſtance. But ſo the law of nature alloweth, except we be guilty of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the culpable omiſſion of ſelf defence. The reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the love of ſelf is nearer and greater, as to temporal life, than the love of our neighbour; that being the meaſure of this, therefore it obliges rather to kill than be killed, the exigence of neceſſity ſo requiring. Fourth. If nature put no other differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the violence of a tyrant than of another man, then it teaches to reſiſt both alike; but it putte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h no difference, but rather aggravates that of a tyrant, being the violence of a man, the injuſtice of a member of the common wealth, and the cruelty of a tyrant; and it is moſt abſurd to ſay, that we might defend ourſelves from the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er violence, and not from the greater. Fifth. If particular nature muſt yield to the good of univerſal nature, then muſt one man, though in greateſt power, be reſiſted rather than the univerſal common wealth ſuffer hurt. But the former is true therefore the latter; for that dictates the neceſſity of the diſtracted father to be bound by his own ſons, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t all the family be hurt; therefore the greateſt of men, or kings, when deſtructive to the common wealth, muſt be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017905_0012_0FA37A5183E7D120"/>
worſe condition than brutes, is abſurd and contrary to the law of nature; but to ſay that the brutes have power to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by reſiſting what annoys them, and deny this power to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aen, is irrational, and reflects upon providence as putting men in a worſe condition than brutes; therefore it is abſurd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the law of nature.</p>
            <p>Third. From the inſtitution of government, I may argue thus, that power and government, which is not of God, may be reſiſted. The tyrant's power and government in breaking char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, overturning laws, ſubverting religion, oppreſſing ſubjects, is not of God, therefore it may be reſiſted. This is clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is only the reaſon why he is not to be reſiſted, becauſe the ordinance of God is not to be reſiſted. Rom. xiii. 2. But they reſiſting a man, deſtroying all the intereſts of mankind, do not in this reſiſt the ordinance of God. And if it were not ſo, this would tend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>remedableſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cs, and open a gap to all diſorder. Injuſtice and cruelty would give as great encouragement to tyrants to do what they liſt, as thieves would be encouraged, if they knew that nobody would reſiſt them, or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing them to puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Fourth. From the original conſtitution of government by men, it may be argued thus, if people, at the firſt erection of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, acted rationally and did not put themſelves in a worſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe than before, wherein it was lawful to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all injuries, but devolved their rights upon the fiduciary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>utory of ſuch as ſhould remain ſtill in the rank of men, that can do wrong, who had no power but by their gift, conſent, and choice, with whom they aſſociated, not to their detriment, but for their advantage; and determined the form of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and time of its continuance, and in what caſes they might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>lf defence and power of reſiſtance, which they had before to withſtand the violence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> injuries, and oppreſſions of men they ſet over them, when they pervert the form, and convert it to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but did re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> true, ergo, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>exion is confirmed from this. If the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of a kingdom give the power to a king, it is their own power in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Fifth. From the way and manner of erecting governors, by compact, the neceſſity whereof is clear, many arguments might be deduced. I ſhall reduce them to this form, if people muſt propoſe conditions unto kings to be by them acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Then whenever a tyrant doth break all theſe conditions, which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce accepted, and ſo become, in ſtrict law, no king and the people be, in ſtrict law, liberated from ſubjection to him, they may and muſt defend themſelves, and their fundamental rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, religion and laws, and reſiſt the tyranny overturning them. But the former is true, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sixth. From the nature of magiſtracy, it may be argued thus: That power which is properly neither parental nor merital, nor maſterly and deſpotick over the ſubjects and goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciary, and by way of truſt, is more to be reſiſted than that which is properly ſo. But that power which is properly ſo, that is parental power and marital and maſterly, may be reſiſted in many caſes Therefore that power which is not ſo properly, but only fiduciary, is more to be reſiſted than a king's power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ſubjects, is neither parental nor marital, &amp;c. is moſt clear. The minor is clear, by inſtances. Firſt. If children may in caſe of neceſſity, reſiſt the fury and mad rage of their father, ſeeking to deſtroy them, then muſt private ſubjects reſiſt the rage and tyranny of kings, ſeeking to deſtroy them, and what is dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to them; for there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> true. Ergo, Three. If ſervants may defend themſelves againſt their maſters, then m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

a tyrant or his emiſſaries; but the former is true. Ergo, Four. If the king's power is only fiduciary, and by way of pawn, which he hath got to keep, then when that power is manifeſtly abuſed, to the hurt of them that entruſted him with it, he ought, by all means, to be reſiſted by all thoſe which he undertook to protect; but the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
            <p>Seventh. From the limited power of kings it may be thus argued: If kings be limited by laws and contracts, and may be reſiſted by pleas in law, and have no abſolute power to do and command what they will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but muſt be limited both by the laws of God and man, and cannot make what laws they will, in prejudice of the people's rights, nor execute the laws made according to their pleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor confer on others a lawleſs licenſe to oppreſs whom they pleaſe; then when they turn tyrants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and arrogate a lawleſs abſoluteneſs, and croſs the rules and tranſgreſs the bounds preſcribed by God's laws and man's laws, and made their own luſts a law, and execute the ſame arbitrarily, they muſt be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by force when a legal reſiſtance cannot be had, in defence of religion and liberty. But all kings are limited, &amp;c and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion may be thus confirmed in ſhort: That power which is not the ordinance of God, may be reſiſted; but an abſolute illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power croſſing the rules and tranſgreſſing the bounds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by God's law and man's, is not the ordinance of God, therefore it may be reſiſted.</p>
            <p>Eighth. Further from the rules of government it may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued ſeveral ways. Firſt. That power which is contrary to law, evil and tyrannical, can tie none to ſubjection; but if it oblige to any thing, it ties to reſiſtance. But the power of a king againſt law, religion, and liberty, is a power contrary to law, evil and tyrannical, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The major is plain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or wickedneſs can tie no man but to reſiſt it. That power which is contrary to law, evil and tyrannical is wickedneſs. Second. That power and thoſe acts, which neither king can exerciſe nor command, nor others execute, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt certainly be reſiſted; but ſuch is the power and acts that oppreſs the ſubjects, and overturn religion and liberty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The minor is evident from ſcripture, condemning oppreſſion and violence, both in them that command and in them that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo them that obey ſuch wicked commands. The major is very clear from reaſon, both becauſe ſuch power and ſuch acts as cannot be commanded cannot be executed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obeyed lawfully, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ful and wicked; and becauſe it
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017905_0013_0FA37A52430B0998"/>
cannot be a magiſtratical power, for that may always be exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and executed lawfully; and what a man cannot command, the reſiſting of that he cannot puniſh; but acts of oppreſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt law, religion, and liberty, a man cannot command, ergo the reſiſting of theſe he cannot puniſh. Third. That govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and adminiſtration which is not ſubordinate to the law and will of God, who hath appointed it, muſt be reſiſted. But that government, or adminiſtration, which under mines or overturns religion and liberty, is not ſubordinate to the law and will of God, therefore, &amp;c. The major is clear, for nothing but what is the ordinance of God, ſubordinate to his law and will, is irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Rom. xiii. 2. The aſſumption is undeniable.</p>
            <p>Ninth. From the very end and true deſign of government, which muſt be acknowleged by all to be the glory of God and the good of mankind; yea all that have been either wiſe or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt have always held that the ſafety of the people is the ſupreme law. The argument may run thus in ſhort. Firſt. That doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which makes the holy one to croſs his own ends, in giving governors, muſt be abſurd and unchriſtian, as well as irrational; but ſuch is the doctrine that makes all kings, and tyrants irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon any pretence whatever; which, by the bye, is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y doctrine, ergo the the minor. I prove that doctrine which makes God, intending his own glory, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples good, to give governors both as fathers to preſerve and as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers to deſtroy them, muſt make the holy one to croſs his own ends, for theſe are contradictory; but the doctrine that makes all kings and tyrants irreſiſtable, &amp;c. is ſuch, for by office they are fathers to preſerve, and by office alſo they muſt be murderers, veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a power from God by the firſt act. If they be irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able when they do ſo, ſeeing every power that is irreſiſtable is the ordinance of God. Hence alſo when a bleſſing turns a curſe it is no more the ordinance of God, but to be reſiſted with all our might and ſtrength; but when a king turns a tyrant, overturning religion and liberty, then a bleſſing turns a curſe, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Second. Means are to be reſiſted when they are not uſeful for, but deſtructive to the ends for which they were appointed; but kings overturning religion and liberty, are means not uſeful for, but deſtructive to the ends for which they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Seeing then they are neither for the glory of God nor the good of mankind, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Third. If all powers and prerogatives of men are only means appointed for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhould vail unto the ſupreme law of the peoples ſafety, and all laws be ſubordinate to and corroborative
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017905_0014_0FA37A5303AFB5D8"/>
of this law; and when croſs to it, are in ſo far null, and no laws; and all law formalities in competion with it are to be laid aſide, and all parliamentary priviledes muſt yield to this, and king and parliament, both conſpiring, have no power againſt it; and no ſovereign power, by virtue of any reſignation from the people can comprize any authority to act againſt it; then it is duty to obey the ſupreme law, in reſiſting all powers and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, all laws and law formalities, and all conſpiracies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever againſt this ſupreme law, the ſafety of the people; but the former is true, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourth. That power which is obliged and appointed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and rule juſtly and religiouſly, for the good of the people, and is only ſet over them on theſe conditions, and for that end, cannot tie them to ſubjection, without reſiſtance, when the power is abuſed to the deſtruction of laws, religion, liberty, and people; but all power is ſo appointed and obliged, therefore whenſoever it is ſo abuſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it cannot tie people to ſubjection, but rather oblige them to the rejection of it.</p>
            <p>Tenth. From the obedience required to government it may be argued thus: Firſt. If we may flee from tyrants then we may reſiſt them; but we may flee from tyrants therefore we may reſiſt them. The connexion I prove, Firſt. If all grounds of juſtice will warrant the one as well as the other, then, if the one be duty ſo is the other; but the former is true; for the ſame juſtice and equity that warrants declining a tyrants unjuſt violence by flight, will warrant reſiſtance when flight will not do it; the ſame principle of ſelf defence that makes flight duty, when reſiſtance is not poſſible, will alſo make reſiſtance duty when flight is not poſſible; the ſame principle of charity to wives and children, that makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light lawful when, by reſiſtance, they cannot avoid tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, will make reſiſtance duty when by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light they cannot evita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e it; the ſame principle of conſcience to keep religion free, that prompts to flight when reſiſtance will not ſave it, will alſo prompt to reſiſt it when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light is not practicable. Second. If to flee from a juſt power when, in juſtice we are obnoxious to its ſword, be to reſiſt the ordinance of God, and ſo ſin, then to flee from an unjuſt power muſt be alſo a reſiſting of the abuſing of it, and ſo duty, for the one is reſiſtance as well as the other; but the difference of the power reſiſted makes the one lawful, the other not. Again, if kingly power may be reſiſted, by interpoſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eas, and miles, why not by the ſame rule by interpoſing walls and arms? Both is reſiſtance, for againſt a lawful king or magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate that would be reſiſtance. Third. If a tyrant hath irreſiſtable
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017905_0014_0FA37A5303AFB5D8"/>
power to kill and deſtroy the people, he hath alſo irreſiſtable power to cite and ſummon them before him; and if it be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to reſiſt his murders, it muſt be as unlawful to reſiſt his ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Fourth. For a community of people to flee with wives and children, ſtrong and weak, young and old, to eſcape tyrannical violence, and leave the land, were more unlawful than to reſiſt, Alas! where ſhould or could we of America have fled to have eſcaped the power of tyranny? Therefore it was ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> duty to reſiſt, for what is not poſſible as a natural means of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is not a lawful mean; but this was not a poſſible mean, neither is it warranted in nature's law, or God's word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have God's right, and man's law, to the land, and the rights and liberties thereof, to leave the country and its liberties all into the hands of a tyrant, and his crew. And farther, if it is duty to diſobey, 'tis alſo duty to reſiſt tyrants in defence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and liberty. But it is duty to diſobey them, therefore, &amp;c. The connection only will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck at, which is thus ſtrengthened, if ſubjection be no more preſſed in ſcripture than obedience. Then, if non obedience be duty, non ſubjection muſt be ſo alſo, and conſequently reſiſtance; but ſubjection is no more preſſed in ſcripture than obedience, for all commands of ſubjection, to the higher powers as God's miniſters, under pain of damnation, do only reſpect lawful magiſtrates, and in lawful things, and do include obedience; and non-obedience to the power ſo qualified is a reſiſting of the ordinance of God, as well as non ſubjection. If then obedience to magiſtrates be duty, and non-obedience ſin, and obedience to tyrants ſin, and non obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience duty, then, by parity of reaſon, ſubjection to magiſtrates is duty, and non-ſubjection is ſin; and alſo ſubjection to tyrants is ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and non ſubjection duty.</p>
            <p>Eleventh. From the reſiſtance allowed in all governments, it may be argued thus:—If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be duty to defend our religion, lives and liberties, againſt an invading army of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut throats, Turks, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, &amp;c. without or againſt the king's warrant, then of courſe, it is and muſt be duty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o defend the ſame againſt home b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, except we would ſubſcribe ourſelves home born ſlaves; but the former is true, therefore, &amp;c. The minor cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe the king's power cannot be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ative and deſtructive to defence of our religion, lives, and liberties; nor neither can it take away nature's birth right, to defend th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe or make it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the worſe than if we had no king at all. Now if we had no king at all, we might defend theſe againſt invaders; and whether we have king's or not, we are under moral obligations of the law of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017905_0015_0FA37A53C3AAC820"/>
God to endeavour the defence of theſe. But this need not be inſiſted on; the connexion of the propoſition is clear, if king's be more tyrannical, in invading religion and liberty themſelves, than in ſuffering others to do it, or hindering them to be oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if their invaſion be more tyrannical, hurtful, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, than the invaſion of ſtrangers, then, if it be duty to reſiſt ſtrangers, invading theſe intereſts, it is more duty to reſiſt home bred tyrants invading the ſame; but the former is true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter. Reſiſtance in the one caſe is no more reſiſting the ordinance of God than in the other.</p>
            <p>Twelfth. From the motives of reſiſtance we may draw this argument, which might indeed be branched out into ſeveral; but for brevities ſake, I propoſe to reduce it to this complex one: If when we are in a capacity we cannot acquit ourſelves in the duty that we do owe to our country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ourſelves, and poſterity, and abſolve ourſelves from the ſin and judgment of tyrants, who overturn religion and liberty, oppreſs our countrymen, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſlavery on ourſelves, and intail it upon poſterity, by a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſubjection, ſubmiſſion to, and not oppoſing theſe miſchiefs, then this inſtance is neceſſary; but the former is true, therefore, &amp;c. The connexion is clear, for there cannot be a medium, if we cannot diſcharge theſe duties by ſubjection, ſubmiſſion, and not oppoſing; then, we muſt do them by non ſubjection, non ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and oppoſing, ſince they muſt be done ſome way. The aſſumption is thus confirmed Second. The duties we owe to religion, when it is like to be overturned, which no doubt would have been the caſe had our civil liberties been taken from us, it is, I ſay, in this caſe, our duty to reſiſt tyranny, by making uſe of defenſive arms. This muſt ſurely be as neceſſary as that of our civil liberties, which is an intereſt of our bodies, which is, indeed far inferior, and as neceſſary a duty as to defend our civil liberties from perpetual ſlavery, and as preferable thereunto as Chriſt's intereſts is to man's; and as the true end of all ſelf preſervation is to the means of it, the preſervation of religion being the end of all ſelf preſervation. But this duty cannot be diſcharged without reſiſtance in a mere paſſive ſubjection and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, otherwiſe the ſame might be diſcharged in our univerſal ſubmiſſion to Turks or Indians, coming to deſtroy our religion. Surely this paſſive way of conducting ourſelves cannot anſwer the duty of pleading for truth. Iſa. ix. 4. Seeking the truth. Jer. v. 1. Being valliant for it. Jer. lix. 3. Making up the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edge, ſtanding in the gap, &amp;c. Ezek. xxii. 30. Which yet are really neceſſary and incumbent duties according to our capacity;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017905_0015_0FA37A53C3AAC820"/>
therefore we cannot anſwer the duties we owe to religion, in a mere paſſive way. I ſay farther, the duty we owe to our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and to thoſe of each ſtate, is to aſſiſt and defend them, and relieve them when oppreſſed, which fully and compleatly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the conduct of all thoſe brave officers and men who ſo chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully flew from their ploughs to the ſword, to the relief of our brave, but oppreſſed brethren at Boſton, in the year 1775, as truly we were bound, by all laws of humanity, and of God, to do; and by the royal law of Chriſt, the foundation of all righteouſneſs among men, towards each other. Matt. vii. 12. All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them. Reader, never let this direction ſlip your memory, for ſurely as we would wiſh to have others help us, when we are oppreſſed, ſo ſhould we do to them when it is in the power of our hands to do it, and not forbear to deliver them, for the Lord will require their blood at our hand. Prov. xxiv, 11, 12 But this cannot, by any means, be done by a mere ſubjection without reſiſtance. Third. There is no way to free ourſelves of the ſin and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tyrants, by mere paſſive ſubjection. We find in the ſacred ſcriptures, how that the people of old have been involved and puniſhed for the ſins of tyrants, as the people of Judah for Manaſſeh. 2 Kings xxi. 11. &amp;c. Jer. xv. 4. Whoſe ſins, if they had not been committed, the judgment for them had been prevented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if the people had hindred them, they had not ſmarted, but being jointly included with their rulers in the ſame bond of fidelity to God, and made accountable as joint princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with their kings for that debt, by their mutual as well as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral engagements, to walk in his ways, they were liable to be puniſhed for their rebellion and apoſtacy, becauſe they did not hinder it. Hence I ſay, reſiſtance againſt tyrants and tyranny is right and lawful, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly. This truth is confirmed from the common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the people of God, even under perſecution, from whence I propoſe to draw an argument from ſome notable examples which, to condemn, were impious, and to deny were moſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and, for forms ſake, it may run thus: What the people of God under both teſtaments have frequently done, in time of perſecution, for defending, vindicating, or recovering their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and liberties, may and ought to be done again in the like circumſtances, when theſe are in the like hazard; but under both teſtaments, the people of God frequently, in times of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have defended, vindicated, and recovered their religion and liberties by defenſive arms, reſiſting the ſovereign powers that
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017905_0016_0FA37A54823DAB60"/>
ſought to deſtroy them; therefore this may, and ought to be done again when theſe religious, civil and natural privileges are in the like hazard to be deſtroyed by the violent encroachments of the ſovereign powers. The propoſition cannot be denied, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by all ſuch as are open profeſſed enemies to the people of God, as I take all the enemies to their country really to be. And I am ready to believe that, by an impartial and ſtrict <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, it will be found that the examples of their endeavoured reſiſtance will be little inferior, if not ſuperior, in number and importance to the examples of their ſubmiſſive ſufferings in all ages of the world, which will appear in the probation of the aſſumption by adduction of many inſtances which I ſhall only curſorily glean out of that plentiful harveſt that hiſtories do afford us, both of ancient and modern date.</p>
            <p>Firſt. I need only juſt touch on that moſt well known and famous hiſtory of the Maccabees, of undoubted verity, though not of cannonical authority, in which, according to ſcripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, we have a moſt notable account of many heroick enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, atchievements, and exploits performed by them that knew their God, and tendered his glory and their religion and country's liberties, above the common cate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And have not we of America great reaſon to bleſs God, and to ſtand amazed at the great goodneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, that when the king of Great-Britain, and his venal parliament, was about to deſtroy our civil, and of courſe, our religious liberties, that he raiſed us up a ſecond Matthias, even the great WASHINGTON, as an inſtrument in his hands to ſave this land from ruin and ſlavery; who has, by his great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralſhip, rendered himſelf a world's wonder and a wonder to the world. But nothing is too hard or impoſſible with God, who always fits and furniſhes inſtruments ſuitable to the work he has to do.</p>
            <p>Second. To come down to the hiſtory of the goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, I allow indeed that in the time of the primitive perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, under the heathen emperors, this great and well approved privilege of ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> defence was not much improved or made uſe of by chriſtians, who ſtudied more to play the martyrs than to play the men as chriſtian ſoldiers; becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at that time, the Lord was pleaſed, in his good providence, to ſpirit them up, and call them unto, and accept of their hands paſſive teſtimonies, while they were incorporate under a civil relation with the heathens, in ſubjection to governors, who did not, by open tyranny over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn their civil liberties; but did only endeavour to eradicate religion, which, at that time, had never become their right by law, while they were ſcattered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and out of capacity, and never could come to a ſeparate formed community, by joint concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and correſpondence, to undertake a declared reſiſtance, while religion was only propagating through the nations, and the Lord did providentially preclude the leaſt appearance that might be of propagating of it by any armed and formed force, being the goſpel of peace, deſigned to ſave and not to deſtroy; yet even then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in that caſe, there were inſtances of chriſtians reſiſting their enemies, and reſcuing of their miniſters, &amp;c. as they are found on record. Firſt. How ſome inhabiting Marcota with force reſcued Dionyſius of Alexandria out of the hands of ſuch as were carrying him away, about the year of our Lord 255. Second.

How when a wicked edict was ſent forth to pull down the churches of ſuch as were for the clauſe of one ſubſtance, the chriſtians that maintained that teſtimony reſiſted the bands of ſoldiers that were procured at the emperors command, by Macedonius, to force the Mantinians to embrace the Arian hereſy, but the chriſtians at Mantinium kindled with an earneſt zeal towards the chriſtian religion, went againſt the ſoldiers with chear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

How the people reſiſted alſo the tranſportation of Ambroſe by the command of Valentinian the emperor, and chuſed rather to loſe their lives than to ſuffer their paſtor to be taken away by the ſoldiers.

About the year 894 the Bohemian chriſtians reſiſted Drahomica their Queen, who thought to have deſtroyed them, and to have re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>introduced paganiſm. About the year 1420 they maintained a long defenſive war againſt the government, and the popes legates, under the management of their brave Captain Zizca, which was further proſecuted after him by the remaining Thaborites; and again in the year 1618, they maintained a defenſive war againſt the emperor Ferdinand.

ſuperiors. About the year 1200 they defended themſelves againſt the Popes legate, and his croſſed ſoldiers, under the conduct firſt of the Earl of Beziers, and then of the Earl of Foiſe, and Earl of Remand, of Tholouſe, and where helped by the Engliſh, who then poſſeſſed Guienne, bordering upon Thoulouſe, which reſiſtance continued many years.</p>
            <p>Sixth. In Spain we find the people of Arragon conteſting with Alph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nſus III, and aſſociating themſelves together againſt him; and they tell Pedro III, their king, that if he would not govern by, and according to law, they would purſue him by arms, about the year 1283, as alſo other Spaniards who roſe in arms ſeveral times againſt Pedro, the firſt king of Caſtile.</p>
            <p>Seventh. It was this that brought the Cantons of Helvetia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſtate of freedom, wherein they have continued many years; for about the year 1260, they levied war againſt their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing nobles; and in the year 1308, they joined in covenant to defend themſelves againſt the houſe of Auſtria; and in the year 1315<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they renewed it at Brunna, in which, at length, the reſt of the Cantons joined and formed themſelves into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</p>
            <p>Eighth. If we take a view of the Germans, we will find, at the very commencement of the reformation, as ſoon as they got the name of proteſtants, they reſiſted the emperor Charles V<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Duke of Saxon, the Landgrave of Heſſe, and the city of Maged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, with the advice of lawyers concluded, "that the laws of empire permitted reſiſtance of the emperor, in ſome caſes; that the times were then, ſo dangerous, that the very force of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience did leave them to arms and to make a league to defend themſelves, though Caeſar, or any in his name, ſhould make war againſt them; for ſince he attempteth to root out religion, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert our liberties, he giveth us cauſe enough to reſiſt him with a good conſcience." The matter ſtanding as it doth, we may ſay they reſiſt, as may be ſhewed, both by ſacred and profane hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſo on, the whole they undertook, and ſtated the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon the account of religion and liberty.</p>
            <p>Ninth. If we but caſt an eye over the hiſtory of Holland, we will find how much they are indebted to this practice of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive arms, having thereby recovered both religion and liberty, and eſtabliſhed themſelves into a moſt flouriſhing ſtate; we find even in the time of D. de Alvas's perſecution, they began to defend Haerlem, and Valenciennes in Hainault, and went on till under the conduct of William of Naſſau, Prince of Orange, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the king of Spain to have fallen from the government of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017905_0018_0FA37A5605367130"/>
thoſe countries, and ſo effectually ſhook off the yoke of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
            <p>Tenth. If we turn to the French Hugonots, we will find many inſtances among them, and many brave heroes raiſed up to maintain the principles, and proſecute the practices thereof, of older and later date. The hiſtory of the civil wars of France is ſtored with their trophies, and the memories of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igni will ever be fragrant. There were many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of reſiſtance in thoſe times, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Eleventh. The many practices of the Hungarians, reſiſting the encroachments of the houſe of Auſtria, prove the ſame; and when Matthias denied the free exerciſe of religion unto the proteſtants of Auſtria, they took up arms in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and ſent a proteſtation unto the ſtates of Hungary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring their aſſiſtance agreeable to their league.</p>

               </gap>a, in Poland, as late as the year 1655.</p>
            <p>Thirteenth. The Deans and Swedes have not been ſlack on their parts, in taking courſe with their Chriſtierns, kings of that name, whom they reſiſted and puniſhed, and generally, wherever the reformation was received, we find this principle eſpouſed, and the practice of it proſecuted; nay there hath been no nation in the world but it will be found they have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſiſted or killed tyrants.</p>
            <p>Fourteenth. The moſt deſerving and celebrated monarchs in the world, have eſpouſed the quarrel of oppreſſed ſubjects not only ſuch as Tamerlane, whoſe obſervable ſaying is noted when he advanced againſt Bajazet, I go, (ſays he) to chaſtiſe his tyranny, and to deliver the afflicted people; and Philip and Lewis of France, who aſſiſted the barons of England, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt king John; and Charles the great, who upon this ground undertook a war againſt the Lombards, in Italy. But even Conſtantine the Great hath it recorded, to his great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that he employed his power and force againſt Licinius, upon no other motive but becauſe he baniſhed, tortured, and deſtroyed thoſe chriſtians in his dominions that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their religion. And queen Elizabeth, of glorious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, is to be highly commended for aſſiſting the Dutch to maintain their religion by force, when they could not enjoy it by favour. And king James Firſt did give public aid to the proteſtants in Germany and Bohemia, againſt the emperor;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017905_0019_0FA37A56C31BC6C0"/>
againſt whom alſo Guſtavas Adolphus marched, that he might deliver the oppreſſed cities from the bondage that Ferdinand had brought them into. Yea poor ſilly Charles Firſt pretended, at leaſt, to aſſiſt the proteſtants in France at Ree and Rachel, and though he himſelf was reſiſted by the parliaments of both kingdoms, yet he did declare in his acts of oblivion and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the Scots taking up arms againſt him, in defence of their religion and liberties, to be no treaſon or rebellion. See Apol. Relat. Sect. 11. page 149; and although the late ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Charles Second condemned all the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſings of the people of Scotland for defence of religion and liberty, which his own tyranny forced them into; yet he juſtified the revolt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Mahometan ſubjects, as in the inſtance of the young king of Bantam, when by reaſon of his tyranny his ſubjects revolting and reſiſting of him, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the ſaid Charles Second, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the revolters with ammunition. &amp;c. Indeed many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be adduced which ſhews the righteouſneſs of ſuch reſidances, when the greateſt of kings and queens have undertaken the patroniſing of them.</p>
            <p>Third. From ſcripture proofs, the beſt of all proofs, I ſhall endeavour briefly to gather ſome of the many that might be preſſed, which being put together to me, ſeem impregnable. I ſhall reduce them to theſe heads. Firſt. I ſhall adduce ſome practices of the Lord's people, frequently reiterated, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver condemned, always approved, confirming this point. Second. Some ſevere reprehenſions for their omiſſion of this duty in the ſeaſon thereof. Third. Some promiſes both of ſpiriting for the duty and of countenancing of it when under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Fourth. Some precepts commanding ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>chieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Fifth. Some prayers, ſupplicating for them, all which, put together, I think will make a ſtrong argument, for practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this kind is common in ſcripture hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Firſt. I ſhall begin at the firſt war, which we find recorded in the world, wherein it ſeems the godly at firſt ſuffered ſome, but afterwards, by the virtue and val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

theſe ſubjects to oppoſe that violence; but here is a clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of that in Abraham, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Second. When the Lord's people were poſſeſſed of Canaan, and forgetting the Lord, did enter into affinity with theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted nations, ſome of them were left to prove Iſrael, that the generations of the children of Iſrael might know to teach them war. Judges iii. 1 2. And when they did evil in the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ht of the Lord, he ſold them into the hand of Cuſhan-riſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaim king of Meſopotamia, whom they ſerved and were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to full eight years. Verſe 8. But when they humbled themſelves, and cried unto the Lord, their rebellion, in ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off that yoke, was ſucceſſful under the conduct of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>in king of Canaan, who twenty years mightily oppreſſed them. Judg. iv. 1, 3. But by the Lord's commandment, under the conduct of Deborah and Barak, they rebelled and prevailed. Whence I infer, if the Lord's people, ſerving a haughty tyrant, may ſhake off the yoke of their ſubjection, then it is duty to defend themſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them, for there is no other way of ſhaking it off; but theſe examples prove the former, therefore, &amp;c. Obj. if any ſhould reply, and cavil, and declare theſe were not their own kings, to whom they owed allegiance, but only invading conquerors, whom they might reſiſt, I anſwer, Firſt, Yet they were the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign powers, for the time being, and therefore if the doctrines and principles of both antient and modern to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies be true and good, they ought, upon no pretence whatſoever, to be reſiſted (O! poor ſlaves, that believes ſuch doctrines!) and perhaps by compact, they were not their kings, yet by conqueſt they were, as much as that would make them, and by their own conſent, when they paid them kings due, (viz) tribute. Second, No more are they our kings who attempts to deſtroy charters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> overturn religion, liberty, and law, as the king of Britain and his venal parliament lately did. Witneſs the Boſton charter, &amp;c. I ſay to ſuch we owe no allegiance, no more than Iſrael of old did to thoſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, for tyranny is the ſame in all ages. Third, I retort that old colewort, twice boiled, who ſhould be judge whether they were their own lawful kings or not, for they acted as kings, and thought themſelves their abſolute Lords, and gave themſelves
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017905_0020_0FA37A5783D1E7C0"/>
out to be ſuch; and yet we find an approved rebellion againſt them. Mr. Gee, in his magiſtrates original, Chap 8. Sect. 4. Page 268, improves theſe inſtances to the ſame purpoſe, and adds. "Neither as far as my obſervation goes, can any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate or extraordinary command of word, for what they ſo did, be pretended to or pleaded from the text, for many of them, or for any, ſave Barak or Gideon."</p>
            <p>Third. Yet Gideon's example, though he had an extraordinary call, cannot be pretended as unimo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able on the matter, for that was ordinary, though the call and manner was extraordinary; he, with the aid of a few m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, did break the yoke of ſubjection to Midian. Judg. vi. 7. And having called his brethren out of all Mount Ephraim, into a conjunction with him, in the purſuit of his victory, when he demanded ſupply of the princes of Succoth, and of the men of Penuel, and they denied it, he ſerved them as enemies. Whence I conclude, if a ſmall party may, with God's approbation, deliver themſelves and the whole of their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from the bondage of their oppreſſing maſters, whom they had ſerved ſeveral years, and may puniſh their kings that do not turn out to their aſſiſtance, and encourage them in that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, then muſt it be duty to defend themſelves againſt their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, that rule over them, and all ought to concur in it, or elſe there would not be juſtice in puniſhing them that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in this work; but we ſee the former by this example, therefore, &amp;c. Obj. If it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſaid that Gideon, and the reſt of the extraordinary raiſed judges, were magiſtrates, therefore they might defend and deliver their country, which a private people, that are only ſubjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may not do. I anſwer, Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They were ſubject to thoſe tyrants that oppreſſed them, who were then the ſovereign powers of that time; and yet they ſhook of that yoke be defenſive arms. Second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They were not then magiſtrates when they firſt appeared for their countries defence, and deliverance; neither in that did they act as ſuch, but only as Captains of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in the eſteem of them that had power over them. Juſt ſo has our modern oppreſſors and to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him after the deliverance. See Judg. viii. 22, &amp;c. Yet he did all this before.</p>
            <p>Fourth. When his baſtard Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>melech uſurped the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was made king by the men of Shechem, at length, God ſending an evil ſpirit between him and his complices, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017905_0020_0FA37A5783D1E7C0"/>
which was their brand and bane, in the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, for their aiding at firſt in killing his brethren. Judg. ix. 23, 24. &amp;c. But alſo he was oppoſed by others of the men of Iſrael, as at Thebez, where he was ſlain by a woman. Verſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0, at the end. Whence, if an uſurping tyrant acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged as king by the generality, may be diſowned by the godly, and threatened with God's vengeance to conſume both him and his complices, that comply with him; and if he may be oppoſed and reſiſted, not only by thoſe that ſet him up, but alſo by others that were in ſubjection to him, and at length be killed by them, without reſentment of the reſt of the nation, then moſt it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be duty for a people who had no hand is the ſetting up ſuch a tyrant to defend themſelves againſt his force; but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> former is true by this example, therefore, &amp;c.</p>

Whereupon the people, as reſolute on the other hand to ſave him, reſiſted the rage of Saul, and ſwore as peremptorily that not one hair of his head ſhould fall to the ground; ſo the people reſcued Jonathan that he died not. 1 Sam. xiv. 44, 45. Hence if people may covenant, by oath, to reſiſt the commands and reſcue a man from a tyrant's cruelty, then it is duty to defend themſelves againſt him. The Antecedent is true here.</p>

Here was violent reſiſtance reſolved both againſt the man and his maſter, though the king of the land for the time; and this calling him the ſon of a murderer, and reſiſting of him is no more extraordinary, though it was an extraordinary man's act, than it is ſot a plaintiff to libel a true crime againſt a wicked perſon, and for an oppreſſed man to cloſe the door upon a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.

            <p>Eighteenth. I ſhall now conclude with one inſtance more, which is vindicated by Juſ. Populi, from the hiſtory of Eſther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mordecai refuſed to do homage to a hangman, Haman I ſhould ſay, at that day, now a proud North, a cruel edict was procured from Ahaſuerus to deſtroy all the Jews at that time; now from George III. to deſtroy all the Boſtonians by ſtarving them &amp;c. which was written and ſealed with the king's ring, according to the laws of the Medes and Perſians, becoming a law irrevocable and irreverſable. Eſther iii. 12, 13. Yet the Lord's providence, always propitious to his people, brought it about ſo that Haman being hanged, and Mordecai advanced, the Jews were called and capacitated as well as neceſſitated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that armed authority that decreed to maſſacre them, and that by the king's own allowance. Eſther ix. When his former decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, it was turned to he contrary, that no man could withſtand them. Here they had the allowance of authority to reſiſt authority, and this was not a gift of a new right by that grant, which they had not before, only it was corroborative of the irradical right to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which is not the donative of kings, and which they had power to exerciſe and uſe without this, though may be not the ſame capacity, for the king's warrant could not make it lawful in point of conſcience, if it had not been ſo before. Hence I argue, if people may have the allowance of well adviſed-authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reſiſt the decree and force of unlawful authority, then may people maintain right authority in defending themſelves againſt the injuries of pretended authority; but by this very inſtance we plainly ſee, that the Jews had Ahaſuerus's allowance to reſiſt the decree and force of his own ill-adviſed authority, though irreverſable, and hence we learn, that diſtinction in this point is not groundleſs between reſiſting the authority of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power and the abuſes of the ſame.</p>

where unto was the bondage wherein they were made to ſerve. Hence I argue, that if it be promiſed that a captivated, ſubjugated peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhall break the yoke, and free themſelves of the bondage of them that had them in ſubjection, then it is promiſed, in that caſe, they muſt reſiſt the ſupreme powers for ſuch were they whoſe captives they were.

Hence I argue, that if the Lord promiſes, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to his people, to furniſh them with inſtruments to fray and ſcatter the power of tyrants, who have long bore down their head, then, when they are ſo furniſhed, they may reſiſt them; but the Lord here promiſes that; therefore, &amp;c. This is more plainly promiſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            <p>Fourth. We have alſo precepts from whence we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conclude the approven duty of defenſive arms againſt oppreſſing rulers.</p>
            <p>Firſt. The children of Iſrael are commanded to vex the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites and ſmite them, for, ſaith the Lord, they vex you with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ſes for their magiſtrate to lead them forth, but, in the days of Gideon, when they were under their rule, whom they were to avenge themſelves upon. Hence I argue, if people muſt vex their enemies, and avenge themſelves of them by a war offenſive, much more may they reſiſt them by a war defenſive, when invaded by their cruelty.</p>
            <p>Second. There is a command to puniſh every city or party, making apoſtacy unto idolatry. Deut. xiii. 12, 15. upon this moral ground was Iſrael's war againſt Benjamin. Judges xx. and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ir bringing Amaziah unto cordign puniſhment, which is vindicated by Mr. Knox. Hence I argue, if people are to bring to condign puniſhment idolatrous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> much more ought they to reſiſt all tyrants, ſeeking to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Third. There is a precept not only to defend, but alſo, to reſcue and deliver our brethren when in Hazard. Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Fourth. All thoſe that would learn to do well are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Iſa. i. 17. to relieve the oppreſſed; which is not ſpoken to kings only, many of whom were the oppreſſors. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were rebellious and companions of thieves, Verſe 23. So alſo, Iſa. lviii. 6. It is required of a people that would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God in their humiliations, to let the oppreſſed go free, and to break every yoke. Hence I argue, if it be duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the oppreſſed, by breaking the yoke of them that oppreſs them, then it is duty to defend them and ourſelves, both againſt them that would oppreſs us more. But the former is here commanded, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fifth. There is a command for a ſpoiled oppreſſed people, when the Lord is reconciled to them, and ſympathizes with them, to deliver themſelves from their rulers ſervitude. Zech. ii. 7. Deliver thy ſelf O Zion, which dwelleth with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Babylon. Which comprehends all the ordinary active means of people's delivering themſelves from oppreſſing powers that rule over them; and conſequently defenſive reſiſtance, for it cannot only be reſtricted to flight, included verſe 6. the promiſe annexed verſe 9 imports more, when they that ſpoiled them, ſhall be a ſpoil to their ſervants. Whereby it is infinuated they were ſo to deliver themſelves as not only to free themſelves from their ſervitude, but to bring their maſters under ſubjection. Hence I argue, if the Lord's people being ſubject to tyrants ruling over them for the time, may deliver themſelves from their oppreſſing maſters, then may they reſiſt them, and defend themſelves, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sixth. There is a command given by the bleſſed Jeſus to his diſciples, to provide themſelves with weapons for their defence againſt them that ſhould attempt their lives, as well as with other things neceſſary for their ſuſtenance. Luke xxii. 36. Now he that hath a purſe, let him take it, and likewiſe his ſcrip; and he that hath no ſword, let him ſell his garment and buy one. Before, when he had ſent them out upon an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary commiſſion, as it were to ſerve their apprenticeſhip in the work of the goſpel, he did not allow them ſuch ſolicitous care to provide themſelves, becauſe he would give them a proof of his ſufficiency to ſuſtain and protect them without the ordinary means of their own diligence; but now, when he was about to withdraw his bodily preſence from them, and would warn them of the many diſcouragements they were to look for in the proſecution of their more continued work, which they had a commiſſion for, not to be retracted, he would not
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:017905_0026_0FA37A5C0307C990"/>
have them expect proviſion and protection by a courſe of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but to provide themſelves with means for their ſuſtenance, and alſo for their defence againſt the violence of men, which chiefly was to be expected from their rulers, who would perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them under the notion of tranſgreſſors of the laws of the kingdoms and countries. He was not, indeed, to make much uſe of them at that time for himſelf, who was then to finiſh the work of redemption by ſuffering, only that what was written might be accompliſhed in him, he would make ſo much uſe of them as voluntarily to be involved under the cenſure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of rebellion, being taken among men in arms, that he might be reckoned among tranſgreſſors. Verſe 37. Therefore when they told him they had two ſwords, he ſaid it is enough. Verſe 38. I think I need not ſtand long here to confute that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency of a conceit that theſe were ſpiritual ſwords, which indeed deſerves no confutation, being fitter to be put among the many delicious deſtractions, and other errors of Quakers, than to be numbered among the notions of men of common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Indeed I could hardly be brought to believe they did hold ſuch an error, if I had not been informed by a perſon of credit, who aſſured me he had it from the mouth of one of their ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or teachers. O horrid blaſphemy! Purchaſe the ſpirit of God, or the ſword of the ſpirit, or a ſpiritual ſword, with the price of an old garment. Surely if this was true, then the purſe and ſcrip muſt be ſpiritual too, and theſe bought by ſelling of old garments; and yet they would be ſuch ſpiritual ſwords as would cut off carnal ears, and ſuch as would be both viſible and ſenſible, and two of them would be enough. But it does not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a doubt, but what they were ordinary and material ſwords, which the Lord did command his followers to provide themſelves with for their defence as men, in caſes of neceſſity, and when they ſhould be in a capacity to improve them againſt their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering perſecutors, againſt whom he gives his royal grant of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that the world may know his ſubjects, though they have more privileges ſpiritual, yet they have no leſs human privileges than other men, although at that period of his determined ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he would not allow the preſent uſe of them. From hence I argue, that if the Lord's people ſhould provide themſelves with arms of defence, though they ſhould, by a wicked world, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſinners and the greateſt of tranſgreſſors for ſo doing, then ſurely they may uſe theſe arms of defence againſt them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them; therefore &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fifth. We may infer the ſame truth from ſome of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:017905_0026_0FA37A5C0307C990"/>
of the ſaints, wherein they glory in the conſtant expectation of the Lord's ſtrengthening them, and favouring and approving their helpers, and in the experience of the Lord's aſſiſting them, while in the mean time conſtitute in a formed appearance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. I ſhall only hint theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt. In that prayer, Pſal. xliv. 5. They glory in hope, that through the Lord they will puſh down their enemies, &amp;c. Yet then at that time they were under the power of tyrants, which they were reſiſting, for Verſe 9. They complain they were put to ſhame, becauſe the Lord went not forth with their armies, and they which hated them ſpoiled them; and for his ſake were killed all day long. Hence they plead, that the Lord would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and not forget their affliction and oppreſſion; whereby it is evident, they were under the yoke of tyrants, and reſiſting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their might; which, by whomſoever or upon what occaſion ſoever, the pſalm was compiled, ſhews that no want of ſucceſs in reſiſting tyrants can mar the ſaints faith in pleading for the Lord's aſſiſtance and approbation of the duty. Hence I argue, that if they that in faith may pray for and boaſt of their treading down their enemies, that riſe like tyrants up againſt them, they may alſo in faith attempt the reſiſting them in their own defence. But here the Lord's people did the former; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Second. We find David, under Saul's perſecution, while h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had a party of 600 men to defend himſelf againſt his rage, in the pſalms which he compoſed upon that occaſion, not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of oppreſſors, but encouraging himſelf in the faith that God would be with them that aſſiſted him in his attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, and imprecating deſtruction to Saul and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices. That the Lord would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut them off in his truth and let him ſee his deſire upon them. Pſal. liv. 4, 5. laſt verſe, and Pſal. lvii, 4. and Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lvii throughout, and Pſal. cxl. 7, 9. He imprecates againſt the head of them that compaſſed him about, and of courſe againſt Saul. Whence I argue, Firſt. If the Lord's people, conflicting with and encompaſſed with oppreſſing rulers, as ſo many lions and dogs, may pray and praiſe for the help of thoſe that aſſiſt them in their endeavours of ſelf-preſervation from them, then may they make uſe of their help for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for which they pray and praiſe. But here we ſee the Lord's people did the former; therefore they may and ought to do the latter.</p>
            <p>Second. If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> may pray againſt kings, and for preſervation from them, then may we defend ourſelves againſt them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:017905_0027_0FA37A5CC3C25B48"/>
the means of that preſervation for which we pray? The connection is before cleared, yet here I add, that which will give a diſpenſation from our duty of praying for them, will alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe from the duty of being paſſively ſubject to their will, and conſequently will allow the defending ourſelves from their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And here we ſee tyranny and treachery, and deſigned miſchief, will give a diſpenſation from our duty of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aying for them, altho' that be duty as indiſpenſible a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſubjection. Again if any thing deter us from reſiſting of kings, it muſt be reſpect to their majeſty and the character of the Lord's anointing upon them. But we ſee no reſpect to that will deter a believer from praying in faith againſt them, therefore no ſuch reſpect will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that he may defend himſelf againſt his violence; and indeed, if we do but conſider it right, if the impreſſion of any majeſty God hath put upon kings, ſhould tie up our hands from any reſiſtance, it will alſo reſtrain from prayer reſiſtance; for if that impreſſion have any force at any time, it muſt be when a man is moſt ſolemnly ſtated before God, and ſpeaking to God as a chriſtian, rather than when he is acting as a man with a man like himſelf; and as prayer reſiſtance is the moſt formidable and forceable reſiſtance of any in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as this Saul, and our la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e George, and many other tyrants have found, by their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience, ſo it is more reſtricted than other reſiſtance, for we may defend ourſelves againſt many whom we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not pray againſt, to wit, our private <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, for whom we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pray; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no body will deny but we may reſiſt their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and likewiſe, we are commanded to pray for kings, when inveſted with God's authority; but when, by their degeneration, we are looſed from that obligation to pray for them, and allows us to pray againſt them, when they turn enemies to God, and oppreſſors of his people, as we ſee in the prayer of the Pſalmiſt, then may we moſt warrantably reſiſt them by defenſive arms.</p>
            <p>Third and laſtly. Among the hallelujahs in the end of Pſalms, there is one calculated for the prevailing time of the church, when the Lord ſhall take pleaſure in his people. In that time of the ſaints being joyful in glory, when they may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the reſt and ſecurity the Lord will vouchſafe upon them, they are prophetically, and very pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hetically, excited to praiſe prayer wiſe. Pſal. cxlix. 6. To the end let the high praiſes of God be in their mouth, and a two edged ſword in their hand to bind their kings with chains, to execute upon them the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment written. This honour have all the ſaints, hallelujah. This was their praiſe and honour when they were brought on to execute vengeance on their kings and nobles of Canaan; this
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:017905_0027_0FA37A5CC3C25B48"/>
alſo in David's time was the ambition and alſo the attainment of the ſaints in their triumphant victories over many of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors round about them. But it looks to a further and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous executio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of vengeance upon the tyrants of the world, when they have long kept under the church of God, and at length, the Lord ſhall give his people a capacity to break their yoke, which, whenever it ſhall be, ſhall be then great honour. Hence I argue laſtly, if it will be the honour of the ſaints, when the Lord puts them in capacity to execute vengeance upon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, though they be kings, nobles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. that oppreſs them, then it may be their ambition to ſeek it; at leaſt they may reſiſt them. Thus I think I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhewn from the law of God, the law of nature, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            <head>A ſhort Receipt for a Continental Diſeaſe, The name whereof is the love of Money.</head>
            <p>THE holy ſcriptures informs us, that the love of money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the root of all evil. And this our daily experience doth alſo make manifeſt. It drives people into the commiſſion of all evil, to the ruin of themſelves and others. How are people dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtreſſing each other in ſueing and tearing each other limb from limb, in order to handle a little of this traſh, a world of which will not purchaſe a ſpark of grace, nor one inch of time, when on a death bed. Paying no regard to the diſtreſs of the times, nor to the cries of the poor, the needy, widow, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs children. Perhaps ſuch whoſe fathers have fought, bled, and died by our ſides, nobly fighting in our glorious cauſe. How doleful the thought, that we who have ſo nobly joined hand in hand to defeat Britiſh cruelty and oppreſſion, ſhould now devour one another? Which is daily practicing. I ſhall now give a word of advice to creditors and debtors, which I ſhall divide into two claſſes. Firſt publick creditors and debtors. Secondly private ditto. Publick creditors is our rulers and governors, who have a right, for our good and ſafety, to demand taxes from us. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, let me beg of you to be as ſparing in your demands as poſſible. You are not unſenſible that the times are hard, and caſh ſcarce. Endeavour to give ſatisfaction to the commonalty, that what they pay in taxes is faithfully applied to the uſes it were paid for. The money is the people's to pay and yours to apply, which ought to be done with the greateſt oeconomy. Let no one get rich that handles publick money. I think I have once read of a great general that had ſerved his country long and faithfully, when he car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to die all he could call his own was his diſh and ſpoon, and was buried by charity. A rare inſtance indeed, but a noble one. He prefered the publick's intereſt to his own.</p>
            <p>You, my countrymen, publick debtors. Gentlemen, pleaſe to conſider that no war can be carried on, no government kept up, without taxes, and hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ones too; and conſider what a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you would ſoon be in, if there was no government. Could you ſleep one night in peace? Could yo call any thing your own one day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore if you are wiſe you will moſt chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully part with ſome of your wealth to ſecure the reſt; for I am confident he is an enemy to himſelf and country too, that is back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:017905_0028_0FA37A5D83B70CC0"/>
in paying his taxes. Conſider that it is not for us common people to be led into all the ſecrets of government. Surely we muſt believe that thoſe which we have truſted at the helm of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs does know beſt what ſums is neceſſary to be raiſed from us for our good and protection; and I think we may reſt aſſured that our legiſlature will not lay any needleſs bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thens upon us; for my own part, I have that confidence in them that I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to pay my taxes as long as I have a copper left, or can raiſe it; for I am ſure if the enemy ſhould overcome, or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fails, I am gone finally.</p>
            <p>You gentlemen that may be called private creditors, let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of you to make uſe of every method to come at your rights and money, beſides law. If it is a matter of diſpute ſubmit it to reference. If it is clear debt, exerciſe patience, bear and forbear with your poor debtors. Let nothing but the utmoſt neceſſity, let me ſay extremity, drive you to diſtreſs mankind at this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day. Cauſe not the cries of the poor and needy widow, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and orphan children, to aſcend up to Heaven againſt you for diſtreſſing them in order to obtain ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to lay out in toys, to adorn your and families bodies with. Remember, O remember, a judgment day to come.</p>
            <p>And now to you gentlemen debtors. I would have you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoſe ſcripture ſayings owe no man any thing, pay to all their dues. See that you pay to all their juſt dues, as faſt as poſſible. If you have not caſh turn out any thing you can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſpare; yea, offer all you have to your creditors; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they are chriſtians, and endowed with humane hearts, if they ſee you thus willing to diſtreſs yourſelves to pay them, they will nobly refuſe it and grant you longer day. Uſe them well, give them good language, and if poſſible deceive them not. Practice induſtry and good oeconomy, for a creditor has hawk's eyes; and do not love to ſee their debtors ſtruting about in fine rigging at their expence. Above all, remember the golden rule, do to all men as you would have them do to you again.</p>
