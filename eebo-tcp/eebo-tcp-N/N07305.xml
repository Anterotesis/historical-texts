            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE Obſervations I think are undeniable in themſelves, and are alſo as worthy of Notice now, as then; which was one Cauſe of my ſetting of them down here; and another was, becauſe of what I have heard and ſeen of late.</p>

Nay, the Caſe is ſo clear, that I ſhould not be affraid to defy all Men to ſhew fuller Proofs of that's being the Work of God's Spirit which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed then in the Land, than have appeared among us in the Year paſt; unleſs they think this to be ſo, <hi>to wit.</hi> That the Inſtruments and Subjects of that Work were more accounted of in the World than theſe now; and if that be the Caſe, then I would only deſire ſuch to look back again upon the <hi>Jews'</hi> Conduct towards CHRIST, and take Warning.</p>

            <p>AGAIN, 'tis generally held that all Saints are imperfect in this Life; and yet, if a Perſon who has profeſt to have the In-dwelling of the Holy Spirit, happens to have his Judgment altered afterwards in any Point in Religion, I have heard that Promiſe, <hi>The Spirit of Truth will guide you into all Truth</hi>

this Head, let me obſerve, that there is one Sort of People who ſtrangely think themſelves free of this Charge, of ſaying one Thing and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing another, becauſe they don't profeſs Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at all. They will exclaim at a high Rate againſt the Hypocriſy of Profeſſors, and declare that they would not be guilty of mocking GOD as they do, upon no Account. Now here ſeems to be an Acknowledgment of the Divine Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, and a Regard to Uprightneſs before him; and yet, at the ſame Time, they don't ſo much as pretend to regard his Authority, nor ſubmit to his Government. Thus a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Regard to GOD, makes them diſregard him; and while they explode Deceit and Self-Righteouſneſs, ſadly diſcover Marks of both: For while the <hi>Phariſee</hi> tells of his Faſtings and Performances, theſe boaſt of their honeſt Hearts, and I believe many of them depend as much upon their <hi>Honeſty,</hi> as others do upon their <hi>Duties.</hi> But are they really honeſt? They ſay they abhor Self-Righteouſneſs, and it ſeems that they would not pretend to pray to GOD, becauſe their Prayers would not be acceptable; that is, they will not come to him, becauſe they find no Good in themſelves to bring. What amazing Things are here! Here are Men that would not mock GOD, and yet live in open Contempt of his Service; they ſay they have honeſt Hearts, but will not ſo much as confeſs their Iniquities to him, whom they have provoked, nor ſeek his Mercy. O Heaven-daring Madneſs!</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:009330_0026_1030EDE241656FE8"/>THUS it appears, that Men are ſo far from avoiding Inconſiſtences, by diſregarding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that they involve themſelves the deeper in Confuſion and Guilt, and run in the high Road to eternal Ruin; while Profeſſors are far from being excuſable, in not practiſing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Profeſſion. But one Way of Peace and Happineſs therefore remains, which is to fly to the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>purge our Conſciences from dead Works,</hi> that we may <hi>ſerve the living God</hi>

            <p>BEFORE I conclude, I would ſet down a few Words of Advice, to my own Soul as well as others, which if rightly regarded, will afford much Help againſt the Evils mainly ſpoken of in this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. LET us meditate much upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of GOD, eſpecially his Omniſcience and Omnipreſence; that he fills all Places, and ſees all Things. A realizing View hereof, will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully guard the Soul againſt all Deceit, as well as other Vices. When <hi>David</hi> had been devoutly contemplating upon theſe Things, it led him to renounce the Ways of wicked Men, and to cry to GOD to <hi>ſearch</hi> his Heart and Thoughts, and ſee if there was any Way of Wickedneſs in him, <hi>and lead him in the Way everlaſting</hi>

LET us often review our Ways, and compare our Profeſſion and Practice together; and endeavour to ſet ourſelves as Spectators, critically to obſerve how our Conduct may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to others. But becauſe Self is ſo apt to blind us; therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3d. LET us prize and improve the faithful Reproofs of our Fellow-Chriſtians. When the Man after GOD'S own Heart, had been crying to the Lord, that his Lips and Heart might be kept from wicked Works, as believing Prayer engages the Soul to wait for an Anſwer, in the Way of uſing the beſt Means to obtain the Thing requeſted; ſo he names this as a great Help in the Caſe, <hi>viz. Let the Righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a Kindneſs; and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent Oil which ſhall not break my Head</hi>
