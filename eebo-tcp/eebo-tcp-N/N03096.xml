            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Erhaps the Reader unacquainted with the Perſon who ſends theſe few Lines to our <hi>Young People</hi>; will deſire ſome Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning her &amp; her Circumſtances; they being very peculiar and uncommon: I ſhall in Anſwer to the Requeſt of divers of her near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, give the Reader an Account of the ſame, as followeth: <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THis Young Woman (which I think I may without Vanity call a <hi>Young Saint</hi>) is the Daughter of Mr. <hi>Iſaac Wheeler</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, originally of <hi>Concord</hi> in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay in N. E. who with their Family removed from thence unto the Town of <hi>Plainfield</hi> in <hi>Connecticut</hi> in the Year 1704, and it has pleaſed GOD to bleſs theſe Parents with a numerous Off-ſpring, three Sons and ten Daughters; of which ten our young Author is the fourth; being born in the Year 1706: was a Child very remarkable for Health and Agillity of Body, until the Twentieth Year of her Age; and then was taken Sick of the burning Ague in the latter end of the Summer 1726, and hath never ſince enjoyed one Days health; ſhe was in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer following brought ſo low, as that ſhe was wholly Confin'd to her Bed, (which Confinement continues to this Day) and reduced to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding low Circumſtances, as that every Day, for many Days and Months together, was expected by all about her, would have been her laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003732_0002_1002037061477C48"/>Her Strength was ſo intirely gone as ſhe could not move her Head, Hand or Foot ſo as to help her ſelf in the leaſt; and her Speech wholly failed; ſo that ſhe has not been able to ſpeak by whiſpering ſo as to be heard by any, but thoſe of the Family, much uſed to her; and they gueſſing more by the motion of her Lips than by any Voice which could be heard. Her Fleſh is much conſumed: Her Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to Food is ſo gone, that it is admirable to think how ſhe has been ſuſtained; her digeſtive Faculty ſo weak, that ſhe has not been able to Eat either Bread of Fleſh of any ſort, for the ſpace of Five Years and more; ſupported only (as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means) by ſome thin, liquid Food, put into her Mouth with a Spoon; who will ſay but that the Power and Goodneſs of GOD is very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable in ſuſtaining her ſo long time by ſuch ſlender and inconſiderable Means.</p>
            <p>No Care or Coſt, has been wanting on her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; Phyſicians far and near, have been conſulted and improved (to great Expence) for her. Nor have her Parents neglected to ſeek to GOD for a Bleſſing on their Endeavours of this Nature: Divers Days of Faſting and Prayer have been attended in her Father's Houſe, with the Aſſiſtance of the Paſtor of the Church here, and other chriſtian Friends, and alſo the Paſtors of divers of the neighbouring Churches; and ſeveral Sermons adapted to the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, have been Preacht in her hearing; which by the Lines ſhe now ſends abroad (I believe) you will think GOD has Sanctified to her for ſaving good. For I think, Reader, if you ſhall want Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for her, you fall under another great Want, and want the one thing needful for your ſelf.</p>
            <p>She ſtill remains weak and low, but (thanks be to GOD) ſhe is under ſome revivings. Moſt
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003732_0003_100252F453BFD8E0"/>remarkably the laſt <hi>April</hi> it pleaſed GOD to open her Lips and <hi>her Mouth doth ſhew forth his Praiſe</hi>: ſhe was on a ſudden enabled to ſpeak with a Voice ſo loud as to be heard into another Room in the Houſe, to the ſurprize of the whole Family; this reviving, and power of Speech ſhe ſeems great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with, and bleſſes GOD for the ſame; it being an Anſwer of her requeſt to GOD that ſo ſhe might declare what He had done for her Soul; and alſo apply her ſelf to <hi>Young People</hi> as in the following pages.</p>
            <p>I think indeed ſhe ſeems to be under the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Impreſſions of the Spirit of GOD, and touch'd with a ſence of the prevailing Sins of the preſent Times, laments the decay of the Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongſt us.</p>
            <p>In one of my laſt Conferences with her, I could not but take peculiar Notice of a ſad ſurprize ſhe ſeemed to be in from her being informed of ſome Families which lived in the Neglect of <hi>Family Prayer</hi>; ſo affected was ſhe in her Meditation on it, that ſhe verſify'd upon it; and rehearſt to me ſeveral of the Verſes ſhe had compoſed: one of which I will here Record; hoping that it may jog ſome of 'em that ly ſnoaring in ſuch a ſhameful Omiſſion; and it runs after this manner,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Poor, wretched and vile Sinners all</l>
               <l>Rank'd with the heathen Nation,</l>
               <l>Who unto GOD ne'er Pray nor Call,</l>
               <l>For Pardon and Salvation.</l>
            </q>
            <p>(<hi>I'll add another and ſay,</hi>)</p>
            <l>What dreadful Threats, O direful Wrath!</l>
            <l>Such Families fall under,</l>
            <l>Who will tread that forbidden Path</l>
            <l>Full ſhow'd with Bolts of Thunder.</l>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:003732_0003_100252F453BFD8E0"/>You'l find in her Addreſs to young People, a Caution againſt ſuch vile Omiſſions.</p>
            <p>God grant that the ſame bleſſed SPIRIT which influenced her in ſuch manner to apply her ſelf to our <hi>young People</hi>; may alſo influence us all, young and old, to make an agreeable Improvement of the ſame!</p>
            <p>The Reader acquainted with ſacred Writ, will remember, that it is intimated to us by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in his Parable concerning the <hi>rich Man</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that the doleful Inhabitants of the Place of Torment, do imagine, that <hi>if one were ſent</hi> to their Fellow Sinners on Earth <hi>from the Dead they would repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold here we have Warning given to our young People; which may in ſome ſenſe be called <hi>Warning from the Dead</hi>: tho' not abſolutely ſo, yet the Perſon who gives it, has been numbered among the Dead, in our Expectation, for a long Time, until now ſhe experiences what we may call, a <hi>ſort of Reſurrection.</hi> The Inſtance we have in her, is very uncommon, and I think what ſhe now offers is worthy of Obſervation from us all.</p>
            <p>I will but add one word by way of <hi>Apology</hi> for my ſelf, in preſuming to gratify her, in granting her the uſe of my Pen; poſſibly ſome among our young People may have arrived to that height of Profanity as to make a Ridicule and a Scoff at what I have here performed; to ſuch I anſwer in ſhort, I value not their Scoff a ruſh, only would ſay to ſuch, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the Jailer, <hi>Do thy ſelf no harm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps the Aged, Sober &amp; judicious Reader will admire at my preſumption herein; to ſuch I would with all imaginable Humility ſay, I am ready to admire with you too: But when I was ſo oft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:003732_0004_100252F6C8EBA160"/>to it not only by the Young Author, but divers others; and ſeriouſly conſidered the Matter, I dare not deny to undertake the Task, leaſt I ſhould render my ſelf to my fellow Creatures more churliſh than the <hi>unjuſt Judge,</hi> who <hi>neither fear'd GOD nor regarded Man.</hi> Or leaſt I ſhould hide my one poor Talent in a Napkin, when I ſhould have improved it for my Lord's uſe.</p>
            <p>I hope I can truly ſay, I have been much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the Intereſt of Religion among us; and tho'tful what I in particular may do that may any way tend to revive the too, too viſible Decays of it: When this Invitation was urged upon me, I dare not wholly reject it, leaſt I ſhould let ſlip an Opportunity of being ſome way ſerviceable to the Intereſt of Religion, and the good of Souls.</p>
            <p>And this is the grand prevailing Motive with me; the Hope I have that GOD who has ſo deeply Impre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> her Mind by His Holy Spirit, has alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to make what is by the young Female-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor offer'd, of ſaving Advantage (at leaſt) to ſome Souls. And if ſo what I have done by the Power and Goodneſs of GOD ſhall be made an Offering to the Tabernacle, tho' performed by him, who is an unworthy Servant for the Table of the Lord.</p>

            <head>AN Addreſs to young People, BY <hi>Mercy Wheeler</hi> Of <hi>Plainfield, June 8. 1732.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y dear Friends, Relatives &amp; Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> who are now in your Youth, and come to that Time of Life, which is called the Flower of the Age. It is well known to many of you, that the great and ſovereign Jehovah, who doth whatſoever He pleaſeth in Heaven, Earth, Sea and all deep Places, hath been very ſignal and remarkable in his diſpenſations towards me.</p>
            <p>He has laid me upon a Bed of Languiſhing, for the Space of more than Five Years paſt already, the greateſt part of which time I have been reduced to ſuch low Circumſtances that I have not been able to ſpeak with an audible Voice: until now of late it hath pleaſed GOD of his abundant good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to grant me ſuch reviving, as to be able to ſpeak with an audible, tho' a low Voice.</p>
            <p>And now GOD has given me ability, I think it my Duty to you O young People, to addreſs my ſelf to you, by way of Adviſe, Counſel &amp; Caution: to you which are near to me in the bonds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in an eſpecial manner; yea and to all the whole Neighbourhood, and whomſoever are or ſhall be acquainted with my Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>O <hi>young People</hi>! you that are of my own Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; who are in the Prime and Flower of your Days, I muſt tell you that I think you have in me, I mean in what GOD has done unto me, a very
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003732_0005_100252F935BAE200"/>loud Lecture preach'd to you: and O that you, all of you may be ſuch Perſons of Wiſdom as to hear the rod and Him that hath appointed it!</p>
            <p>Remember! Oh young People, remember that Childhood and Youth is Vanity. What ſhall I ſay to you to perſwade you to be ſerious? How ſhall I order my Speech to you, ſo as to prevail with you to hearken to me now, that ſo GOD may hearken to you another Day?</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you, that tho' Youth be indeed the Flower of the Age, yet it is the moſt dangerous Seaſon of the Mind. I have found it ſo, and you will ſee it to be ſo ere-long, when your Eyes are open to ſee things as indeed they are.</p>
            <p>My adviſe to you is, Oh labour to ſee &amp; appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend your danger; leaſt you fall into fooliſh and hurtful Luſts which drown Men and Women in Deſtruction and Perdition.</p>
            <p>O flee youthful Luſts, beware, be warned by the Harms and Falls of others, remember Death is haſtening; it is appointed for Man once to Die, and after that the Judgment.</p>
            <p>Remember me, you that know me, and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with me: O how ſuddenly has GOD blaſted my youthful Vigour, and lay'd me upon a Bed of pining Sickneſs to this Day. In the Spring of my Days, or before the Spring was fully advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, it is become Autumn with me; the Leaves fall apace, as if the Winter of Death were juſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, that I may ſay with ſick <hi>Hezekiah, I am deprived of the reſidue of my Days, and ſhall ſee Man no more, with the Inhabitants of the World.</hi> And how ſoon it may be your Caſe you know not; nor are you ſure (if GOD ſhall give ſo much Warning, and not ſnatch you away by ſome ſudden accidental and violent Death) that GOD will afford to you the Mercy He hath vouchſafed to me; it may be you may be deprived of the Uſe of your

O my friends, believe me, believe me, the Time of Health is the very beſt Time for you to prepare for Death in.</p>
            <p>I deny not but that GOD doth ſometimes mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his ſovereign Grace to Sinners; by ſanctifying long and tedious Sickneſs for ſaving Good to their Souls, I hope he has done it for me (and I adore his Grace for ever on the Account whereof. But I muſt tell you, it was indeed hard Work to bear the Pains of Body, which my diſeaſe laid me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and at the ſame: Time to grapple with the wracking Terrors of a wounded Spirit which indeed who can bear. And I do ſadly, and greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my Sin and Folly in neglecting to improve my Health, while GOD was pleaſed to afford it to me: and ſo will you if you neglect to improve yours.</p>
            <p>The beſt that you can poſſibly imagine (if you continue to delay to make your Peace with GOD now in the time of Health and Proſperity) is, I ſay, the beſt you can poſſibly imagine is, you make ſad Work for a moſt bitter Repentance here-after.</p>
            <p>And if this be the beſt you can poſſibly Hope for, (and that at the utmoſt Hazard too,) What may the Worſt be, if GOD in Juſtice ſay, becauſe <hi>I have called and ye have refuſed, therefore I will laugh at your Calamity, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>One Arrow more I muſt draw out of the divine Quiver, and it ſhall be that moſt important Queſtion propounded to us by the Redeemer himſelf, a much greater than King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſpake as never Man ſpake: Which grand Inquiry of his we have in the Goſpel of S.

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003732_0007_100252FC4ABD5038"/>bleſſed Name, which I cannot mention but with Reverence and Adoration, admiring the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Riches of divine Wiſdom and Grace, that ever there ſhould be ſuch a Name <hi>given under Heaven among Men whereby we may be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brings me again to what I told you before is all my Deſire concerning you: that a part in this great Saviour, &amp; the great Salvation procured by Him for us Sinners, may be your Portion: Let me urge it upon you to labour to obtain it, with all your might; delay not; dallie not; trifle not in this moſt great and important Buſineſs. I know not how to leave off urging you, or let you go, till you cry out, <hi>None but Chriſt, None but Chriſt</hi>! and I hear you ſay, Give me Chriſt, or elſe I die.</p>
            <p>Are you deſirous of a Chriſt? Do you ſee your periſhing Condition without him, and that a part in him is abſolutely neceſſary for you? My Advice to you all is this:</p>
            <p>O prize the Goſpel, and Goſpel Ordinances. O my Friends, I long to enjoy Publick Ordinances; I think I deſire Health for nothing more, than to be able to come to the Publick Ordinances of GOD's Houſe; eſpecially that I may Commemorate the Dying Love of my Redeemer in that High and Holy Ordinance of the Supper: To come to that Goſpel Feaſt; which if GOD in his ſovereignty ſhall deny me ability for, I hope he will accept the Will for the Deed: As for you that are in Health prize and improve it, it is the ordinary Means of Salvation. O have a care you do not put a ſlight upon the Goſpel diſpenſation of the Word of Life; and beware you do not entertain any prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any clear Goſpel Truths; or againſt any of the faithful diſpenſers of the ſame. Mind well what the great King &amp; Saviour of the Church hath with his own Mouth ſaid in this Matter, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me,</hi> &amp;c. What a dreadful thing is it to deſpiſe Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003732_0008_100252FE0914D440"/>Go as conſtantly as you can to hear what GOD will ſpeak to you; don't ſuffer Trifles to divert you; let not a little Cold, wet or dull Weather, keep you at Home, when you are in Health; and may go to the Houſe of GOD, if you will.</p>
            <p>And don't neglect private, or ſecret Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for Communion with GOD: Make Conſcience of ſecret Prayer daily; and attend conſtantly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Worſhip you that have the Advantage of it.</p>
            <p>And Oh, let no young Couple come together in Marriage, and dare to live in the horrible Omiſſion of Family Prayer. I am amazed to think that ever ſuch Goſpellers as we in <hi>New-England</hi> are, ſhould any of us dare to live without Family Prayer. What ſays Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> of ſuch Houſes?
<q>The roaring Lion (ſays he) doth ramp and rage there without controul:</q>
And how doth the weeping Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> imprecate the divine Vengeance, on ſuch ſuch Familys, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.25. Yea how doth GOD himſelf threaten them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I will pour out my Fury upon the Heathen that know me not, and on the Families that call not upon my Name.</hi> Oh let none indulge themſelves in ſuch a fearful Omiſſion. Oh young People! I could fill my Mouth with Arguments to perſwade you to become truly pious; Fear of Evil on the one Hand; and hope and expectation of Good on the other, are two great ſwaying Conſiderations with rational Agents: I have already ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the great Danger of Delays.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now add a Word as to the <hi>great Good</hi> that will acrue to you, if you will now comply and in good earneſt ſet your ſelves to ſeek and ſerve God with perfect Hearts and willing Minds, you'l then be in the way to all manner of Good, to have the Bleſſings of the upper and nether Springs, of God's Throne and of his Foot-ſtool conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you.— Will <hi>Profit</hi> allure you? truly there is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003732_0008_100252FE0914D440"/>no Gold, or worldly Gain, that is worthy to be compared with the <hi>Gold tryed in the Fire,</hi> which Chriſt counſels us to buy of him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18.—Will <hi>Pleaſure</hi> invite you? There is no Pleaſure which the Things of Time &amp; Senſe afford us, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be named the ſame Day with the Pleaſure that is to be enjoyed in Communion with God, and walking in the Ways of Wiſdom; all whoſe <hi>Ways are Ways of pleaſantneſs, and whoſe Paths are Peace.</hi>—Will <hi>Honour</hi> ſway with you? There's no Honour like that which come from God only, or the Honour which Chriſt will one day put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that Love and Honour him.— Is <hi>Peace</hi> a thing deſireable with you? There is no Peace with our fellow-Creatures, to be compared to the Peace which Believers have with God, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which verily <hi>paſſeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>— Once more, Will <hi>Joys</hi> or <hi>Songs</hi> charm you? Sure I am, that there is no Joy like the <hi>Joy of the Lord,</hi> which is our Strength, who have ſecured to our ſelves a part in a glorious Chriſt. No carnal Mirth or Gladneſs which is comparable to that of the Ranſomed of the Lord, who ſhall return and come to Zion with <hi>Songs of everlaſting Joy upon their Heads, and ſhall obtain Joy and Gladneſs,</hi> and Sorrow ſhall flee away, Iſa.35.10.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay more, My Strength of Body is ſmall; and it is hard for me to ſpeak: I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſpend all the Strength I have, were it much more than it is, for your Good; might I be any way Inſtrumental of any ſaving Good to your Souls; or any one Soul. May God bleſs what you ſee in me, and what you now hear from me, for ſaving Good to you, I ſhall never repent the Pains I now take.</p>
            <p>O my Friends, Do you do your part, that what you have ſeen of God's Dealings with me, and what you now hear from me, may not riſe up in
<pb facs="unknown:003732_0009_1002530095AECBE8"/>Judgment againſt you in the great Day of Account.</p>
            <p>THUS, Friends, (whoſe Souls are of very great Value with me) I have by the help of God, and the uſe of a borrowed Pen, done and accompliſh'd what I have long deſired to do. I leave theſe Lines with you as being the beſt Advice I can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble give to you, if I knew I ſhould never ſee any of you more in the World, or if I ſhould yet have further Opportunities to Converſe with you.</p>
            <p>I intreat you for your Soul's ſake, Give ear to what I have now ſaid to you; ſo out of the Mouth of a Babe and Suckling, God ſhall ordain Strength and perfect his own Praiſe.</p>
            <p>And now, Whether it ſhall pleaſe God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue me with you ſtill, under my preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or otherwiſe, (that Matter I deſire to leave with God, and would entirely reſign to his holy and bleſſed Will and Pleaſure therein) I aſſure you my Kinsfolk according to the Fleſh, and all others, to whom I have directed theſe Lines, (and the Pen-man does doubtleſs join with me,) My Hearts Deſire and Prayer to GOD for you is, that your Souls may be eternally ſaved.</p>
