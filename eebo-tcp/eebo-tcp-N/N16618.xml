            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>12</hi>th July.</note>UPON the opening of the court this morning, <hi>Lewis</hi> moved for a rule to ſhew cauſe why an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment ſhould not iſſue againſt <hi>Eleazer Oſwald,</hi> the printer and publiſher of the <hi>Independent Gazetieer.</hi> The caſe was this: <hi>Oſwald</hi> having inſerted in his newſpapers ſeveral anonymous pieces againſt the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Andrew Browne,</hi> the maſter of a female academy, in the city of Philadelphia, <hi>Browne</hi> applied to him to give up the authors of thoſe pieces; but being refuſed that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he brought an action for the libel againſt <hi>Oſwald,</hi> returnable into the ſupreme court, on the 2d. day of July; and therein demanded bail for £1000. Previouſly to the return day of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, the queſtion of bail being brought by citation before Mr. Juſtice BRYAN<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at his chambers, the Judge, on a full hearing of the cauſe of action, in the preſence of both the parties, ordered the defendant to be diſcharged on common bail; and the plaintiff appeared from this order to the court. Afterwards (on the 1ſt of July) <hi>Oſwald</hi> publiſhed under his own ſignature, an addreſs to the public, which contained a narrative of theſe proceedings, and the following paſſages, which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to have been the material grounds of the preſent motion.</p>
            <p>"When violent attacks are made upon a perſon under pretext of juſtice, and legal ſteps are taken on the occaſion, not perhaps to redreſs the ſuppoſed injury, but to feed and gratify partiſaning and temporiſing reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is not unwarrantable in ſuch perſon to repreſent the real ſtatement of his caſe, and appeal to the world for their ſentiments and countenance.</p>
            <p>"Upon theſe conſiderations, principally, I am now emboldened to treſpaſs on the public patience, and muſt ſolicit the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of my friends and cuſtomers, while I preſent to their notice, an account of the ſteps lately exerciſed with me; from which it will appear that my ſituation <hi>as a printer,</hi> and the <hi>rights of the preſs</hi> and of <hi>freemen,</hi> are fundamentally ſtruck at; and an earneſt endeavour is on the carpet to involve me in difficulties to pleaſe the malicious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of old and permanent enemies.</p>
            <p>"But until the news had arrived laſt Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that the <hi>ninth</hi> ſtate had acceded to the new federal government, I was not called upon; and Mr. Page in the afternoon of that day viſited me in due form of law with a writ. Had Mr. Browne purſued me in this line, "without loſs of time," agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his lawyer's letter, I ſhould not have ſuppoſed it extraordinary—but to arreſt me the moment the <hi>federal</hi> intelligence came to hand, indicated that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of this ſuit was not ſo much the child of his own fancy, as it has been probably dictated to and urged on him by others, whoſe ſentiments upon the new conſtitution have not in every reſpect coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided with mine. In fact, it was my idea, in the firſt progreſs of the buſineſs, that Mr. Browne was merely the <hi>hand-maid</hi> of ſome of my enemies among the federaliſts; and in this claſs I muſt rank, his great patron Doctor <hi>Ruſh</hi> (whoſe brother is a judge of the Supreme Court) I think Mr. Brown's conduct has ſince confirmed the idea beyond a doubt.</p>
            <p>"Enemies I have had in the legal profeſſion, and it may perhaps add to the hopes of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity,</hi> that this action is inſtituted in the <hi>Supreme Court</hi> of Pennſylvania However, if former prejudices ſhould be found to operate againſt me on the bench, it is with a jury of my country, properly elected and empannelled, a jury of freemen and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent citizens, I muſt reſt the ſuit. I have eſcaped the jaws of perſecution through this channel on certain memorable occaſions,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021363_0004_0FB360F0413E92B0"/>
hope I ſhall never be a ſufferer, let the blaſt of faction blow with all its furies!</p>
            <p>"The doctrine of libels being a doctrine incompatible with law and liberty, and at once deſtructive of the privileges of a free country in the communication of our thoughts, has not hitherto gained any footing in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania: and the vile meaſures formerly taken to lay me by the heels on this ſubject only brought down obloquy upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors themſelves. I may well ſuppoſe the ſame love of liberty yet pervades my fellow citizens, and that they will not allow the freedom of the preſs to be violated upon any refined pretence, which oppreſſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity or courtly ſtudy caninvent.</p>
            <p>"Upon trial of the cauſe, the public will decide for themſelves, whether Mr. Browne's motives have been laudable and dignified; whether his conduct in declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an acquittal of his character in the paper, and ſuing me in the mariner he did, was decent and conſiſtent; and, in a word, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is not actuated by ſome of my inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate foes and opponents, to lend his name in their ſervice for the purpoſe of harraſſing and injuring me."</p>
            <p>A tranſcript from the records was read to ſhew that the action between Browne and Oſwald was depending in the court. <hi>James Martin</hi> proved that the paper contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oſwald's addreſs, was bought at his printing office, freſh and damp from the preſs; and a depoſition, made by <hi>Browne,</hi> was read to prove the preceding facts rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the cauſe of action, the hearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Juſtice BRYAN, and the appeal from his order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> then adverted to the various pieces, which were charged as libellous in the depending action; and argued, that, though the liberty of the preſs was invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in its nature, and ought not to be infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; yet, that its value did not conſiſt in a boundleſs licentiouſneſs of ſlander and defamation. He contended, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Browne, to whom the education of more than a hundred children was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times entruſted, expoſed him, in a peculiar manner, to be injured by wanton aſperſions of his character; and he interred the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the action, which had been inſtituted, from this conſideration, that if <hi>Browne</hi> were really the monſter which the papers in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, deſcribed him to be, he ought to be hunted from ſociety; but, that if he had been falſely accuſed, if he had been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly traduced, it was a duty that he owed to himſelf and to the public, to vindicate his reputation, and to call upon the juſtice of the laws, to puniſh ſo groſs a violation of truth and decency. For this pupoſe, he continued, a writ had been iſſued, and bail was required. The defendant, if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was, certainly, on the hearing at the Judge's chambers, apprized of the cauſe of action: The order of Mr. Juſtice BRYAN on that occaſion, and the appeal to the court, were circumſtances perfectly within his knowledge; and yet, while the whole merits of the cauſe were thus in ſuſpenſe, he thought proper to addreſs the public in language evidently calculated to excite the popular reſentment againſt <hi>Browne;</hi> to create doubts and ſuſpicions of the integrity and impartiality of the Judges who muſt preſide upon the trial; and to promote an unmerited compaſſion in his own favour. He has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed himſelf as the object of former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions upon ſimilar principles; he has aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that, in this inſtance, an individual is made the inſtrument of a party to deſtroy him; and he artfully calls upon his fellow citizens to intereſt themſelves to preſerve the freedom of the preſs, which he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as attacked in his perſon. Nay, in order to caſt an odium upon the new government of the United States, he inſinuates, that his arreſt was purpoſely protracted 'till the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of nine ſtates had given ſtability to that ſyſtem:—a falſehood, as unwarrantable as it is inſidious; for, it will be proved that this delay took place at his own requeſt, communicated by Col. <hi>Proctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Proctor</hi> being examined on this point, ſaid, that he, at firſt, deſired the action might not be brought, in hopes of accompliſhing a compromiſe between the parties; that, afterwards, he requeſted Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer iſſuing the writ 'till as near the term as it was poſſible: but that all this interference was of his own accord, and not at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the defendant. He acknowledged, however, that he had informed <hi>Oſwald,</hi> that the commencement of the action would be poſtponed as long as poſſible, after having obtained a promiſe to that effect from Mr. <hi>Lewis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> ſaid he was very much miſtaken indeed, if Col. <hi>Proctor</hi> had not mentioned the requeſt as coming from the defendant; and Col. <hi>Proctor</hi> anſwered,
<q>if ever I told you ſo, he certainly ſent me; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remember that ever he aſked me to do a thing of the kind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> then added, that the addreſs to the public manifeſtly tended to interrupt the courſe of juſtice; it was an attempt to prejudice the minds of the people in a cauſe then depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and, by that means, to defeat the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iff's claim to juſtice, and to ſtigmatize the Judges, whoſe duty it was to adminiſter the laws. There could be no doubt, therefore, that it amounted to a contempt of the court; and it only remained, in ſupport of his motion, to ſhew that an attachment was the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021363_0005_0FB360F2C63BE6C8"/>
legal mode of proceeding againſt the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For this he cited 4 <hi>Black. Com.</hi> 280. 2 <hi>Atk.</hi> 469.</p>

                  <p>I know not of any inſtance where a delay of a term has been allowed in the caſe of an attachment: one reaſon for ſuch a ſummary proceeding is to prevent delay. Let cauſe be now ſhewn.</p>

                  <hi>Sergeant,</hi> in ſhowing cauſe againſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, contended that the doctrine, in 4 <hi>Black. Com.</hi> 280. was laid down much too wide; that in 2 <hi>Atk.</hi> 469, the Chancellor expreſsly aſſigns this reaſon, for his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining without a jury, that he was a judge of <hi>fact;</hi> and in 1 <hi>Burr.</hi> 510<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 513, an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is granted on this principle, that courts of common law will not decide upon facts without the intervention of a jury.</p>

                  <p>This was not the reaſon that influenced tne court in their deciſion.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>But whatever the law might be in <hi>England, Sergeant</hi> inſiſted, that it could not avail in <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> Even in <hi>England,</hi> indeed, though it is ſaid to be a contempt to report the deciſions of the courts, unleſs under the <hi>imprimatur</hi> of the judges; yet, we find <hi>Burrow</hi> and all the ſubſequent reporters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding without that ſanction. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> authorizes many things to be done which in <hi>England</hi> are prohibited. Here the preſs is laid open to the inſpection of every citizen, who wiſhes to examine the proceedings of the government; of which the judicial autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is certainly to be conſidered as a branch. <hi>Conſt.

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Could not this be done in <hi>England?</hi> certainly it could: for, in ſhort, there is nothing in the conſtitution of this ſtate, reſpecting the liberty of the preſs, that has not been authorized by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that kingdom for near a century paſt.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Sergeant.</speaker>
                  <p>The 9th <hi>ſection of the Bill of Rights,</hi> however, puts this ſuppoſed offence into ſuch a form, as muſt entitle the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to a trial by jury; and precludes every attempt to compel him to give evidence againſt himſelf. It declares
<q>that in all proſecutions for <hi>criminal offences,</hi> a man hath a right to be heard by himſelf and his council, to demand the cauſe and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his accuſation, to be confronted with the witneſſes, to call for evidence in his favour, and a ſpeedy public trial, <hi>by an impartial jury of the country,</hi> without the <hi>unanimous</hi> conſent of which jury he cannot be found guilty; <hi>nor can he be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to give evidence againſt himſelf;</hi> nor can any man be juſtly deprived of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</q>
—Now, the preſent proceeding againſt the defendant it for a <hi>criminal offence;</hi> and, yet, if the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment iſſues, the eſſential parts of this ſection muſt be defeated: for, in that caſe, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>cannot be tried by a jury;</hi> and, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practice upon attachments, he will <hi>be compelled to anſwer interrogatories;</hi> in doing which, he muſt either he guilty of perjury, or <hi>give evidence againſt himſelf.</hi> The proceeding by attachment is, indeed, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty in this country, except for the purpoſe of enforcing the attendance of witneſſes. Thoſe contempts which are committed in the face of a court ſtand upon a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground. Even the court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> (which is not a court of record) poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes a power to puniſh them; and the reaſon ariſes from the neceſſity, that every juriſdiction ſhould be competent to protect itſelf from immediate violence and interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But contempts which are alledged to have been committed out of doors, are not within this reaſon; they come properly within the claſs of <hi>criminal offences;</hi> and, as ſuch, by the 9th <hi>ſect.</hi> of the bill of rights, they can only be tried by a jury.</p>

                  <hi>Sergeant</hi> ſaid, that he had diſcuſſed the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as well as the little opportunity afforded him would admit. He preſſed the court to give further time for the argument, or, at once, to direct a trial. This he contended was, at leaſt, diſcretionary: and, conſidering the defendant's proteſtation of innocence<note n="*" place="bottom">Col. <hi>Oſwald</hi> repeatedly declared that he meant no contempt of the court in what he had publiſhed.</note>, his readineſs to give ample ſecurity for his future appearance, the magnitude of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion as ariſing from the conſtitution, and its immenſe conſequences to the public, he thought a delay, that was eſſential to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration and juſtice, ought not to be refuſed.</p>

of the caſe, <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s publication, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or falſe, amounted to a contempt of the court, as it reſpected a cauſe theu de, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to judgment, and reflected upon one of the Judges in his official capacity; that the argument of the adverſe counſel went ſo far as to aſſert, that there could be no ſuch offence as a contempt even in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the very words inſerted in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> were uſed in the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of that kingdom; that, in truth, neither the bill of rights nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution extended to the caſe of <hi>contempts,</hi> for they meant only to ſecure to every citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen the right of expreſſing his ſentiments with a manly freedom, but not to authorize wanton attacks upon private reputation, or to deprive the court of a power eſſential to its own exiſtence, and to the due admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of juſtice; that the court were as competent to judge of the fact and the law, upon the inſpection of the publication in queſtion, as <hi>the chanceilor</hi> was in the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity cited from <hi>Atkins;</hi> and that although the proſecutor could, perhaps, proceed either by indictment or information, yet that the abuſes of the <hi>Star Chamber</hi> had rendered the proceſs by information odious, and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, which was ſanctified by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial uſage, was the moſt expeditious, and, therefore, the moſt proper remedy for the evil complained of.</p>

                  <p>—This is a motion for an attachment againſt <hi>Eleazer Oſwald,</hi> the printer and publiſher of the Independent Gazetteer, of the 1ſt of July laſt. No. 796. As a ground for granting the attachment, it is proved, that an action for a libel had been inſtituted in this court, in which <hi>Andrew Browne</hi> is the plaineſt, and <hi>Eleazer Oſwald</hi> the defendant; that a queſtion with reſpect to bail in that action had been agitated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one of the Judges, from whoſe order, diſcharging the defendant on common bail, the plaintiff had appealed to the court; and that Mr. <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s addreſs to the public, which is the immediate ſubject of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, relates to the action thus depending before us. The counſel in ſupport of their motion, have argued, that this addreſs was intended to prejudice the public mind upon the merits of the cauſe, by propagating an opinion that <hi>Browne</hi> was the inſtrument of a party to prejudice and deſtroy the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; that he acted under the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Dr. <hi>Ruſa,</hi> whoſe brother is a judge of this court; and, in ſhort, that from the ancient prejudices of all the judges, the defendant did not ſtand a chance of a fair trial.</p>
                  <p>Aſſertions and imputations of this kind are certainly calculated to defeat and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the adminiſtration of juſtice Let us, therefore, enquire, <hi>firſt,</hi> whether they ought to be conſidered as a contempt of the court; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> whether, if ſo, the offender is puniſhable by attachment.</p>
                  <p>And here I muſt be allowed to obſerve, that libelling is a great crime, whatever ſentiments may be entertained by thoſe who live by it. With reſpect to the heart of the libeller, it is more dark and baſe than that of the aſſaſſin, or than his who commits a midnight arſon. It is true, that I may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcover the wretch who has burned my houſe, or ſet fire to my barn; but theſe loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are eaſily reparted, and bring with them no portion of ignominy or reproach. But the attacks of the libeller admit not of this conſolation: the injuries which are done to character and reputation ſeldom can be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the moſt innocent man may in a moment be deprived of his good name, upon which, perhaps, he depends for all the proſperity, and all the happineſs of his life. To what tribunal can be then reſort? how ſhall he be tried, and by whom ſhall he be acquitted? It is in vain to object, that thoſe who know him will diſregard the ſlander, ſince the wide circulation of public prints muſt render it impracticable to apply the antedote as far as the poiſon has been extended. Nor can it be fairly ſaid, that the ſame opportunity is given to <hi>vindicate,</hi> which has been employed to <hi>deſame</hi> him; for, many will read the charge, who may never ſee the anſwer; and while the object of accuſation is publicly pointed at, the malicious and malignant author, reſts in the diſhonorable ſecurity of an anonymous ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature Where much has been ſaid, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be believed; and it is one of the many artifices of the libeller, to give to his charges an aſpect of general ſupport, by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and multiplying the ſtyle and name of his performances. But ſhall ſuch things be tranſacted with impunity in a tree country, and among an enlightened people? Let every honeſt man make this appeal to his heart and underſtanding, and the anſwer muſt be—no!</p>
                  <p>What then is the meaning of the Bill of Rights, and the Conſtitution of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> when they declare, "That the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the preſs ſhall not be reſtrained,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Declar. of Rights, <hi>ſ.</hi> 12.</note> and that "the printing preſſes ſhall be free to every perſon who undertakes to examine the proceedings of the legiſlature, or any part of the government<note n="†" place="bottom">Conſtit. of Penn. <hi>ſ.</hi> 35.</note>." However in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity may torture the expreſſions, there can be little doubt of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſenſe of theſe ſections: they give to every citizen a right of inveſtigating the conduct of thoſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

are entruſted with the public buſineſs; and they effectually preclude any attempt to fetter the preſs by the inſtitution of a <hi>licenſer.</hi> The ſame principles were ſettled in <hi>England,</hi> ſo far back as the reign of <hi>William the Third,</hi> and ſince that time, we all know, there has been the freeſt animadverſion upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the miniſters of that nation. But is there any thing in the language of the conſtitution (much leſs in its ſpirit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention) which authorizes one man to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute crimes to another, for which the law has provided the mode of trial, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of puniſhment? Can it be preſumed that the ſlanderous words, which, when ſpoken to a few individuals, would expoſe the ſpeaker to puniſhment, become ſacred, by the authority of the conſtitution, when delivered to the public through the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and diffuſive medium of the preſs? Or, will it be ſaid that the conſtitutional right to examine the proceedings of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, extends to warrant an anticipation of the acts of the legiſlature or the judgments of the court? and not only to authorize a candid commentary upon what has been done, but to permit every endeavour to biaſs and intimidate with reſpect to matters ſtill in ſuſpenſe? The futility of any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to eſtabliſh a conſtruction of this ſort, muſt be obvious to every intelligent mind. The true liberty of the preſs is amply ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by permitting every man to publiſh his opinions; but it is due to the peace and dignity of ſociety to enquire into the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of ſuch publications, and to diſtinguiſh between thoſe which are meant for uſe and reformation, and with an eye ſolely to the public good, and thoſe which are intended merely to delude and deſame. To the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſcription, it is impoſſible that any good government ſhould afford protection and impunity.</p>
                  <p>If, then, the liberty of the preſs is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by any juſt principle, there can be little doubt, that he, who attempts to raiſe a prejudice againſt his antagoniſt, in the minds of thoſe that muſt ultimately deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the diſpute between them; who, for that purpoſe, repreſents himſelf as a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted man, and aſſerts that his judges are influenced by paſſion and prejudice,—wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſeeks to corrupt the ſource, and to diſhonor the adminiſtration of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Such is evidently the object and tendency of Mr <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s addreſs to the public. Nor can that artifice prevail, which inſinuates that the deciſion of this court will be the effect of perſonal reſentment; for, if it could, every man might evade the puniſhment due to his offences, by firſt pouring a torrent of abuſe upon his judges, and then aſſerting that they act from paſſion, becauſe their treatment has been ſuch as would naturally excite reſentment in the human diſpoſition. But it muſt be remembered, that judges diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their functions under the ſolemn obligations of an oath; and, if their virtue entitles them to their ſtation, they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be corrupted by favour to ſwerve from, nor influenced by fear to deſert their duty. That judge, indeed, who courts popularity by unworthy means, while he weakens his pretenſions, diminiſhes, likewiſe, the chance of attaining his object; and he will eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally find that he has ſacrificed the ſubſtantial bleſſing of a good conſcience, in an idle and viſionary purſuit.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, we conſider the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in queſtion, as having the tendency which has been aſcribed to it, that of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing the public (a part of whom muſt hereafter be ſummoned as jurors) with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the merits of a cauſe depending in this court, and of corrupting the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice: We are, therefore, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly of opinion, on the firſt point, that it amounts to a contempt.</p>
                  <p>It only remains then to conſider, whether the offence is puniſhable in the way that the preſent motion has propoſed. It is certain that the proceeding by <hi>attachment</hi> is as old as the law itſelf, and no act of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſection of the conſtitution, has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed to alter or ſuſpend it. Beſides the ſections which have been already read from the conſtitution, there is another ſection which declares, that "trials by jury ſhall be "as <hi>heretofore;</hi>" and ſurely it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the offence, with which the defendant is now charged, was <hi>heretofore</hi> tried by that tribunal. If a man commits an outrage in the face of the court, what is there to be tried?—what further evidence can be neceſſary to convict him of the offence, than the actual view of the Judges? A man has been compelled to enter into ſecurity for his good behaviour, for giving the lie in the preſence of the Judges in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter Hall.</hi> On the preſent occaſion, is not the proof, from the inſpection of the paper, as full and ſatisfactory as any that can be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered? And whether the publication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a contempt, or not, is a point of law, which, after all, it is the province of the judges, and not of the jury, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Being a contempt, if it is not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed immediately, how ſhall the miſchief be corrected? Leave it to the cuſtomary forms of a trial by jury, and the cauſe may be continued long in ſuſpenſe, while the party perſeveres in his miſconduct. The injurious conſequences might then be juſtly imputed to the court, for refuſing to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their legal power in preventing them.</p>

                  <hi>Lewis</hi> ſaid, that as a miſrepreſentation had been induſtriouſly ſpread abroad reſpecting the conduct of the court, he thought it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, at this time, conciſely to ſtate the real nature of the preſent proceedings. It has been aſſerted that the court were about to compel Mr. Oſwald to convict himſelf of the offence with which he is charged: but the fact is this, that it is incumbent upon the perſon who ſuggeſts the contempt to prove it by diſintereſted witneſſes; and then, indeed, the defendant is allowed by his own oath to purge and acquit himſelf, in ſpite of all the teſtimony which can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be produced againſt him. It appears clearly therefore, that Mr. Oſwald's being called upon to anſwer interrogatories, is not meant to eſtabliſh his guilt (for that has been already done) but to enable him to avoid the puniſhment which is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it. The court employ no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion in this reſpect. He may either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, or not, as he pleaſes: if he does anſwer, his ſingle oath, in his own favour, will countervail the oaths of a thouſand witneſſes; and if he does not anſwer, his ſilence corroborates the evidence which has been offered of the contempt, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the court muſt neceſſarily follow.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Having yeſterday conſidered the charge againſt you, we were unanimouſly of opinion, that it amounted to a contempt of the court. Some doubts were ſuggeſted, whether, even a contempt of the court, was puniſhable by attachment: but, not only my brethren and myſelf, but, likewiſe, all the judges of <hi>England,</hi> think, that without this power no court could poſſibly exiſt;—nay, that no <hi>contempt</hi> could, indeed, be committed againſt us, we ſhould be <hi>ſo truly contemptible.</hi> The law upon the ſubject is of immemorial an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; and there is not any period when it can be ſaid to have ceaſed, or diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. On this point, therefore, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain no doubt: but ſome difficulty has ariſen with reſpect to our ſentence; for, on the one hand, we have been informed of your circumſtances, and on the other, we have ſeen your conduct: your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are ſmall, but your offence is great and perſiſted in. Since, however, the queſtion ſeems to reſolve itſelf into this, whether you ſhall bend to the law, or the law ſhall bend to you, it is our duty to determine that the former ſhall be the caſe. Upon the whole, therefore, THE COURT pronounce this ſentence: That you pay a fine of 10l. to the commonwealth; that you be impriſoned for the ſpace of one month, that is, from the 15th day of July to the 15th day of Auguſt next; and, afterwards, till the fine and coſts are paid. —Sheriff he is in your cuſtody.</p>

            <head>A <hi>SUMMARY</hi> of the <hi>PROCEEDINGS</hi> in the <hi>GENERAL ASSEMBLY</hi> of <hi>PENNSYLVANIA,</hi> upon the Complaint of Col. <hi>ELEAZER OSWALD</hi> againſt the <hi>JUSTICES</hi> of the <hi>SUPREME COURT.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ON the 5th of September 1788, Col. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald, the defendant, preſented a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to the general aſſembly, in which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the deciſion of the ſupreme court; ſtated the above proceedings againſt him; and likewiſe repreſented, that the Chief Juſtice had directed the Jailer not to diſcharge him, after his ſentence was expired;—finally call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the houſe to determine,
<q>whether the Judges did not infringe the conſtitution in <hi>direct</hi> terms in the ſentence they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; and whether, of courſe, they had not made themſelves proper objects of impeachment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The aſſembly, having previouſly appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a committee to report the order of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on Col. <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s memorial, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved itſelf into a committee of the whole, to hear the evidence in ſupport of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges exhibited. Three days were conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the examination of witneſſes, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, the preceding report was ſubſtantially proved; and it was alſo given in evidence, that, though the ſentence of impriſonment was pronounced
<q>for the ſpace of one month, that is from the 15th day of July to the 15th day of Auguſt,</q>
yet, that the record merely ſtated it to be for <hi>one month</hi> (which is only 28 days in law) without taking notice of the explanatory words uſed by the court; and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, the CHIEF JUSTICE, when the month was expired, had, at firſt, directed the Jailor not to releaſe Col. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> till the morning of the 15th day of Auguſt; though he, afterwards, wrote to the ſheriff, that it would be proper to diſcharge his priſoner agreeably to the record.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> as a member of the houſe, then delivered a very elaborate argument, in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the conduct of the judges. It is impoſſible to purſue this gentleman's tract of reaſoning, with any degree of juſtice to his eloquence, or the ſubject in diſcuſſion; but it may not be unprofitable to thoſe who, either now or hereafter, may wiſh to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the principles of this intereſting caſe, to delineate the leading features of the doctrine which he maintained.</p>
            <p>He began with ſtating the ineſtimable character of true liberty, which is equally endangered by tyranny on the one hand, and by licentiouſneſs upon the other. He ſaid, it did not conſiſt in the uncontrouled power of doing whatever the will might prompt an individual to attempt; but, while it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of arbitrary and deſpotic rule, it was happily regulated by the laws and conſtitution of the ſtate. Having reſcued Sir <hi>William Blackſtone,</hi> from the ſtigma of being a <hi>courtly</hi> writer, by ſhewing the enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm of that author in favour of the trial by jury, Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> referred to the celebrated <hi>Commentaries</hi> in ſupport and illuſtration of his ſentiments upon liberty. 1 <hi>Black. Com.</hi> 125. 2 <hi>Black. Com.</hi> 4 <hi>Black. Com.</hi> 3 42.</p>
            <p>He then commented upon the origin, nature, and purpoſes of a ſtate of ſociety, which, he ſaid, was principally formed to protect the rights of individuals; and, of thoſe rights, he pathetically deſcribed, the right of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying a good name, to be the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and moſt precious. He obſerved, that the injuries which could be done to any other property, might be repaired; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation was not only the moſt valuable, but, likewiſe, the moſt delicate of human poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. It was the moſt difficult to acquire; when acquired, it was the moſt difficult to preſerve; and when loſt, it was never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained. If, therefore, it was not as much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, as any other right, the aged matron, and the youthful virgin, (ſince purity of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the palladium of female happineſs) while they are fettered by the habits and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſociety, are expoſed and abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its laws and inſtitutions. But this evil is effectually removed, when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bill of rights as precluding any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reſtrain the preſs, and not as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing inſidious falſhoods and anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous abuſe. The right of publication, like every other right, has, therefore, its natural and neceſſary boundary; for, though the law allows a man the free uſe of his arm, or the poſſeſſion of a weapon, yet it does not authorize him to plunge a dagger in the breaſt of an inoffenſive neighbour.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> then proceeded to conſider the immediate ſubject of complaint. He ſtated it to be two-fold; 1 ſt. That the CHIEF JUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICE had protracted Col. <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beyond the legal expiration of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and, 2dly. That the impriſonment itſelf, was unconſtitutional, illegal, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>firſt</hi> point, he obſerved, that it was, indeed a ſerious charge, if Col. <hi>Oſwald</hi> could prove that a ſingle juſtice, had arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily altered, or counteracted, the record of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021363_0011_0FB360FF49E10998"/>
the court, in order to accompliſh the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of a citizen. But how was the charge ſupported? The opinion given by the Chief Juſtice to the Jailer, was not given in his judicial capacity; and though a paper, ſaid to be a tranſcript from the records, was ſhewn to him, yet it was not ſubſcribed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonotary, nor was it under the ſeal of the court. This, therefore, could not be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient document to ſet aſide his recollection of the ſentence; it was no legal evidence of the fact which it ſtated, (<hi>Gi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the <hi>ſecond</hi> point, he engaged in a long and ingenious diſquiſition upon the nature of what is called <hi>the liberty of the preſs;</hi> he repreſented the ſhackles which had been impoſed upon it during the arbitrary periods of the Engliſh government; and thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the wiſdom and propriety of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, which declares in the <hi>bill of rights,</hi> that the preſs ſhall not be ſubject to reſtraint. He gave an hiſtorical narrative of the Britiſh acts of parliament and proclamations, which debarred every man of the right of publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without a previous licence obtained from cancers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſtabliſhed by the government, to inſpect and pronounce upon every literary performance; but obſerved, that this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (which was intended to keep the people in a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>It has been aſſerted, however, that Col. <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s addreſs was of a harmleſs texture; that is was no abuſe of the right of publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which, as a citizen, he was entitled: and, in ſhort, that in conſidering it as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the court, the judges have acted tyrannically, illegally, and unconſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. But let us diveſt the ſubject of theſe high-ſounding epithets, and the reverſe of this aſſertion will be evident, to every can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and unprejudiced mind: For, ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications are certainly calculated to draw the adminiſtration of juſtice from the proper tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals; and in their place to ſubſtitute newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper altercations, in which the moſt ſkilful writer will generally prevail againſt all the merits of the caſe. But it is moreover the duty of the judges to protect ſuitors, not only from perſonal violence, but from inſidious attempts, to undermine their claims to law and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Hence, Lord Chancellor <hi>Hardwicke,</hi> (who was an ornament to his country, and not one of whoſe decrees during the period of twenty years which he ſat as chancellor, was ever reverſed) has deſcribed three ſorts of contempts—1ſt. Scandalizing the court itſelf. 2dly. Abuſing parties who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in cauſes there; and 3dly. Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing mankind againſt perſons, before the cauſe is heard. 2 <hi>Atk.</hi> 471. And in 2 <hi>Veſey</hi> 520, though no reflection was caſt upon the court, and the offender pleaded ignorance of the law, yet it is expreſsly laid down, that ignorance was not an excuſe, and that the reaſon for puniſhing was, not only for the ſake of the party injured, but alſo for the ſake of the public proceedings in the court to hinder ſuch advertiſements, which tend to propoſſeſs people as to thoſe proceedings. A ſimilar doctrine is maintained in 1 <hi>P. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> 675. and 4 <hi>Black. Com.</hi> 282. pronounces the printing, even true, accounts of a cauſe depending in judgment, to be a contempt of the court.</p>
            <p>But it has been ſaid, that this cauſe was not depending in court, when the offence was committed, becauſe the addreſs was publiſhed on the <hi>firſt</hi> of July, and the writ againſt Mr. <hi>Oſwald</hi> was not returnable 'till the <hi>ſucceeding day.</hi> This idea originates in an ignorance of the conſtitution of our courts, which, in this reſpect, differs eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially from the conſtitution of the courts of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021363_0012_0FB36100E8274FE8"/>
               <hi>England. There</hi> all original proceſs iſſues out of the Court of Chancery, and is made returnable into the King's Bench or Common Pleas; ſo that, in truth, the writ gives the juriſdiction, and, of courſe, 'till it is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the court cannot take cognizance of the cauſe. <hi>Here,</hi> however, the original proceſs iſſues out of the very court into which it is returnable, and is uſually teſted the laſt day of the preceeding term. It is abſurd, therefore, to ſay that the juriſdiction of a court, by whoſe authority a ſuit is actually inſtituted, can be thus ſuſpended and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled out.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the addreſs itſelf, Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> annalyſed its offenſive parts, in order to ſhew that it treated the judges with inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent opprobrium; that, in ſome reſpects, it was inconſiſtent with truth, and that, in its general operation, it was intended, and could not fail, to excite reſentment againſt <hi>Browne,</hi> the plaintiff, and compaſſion for <hi>Oſwald,</hi> the defendant, in the cauſe</p>
            <p>He now proceeded to conſider the <hi>mode</hi> of puniſhment, which formed a material part of Col. <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s complaint; and, in ſupport of its legality, referred, generally, to the authorities which he had already cited. He obſerved that much declamation had been waſted upon this topic; and that the proceeding by <hi>attachment</hi> had been vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprobated as the <hi>creature</hi> of the Court of <hi>Star Chamber.</hi> Though that court might have employed the proceſs of <hi>attachment</hi> (of which, however, he did not recollect an inſtance) yet, he inſiſted, that it was idle and abſurd to conſider it as the <hi>creature</hi> of a juriſdiction, whoſe own exiſtence was of a much later date, than that of the ſubject to which we are told it gave birth. To prove this, he ſtated that the court of <hi>Star Chamber</hi> was not inſtituted 'till the year 1368; that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was confirmed, at leaſt, 113 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time; and, as all the authorities concur in declaring that the proceſs by <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment</hi> is as ancient as the laws themſelves, and that it was confirmed by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> its origin is conſequently long antecedent to that of the Court of <hi>Star Chamber.</hi> 4 <hi>Black. Com.</hi> 280.281.282.283.284.285.</p>
            <p>But he argued, with great ſtrength and perſpicuity, that the proceſs of <hi>attachment,</hi> which in practice was multiplied into innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable uſes, was eſſential to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice; and that if the exerciſe of this power was ſuppreſſed, the courts themſelves might as well be annihilated. He repreſented, that it was an eſtabliſhed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in law, that one court could not puniſh a <hi>contempt</hi> committed againſt another; then, continued he, how ſhall the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> repel an injury of that nature? It is not veſted with any criminal juriſdiction; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not impannel a grand Jury, nor try an indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the only remedy therefore which the caſe can admit, is by an <hi>attachment.</hi> He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the ſame reaſoning to the <hi>ſupreme court;</hi> and with reſpect to the <hi>orphan's courts,</hi> the court of <hi>admiralty,</hi> and the courts of the <hi>regiſters of wills, &amp;c.</hi> he obſerved that their proceedings, according to the civil law, were totally independent of juries; and that conſequently if they were deprived of the proceſs of <hi>attachment,</hi> it was in vain for them to decide and to decree, for they would then be without any means to enforce obedience to their deciſions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. Nay, he added, that, without this power, the legiſlature itſelf would be expoſed to wanton inſult and interruption; and that letters, ſuch as he had received, menacing his exiſtence for his conduct on the preſent occaſion, might be written and avowed with abſolute impunity. He then enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many inſtances in which groſs injuſtice would take place, but for the intervention of this ſummary proceeding. Where a ſheriff refuſes, or neglects, to return a writ; or to pay money which he has received upon an execution; where an inferior court refuſes to tranſmit a record; a witneſs, or juryman, to attend or to be ſworn; and where a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant in <hi>ejectment</hi> refuſes to pay coſts, after a <hi>nonſuit,</hi> for want of a confeſſion of leaſe entry and ouſter;—in all theſe (and many other) caſes he demonſtrated, that the great, efficient remedy, was by an attachment to be iſſued againſt the delinquent.</p>
            <p>In tracing the antiquity of the proceſs by attachment, he remarked, that, it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be a part of the common law by the moſt authoritative writers; and that the common law was a compound of the <hi>Daniſh, Saxon, Norman, Pict</hi> and <hi>Civil law.</hi> 1 <hi>Black. Com.</hi> 63. As, therefore, the <hi>attachment</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the civil law, and the civil law was introduced into <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> early in the firſt century, he thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable at this day to aſcertain its ſource; but inſiſted that enough appeared to prove it to be of immemorial uſage, and a part of the law of the land.</p>
            <p>He then adverted to the leading objection made by the advocates for Col. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> that, however the proceſs of <hi>attachment</hi> might be legal in <hi>England,</hi> it was not ſo in <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> From a deciſion in the time of Judge <hi>Kinſey,</hi> he ſhewed that, before the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an <hi>attachment</hi> had iſſued for a contempt, and that the party had, in fact, anſwered cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain interrogatories filed by order of the court; ſo that it only remained to enquire, whether
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021363_0013_0FB36102DEBBFF08"/>
any alteration had been introduced by the conſtitution of the ſtate. In the 24th <hi>ſect.</hi> of that inſtrument, it is declared that,
<q>the <hi>ſupreme court,</hi> and the ſeveral courts of <hi>common pleas</hi> of this commonwealth, ſhall, <hi>beſides the powers uſually exerciſed by ſuch courts,</hi> have the powers of a court of chancery, ſo far as relates, &amp;c.</q>
Now, as it appears by the caſe which occurred while Mr <hi>Kinſey</hi> was chief juſtice, that the power of iſſuing <hi>attachments</hi> was uſually exerciſed by the <hi>ſupreme court,</hi> ſo far from altering the law, this is a direct confirmation of the juriſdiction of the court; for, the greater naturally includes the leſs; and if the court is veſted with <hi>all</hi> its former powers, by what poſſible conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can we deprive it of this? But it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that a ſection in the <hi>bill of rights</hi> provides, that "In all proſecutions for cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal offences the trial ſhall be by jury, &amp;c." True; but the whole ſyſtem muſt be taken together; or, if we examine a particular part, it muſt be with a recollection of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſubject to which that part relates For, otherwiſe, this very ſection might as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be brought to prove, that the judges could not be <hi>impeached</hi> (ſince ſurely that is not a trial by jury) as that they have not the power of iſſuing attachments. All caſes proper for a trial by jury, the bill of rights clearly meant to refer to that tribunal; but can any thing more explicitly demonſtrate, that the framers of the conſtitution were aware of ſome caſes, which required another mode of proceeding, than their declaration, that "Trials ſhall be by jury as <hi>heretofore?</hi>"—Who will aſſert that contempts were ever ſo tried? who will hazard an opinion, that it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo to try them?</p>
            <p>But does not the conſtitution of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> further diſtinguiſh between the <hi>laws of the land,</hi> and the <hi>judgment of our peers;</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing a ſtriking alternative, by the disjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive particle <hi>or?</hi> This very ſentiment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſame words, appears in the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and yet <hi>Blackſtone</hi> unequivocally informs us, that the proceſs of <hi>attachment</hi> was <hi>confirmed</hi> by that celebrated inſtrument. In the 14 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> it is alſo ſaid, that
<q>no amercement ſhall be aſſeſſed, but by lawful men of the vicinage;</q>
and who, that is at all acquainted with the law, or with the reaſon of the law, can think it poſſible, in that caſe, to purſue the <hi>generality</hi> of the expreſſion? From theſe analogous principles, therefore, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ages, we may ſafely argue on the preſent occaſion. But the wild and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical interpretations, which ſome men have offered, would inevitably involve us in a labyrinth of error, and eventually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger that liberty, which they profeſs, and every honeſt citizen muſt wiſh, to preſerve.</p>
            <p>As to the manner of proceeding upon the <hi>attachment,</hi> the court on this occaſion have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the precedent in <hi>Moſley's rep</hi> 250. where it is liberally ſaid, that the defendant ſhall not be permited to be examined to bring himſelf into contempt; but upon proof of the contempt, he ſhall be allowed to purge himſelf upon his oath.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> concluded, that the only grounds of impeachment, were bribery, corruption, groſs partiality, or wilful and arbitrary oppreſſion; and that as none of theſe had been proved, Col. <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s memorial ought to be diſmiſſed. He ſaid, indeed, that it would be preferable to return to the ſtate of nature, than to live in a ſtate of ſociety upon the terms which that memorial preſented;—terms which left the weak and the innocent a prey to the powerful and the wicked; and which gave to falſehood and licentiouſneſs, all that was due to freedom and to truth.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s argument was cloſed, Mr. <hi>Findley</hi> roſe, and delivered his ſentiments, with his uſual abilities and preciſion. He acknowledged, that he had received great information and pleaſure, from the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eloquent ſpeech of the member who preceded him; but he thought it was unneceſſary, upon the preſent occaſion, to explore the dark and diſtant periods of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridical hiſtory. The rights and immunities which formed the great object of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he contended, were capable of an eaſy and unequivocal definition; they were not of ſuch remote antiquity as to be loſt even to the feelings of the people; and the conſtitution of the ſtate was the only proper criterion, by which they could be judged and aſcertained. He did not, therefore, intend to purſue Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> in the tract of legal diſquiſition; but, appealing confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the inſtrument itſelf, he deemed it to be his duty to pronounce, that the deciſion of the ſupreme court was a deviation from the ſpirit and the letter of the frame of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In doing this, he obſerved, that he did not mean to aſſert, that any ground had been ſhewn for the impeachment of the judges. But, on the contrary, he agreed with Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> that bribery, corruption, or a wilful and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary infraction of the law, were the only true cauſes for inſtituting a proſecution of that nature; and his candor readily induced him to believe, that as none of theſe had been proved, neither did any of them actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſt on this occaſion. But, he ſaid, it was due to the deareſt intereſts of poſterity, that the legiſlature ſhould act with that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, ſhould decide with that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which, leading on the one hand, to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021363_0014_0FB36103A90115E8"/>
an acquittal of the judges, did not tend, on the other, to eſtabliſh a baneful and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precedent. It was in this point of view, that the preſent proceeding preſented itſelf to his mind, as a matter of the greateſt magnitude and importance; and he ſaid it were better far that Col. <hi>Oſwald</hi> had ſuffered in ſilence and obſcurity, than that the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the legiſlature ſhould be awakened, only to give additional ſtrength and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the miſtaken judgment of the court.</p>
            <p>That it was a miſtaken judgment, every man, he alledged, who poſſeſſed a competent ſhare of common ſenſe, and underſtood the rules of grammar, was able to determine on a bare peruſal of the bill of rights and conſtitution. With theſe aids, he defied all the ſophiſtry of the ſchools, and the jargon of the law, to pervert or corrupt the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit language of the text; and therefore he regretted, that in liſtening to the ingenuity of Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s paraphraſe, his admiration was not neceſſarily followed by conviction.</p>
            <p>He then diſcuſſed the 9<hi>ſect.</hi> of the bill of rights, which provides,
<q>that in all proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for criminal offences a man hath a right to be heard by himſelf and his council, to demand the cauſe and nature of his accuſation, to be confronted with the witneſſes, to call for evidence in his favour, and a ſpeedy public trial, by an impartial jury of the country, without the unanimous conſent of which jury he cannot be found guilty, nor can he be compelled to give evidence againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor can any man be juſtly deprived of his liberty except by the laws of the land or the judgment of his peers.</q>
He ſaid, that in theſe expreſſions, there was nothing ambiguous or uncertain; they contained a recapitulation of the moſt valuable privileges, in the moſt poſitive language; and they did not require to be illuſtrated, or explained, by the <hi>Roman</hi> inſtitutions, or the <hi>Britiſh</hi> practice. Hither, he obſerved, every man could ſafely reſort, in order to be taught the nature and extent of his rights and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and it would be fatal indeed to the cauſe of liberty, if it was once eſtabliſhed, that the technical learning of a lawyer, is neceſſary to comprehend the principles, laid down in this great political compact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the people and their rulers. Even with reſpect to that clauſe on which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Judges are particularly vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, he did not perceive a reaſonable ground for the diſtinction that was attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but thought, with many other characters of ſuperior information and abilities, that the <hi>law of the land</hi> was not, in fact, contra-diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>judgment of his peers,</hi> but merely a diverſity in the mode of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the ſame thing. He admitted, however, that caſes did exiſt in which it was neceſſary, for the ſake of juſtice, to empower the judges to exerciſe a ſummary authority. For outrages committed in the face of the court, for the miſconduct of its officers, and for a diſobedience or reſiſtance of its proceſs, there ſeemed, he ſaid, to be a propriety in eſtabliſhing an immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. But, this did not extend, in his opinion, to the caſe of conſtructive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; to criminal offences perpetrated out of the view of the court; nor to ſuch acts, as in their nature, did not call for a ſudden puniſhment, and which, in their operation, involved a variety of facts, that a jury were only competent to inveſtigate and determine.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the argument offered by Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> that as <hi>attachments</hi> had iſſued in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> before the revolution; and as the 24 <hi>ſect.</hi> of the conſtitution, declares, that the courts ſhall have all the powers which they uſually exerciſed, therefore the power of proceeding by <hi>attachment</hi> is confirmed, Mr. <hi>Findley</hi> obſerved, that the fallacy of this interpretation, would be notorious, by recollecting that the laſt ſentence of that very ſection, ſtipulates that ſuch powers ſhall not be inconſiſtent with the conſtitution. Nor would he admit the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which had been drawn from the next ſection, that ſays, "trials ſhall be by jury as <hi>heretofore;</hi> for, he ſaid, it appeared by its context and immediate ſubject, that was related to the forms and modes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upon the trial, and not to the caſes in which the trial ought to be allowed.</p>
            <p>Having expatiated, with great energy, upon the different points of the conſtitution, which the ſubject brought into view; having aſſerted the right of every man to publiſh his ſentiments on public proceedings; and having urged the danger of permitting the judges, by implication, to puniſh for offences againſt themſelves (obſerving, that if it was a contempt to write, it was alſo a contempt to ſpeak of a cauſe depending in the courts) he concluded with intimating, that he ſhould take an opportunity of ſubmitting a reſolution to the houſe, which might ſerve to avert the pernicious conſequences of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the caſe of Col. <hi>Oſwald</hi> to grow into precedent.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fitzſimons, now moved the following reſolution.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That this houſe, having, in a committee of the whole, gone into a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the charges exhibited by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azer Oſwald, of arbitrary and oppreſſive
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021363_0015_0FB361052AA8E9E8"/>
proceedings in the juſtices of the ſupreme court againſt the ſaid Eleazer Oſwald, are of opinion, that the charges are unſupported by the teſtimony adduced, and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is no juſt cauſe for impeaching the ſaid juſtices."</p>
            <p>The propoſition contained in this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gave riſe to a ſhort but animated conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. On the one hand, it was ſaid, that, in admitting that there was no ground of impeachment, it was not intended to concede, that the facts repreſented in the memorial had not been proved: and, on the other hand, it was anſwered, that, if there had been proof that the memorialiſt, according to the complaint,
<q>was immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in priſon, without even the ſhadow of a trial, for an imaginary offence,</q>
it would have been the indiſpenſable duty of the legiſlature to vote for an impeachment. A compromiſe, at length, took place, and the committe of the whole agreed to report the following reſolution.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That the charges exhibited by Colonel Eleazer Oſwald againſt the juſtices of the ſupreme court, and the teſtimony given in ſupport of them, are not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground of impeachment."</p>
            <p>But when this report was called up for the deciſion of the houſe, it was poſtponed (and conſequently loſt) on motion of Mr. Clymer, in order to introduce the reſolution original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſed by Mr. <hi>Fitzſimons</hi> in the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee. Mr. <hi>Findley</hi> then claimed the attention of the members, and after a judicious intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, preſented the following reſolutions to the chair, to ſupercede Mr. Clymer's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That the proceedings of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme court againſt Col. Eleazer Oſwald, in puniſhing him by fine and impriſonment, at their diſcretion, for a conſtructive or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied contempt, not committed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the court, nor againſt any officer, or order thereof, but for writing and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing improperly, or indecently, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cauſe depending before the ſupreme court, and reſpecting ſome of the judges of ſaid court, was an unconſtitutional exerciſe of judicial power, and ſets an alarming precedent, of the moſt dangerous conſequence, to the citizens of this commonwealth."</p>
            <p>"Reſolved, That it be ſpecially recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the enſuing General Aſſembly, to define the nature and extent of contempts, and direct their puniſhment."</p>
            <p>An intereſting debate aroſe upon theſe reſolutions, in the courſe of which, much that had been ſaid in the committee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and many new ideas were ſuggeſted, upon the general queſtion of the juriſdiction of the court in caſes of attachment. With reſpect to Mr. <hi>Findley</hi>'s propoſitions, that gentleman ably ſupported them upon the ſpirit of the conſtitution, and the expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the thing itſelf. But it ſeemed to be ſatisfactorily anſwered by Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> 1ſt. That the legiſlative power is confined to <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> the law, and cannot interfere in the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation;</hi> which is the natural and excluſive province of the judicial branch of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: and 2dly, That the recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the ſucceeding aſſembly would be nugatory; for the courts of juſtice derive their powers from the conſtitution, a ſource paramount to the legiſlature; and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, what is given to them by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, cannot be taken from them by the latter.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Findley</hi>'s motions were loſt by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable majority; and Mr. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ymer</hi>'s revived reſolution, adopted by the houſe:</p>
            <p>Yeas 34. Nays 23.</p>
            <p>Thus terminated a buſineſs which for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral weeks agitated the public mind; and which was conſidered of ſo important a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the GENERAL ASSEMBLY of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> at the very cloſe of the laſt ſeſſions of their political exiſtence, and while ſolicited by a multiplicity of other objects of great national concern, devoted all their attention to hear the evidence with impartiality, to diſcuſs the arguments with candor, and to decide upon the merits with integrity and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Of the advantages derived from this ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, the moſt apparent, and the moſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately intereſting, are the certainty which it has given to a title of the law, not, perhaps, ſufficiently underſtood before; and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which it has ſupplied in favor of thoſe who are enruſted with the adminiſtration of juſtice, and whoſe characters, like the chaſtity of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s wife, ſhould be free even from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion. But there is another point of view, in which the patriotic eye will regard the beneficial influence of theſe tranſactions; for, when we behold the legiſlative authority of the ſtate, liſtening, as in an act of duty, to the complaints of an individual citizen againſt a ſiſter branch of the government, and not only able, but willing, to redreſs any wrongs that have been ſuſtained; the emotions of gratitude and veneration will naturally ſwell the mind; every man muſt feel a pride and intereſt in ſupporting thoſe laws which ſo amply protect him; and, while he contemplates the ſyſtem of freedom under which he lives, he will at length be taught to convert a pious wiſh, into an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rule of action: ESTO PERPETUA!</p>
