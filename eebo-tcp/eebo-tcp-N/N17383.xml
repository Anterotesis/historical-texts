         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe reaſons will not ſubſiſt long; and as he ſeems to intimate a deſign, on his return to England, of publiſhing an entire tranſlation of Cao-Tſou's whole journey, the Public will then, in all probability, have an opportunity of being ſatisfied concerning any particulars which they may be curious to know.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>IN the laſt letter which I had the honor of writing to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, dated December <hi>23, 1748,</hi> I think I concluded all I had to ſay in regard to the topography and natural hiſtory of this great empire. I purpoſed in this, and ſome ſucceeding ones, to have ſet down ſuch obſervations as I have been able to make on the laws, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, religion, and manners of the people. But a remarkable occurrence has happened lately, which engroſſes the converſation of the literati here, and may hereafter, perhaps, afford matter of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation to the learned in Europe. As it is of a nature which I know will furniſh ſome entertainment to your Lordſhip, I will endeavour to give you as diſtinct and particular an account of it as I have been able to obtain.</p>
                  <p>Adjoining to China on the weſt, is the large country of Thibet, called by ſome Barantola. In a province of this country, named Laſa, reſides the Grand Lama, or High Prieſt of theſe idolaters; who is reverenced, and even adored as a God, by moſt of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring nations. The high opinion which is entertained of his ſacred character, induces prodigious numbers of religious people to reſort to Laſa, to pay their homage to him, and to give him preſents, in order to receive his bleſſing. His reſidence is in a moſt magnificent pagod, or temple, built on the top of the mountain Poutala. The foot of this mountain, and even the whole diſtrict of Laſa, is inhabited by an incredible number of Lamas of different ranks and orders; ſeveral of whom have very grand pagods erected to their honor, in which they receive a kind of inferior worſhip. The whole country, like Italy, abounds with prieſts; and they entirely ſubſiſt on the great number of rich preſents which are ſent them from the utmoſt extent of Tartary, from the empire of the Great Mogul, and from almoſt all parts of the Indies. When the Grand Lama receives the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people, he is raiſed on a magnificent altar, and ſits croſs-legged upon a ſplendid cuſhion. His worſhippers proſtrate themſelves before him, in the humbleſt and moſt abject manner; but he returns not the leaſt ſign of reſpect, nor ever ſpeaks even to the greateſt princes. He only lays his hand upon their heads, and they are fully perſuaded that they receive from thence a full for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of all their ſins. They are likewiſe ſo extravagant as to
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:022469_0008_0FB92099502FF778"/>
imagine, that he knows all things, even the ſecrets of the heart; and his particular diſciples, being a ſelect number of about two hundred of the moſt eminent Lamas, have the addreſs to make the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is immortal; and that, whenever he appears to die, he only changes his abode, and animates a new body.</p>
                  <p>The learned in China have long been of opinion, that, in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieves of this grand temple, ſome very ancient books have for many ages been concealed; and the preſent Emperor, who is very curious in ſearching after the writings of antiquity, became at length ſo fully convinced of the probability of this opinion, that he determined to try whether any diſcovery of this ſort could be made. To this end, his firſt care was, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He at length pitched upon one of the Haulins, or doctors of the firſt order, whoſe name was Cao-Tſou; a man about fifty years of age, of a grave and noble aſpect, of great eloquence, and who, by an accidental friendſhip with a certain learned Lama, who had reſided many years at Peking, was become entirely maſter of the language which the Lamas of Thibet uſe among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>With theſe qualifications be ſet forward on his journey; and, to give his commiſſion the greater weight, the Emperor honoured him with the title of <hi>COLAO,</hi> or Prime-miniſter: To which he added a moſt magnificent equipage and attendants, with preſents for the Grand Lama, and the other principal Lamas, of an immenſe value; alſo a letter, written with his own hand, in the following terms:—</p>

books, which, from their great antiquity, are become to the generality, even of the learned, almoſt wholly unintelligible; in order, as far as in us lies, to prevent their being totally loſt, we have thought proper to authoriſe and employ our moſt learned and reſpected miniſter, Cao-Tſou, in this our preſent embaſſy to thy Sublime Holineſs. The buſineſs of which is, to deſire, that he may be permitted to read and examine the ſaid writings—we expecting, from his great and uncommon ſkill in the ancient languages, that he will be able to interpret whatever may be found, though of the higheſt and moſt obſcure antiquity. And we have commanded him to throw himſelf at thy feet, with ſuch teſtimonies of our reſpect, as, we truſt, will procure him the admittance we deſire.</p>

                  <p>I will not detain your Lordſhip with any particulars of his journey, though he hath publiſhed a large account of it, abounding with many ſurpriſing relations, and which, at my return to England, I may probably tranſlate and publiſh entire. Let it ſuffice at preſent, that, when he arrived in theſe ſacred territories, the magnificence of his appearance, and the richneſs of his preſents, failed not to gain him a ready admiſſion. He had apartments appointed him in the ſacred college, and was aſſiſted in his enquiries by one of the moſt learned Lamas. He continued there near ſix months: during which time, he had the ſatisfaction of finding many valuable pieces of antiquity; from ſome of which he hath made very curious extracts, and hath formed ſuch probable conjectures concerning their authors, and the times wherein they were written, as proves him to be a man of great judgment and penetration, as well as moſt extenſive reading.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt ancient piece he hath diſcovered, and which none of the Lamas for many ages had been able to interpret or underſtand, is a ſmall ſyſtem of morality, written in the language and character of the ancient Gymnoſophiſts or Bramins; but by what particular perſon, or in what time, he does not pretend to determine. This piece, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he wholly tranſlated, though, as he himſelf confeſſes, with an utter incapacity of reaching, in the Chineſe language, the ſtrength and ſublimity of the original. The judgments and opinions of the bonzes and the learned doctors, are every much divided concerning it. Thoſe who admire it the moſt highly, are very fond of attributing it to Confucius, their own great philoſopher; and get over the difficulty of its being written in the language and character of the ancient Bramins, by ſuppoſing this to be only a tranſlation, and that the original work of Confucius is loſt. Some will have it to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes of Laokinn, another Chineſe philoſopher, cotemporary with Confucius, and founder of the ſect Tao-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the ſame difficulty, in regard to the language, with thoſe who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to Confucius. There are others, who, from ſome particular marks and ſentiments which they find in it, ſuppoſe it to be written by the Bramin Dandamis, whoſe famous letter to Alexander the Great, is recorded by the European writers. With theſe Cao-Tſou himſelf ſeems moſt inclined to agree; at leaſt ſo far as to think, that it is really the work of ſome ancient Bramin; being fully perſuaded, from the ſpirit with which it is written, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> it is no tranſlation. One thing, however, occaſions ſome doubt amongſt them; and that is, the plan of it; which is entirely new to the Eaſtern people, and ſo unlike any thing they have ever ſeen, that, if it was not for ſome turns of expreſſion peculiar to the Eaſt, and the impoſſibility of accounting for its being written in this very ancient language, many would ſuppoſe it to be the work of an European.</p>
                  <p>But whoever was the writer of it, the great noiſe which it makes in this city, and all over the empire, the eagerneſs with which it is read by all kinds of people, and the high encomiums which are given to it by ſome, at length determined me to attempt a tranſlation of it into Engliſh; eſpecially as I was perſuaded it would be an agreeable preſent to your Lordſhip. And I was the more eaſily induced to make this trial, as, very happily for me, you cannot judge how far I have fallen ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

One thing, however, it may perhaps be neceſſary to apologize for, at leaſt to give ſome account of; and that is, the ſtyle and manner in which I have tranſlated it. I can aſſure your Lordſhip, that when I firſt ſat down to the work, I had not the leaſt intention of doing it in this way; but the ſublime manner of thinking which appeared in the Introduction, the great energy of expreſſion and the ſhortneſs of the ſentences, naturally led me into this kind of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <p>Lo! yonder ſtandeth the houſe of joy. It is painted on the out-ſide, and looketh gay; thou mayeſt know it by the continual noiſe of mirth and exultation that iſſueth from it.</p>
                        <p>The miſtreſs ſtandeth at the door, and calleth aloud to all who paſs by; ſhe ſingeth, and ſhouteth, and laugheth without ceaſing.</p>

                        <p>They call themſelves the ſons of Joy, they laugh and ſeem delighted; but madneſs and folly are in all their doings.</p>
                        <p>They are linked with miſchief hand in hand, and their ſteps lead down to evil. Dangers beſet them round about, and the pit of deſtruction yawneth beneath their feet.</p>
                        <p>Look now on the other ſide; and behold, in that vale over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed with trees, and hid from the fight of men, the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſorrow.</p>

                        <p>True wiſdom is leſs preſuming than folly. The wiſe man doubteth often, and changeth his mind: The fool is obſtinate, and doubteth not; he knoweth all things, but his own ignorance.</p>
                        <p>The pride of emptineſs is an abomination; and to talk much, is the fooliſhneſs of folly: Nevertheleſs, it is the part of wiſdom to bear the impertinence of fools, to hear their abſurdities with patience, and pity their weakneſs.</p>

                        <p>The wiſe man feeleth his imperfections, and is humbled; he laboureth in vain for his own approbation. But the fool peepeth in the ſhallow ſtream of his own mind, and is pleaſed with the pebbles which he ſeeth at the bottom: He bringeth them up, and ſheweth them as pearls; and with the applauſe of his brethren, delighteth he himſelf.</p>
                        <p>He boaſteth of attainments in things that are of no worth; but where it is a ſhame to be ignorant, there he hath no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>

                        <p>THE man to whom God hath given riches, and bleſſed with a mind to employ them aright, is peculiarly favoured, and highly diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                        <p>He looketh on his wealth with pleaſure, becauſe it affordeth him the means to do good.</p>
                        <p>He protecteth the poor that are injured, he ſuffereth not the mighty to oppreſs the weak.</p>
                        <p>He ſeeketh out objects of compaſſion; he enquireth into their wants; he relieveth them with judgment, and without oſtentation.</p>
                        <p>He aſſiſteth and rewardeth merit; he encourageth ingenuity, and liberally promoteth every uſeful deſign.</p>
                        <p>He carrieth on great works, his country is enriched, and the labourer is employed; he formeth new ſchemes, and the arts receive improvement</p>
                        <p>He conſidereth the ſuperfluities of his table, as belonging to the poor of his neighbourhood, and he defraudeth them not.</p>
                        <p>The benevolence of his mind is not checked by his fortune; he rejoiceth therefore in riches, and his joy is blameleſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="33" facs="unknown:022469_0031_0FB920CE14332C50"/>But woe unto him that heapeth up wealth in abundance, and rejoiceth alone in the poſſeſſion thereof;</p>
                        <p>That grindeth the face of the poor, and conſidereth not the ſweat of their brows;</p>
                        <p>He thriveth on oppreſſion without feeling; the ruin of his brother diſturbeth him not.</p>
                        <p>The tears of the orphan he drinketh as milk, the cries of the widow are muſic to his ear.</p>
                        <p>His heart is hardened with the love of wealth; no grief nor diſtreſs can make impreſſion upon it.</p>
                        <p>But the curſe of iniquity purſueth him: He liveth in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fear; the anxiety of his mind, and the rapacious deſires of his own ſoul, take vengeance upon him, for the calamities he hath brought upon others.</p>
                        <p>O! what are the miſeries of poverty, in compariſon with the gnawings of this man's heart?</p>
                        <p>Let the poor man comfort himſelf, yea, rejoice; for he hath many reaſons.</p>
                        <p>He ſitteth down to his morſel in peace; his table is not crowded with flatterers and devourers.</p>
                        <p>He is not embarraſſed with a train of dependants, not teaſed with the clamours of ſolicitation.</p>
                        <p>Debarred from the dainties of the rich, he eſcapeth alſo their diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>The bread that he eateth, is it not ſweet to his taſte? the water he drinketh, is it not pleaſant to his thirſt? yea far more delicious than the richeſt draughts of the luxurious.</p>
                        <p>His labour preſerveth his health, and produceth him a repoſe to which the downy bed of ſloth is a ſtranger.</p>
                        <p>He limiteth his deſires with humility; and the calm of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is ſweeter to his ſoul, than the acquirements of wealth and grandeur.</p>
                        <p>Let not the rich therefore preſume on his riches, nor the poor deſpond in his poverty; for the providence of God diſpenſeth happineſs to them both, and the diſtribution thereof is more equally made than the fool can believe.</p>

                        <p>THE bleſſings, O Man! of thy external part, are health, vigour, and proportion. The greateſt of theſe is health. What health is to the body, even that is honeſty to the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>That thou haſt a ſoul, is of all knowledge the moſt certain, of all truths the moſt plain unto thee. Be meek, be grateful for it. Seek not to know it perfectly. It is inſcrutable.</p>
                        <p>Thinking, underſtanding, reaſoning, willing, call not theſe the ſoul. They are its actions, but they are not its eſſence.</p>
                        <p>Raiſe it not too high, that thou be not deſpiſed. Be not thou like unto thoſe that fall by climbing, neither debaſe it to the ſenſe of brutes; nor be thou like to the horſe and the mule, in whom there is no underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>Search it by its faculties, know it by its virtues. They are more in number than the hairs of thy head; the ſtars of Heaven are not to be counted with them.</p>
                        <p>Think not with Arabia, that one ſoul is parted among all men; neither believe thou with the ſons of Egypt, that every man hath many: Know, that as thy heart, ſo alſo thy ſoul is one.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="50" facs="unknown:022469_0045_0FB920E6F508B0D0"/>Doth not the ſun harden the clay? Doth it not alſo ſoften the wax? As it is one ſun that worketh both, even ſo it is one ſoul that willeth contraries.</p>
                        <p>As the moon retaineth her nature, though darkneſs ſpread itſelf before her face as a curtain; ſo the ſoul remaineth perfect, even in the boſom of the fool.</p>
                        <p>She is immortal; ſhe is unchangeable; ſhe is alike in all. Health calleth her forth to ſhew her livelineſs, and application anointeth her with the oil of wiſdom.</p>
                        <p>Although ſhe ſhall live after thee, think not ſhe was born before thee. She was concreated with thy fleſh, and formed with thy brain.</p>
                        <p>Juſtice could not give her to thee exalted by virtues, nor mercy deliver her to thee deformed by vices. Theſe muſt be thine, and thou muſt anſwer them.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſe not death can ſhield thee from examination; think not corruption can hide thee from enquiry. He who formed thee of thou knoweſt not what, can he not raiſe thee from thou knoweſt not what again?</p>
                        <p>Perceiveth not the cock the hour of midnight? Exalteth he not his voice, to tell thee it is morning? Knoweth not the dog the footſteps of his maſter? and flieth not the wounded goat unto the herb that healeth him? Yet when theſe die, their ſpirit returneth to the duſt: Thine alone ſurviveth.</p>
                        <p>Envy not theſe of their ſenſes, becauſe quicker than thine own. Learn that the advantage lieth not in poſſeſſing good things, but in knowing to uſe them.</p>
                        <p>Hadſt thou the ear of the ſtag, or were thine eye as ſtrong and piercing as the eagle's; didſt thou equal the hound in ſmell, or could the ape reſign to thee his taſte, or the tortoiſe her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet, without reaſon, what would they avail thee? Periſh not all theſe like their kindred?</p>
                        <p>Hath any one of them the gift of ſpeech? Can any ſay unto thee, Therefore did I ſo?</p>
                        <p>The lips of the wiſe are as the doors of a cabinet; no ſooner are they opened, but treaſures are poured out before thee.</p>
                        <p>Like unto trees of gold arranged in beds of ſilver, are wiſe ſentences uttered in due ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>Canſt thou think too greatly of thy ſoul? or can too much be ſaid in its praiſe? It is the image of him who gave it.</p>
                        <p>Remember thou its dignity for ever; forget not how great a talent is committed to thy charge.</p>
                        <p>Whatſoever may do good, may alſo do harm. Beware that thou direct its courſe to virtue.</p>

                        <p>Her motion is perpetual; her attempts are univerſal; her agility is not to be ſuppreſſed. Is it at the uttermoſt part of the earth? ſhe will have it: Is it beyond the region of the ſtars? yet will her eye diſcover it.</p>
                        <p>Enquiry is her delight. As one who traverſeth the burning ſands in ſearch of water, ſo is the ſoul that thirſteth after knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Guard her, for ſhe is raſh; reſtrain her, for ſhe is irregular; correct her, for ſhe is outrageous: More ſupple is ſhe than water, more flexible than wax, more yielding than air. Is there aught that can bind her?</p>
                        <p>As a ſword in the hand of a madman, even ſo is the ſoul to him who wanteth diſcretion.</p>
                        <p>The end of her ſearch is truth; her means to diſcover it, are reaſon and experience. But are not theſe weak, uncertain and fallacious? How then ſhall ſhe attain unto it?</p>
                        <p>General opinion is no proof of truth; for the generality of men are ignorant.</p>
                        <p>Perception of thyſelf, the knowledge of him who created thee, the ſenſe of the worſhip thou oweſt unto him; are not theſe plain before thy face? And, behold! what is there more than man needeth to know?</p>

                        <p>When thy bed is ſtraw, thou ſleepeſt in ſecurity; but when thou haſt ſtretched thyſelf on roſes, beware of the thorns.</p>
                        <p>A good death is better than an evil life: Strive to live, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as long as thou oughteſt, not as long as thou canſt.</p>
                        <p>While thy life is to others worth more than thy death, it is thy duty to preſerve it.</p>
                        <p>Complain not with the fool, of the ſhortneſs of thy time: Remember, that with thy days, thy cares are ſhortened.</p>
                        <p>Take from the period of thy life the uſeleſs parts of it, and what remaineth? Take off the time of thine infancy, the ſecond infancy of age, thy ſleep, thy thoughtleſs hours, thy days of ſickneſs; and, even at the fullneſs of years, how few ſeaſons haſt thou truly numbered.</p>
                        <p>He who gave thee life as a bleſſing, ſhortened it to make it more ſo. To what end would longer life have ſerved thee? Wiſheſt thou to have had an opportunity of more vices? As to the good, will not he who limited thy ſpan, be ſatisfied with the fruits of it?</p>

                        <p>Labour not after riches firſt, and think thou afterwards wilt enjoy them. He who neglecteth the preſent moment, throweth away all that he hath.

                        <p>What then is life, that man ſhould deſire it? what breathing, that he ſhould covet it?</p>
                        <p>Is it not a ſeene of deluſion, a ſeries of miſadventure, a purſuit of evils linked on all ſides together? In the beginning it is ignorance; pain is in its middle, and its end is ſorrow. As one wave puſheth on another, till both are involved in that behind them, even ſo ſucceedeth evil to evil in the life of man; the greater and the preſent ſwallow up the leſſer and the paſt. Our terrors are real evils; our expectations look forward into impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities.</p>

                        <p>NATURE urgeth thee to inconſtancy, O man! There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, guard thyſelf at all times againſt it.</p>
                        <p>Thou art, from the womb of thy mother, various and waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. From the loins of thy father, inheriteſt thou inſtability: How then ſhalt thou be firm?</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who gave thee a body, furniſhed it with weakneſs; but he who gave thee a ſoul, armed thee with reſolution. Employ it, and thou art wiſe; be wiſe, and thou art happy.</p>
                        <p>Let him who doth well, beware how he boaſteth of it; for rarely is it of his own will.</p>
                        <p>Is not the event of an impulſe from without born of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, enforced by accident, dependent on ſomewhat elſe? To theſe then, and to accident, is due the praiſe.</p>
                        <p>Beware of irreſolution in the intent of thy actions, beware of inſtability in the execution; ſo ſhalt though triumph over two great failings of thy nature.</p>
                        <p>What reproacheth reaſon more than to act contrarieties? What can ſurpreſs the tendencies to theſe, but firmneſs of mind?</p>
                        <p>The inconſtant feeleth that he changeth, but he knoweth not why; he ſeeth that he eſcapeth from himſelf, but he perceiveth not how. Be thou incapable of change in that which is right, and men will rely upon thee.</p>
                        <p>Eſtabliſh unto thyſelf principles of action; and ſee that thou ever act according to them.</p>
                        <p>Firſt know that thy principles are juſt, and then be thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible in the path of them.</p>
                        <p>So ſhall thy paſſions have no rule over thee; ſo ſhall thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy enſure unto thee the good thou poſſeſſeſt, and drive from thy door misfortune. Anxiety and diſoppointment ſhall be ſtrangers to thy gates.</p>
                        <p>Suſpect not evil in any one, until thou ſeeſt it; when thou ſeeſt it, forget it not.</p>
                        <p>Whoſo hath been an enemy, will not eaſily be a friend: for a man mendeth not ſoon of his faults.</p>
                        <p>How ſhould his actions be right, who hath no rule of life? Nothing can be juſt, which proceedeth not from reaſon.</p>
                        <p>The inconſtant hath no peace in his ſoul; neither can any be at eaſe, whom he concerneth himſelf with.</p>
                        <p>His life is unequal; his motions are irregular; his ſoul changeth like the weather.</p>

                        <p>Who ſhall ſay of the inconſtant, He is joyful, when his next breath ſhall be ſpent in ſighing?</p>
                        <p>What is the life of ſuch a man, but the phantom of a dream? In the morning he riſeth happy, at noon he is on the rack; this hour he is a god, the next below a worm; one moment he laugheth, the next he weepeth; he now willeth, in an inſtant he willeth not, and in another he knoweth not whether he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth or not.</p>
                        <p>Yet neither eaſe nor pain have fixed themſelves on him: Neither is he waxed greater, or become leſs; neither hath he had cauſe for laughter, nor reaſon for his ſorrow: Therefore ſhall none of them abide with him.</p>
                        <p>The happineſs of the inconſtant is as a palace built on the ſurface of the ſand; the blowing of the wind carrieth away its foundation; What wonder then that it falleth?</p>
                        <p>But what exalted form is this, that hitherward directs its even, its uninterrupted courſe; whoſe foot is on the earth, whoſe head above the clouds?</p>
                        <p>On his brow ſitteth majeſty; ſteadineſs is in his port; and in his heart reigneth tranquility.</p>
                        <p>Though obſtacles appear in the way, he deigneth not to look down upon them; though heaven and earth oppoſe his paſſage, he proceedeth.</p>
                        <p>The mountains ſink beneath his tread; the waters of the ocean are dried up under the ſole of his foot.</p>
                        <p>The tyger throweth herſelf acroſs his way in vain; the ſpots of the leopard glow againſt him unregarded.</p>
                        <p>He marcheth through the embattled legions; with his hand he putteth aſide the terrors of death.</p>
                        <p>Storms roar againſt his ſhoulders, but are not able to ſhake them; the thunder burſteth over his head in vain; the lightning ſerveth but to ſhew the glories of his countenance.</p>

                        <p>VAIN and inconſtant as thou art, O child of imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! how canſt thou but be weak? Is not inconſtancy connected with frailty? Can there be vanity without infirmity? Avoid the danger of the one, and thou ſhalt eſcape the miſchiefs of the other.</p>
                        <p>Wherein art thou moſt weak? in that wherein thou ſeemeſt moſt ſtrong; in that wherein moſt thou glorieſt; even in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the things which thou haſt; in uſing the good that is about thee.</p>
                        <p>Are not thy deſires alſo frail? or knoweſt thou even what it is thou wouldeſt wiſh? When thou haſt obtained what moſt thou ſoughteſt after, behold it contenteth thee not.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore loſeth the pleaſure that is before thee, its reliſh? and why appeareth that which is yet to come, the ſweeter? Becauſe thou art wearied with the good of this, becauſe thou knoweſt not the evil of that which is not with thee. Know, that to be content, is to be happy.</p>
                        <p>Couldſt thou chuſe for thyſelf, would thy Creator lay before thee all that thine heart could aſk for: Would happineſs then remain with thee? Or would joy dwell always in thy gates?</p>
                        <p>Alas! thy weakneſs forbiddeth it; thy infirmity declareth againſt it. Variety is to thee in the place of pleaſure; but that which permanently delighteth, muſt be permanent.</p>
                        <p>When it is gone, thou repenteſt the loſs of it; though while it was with thee, thou deſpiſedſt it.</p>
                        <p>That which ſucceedeth it, hath no more pleaſure for thee; and thou afterwards quarrelleſt with thyſelf for preferring it: Behold the only circumſtance in which thou erreſt not!</p>

                        <p>Good things ceaſe to be good in our enjoyment of them. What nature meant pure ſweets, are ſources of bitterneſs to us; from our delights ariſe pain; from our joys, ſorrow.</p>

                        <p>God hath given thee no good without its admixture of evil; but he hath given thee alſo the means of throwing off the evil from it.</p>
                        <p>As joy is not without its allay of pain, ſo neither is ſorrow without its portion of pleaſure. Joy and grief, though unlike, are united. Our own choice only can give them to us entire.</p>

                        <p>The beſt things in the hands of a fool may be turned to his deſtruction; and out of the worſt, the wiſe will find the means of good.</p>
                        <p>So blended is weakneſs in thy nature, O man! that thou haſt not ſtrength either to be good, or to be evil entirely. Rejoice that thou canſt not excel in evil, and let the good that is within thy reach content thee.</p>
                        <p>The virtues are allotted to various ſtations. Seek not after impoſſibilities, nor grieve that thou canſt not poſſeſs them all.</p>
                        <p>Wouldſt thou at once have the liberality of the rich, and the contentment of the poor? or ſhould the wife of thy boſom be deſpiſed, becauſe ſhe ſheweth not the virtues of the widow?</p>

                        <p>Know thou, notwithſtanding, that in this is error.—Cuſtom cannot alter the nature of truth; neither can the opinion of man deſtroy juſtice: The glory and the ſhame are miſplaced.</p>

                        <p>PRIDE and meanneſs ſeem incompatible, but man recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileth contrarieties; he is at once the moſt amiable and the moſt arrogant of all creatures.</p>
                        <p>Preſumption is the bane of reaſon; it is the nurſe of error; yet it is congenial with reaſon in us.</p>
                        <p>Who is there that judgeth not either too highly of himſelf, or thinketh not to meanly of others?</p>
                        <p>Our Creator himſelf eſcapeth not our preſumption: How then ſhall we be ſafe from one another.</p>
                        <p>What is the origin of ſuperſtition? and whence ariſeth falſe worſhip? From our preſuming to reaſon about what is above our reach, to comprehend what is incomprehenſible.</p>
                        <p>Limited and weak as our underſtandings are, we employ not even their little forces as we ought; we ſoar not high enough in our approaches to God's greatneſs, we give not wing enough to our ideas, when we enter into the adoration of Divinity.</p>
                        <p>Man, who fears to breathe a whiſper againſt his earthly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, trembles not to arraign the diſpenſations of his God; He forgetteth his majeſty, and rejudgeth his judgments.</p>
                        <p>He who dareth not repeat the name of his prince without honour, yet bluſheth not to call that of his Creator to be witneſs to a lye.</p>
                        <p>He who would hear the ſentence of the magiſtrate with ſilence, yet dareth to plead with the Eternal: He attempteth to ſoothe him with intreaties, to flatter him with promiſes, to agree with him upon conditions; nay, to brave and murmur at him if his requeſt is not granted.</p>
                        <p>Why art thou unpuniſhed, O man! in thy impiety, but that this is not the day of retribution?</p>
                        <p>Be not like unto thoſe who fight with the thunder; nor dare thou to deny thy Creator thy prayers, becauſe he chaſtiſeth thee. Thy madneſs is on thine own head in this; thy impiety hurteth no one but thyſelf.</p>
                        <p>Why boaſteth man, that he is the favourite of his Maker; yet neglecteth to pay his thanks, his adorations for it? How ſuiteth ſuch a life with a belief ſo haughty?

                        <p>While he courts the rays of the ſun to warm him, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it made only to be of uſe to him; while he traceth the moon in her nightly path, he believeth ſhe was created to do him pleaſure.</p>

                        <p>RICHES are not worthy a ſtrong attention; therefore an earneſt care of obtaining them is unjuſtifiable.</p>
                        <p>The deſire of what man calleth good, the joy he taketh in poſſeſſing it, is grounded only in opinion. Take not up that from the vulgar; examine the worth of things thyſelf, and thou ſhalt not be covetous.</p>
                        <p>An immoderate deſire of riches, is a poiſon lodged in the ſoul. It contaminates and deſtroys every thing that was good in it. It is no ſooner rooted there than all virtue, all honeſty, all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection, fly before the face of it.</p>
                        <p>The covetous would ſell his children for gold; his parent might die ere he would open his coffer; nay, he conſidereth not himſelf in reſpect of it; in the ſearch of happineſs, he maketh himſelf unhappy.</p>
                        <p>As the man who ſelleth his houſe to purchaſe ornaments for the embelliſhment of it; even ſo is he who giveth up peace in the ſearch of riches, in hope he may be happy in enjoying them.</p>
                        <p>Where covetouſneſs reigneth, know that the ſoul is poor. Whoſo accounteth not riches the principal good of man, will not throw away all other goods in the purſuit of them.</p>
                        <p>Whoſo feareth not poverty as the greateſt evil of his nature, will not purchaſe to himſelf all other evils in the avoiding of it.</p>
                        <p>Thou fool! is not virtue of more worth than riches? is not guilt more baſe than poverty? Enough for his neceſſities is in the power of every man; be content with it, and thy happineſs ſhall ſmile at the ſorrows of him who heapeth up more.</p>

Meaneth ſhe not by this to inform thee, that gold is not worthy thy regard, that ſilver is beneath thy notice?</p>
                        <p>Covetouſneſs burieth under ground millions of wretches; theſe dig for their hard maſters, what returneth the injury? what maketh them more miſerable than their ſlaves?</p>
                        <p>The earth is barren of good things where ſhe hoardeth up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Where gold is in her bowels, there no herb groweth.</p>
                        <p>As the horſe findeth not there his graſs, nor the mule his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender; as the fields of corn laugh not on the ſides of the hills; as the olive holdeth not forth there her fruits, nor the vine her cluſters: Even ſo no good dwelleth in the breaſt of him, whoſe heart broodeth over his treaſure.</p>
                        <p>Riches are ſervants to the wiſe; but they are tyrants over the ſoul of the fool.</p>
                        <p>The covetous ſerveth his gold; it ſerveth not him. He poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth his wealth, as the ſick doth a fever; it burneth and tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, and will not quit him unto death.</p>
                        <p>Hath not gold deſtroyed the virtue of millions? did it ever add to the goodneſs of any? Is it not moſt abundant with the worſt of men? wherefore then ſhouldſt thou deſire to be diſtinguiſhed by poſſeſſing it? Have not the wiſeſt been thoſe who have had leaſt of it? and is not wiſdom happineſs?</p>
                        <p>Have not the worſt of thy ſpecies poſſeſſed the greateſt portions of it? and hath not their end been miſerable?</p>
                        <p>Poverty wanteth many things; but covetouſneſs denieth itſelf all.</p>
                        <p>The covetous, can be good to no man; but he is to none ſo cruel as to himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Be induſtrious to procure gold, and be generous in the diſpoſal of it. Man never is ſo happy, as when he giveth happineſs unto another.</p>

                        <p>THE root of revenge is in the weakneſs of the ſoul; the moſt abject and timorous are the moſt addicted to it.</p>
                        <p>Who torture thoſe they hate, but cowards? Who murder thoſe they rob, but the baſe and timid?</p>
                        <p>The feeling an injury, muſt be previous to the revenging it: but the noble mind diſdaineth to ſay it hurts me.</p>
                        <p>If the injury is not below thy notice, he that doth it unto thee, in that maketh himſelf ſo: Wouldſt thou enter the liſts with thine inferior?</p>
                        <p>Requite with kindneſs the man who attempteth to wrong thee: do good to him who would give thee diſquiet.</p>
                        <p>In this thou not only preſerveſt thine own peace, but thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteſt puniſhment, without ſtooping to employ revenge againſt him.</p>
                        <p>As the tempeſt and the thunder affect not the ſun or the ſtars, but ſpend their fury on ſtones and trees below; ſo injuries aſcend not to the ſouls of the great, but waſte themſelves on ſuch as thoſe are who offer them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="71" facs="unknown:022469_0066_0FB9210AD3D627D0"/>Poorneſs of ſpirit will actuate revenge; greatneſs of ſoul deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth the offence: nay, it doth good unto him who intended to have diſburbed it.</p>
                        <p>Why ſeekeſt thou vengeance, O man! with what purpoſe is it that thou purſueſt it? Thinkeſt thou to pain thine adverſary by it? Know, that thyſelf feeleſt its greateſt torment.</p>
                        <p>Revenge gnaweth the heart of him who is infected with it; while he againſt whom it is intended, remaineth eaſy.</p>
                        <p>It is unjuſt in the anguiſh it inflicts; therefore, Nature intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not for thee: Needeth he who is injured, more pain? or ought he to add force to the affliction which another hath caſt upon him?</p>
                        <p>The man who meditateth revenge, is not content with the miſchief he hath received; he addeth to his anguiſh the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due unto another: While he whom he ſeeketh to hurt, goeth his way laughing; he maketh himſelf merry at this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his miſery.</p>
                        <p>Revenge is painful in the intent, and it is dangerous in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: Seldom doth the axe fall, where he who lifteth it up intended; and lo! he remembereth not that it muſt recoil againſt himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt the revengeful ſeeketh his enemy's hurt, be oftentimes procureth his own deſtruction; while he aimeth at one of the eyes of his adverſary, lo! he putteth out both his own.</p>
                        <p>If he attain not his end, he lamenteth it; if he ſucceed, he repenteth of it: The fear of juſtice taketh away the peace of his own ſoul; the care to hide him from it, deſtroyeth that of his friend.</p>
                        <p>Can the death of thine adverſary ſatiate thy hatred? Can the ſetting him at reſt reſtore thy peace?</p>
                        <p>Wouldſt thou make him ſorry for the offence, conquer him, by ſparing him: In death he owneth not thy ſuperiority; nor feeleth he any more the power of thy wrath.</p>
                        <p>In revenge, there ſhould be a triumph of the avenger; and he who hath injured him, ſhould feel his diſpleaſure: He ſhould ſuffer pain from it, and ſhould repent him of the cauſe.</p>
                        <p>This is the revenge inſpired from anger; but that which make thee greater, is to repay injuries with kindneſs.</p>
                        <p>Murder for an injury, ariſeth only from cowardice: He who inflicteth it feareth that the enemy may live, and avenge himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Death endeth the quarrel; but it reſtoreth not the reputation: Killing is an act of caution, not of courage; it is ſafe, but it is not honourable.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing ſo eaſy as to revenge an offence, but nothing is ſo honourable as to pardon it.</p>

                        <p>Good offices will make a man aſhamed to be thine enemy; greatneſs of ſoul will terrify him from the thought of hurting thee.</p>
                        <p>The greater the wrong, the more glory is in pardoning it; and by how much the more juſtifiable would be revenge, by ſo much the more honour is in clemency,</p>

                        <p>Men diſown it as not of their nature; they are aſhamed of it, as a ſtranger to their hearts: Do they not call it inhumanity?</p>

                        <p>He who feareth all, ſtriketh at all: why are tyrants cruel, but becauſe they live in terror?</p>
                        <p>The our will tear the carcaſe, though be dared not look it in the face while living; the hound that hunteth it to the death, mangleth it not afterwards.</p>

                        <p>That thou mayeſt not be cruel, ſet thyſelf too high for hatred; that thou mayeſt not be inhuman, place thyſelf above the reach or envy.</p>
                        <p>Every man may be viewed in two lights; in one he will be troubleſome, in the other leſs offenſive: Chooſe to ſee him in that which he leaſt hurteth thee, then ſhalt thou not do hurt unto him.</p>
                        <p>What is there that a man may not turn unto his good? In that which offendeth us moſt, there is more ground for complaint than hatred. Man would be reconciled to him of whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth: What murdereth he, but what he hateth?</p>
                        <p>If thou art prevented of a benefit, fly not into a rage; the loſs of thy reaſon is the want of a greater.</p>

                        <p>Man purchaſeth nothing of his ſuperiors, but for a price; and that price, is it not more than the value? Wouldeſt thou pervert the cuſtoms of the world? wouldeſt thou have the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and the price alſo?</p>

                        <head>CHAP. I. NOBILITY and HONOUR.</head>
                        <p>NOBILITY reſideth not but in the ſoul: nor is there true honour except in virtue.</p>
                        <p>The favour of princes may be bought by rank and vices; titles may be purchaſed for money: But theſe are not true honour.</p>
                        <p>Crimes cannot exalt the man who commits them to real glory; neither can gold make men noble.</p>
                        <p>When titles are the reward of virtue, when he is ſet on high who hath ſerved his country; he who beſtoweth the honours hath glory, like as he who receiveth them; and the world is benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it.</p>
                        <p>Wouldſt thou wiſh to be raiſed for men know not what? or wouldſt thou that they ſhould ſay, Why is this?</p>
                        <p>When the virtues of the hero deſcend to his children, his titles accompany them well; but when he who poſſeſſeth them is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like unto him who deſerved them, lo! do they not call him degenerate?</p>
                        <p>Hereditary honour is accounted the moſt noble; but reaſon ſpeaketh in the cauſe of him who hath acquired it.</p>
                        <p>He who, meritleſs himſelf, appealeth to the actions of his anceſtors for his greatneſs, is like the thief who claimeth protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by flying to the pagod.</p>
                        <p>What good is it to the blind, that his parents could ſee? what benefit is it to the dumb, that his grandfather was eloquent? Even ſo, what is it to the mean, that their predeceſſors were noble?</p>
                        <p>A mind diſpoſed to virtue maketh great the poſſeſſor of it; and without titles, it will raiſe him above the vulgar.</p>
                        <p>He will acquire honour, while others receive it; and will he not ſay unto them, Such were the men whom you glory in being derived from?</p>
                        <p>As the ſhadow waiteth on the ſubſtance, even ſo true honour attendeth on virtue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="78" facs="unknown:022469_0073_0FB92116D5389630"/>Say not that honour is the child of boldneſs, nor believe thou that the hazard of life alone can pay the price of it: It is not to the action that it is due, but to the manner of performing it.</p>
                        <p>All are not called to the guiding the helm of ſtate; neither are their armies to be commanded by every one: Do well in that which is committed to thy charge, and praiſe ſhall remain upon thee.</p>
                        <p>Say not that difficulties are neceſſary to be conquered, or that labour and danger muſt be in the way to renown. The woman who is chaſte, is ſhe not praiſed? the man who is honeſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth he not to be honoured?</p>
                        <p>The thirſt of fame is violent; the deſire of honour is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and he who gave them to us, gave them for great purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>When deſperate actions are neceſſary to the public; when our lives are to be expoſed for the good of our country: what can add force to virtue, but ambition?</p>
                        <p>It is not the receiving honour that delighteth the noble mind; its pride is the deſerving it.</p>
                        <p>Is it not better men ſhould ſay, Why hath not this man a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? than that they ſhould aſk, Why he hath one?</p>
                        <p>The ambitious will always be firſt in the croud; he preſſeth forward, he looketh not behind him. More anguiſh is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The root of ambition is in every man; but it riſeth not in all: Fear keepeth it down in ſome; in many it is ſuppreſſed by modeſty.</p>
                        <p>It is the inner garment of the ſoul; the firſt thing put on by it with the fleſh, and the laſt it layeth down at its ſeparation from it.</p>
                        <p>It is an honour to thy nature when worthily employed; when thou directeſt it to wrong purpoſes, it ſhameth and deſtroyeth thee.</p>
                        <p>In the breaſt of the traitor ambition is covered; hypocriſy hideth its face under her mantle; and cool diſſimulation furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it with ſmooth words: but in the end, men ſhall ſee what it is.</p>
                        <p>The ſerpent looſeth not his ſting, tho' benumbed with the froſt; the tooth of the viper is not broken, tho' the cold cloſeth his mouth: Take pity on his ſtate, and he will ſhew thee his ſpirit; warm him in thy boſom, and he will requite thee with death.</p>
                        <p>He that is truly virtuous, loveth virtue for herſelf; he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth the applauſe which ambition aimeth after.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="79" facs="unknown:022469_0074_0FB92118540DD1D0"/>How pitiable were the ſtate of virtue, if ſhe could not be happy but from another's praiſe? She is too noble to ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, and no more will, than can be rewarded.</p>
                        <p>The higher the ſun ariſeth, the leſs ſhadow doth he make: Even ſo the greater is the virtue, the leſt doth it covet praiſe; yet cannot it avoid its reward in honours.</p>
                        <p>Glory, like a ſhadow, flieth him who purſueth it; but it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth at the heels of him who would fly from it: If thou courteſt it without merit, thou ſhalt never attain unto it; if thou deſerveſt it, though thou hideſt thyſelf, it will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee.</p>
                        <p>Purſue that which is honourable, do that which is right; and the applauſe of thine own conſcience will be more joy to thee, than the ſhouts of millions who know not that thou deſerveſt them.</p>

                        <p>What is the ſtudy of words compared with this? In what ſcience is knowledge, but in the ſtudy of nature?</p>
                        <p>When thou haſt adored the fabric, enquire into its uſe; for know, the earth produceth nothing but what may be good to thee. Are not food and raiment, and the remedies for thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, all derived from this ſource alone?</p>

                        <p>Tho thou haſt been conſtant in ill fortune; though thou haſt been invincible in diſtreſs; yet by her thou art conquered, not knowing that thy ſtrength returneth not again; and yet that thou again mayeſt need it.</p>
                        <p>Affliction moveth our enemies to pity; ſucceſs and happineſs cauſe even our friends to envy.</p>
                        <p>In adverſity, is the ſeed of well-doing; it is the nurſe of heroiſm and boldneſs: Who that hath enough will endanger himſelf to have more? who that is at eaſe, will ſet his life on the hazard.</p>
                        <p>True virtue will act under all circumſtances; but men ſee moſt of its effects, when accidents concur with it.</p>
                        <p>In adverſity, man ſeeth himſelf abandoned by others; he findeth that all his hopes are centered within himſelf: He rouſeth his ſoul, he encountereth his difficulties, and they yield before him.</p>

                        <p>Our paſſions dictate to us in all our extremes. Moderation is the effect of wiſdom.</p>
                        <p>Be upright in thy whole life; be content in all its changes: So ſhalt thou make thy profit out of all occurrences; ſo ſhall every thing that happeneth unto thee, be the ſource of praiſe.</p>
