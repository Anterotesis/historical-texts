            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ILLUSTRIOUS AMERICANS! NOBLE PATRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OTS! You commemorate a glorious day—the <hi>birth-day</hi> of Freedom in the New World. Yes, Columbia, thou art free. The twentieth year of thy independence commences this day. Thou hast taken the lead in regenerating the world! Look back—look forward. Think of the past—anticipate the future, and behold with astonishment, the transactions of the present time! The globe revolves on the axis of Liberty! The new world has put the old in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The light of truth, running rapid, like lightning, flashes convictions in the heart of every civilized nation. Yes, the <hi>thunder</hi> of American remonstrances, has fallen so heavy on the head of the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> that other nations, encouraged by her example, will extirpate all <hi>despots</hi> from the earth.</p>
            <p>O FRANCE: although I do not justify thy excesses, I vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thy magnanimity. If the sun of thy liberty has been eclipsed by a blood-thirsty <hi>Marat</hi> and a saturnine <hi>Robespierre;</hi> if their accomplices, the sons of faction, still darken thy horizon!—the energy of the nation, the unparalleled suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of thy armies, like a mighty rushing wind, will scatter the clouds, and drive them from thy hemisphere. The sun of <hi>liberty</hi> will return with healing in its wings!—yes, its genial rays will restore the drooping spirit of the distressed, and give new energy to the champions of freedom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:029399_0005_0FE0ED87DC9F9748"/>
INVINCIBLE FRENCHMEN! go on. Having laid your hands to the plough, look not back, until the soil of Europe is made a proper fallow, to receive the seeds of emancipation.</p>
            <p>The Popish beast has nearly numbered <hi>his</hi> days. The vassal kings, emperors, and princes, who have deluged the earth with blood, under his malign influence, shall soon take their exit with him, to the same PIT of destruction—Nor shall those potentates who have thrown off his yoke, to <hi>ape</hi> his authority, escape the punishment due for their crimes. <hi>They</hi> have, under the mask of manumission, riveted the chains of slavery two-fold faster, than <hi>Charlemagne</hi> or <hi>Louis le Grand</hi> had it in their power. However, when the sons of liberty will make a strong pull, a long pull, and a pull all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the brass bars, the iron gates, the gold and silver chains of despotism, must be broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Combined Sons of Freedom!</hi> go on, until every <hi>bastile</hi> on earth, with the infernal dungeons of the ocean<note n="*" place="bottom">The British men of war.</note> are destroyed like the <hi>Parisian</hi> prison.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Batavians and Belgians!</hi> rally to the standard of your deliverers—assist them to carry their conquests to the <hi>citadel</hi> of Rome, that the Tree of Liberty may be planted, once more, on the banks of the <hi>Tiber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the court of Byzantum should be inimical to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, tell the monster <hi>Mahomed,</hi> that the flag of freedom shall soon fly on the ramparts of Constantinople.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:029399_0006_0FE0ED9998559958"/>
Neither the <hi>Ottoman Porte,</hi> nor the infamous <hi>Catharine,</hi> can long withstand the energy of freemen. Let them meet the haughty tyrant of the north, in the fertile fields of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the vassals of that unhappy country shall be restored to liberty and equality. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> will then know, that the <hi>fire of freedom</hi> is not to be extinguished.</p>
            <p>Whilst I behold it kindling in every quarter of the globe! where shall I turn my eyes first?</p>
            <p>O my country!<note n="†" place="bottom">Great Britain.</note> my country! My heart bleeds—my eyes become a fountain of waters, when I think of thy fate. ICHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOD, may be written upon all thy borders, for <hi>the glory is departed!</hi> How is thy bright gold become dim? how are the sons of liberty, the pearls of the nation, cast into prisons and banished o'er the seas! O my countrymen! my countrymen! how long will you be duped by a dogmatical administration, which seems determined to destroy not only their own nation, but to mark their footsteps, with devastation and blood, wherever they go!</p>
            <p>Infatuated Britons! I feel for your insanity, although four thousand miles from your coasts. Twenty years have elapsed since your American brethren, have given you a practical example to resist despotism. Have they not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically told you that no government has a right to <hi>taxation</hi> without a free and equal <hi>representation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ancient Britons!<note n="‡" place="bottom">The Welch people.</note> awake out of sleep! open your eyes! why are your tyrants great? because you kneel down and cringe to them. Rise up. You are their equals! If you
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029399_0007_0FE0ED8E4F140FC8"/>
cannot rise, creep to the ocean, and the friendly waves will waft you over the Atlantic, to the hospitable shores of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. If you cannot obtain liberty in your native country, "where liberty dwells, call that your country." Embark, then, for the western world (which wants nothing, but millions of good citizens, to make it the glory of all the earth.) Quit the little despotic island which gave you birth, and leave the <hi>tyrants</hi> and <hi>slaves</hi> of your country to live and die together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Citizens of the United States,</hi> be not frightened in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many emigrants flocking to your territory! If all the inhabitants of the world were to pay you a visit, you can compliment each of them with half an acre of land.<note n="§" place="bottom">i. e. within the limits of the United States, Indian territory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</note> But sirs, look forward and behold with transports of joy, this vast continent, from the gulph of St. Laurence to the gulph of Mexico, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, forming one grand <hi>republic of brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At present it is impossible to calculate on the rapidity of revolutions! what formerly took a century to accomplish is brought to pass in a day! If the snow-ball as it rolls, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies its magnitude; the torrent being checked, for a season, runs with greater rapidity! So the cause of truth and liberty being opposed by despots, will gain greater energy; and will, eventually, like a mighty deluge, sweep every refuge of lies from the earth.</p>
            <p>The little stone which Nebuchadnezzar saw,—smote the image on its feet—ground it to powder—became a great mountain—and filled the whole earth. So be it speedily!
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029399_0008_0FE0ED9F2C905B10"/>
May the perfect law of liberty, sway its sceptre of love, from the rising to the setting sun—from the centre of the globe to the extremities of the poles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Citizens of United America!</hi> Whilst you commemorate a glorious revolution: call to mind your first principles of action: never forget them; nor, those who assisted you to put your principles in practice. May the curse of Meroz,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Judges v.</note> never fall upon America, for not joining the heralds of freedom, whilst combating the tyrants of Europe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Citizens of America!</hi> guard with jealousy, the temple of liberty. Protect her altar, from being polluted with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of force or fraud.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Citizens and Soldiers of America!</hi> Sons of liberty: it is you I address. Banish from your land the remains of slavery! Be consistent with your congressional declaration of rights, and you will be happy. Remember there never was, nor will be, a period when justice should not be done. Do what is just, and leave the event with God. <hi>"Justice is the pillar that upholds the whole fabric of human society; and mercy is the genial ray which cheers and warms the habitations of men. The perfection of our social character consists in properly temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two with one another; in holding that middle course which admits of our being just, without being rigid; and allows us to be generous without being unjust."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May all the citizens of America be found in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of such social virtues as will secure them peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in this world, and in the world to come, life everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through Jesus Christ our Lord!</p>
