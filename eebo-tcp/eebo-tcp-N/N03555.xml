            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a common Thing with our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to diſcourſe to his Hearers in <hi>parabolical</hi> Language: And his View herein (at leaſt in Part) might be to accommodate himſelf to their Capacities, and take greater Hold on their Hearts; For there is no Way of Speaking, that more eaſily and familiarly conveys Truth into the Mind, or more ſtrongly impreſſes it there.</p>
            <p>The Words I have ſelected to employ our preſent Meditations, are Part of the <hi>Parable of the Supper:</hi> Concerning which, it may ſuffice to obſerve in general,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004349_0004_10044F8F80F82B40"/>
That the Bleſſings of the <hi>Goſpel-State</hi> are here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>Supper</hi>: The Perſons <hi>firſtly</hi> invited to it were the <hi>Jews</hi>; but theſe making light of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, and excuſing themſelves from an Attendance at it, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were then called in, the Gentiles of <hi>all Sorts and Kinds</hi>; and this, while the <hi>Jews</hi> were left under that Blindneſs of Mind and Hardneſs of Heart, in which they continue to this Day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> falls in that Part of the Parable, which concerns the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and is a Command to <hi>enforce</hi> their Acceptance of the <hi>Goſpel Offer of Mercy,</hi> with all the Methods of <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> with all the <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Arguments,</hi> ſuited to work upon the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding</hi> of Men. Says our Lord to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>Compel them to come in</hi>: In diſcourſing to which Words, I ſhall do two Things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Explain to you the Meaning of that Compulſion, which our Saviour here recommends.</hi> And then,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Do the Duty enjoin'd the Servant in the Text, by endeavouring to compel you to come in, and partake of the Goſpel Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>I am to explain to you the Meaning of that Compulſion, which our Saviour here recommends.</hi> Says he to the Servant in my Text, <hi>Compel them to come in.</hi> But what are we to underſtand by this <hi>Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</hi> Of what <hi>Sort of Compulſion</hi> does our Lord ſpeak?</p>
            <p>Now, 'tis plain, he here ſpeaks, not of <hi>phyſical,</hi> but <hi>moral</hi> Compulſion; not of Compulſion by <hi>outward Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> but <hi>internal Perſuaſion</hi>; that which is effected, not by <hi>Fines, Impriſonments, Racks</hi> and <hi>Tortures,</hi> but by Application to the <hi>Underſtandings</hi> of Men. The
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004349_0005_10044FC44CD552F8"/>
               <hi>Compulſion,</hi> our Saviour intends, is of that Kind, which the <hi>Mind of</hi> Man is capable of, and is ſutable to it as <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>intelligent</hi>: And this is Compulſion by <hi>ſound Reaſoning, good Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Compel them to come in</hi>; 'Tis is if our Lord had ſaid, Argue with them about coming in to the Goſpel Kingdom; apply to their Reaſon and Conſcience; inform their Underſtanding; convince their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; make Uſe of thoſe Perſuaſions, lay before them thoſe Motives and Arguments, which will leave them inexcuſable, if they are not wro't upon; if they are not, in the <hi>moral</hi> Senſe, <hi>compelled to come in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the plain Meaning of the Phraſe; nor is its Senſe at all difficult or perplext: And yet, as if Men had a Deſign to miſunderſtand our Saviour, they have taken Occaſion from this, and ſuch like Texts, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce <hi>that Sort</hi> of Compulſion into Religion, which can never be juſtified, either by <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is particularly true of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> who interpret my Text as a <hi>Divine Warrant</hi> to make Uſe of <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence</hi> in the Affairs of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi>; at leaſt, together with it, they ſuppoſe our Saviour means <hi>Fire and Faggot</hi>: And if this is what he had in View, they have, it muſt be acknowledged, moſt punctually comply'd with his Command; as not having omitted any Kind of <hi>outward Violence,</hi> however barbarous and inhumane. But 'tis impoſſible our Saviour ſhould have had it in his Thoughts to recommend <hi>this Sort</hi> of Compulſion: To be ſure, if we may judge, either from <hi>his Example,</hi> the <hi>Nature of his Goſpel,</hi> or indeed from the <hi>Reaſon of Things,</hi> this was one of the laſt Methods he would ever have recommended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004349_0006_1004441DB3B46F58"/>As for the <hi>Example of Chriſt,</hi> this was ever againſt the <hi>Uſe of Force</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Conſcience.</hi> He never compelled Men to embrace his Goſpel; never made Uſe of the Art (which has ſince been found out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo often put in Practice) of enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Men's Conſciences, by <hi>fining their Eſtates,</hi> or <hi>impriſoning their Perſons,</hi> or <hi>abuſing their Bodies</hi>; ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the <hi>Whipping-Poſt, Gibbet</hi> or <hi>Gallows.</hi> He did not go about, in any of theſe Methods of Force, to propagate his Religion; but in the <hi>gentle Methods of Perſuaſion.</hi> That was his Manner in making <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes</hi> to his Religion, <hi>If any Man will, let him be my Diſciple. If any Man will, let him follow me. Will ye alſo go away?</hi> He uſed Violence with no Man; but applied to all, in a Way ſuited to their <hi>Make as Men</hi>: Reaſoning the Caſe with them, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Light to their Underſtandings, and Conviction to their Conſciences; but after all, leaving it to their own <hi>free Choice,</hi> whether they would reject or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Him and his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And 'tis remarkable, when his Diſciples, in a Fit of <hi>religious Zeal,</hi> would have call'd for <hi>Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> to deſtroy thoſe who would not receive him, he very ſeaſonably gave a Check to it; informing them, how contrary <hi>ſuch a Spirit and Conduct</hi> was, to the Deſign of his coming, which was <hi>to ſave, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Men's Lives.</hi> Says the <hi>Evangeliſt Luke,</hi> who gives the Account of this Matter, <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> xix. 55, 56.</note> 
               <hi>He turned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked them, and ſaid, Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of. For the Son of Man is not come to deſtroy Men's Lives, but to ſave them.</hi> Our Lord, you ſee, with a greater Severity than ordinary, corrected
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004349_0007_10044FC8D6329A18"/>
this <hi>burning Zeal</hi> of his Diſciples; and this; though it was a <hi>religious Zeal</hi>; and the <hi>Object</hi> of it, thoſe who rejected and deſpiſed, both Him and his Doctrine. And he ever diſcountenanc'd <hi>religious Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Rage,</hi> in all the Acts and Inſtances of it: To be ſure, he did ſo by his <hi>Example</hi>; for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once, in his whole Life, did any Thing that lookt like <hi>perſecuting</hi> Men for Religion. So far from it, that he was always calm and peaceable, and treated even his greateſt Oppoſers with all Meekneſs and Mildneſs. His Concern was to ſerve the Intereſt of Men's Souls; and if he could do this in the Methods proper to be uſed with Men, i. e. by <hi>Perſuaſion</hi> and <hi>Argument,</hi> he was not wanting in his Endeavours: but he would not make Uſe of <hi>Force,</hi> nor in a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive</hi> Way have any Thing to do with them.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> as little favours the Uſe of <hi>Violence</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion</hi> as his Example: Yea, the <hi>Uſe of Force</hi> is abſolutely inconſiſtent with the <hi>Nature of that Kingdom,</hi> the Goſpel was intended to ſet on Foot in the World. So ſpeaks our Saviour in thoſe expreſs Words, John xviii. 36. <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> i. e. 'Tis not like <hi>earthly</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Monarchies, which are eſtabliſh'd with a View to Men's <hi>worldly</hi> Happineſs, and are accordingly ſupported and guarded with <hi>worldly</hi> Sanctions: But 'tis a Kingdom of a quite different Kind, a Kingdom that is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> having to do with Men's <hi>Souls,</hi> not their <hi>Bodies</hi>; with their <hi>eternal,</hi> not their <hi>temporal</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns: And being a Kingdom thus <hi>ſpiritual</hi> in its Nature and Deſign, its <hi>Sanctions</hi> are of the <hi>ſame Kind</hi>; its <hi>Weapons not carnal,</hi> but <hi>ſpiritual</hi>: It exerciſes no Dominion over Men's <hi>Eſtates</hi> or <hi>Bodies</hi>; it makes no Uſe of <hi>ſecular Force.</hi> For ſo it follows in the next Words, <hi>If my Kingdom were of this World, then
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004349_0008_10049D4E4B73CEF8"/>
would my Servants fight.</hi> i. e. they would, in a <hi>Way of Force,</hi> defend my Perſon and my Doctrine: But, as a ſure Evidence of the Truth of what I have ſaid, that <hi>my Kingdom is not like the Kingdoms of this World,</hi> my Subjects and Servants make Uſe of none of the Methods of <hi>Hoſtility</hi> and <hi>Violence</hi>: Or if they do, 'tis not with <hi>my Approbation,</hi> they act not by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> from me. And indeed, ſo far was our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our from encouraging the Subjects of his Kingdom, to do any Thing in a Way of <hi>external Violence,</hi> tho' it were in <hi>Protection</hi> even of <hi>his very Perſon,</hi> that when one of them, upon ſuch an Occaſion, <hi>drew his Sword,</hi> he inſtantly gave forth his Command, <hi>Put up again thy Sword into his Place</hi>; and added upon it, in thoſe ſolemn Words, <hi>All they that take the Sword, ſhall periſh with the Sword</hi>

            <p>This is the Temper and Conduct, which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requires in Matters of Religion. Its Precepts are directly calculated to encourage and promote Peace and Good-will among Men: Nor can any Thing be more oppoſite to the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion, than for Men to bite and devour one another, injure and male-treat each other: Nor does it at all alter the Caſe, tho' they ſhould do this under the Pretext of <hi>Zeal for God,</hi> or the moſt <hi>paſſionate Concern for the Salvation of Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ought, 'tis true, to have near our Heart the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>ſpiritual and eternal Good</hi> of our friends and Neighbours; yea, of all Men: But we are much miſtaken, if we imagine, that we can either do <hi>Honour to God,</hi> or <hi>Service to the Souls of Men,</hi> in the Methods of <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>: No, our Concern for the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Good of others ought principally to expreſs it ſelf, in <hi>inſtructing thoſe who are out of the Way, and oppoſe the Truth,</hi> not, as <hi>Gideon</hi> did the Men of <hi>Succoth,</hi> with <hi>Briers and Thorns</hi>; but with <hi>Meekneſs of Wiſdom.</hi> For <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger reſteth in the Boſom of Fools,</hi> as the <hi>wiſe Man</hi> ſpeaks<note n="†" place="bottom">Eccleſ. <hi>vii. 9.</hi>

               </note>. If we are fierce and furious, and of a Temper diſpoſing and engaging us, to <hi>convert Men's Souls</hi> by <hi>abuſing their Bodies,</hi> we are in an <hi>exceeding bad</hi> Frame of Mind. For <hi>Zeal without Charity,</hi> a Zeal that would put us upon calling for <hi>Fire from Heaven,</hi> or the <hi>Sword from

the Earth,</hi> to deſtroy Men's <hi>Bodies,</hi> for the good of their <hi>Souls,</hi> is as oppoſite to the Goſpel, as contradictory to its great and fundamental Precepts, as any Thing we would rectify, that we ſuppoſe to be amiſs in others.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Uſe of Force,</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> is not only contrary to the <hi>Example of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Precepts of his Goſpel</hi>; but to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon of Things.</hi> 'Tis in it ſelf a Method altogether unſuted to Work upon the Minds of Men. For whatever Influence it may have upon their <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> it can have none on their <hi>Souls.</hi> It conveys no Light into the Mind; it brings no Conviction to the Judgment and Conſcience; it effects no Alteration in Men's Thoughts and Sentiments: But after all that can be done, in a <hi>Way of Compulſion,</hi> Men's Minds will be the ſame; they will entertain the ſame Thot's; the ſame Notions and Principles; and will, in the <hi>moral</hi> Senſe, remain juſt the ſame Perſons. Nor is there the leaſt Sutableneſs in <hi>external Force</hi> to move the <hi>Soul,</hi> in any of its rational Operations: Yea, it is as abſurd and ridiculous to make Uſe of <hi>Force</hi> to affect the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as it would be to make Uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> to affect the <hi>bodily Senſes. Force</hi> is proper to the <hi>Body, Reaſon</hi> to the <hi>Mind:</hi> And 'tis plainly an inverting the Order of Nature, to make Uſe of that with Reference to the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is adapted, in its Uſe, only to the <hi>Body</hi>: Nor let Men uſe what <hi>Violence</hi> they pleaſe, will it have the leaſt Influence upon Men, to make them <hi>truly religious.</hi> It may put them upon making an <hi>outſide Appearance</hi> in Religion, i. e. It may make them <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi> it may make them <hi>deal deceitfully</hi> both with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and often does ſo; but it can never make them <hi>good Chriſtians.</hi> It may put them upon

               <hi>profeſſing with their Mouths,</hi> or <hi>worſhipping with their Bodies,</hi> as thoſe, in whoſe Power they are, would have them; but there is no Value, <hi>religiouſly ſpeaking,</hi> in ſuch <hi>Profeſſions</hi> and <hi>Worſhip:</hi> Nor indeed is there the leaſt <hi>true Religion</hi> in any of thoſe Actions that are the Reſult, not of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but of <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not but that Men may, conſiſtent with Reaſon, be <hi>reſtrained</hi> from <hi>theſe</hi> or <hi>thoſe vicious Practices.</hi> The <hi>civil</hi> Good of Society may make <hi>ſuch Reſtraints</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: And whenever it does ſo, they are <hi>reaſonable</hi>; Men ought to be laid under them. Bat then it muſt, at the ſame Time, be remembred, there is <hi>no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in their abſtaining from <hi>theſe</hi> or <hi>thoſe Vices,</hi> while their abſtaining from them is the Effect of <hi>external Force.</hi> As Men are <hi>rational, free Agents,</hi> they can't be <hi>religious</hi> but with the <hi>free Conſent of their Wills</hi>; and this can be gain'd in no Way, but that of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Perſuaſion. Compulſion</hi> is of no Significancy here. It has no Influence to <hi>perſuade</hi> the <hi>Will</hi>; but rather the <hi>contrary</hi>: Nor was any Man ever <hi>forc'd</hi> to be <hi>religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, even <hi>God</hi> himſelf does not, in <hi>this Way,</hi> go about to make Men religious. He uſes <hi>Violence</hi> with no Man; <hi>forces</hi> no One, contrary to his Will, to betake himſelf to a religious Courſe. Whenever he <hi>draws</hi> Men to a Life of Holineſs, 'tis with <hi>the Cords of a Man, and with the Bands of Love.</hi> i. e. in a Way ſuted to their Character as <hi>Men</hi>; in a Way adapted to their Make as <hi>free Agents.</hi> He does not make Uſe of the <hi>Methods of Force,</hi> turning Men from <hi>Sin</hi> to <hi>himſelf,</hi> whether they <hi>will,</hi> or no; but ſo manages the Affair, as to gain the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004349_0013_10044451D77E9278"/>
of their Wills.</hi> He opens the <hi>Eyes</hi> of their <hi>Mind,</hi> and gives them to ſee the Uglineſs of Sin, the Beauty of Holineſs, the Need they ſtand in of Chriſt, his Sufficiency and infinite Readineſs to be a Saviour to them; and he gives them ſuch a Sight of theſe Things, ſuch an Apprehenſion and Perſuaſion of them, as they never had before: And having thus removed <hi>the Ignorance that was in them, through the Blindneſs of their Mind,</hi> he perſuades and enables them to <hi>chuſe</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> according to the Dictates of their <hi>enlightned Underſtanding.</hi> And ſo, the whole of what he does, is in a Way ſuted to their Character, as Creatures endowed with <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and a Capacity of making a <hi>free Choice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the <hi>only Way,</hi> in which <hi>Men</hi> ought to be dealt with. 'Tis the Way that is ſuted to their Nature; 'tis the Way which infinite Wiſdom thinks proper to take with them: And to leave this Way, and go into that of <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Compulſion,</hi> — there's no Foundation for it in the <hi>Reaſon of Things;</hi> 'tis altogether <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we have ſeen, what that <hi>Compulſion</hi> is, which our Saviour recommends in the <hi>Text</hi>; that it is not a <hi>phyſical,</hi> but <hi>moral</hi> Compulſion: A Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion not by <hi>outward Force,</hi> but <hi>internal Perſuaſion</hi>; a Compulſion by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Argument,</hi> which is the <hi>only Compulſion,</hi> that is proper to be uſed with <hi>Men,</hi> who are <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>free Agents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, conſidering what has been ſaid, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>external Force</hi> is to the <hi>Example of Chriſt,</hi> to the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and to the <hi>Reaſon of Things,</hi> way we not even wonder, that <hi>this</hi> is a Method that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004349_0014_10044F9762CAB148"/>
has been ſo much in Practice, in the Affairs of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Conſcience?</hi> It has all along been the <hi>grand Engine,</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> to make Men <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes</hi> to their Way of Worſhip. And what they have wanted in <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> to bring this about, they have made up in <hi>wholeſome Severities</hi>; and they have gone on in the Uſe of theſe, from one Step to another, till they have arriv'd at the Heighth of Barbarity: Inſomuch that there is ſcarce any Kind of Cruelty, however unmerciful, but they have practiſed it. They have plunder'd Men's Eſtates; they have impriſon'd their Perſons; they have baniſht them from their Families, their Wives and their Children: Yea, they have deſtroy'd their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and this, in all the Ways of Cruelty, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity itſelf has been capable of inventing. And all this they have done, under Pretence of Zeal for the Honour of God and Chriſt, and to ſerve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Religion: Yea, they have barbarouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Men's <hi>Bodies,</hi> at the ſame Time, pretending the greateſt Love and Charity to their <hi>Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It could ſcarce be believed, that Men ſhould act ſo much in Contradiction to the <hi>moſt plain</hi> and the <hi>moſt fundamental</hi> Precepts of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and all the while pretend a <hi>zealous Regard</hi> to them, but that it is a Fact, that can neither be diſputed nor denied. 'Tis really an aſtoniſhing Thing, that the <hi>Chriſtian Inſtitution,</hi> which is ſo full of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and is intended and calculated to promote <hi>Peace on Earth,</hi> and <hi>Good-Will towards Men,</hi> ſhould be the Occaſion of ſo much <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Ill-Nature,</hi> of ſo much unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Barbarity and Cruelty!

But the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's coming</hi> has been quite different from the <hi>Deſign</hi> of it: Inſtead of <hi>Peace,</hi> it has, as our Saviour foretold, unhappily <hi>bro't a Sword</hi>; and this, to the moſt ſhameful Degree. Thoſe who have called themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> have taken Occaſion, even from the very <hi>Goſpel of Peace,</hi> to devour with the Sword; committing all manner of Barbarities, the moſt horrid Blood-ſheds.

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. But 'tis time that I come, in the ſecond Place, to do the Duty enjoin'd the <hi>Servant</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> by endeavouring <hi>to compel you to come in, and partake of the Goſpel Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only, let me previouſly obſerve, that by the <hi>Goſpel Supper,</hi> we are here to underſtand the <hi>Bleſſings of the Goſpel State</hi>; the <hi>Mercies promiſed and offered</hi> in the <hi>Diſpenſation, by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe Bleſſings are
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004349_0019_1004445F15D1FBB8"/>
here compared to a <hi>Supper,</hi> and in the parallel Place in <hi>Matthew's Goſpel,</hi> to a <hi>Marriage Feaſt</hi>: By which is denoted the <hi>Plenty</hi> of theſe Bleſſings; that there is a full Proviſion of them in the Goſpel; which all may partake of upon <hi>Free-coſt,</hi> who will come and accept of them.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid this, I ſhall now make it my Buſineſs <hi>to compel you to come, and partake of this Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. And I would <hi>compel you,</hi> in the firſt Place, by minding you of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> who invites you to it. And this is none other than the <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>eternal God.</hi> For he is the Perſon meant by the <hi>certain Man,</hi> in the beginning of this <hi>Parable</hi>; or, by the <hi>certain King,</hi> as 'tis in <hi>Matthew's Goſpel.</hi> And ſhall we not accept an Invitation from the <hi>King of Heaven?</hi> Where is our Ambition? Where our Senſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? If on of the <hi>Kings of the Earth</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us to an Entertainment, how ſhould we eſteem our ſelves honoured? With what Readineſs ſhould we embrace the Opportunity of ſetting down with him at his Table? And ſhall we make light of an Invitation from him, who is infinitely <hi>higher than the Kings of the Earth?</hi> Shall we excuſe our ſelves, when invited by that glorious Being, before whom all <hi>Nations</hi> of the World are <hi>as nothing</hi>; yea, <hi>leſs than nothing and Vanity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis amazing Condeſcention in the <hi>high and lofty One, who inhabits Eternity,</hi> that he will ſo much as vouchſafe a Look towards ſuch <hi>Worms of the Duſt</hi> as we are: But O how much more amazing is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention, for that he is willing to <hi>ſup with us,</hi> and that we ſhould <hi>ſup with him!</hi> And ſhall we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing?
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004349_0020_10044FA1D274EA20"/>
Shall God call upon us to come, <hi>for all Things are ready,</hi> and we turn off the Invitation, making one Excuſe and another? O our Senſeleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Stupidity! We ought, moſt certainly, to accept the Invitation, and come to the <hi>Supper,</hi> which God has provided.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would <hi>compel you</hi> from the Conſideration of the <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> you are invited to receive. And theſe are many and exceeding great. They extend to even all our Wants; eſpecially, to thoſe that reſpect our <hi>Souls,</hi> and their <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Well-being. Nor is there any good Thing, which our <hi>Souls</hi> do ſtand in Need of, but 'tis provided for them in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Here is <hi>pardoning Mercy,</hi> and <hi>regenerating Grace</hi>; here is <hi>Peace with God,</hi> and <hi>Peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>; here is <hi>Strength to aſſiſt in Duty,</hi> to <hi>help over Difficulties,</hi> to <hi>reſiſt Temptation</hi>; here is <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Support</hi> under <hi>afflictive Tryals</hi>; here is <hi>divine Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thro' this World</hi>; and in a Word, <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>everlaſting Bleſſedneſs</hi> in the <hi>next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O the Wonders of Divine Grace in making <hi>ſuch a Proviſion of Bleſſings</hi> for the Good of our <hi>Souls</hi>! And ſhall we caſt a Slight upon them? Shall we refuſe to accept of them, when they are freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us? O fooliſh and unwiſe if we do! For by rejecting the <hi>Goſpel Offer of Mercy,</hi> we ſhall wrong our own Souls, as well as reflect Contempt on God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I would <hi>compel you</hi> by laying before you, the <hi>great Coſt</hi> a good God has been at to make this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Bleſſings for us. And he has been at a vaſt Expence. The Bleſſings, he invites us to receive in the Goſpel, were all bought; and this, at the deareſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004349_0021_10044FAB6A504680"/>
Rate. They were not purchaſed with <hi>corruptible Things, ſuch as Silver and Gold; but with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of Chriſt.</hi> Nothing ſhort of this was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make a Purchaſe of them: And yet, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we ſhould go without them, the infinitely merciful God has put himſelf to this vaſt Expence. He has even parted with <hi>his own dear and only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son. He ſpared him not, but delivered him up,</hi> to <hi>ſhed his Blood on the Croſs</hi>; and by this Means has got ready for our Acceptance a <hi>Proviſion of Mercy,</hi> equal to the Needs of our Souls.</p>
            <p>And will it not move us to come and accept of the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel State,</hi> when we conſider what they coſt, how much a good God has parted with for the Procurement of them? Where is our Ingenuity? Where our Gratitude to the deareſt Lover of our Souls? We ſhall deſerve to be forever ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſed as baſe to the laſt Degree, if we entertain a low Thought of theſe Bleſſings, which have coſt ſo much: Much more if we neglect, or refuſe to come and take our Part of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I may <hi>compel you from the Need, the abſolute Need, you ſtand in of theſe Bleſſings.</hi> You are undone, remedilouſly undone, without a Share in them. Theſe Bleſſings are provided <hi>no where</hi> but in the <hi>Goſpel</hi>: And if you won't come, at the Call of God, and partake of them, as they are here offered, your Souls muſt periſh thro' Want of them. You can be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned</hi> in <hi>no Way,</hi> but that of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; you can be <hi>regenerated</hi> in <hi>no Way,</hi> but that of the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>; you can be <hi>ſaved</hi> in <hi>no Way,</hi> but that of the <hi>Mercy of God,</hi> in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And are you willing to go without theſe Bleſſings? You can't do without them. Your <hi>Intereſt,</hi> the Intereſt of your
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004349_0022_10044FAEB693F450"/>
               <hi>Souls</hi>; and this, for <hi>all Eternity,</hi> is concerned in this Matter. Neceſſity is laid upon you. Your <hi>Salvation</hi> depends upon this very Thing. You muſt accept of the <hi>Mercy of the Goſpel,</hi> or you muſt periſh, and that unavoidably.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto conſidered the <hi>Goſpel Supper,</hi> as meaning the <hi>whole Proviſion of Goſpel Mercy</hi> It will not be a Miſapplication of the Text, if I take Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from it, <hi>to compel you to come in to the Goſpel Supper,</hi> meaning hereby the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> the <hi>holy Sacrament,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And alas! That there is ſo much Need to make Uſe of <hi>Compulſion</hi> in this Matter; Compulſion, I mean, in the Way of applying to Men's <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Conſcience.</hi> One would think, much need not be ſaid to perſuade Men to a Duty ſo reaſonable and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial: And yet, but few are wrought upon to come in to the Practice of it. The Number of thoſe who go out of the Houſe of God, when the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Supper</hi> is to be adminiſtred, is vaſtly great in compare of thoſe, who make a tarry! Alas! How few are the Gueſts who ſit down with Chriſt at his Table! They are but thinly ſcattered, here and there one to be ſeen. When the Invitation is given, in the Language of the <hi>Parable,</hi> in which is the Text, <hi>Come, for all Things are now ready</hi>: May it not be ſaid, as follows in the next Words, <hi>And they all, with one Conſent, began to make Excuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will not therefore be unſeaſonable<note n="‖" place="bottom">The Sermon was preach't on a <hi>Communion-Day.</hi>
               </note>, if I take upon me the <hi>Work</hi> aſſigned the <hi>Servant</hi> in the Text, and endeavour <hi>to compel you to come in</hi>; to come in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004349_0023_10044FE16F7A1168"/>
to the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>ſit down with him at his Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only, before I proceed, I would juſt obſerve, that as the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Conſiderations are the only proper ones to be uſed with Men, to move them to an Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it. <hi>Worldly</hi> Motives have no Place here. Men ought not to come to the <hi>Ordinance of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> if they have no other Reaſon for their coming, but that they may be <hi>qualified for ſome Place of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Profit.</hi> This would be a baſe Motive indeed: And 'tis pity Men ſhould ever be tempted with a Motive that is ſo mean and low: Nor would it be to the Credit of any <hi>religious Eſtabliſhment,</hi> to make <hi>that</hi> which is a <hi>ſolemn Teſt</hi> of Men's Subjection to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>Qualification</hi> without which they can ſuſtain <hi>no Office</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> not ſo much as that of a common <hi>Exciſe-Man.</hi> If any Thing can be, this certainly is, a wicked <hi>perverting the Uſe</hi> of the <hi>moſt ſacred Rite</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; turning it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an <hi>Engine of worldly Policy</hi>: At beſt, 'tis making Uſe of a <hi>Motive,</hi> which tends to <hi>compel</hi> Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>this Inſtitution of Chriſtianity,</hi> more with a View to <hi>themſelves,</hi> than to <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Nor, where the Motive from <hi>this World</hi> is ſo ſtrong, would it be any Thing ſtrange, if Men ſhou'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be wrought upon to go to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that they might make a <hi>Gain of Godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis Time that I proceed to the <hi>Work of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling you</hi> to give your Attendance at the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let me <hi>compel you from the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Ordinance of the Supper</hi> is plainly an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004349_0024_1004443BD8C90FF0"/>
of <hi>his. Do this in Remembrance of me,</hi> are the Words of <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi>; and as expreſs a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from him, as any in the whole Goſpel And is he not our <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> as well as <hi>Saviour?</hi> Has he not a rightful Authority to give out his Commands? And are we not bound to obey them? And if we are oblig'd to obey his Commands at all, why not in this Inſtance as well as in any other? Has not this the ſame Stamp of his Authority on it? And if we may diſpenſe with his Authority in this Article, why not in any other? Why may we not neglect <hi>Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>publick Worſhip,</hi> as well as the <hi>ſacramental Supper?</hi> The Authority of Chriſt is juſt the ſame in theſe ſeveral Inſtances of Duty; and we may no more neglect to <hi>remember Chriſt at his Table,</hi> than to <hi>worſhip</hi> him in <hi>his Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, there are ſome Circumſtances that do, in a peculiar Manner, recommend to our Obſervance the <hi>ſacramental Inſtitution.</hi> 'Tis the Inſtitution of our <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saviour.</hi> To <hi>remember him,</hi> by <hi>eating Bread,</hi> and <hi>drinking Wine,</hi> in a <hi>religious</hi> Manner, was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he gave us, juſt as he was going to lay down his Life for us. Says the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. xi. 23. <hi>The Lord Jeſus, the ſame Night in which he was betrayed, took Bread; — and ſaid, Take, eat; — this do in Remembrance of me.</hi> And ſhall we not remember Chriſt, when he has deſired we would; and expreſſed this his Deſire, when he was about to do the greateſt Act of Kindneſs for us, even offer up himſelf a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to make Atonement for our Sins? O let us not put ſo ſmall a Value on the Love of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, as to neglect <hi>that Inſtitution</hi> he has ſet up in his Church, on Purpoſe to perpetuate the Memory of it. Let us rather joyfully embrace every Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004349_0025_10044FE657F5F110"/>
of remembring this Love of his, which was ſtronger than Death. 'Tis infinitely reaſonable we ſhould do ſo: Nor otherwiſe ſhall we be able to free our ſelves from the Charge of the blackeſt Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to our beſt Friend and greateſt Benefactor.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let me <hi>compel you</hi> by ſhewing you, that you have no <hi>juſt Ground of Excuſe,</hi> nothing <hi>ſufficient to plead,</hi> why you ſhould not come to <hi>this Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do any excuſe themſelves, became they have other Things to mind, which call off their Thoughts and Hearts from this Duty? This is the Excuſe in my Context. One had <hi>bought a Piece of Ground,</hi> and he <hi>muſt needs go and ſee it.</hi> Another had <hi>bought five Yoke of Oxen,</hi> and he <hi>muſt go and prove them.</hi> And a third had <hi>married a Wife,</hi> and ſo <hi>could not come.</hi> And this is the Excuſe of Multitudes at preſent. They are ſo <hi>encumbred with the World,</hi> that they han't Time to think of their Duty, or to engage in the Practice of it. But this is certainly an <hi>inſufficient</hi> Excuſe. We ought not to regard this World, or ſuffer any of the Affairs and Buſineſſes of it, ſo to engroſs our Hearts, as to take 'em off from minding the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of our Souls, and an Attendance on our Duty; particularly, this of waiting upon Chriſt at his Table. And if this is all that we have to ſay, the <hi>Lord of the Feaſt</hi> will be <hi>angry</hi> with us: Nor can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but that he will <hi>bind us Hand and Foot, and caſt us into outer Darkneſs: There will be weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do any excuſe themſelves for the <hi>preſent,</hi> reſolving that they will attend this Duty <hi>ſometime hence?</hi> This, it may be fear'd, is the Caſe of too many. They are for putting off the Duty, hoping they may, with <hi>more
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004349_0026_10044FB8D5EDC118"/>
Convenience,</hi> engage in it <hi>hereafter.</hi> But this alſo is an <hi>inſufficient</hi> Plea. The Command of Chriſt, <hi>This do in Remembrance of me,</hi> requires <hi>inſtant</hi> Obedience. 'Tis a <hi>preſent</hi> Obligation that lies on us; and we may, by no Means, diſpenſe with it: 'Tis at our Peril, if we do. Beſides, we have no Time in <hi>our own Power,</hi> but the <hi>preſent</hi>: And if we don't attend this Duty <hi>now,</hi> we may never have another Opportunity.</p>
            <p>Do any excuſe themſelves, becauſe 'tis a <hi>ſolemn</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? Some are too ready to make this Plea; putting too great Difference between <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> Duties of Religion. <hi>This,</hi> 'tis true, is a <hi>ſolemn</hi> Duty: But ſo is the Duty of <hi>Prayer.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>ſolemn</hi> Thing to addreſs the ſupreme Majeſty of Heaven and Earth. And perhaps the <hi>Prayers</hi> at the Sacrament, are the <hi>moſt ſolemn Part</hi> of the Duty. But let the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of the ſacramental Inſtitution be what it will, this is no Reaſon why we ſhould neglect it. The <hi>more ſolemn</hi> the Ordinance, the <hi>greater</hi> is its <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>; and the <hi>ſtronger</hi> therefore the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why we ſhould attend it.</p>
            <p>Do any excuſe themſelves, becauſe they an't <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd</hi> for ſo <hi>holy an Ordinance?</hi> This is the moſt common Plea; but a very inſufficient one. If we an't prepar'd for the Sacrament, 'tis our <hi>Sin</hi>: And do we think, that <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>our Sin,</hi> will be a <hi>ſufficient Excuſe,</hi> for a plain Neglect in Point of Duty? It can never be. If we are really unfit for an Approach to the Table of the Lord; our Duty is plain: We ſhould inſtantly ſet about the Work of preparing our ſelves herefor; and give no Sleep to our Eyes, nor Slumber to our Eye-lids, till we have accompliſht it: And the rather, becauſe if we are unprepar'd, in our <hi>habitual Frame,</hi> for the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004349_0027_10044FE9D1C9AE30"/>
Sacrament, we are unprepar'd for Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we are unfit to go to Heaven. And this is certainly a State, we ought not to be quiet in.</p>
            <p>Do any excuſe themſelves, imagining there is <hi>leſs Danger</hi> in a <hi>total Neglect</hi> of the Sacrament, than in coming to it, unleſs in the <hi>beſt prepared</hi> and <hi>moſt worthy</hi> Manner? This ſeems to be the Apprehenſion of ſome. They would willingly come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but are afraid, they ſhan't receive in ſo worthy a Manner, as they would be glad, and ſo think it <hi>ſafeſt</hi> and <hi>beſt, totally</hi> to abſtain. But this is intirely a wrong Way of thinking and arguing. For there is <hi>Danger</hi> in <hi>neglecting</hi> the Sacrament, as well as in <hi>coming to it in an unprepared Manner</hi>; and the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a <hi>total Neglect</hi> is certainly <hi>much greater,</hi> than a <hi>meer Defect</hi> in the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of Preparation. 'Tis a Fault to come to the Sacrament, unleſs we are in ſome good Meaſure prepared: 'Tis a Fault like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and a greater Fault, <hi>totally</hi> to abſtain. Our Wiſdom therefore in this Caſe is, neither to abſtain from the Sacrament, nor to come to it but in a well prepar'd Manner: And this is what we ſhould take Pains about; nor ſhould we allow our ſelves to be eaſy, till we have effected it.</p>
            <p>In fine, Do any excuſe themſelves, becauſe they imagine they ſhall be under <hi>greater Ties of Duty,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> will be <hi>expected</hi> and <hi>required</hi> of them? Some are afraid of this. They imagine, if they come to the Sacrament, they muſt lead more holy Lives; be more circumſpect, more careful of themſelves, and of their whole Walk. But neither is this an Objection of any Weight. 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>more</hi> Men <hi>profeſs,</hi> the <hi>more holy</hi> they ought to be; and the <hi>ſtronger</hi> are their Bonds to be circumſpect of their
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004349_0028_10044FECDD198DF0"/>
Ways. And is this what we are afraid of? We ſhould be aſham'd to make ſuch an Excuſe. 'Tis certainly to our Diſhonour; as arguing the Want of a juſt Senſe of that Holineſs, without which we can never ſee the Lord. We can't be <hi>too</hi> holy, nor <hi>too ſtrongly</hi> bound to endeavour to be ſo, to the <hi>higheſt Degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Time will not permit me to mention any Thing further; nor have I, indeed, any more than hinted at the Things, which have been mention'd, O be perſuaded by the Arguments wherewith you have been compelled! And let it be your <hi>ſpeedy</hi> Care to come to the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> You are now ſolemnly invited in the Name of Chriſt to give your Attendance at his Table. O excuſe not your ſelves! Let it not be ſaid, you were invited, but rejected the Invitation; leaſt the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould ſwear concerning you, that you ſhould not <hi>hereafter taſte of his Supper, in his heavenly and eternal Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for us, who have accepted the Invitation of Chriſt, and are about to <hi>eat Bread</hi> and <hi>drink Wine,</hi> according to his Appointment, let us take Heed to our ſelves, that we do it in a <hi>religious</hi> Manner. Let us put a Difference between <hi>this</hi> and <hi>common</hi> Bread and Wine. Let us eat of <hi>this Bread</hi> and drink of <hi>this Cup</hi>; employing our Tho'ts on Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring his Love in giving himſelf to die for us.</p>
            <p>And may the <hi>Love of Chriſt conſtrain us</hi> to live unto him! Since <hi>he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him who died for them, and roſe again.</hi>
