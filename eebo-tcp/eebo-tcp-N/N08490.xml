            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

If this, I ſay, hath been properly managed, it will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs anſwer what without breach of charity, we may ſuppoſe at leaſt a ſecondary motive of the reverend author in compoſing it; namely, to demonſtrate to his benefactors, that his doctrine hath not been beſtowed in vain. It certainly breaths a noble zeal for the church. Nay, in by and through the church, and ſo far as ſhe is concerned in the premiſes, it ſeems to breath a zeal for religion it ſelf. It proves, moreover, what all the Diſſenters have always aſſerted; and what the Doctor and all his brethren have always denied— that the church of England in America, for want of the grand eſſential, for which the poor gentleman is now breaking his heart, never was the church of England but an independent church. It ſhews farther, what indeed doth not carry with it ſo clear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that though this church hath hitherto been an epiſcopal church, and always well governed; it hath nevertheleſs never been an epiſcopal church; nor ever been governed at all. It ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaciouſly diſtinguiſhes between a primitive <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and a modern <hi>Engliſh Biſhop.</hi> It aſſumes an unuſual moderation; and ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally counterfeits the voice of a ſheep, that it is not every reader who will diſcriminate it from that of a wolf. In fine, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moans, with deeper moans, than any of the moſt moanful ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds in paſtoral, the numberleſs ſouls already periſhed through the neglect of his all important plan; and congratulates poſterity,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010857_0003_0F8524CD5577C5F8"/>if not the hopes of reſcuing them out of purgatory, at leaſt on the proſpect of ſpeedily introducing a kind of millenium, by the epiſcopal triple diſcharge of <hi>ordination, confirmation</hi> and <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> by virtue of which are to be converted Jews and Infidels, together with all and ſingular the Whites, Blacks and Browns, farther than from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> even from Lake <hi>Superiour</hi> to <hi>Penſacola.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>By this time alſo, 'tis probable the author begins to plume him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the ſuppoſed unanſwerableneſs of his performance; for he takes his leave, courteous reader with ſo terrific a defiance as though he was in very deed the Goliah of the fraternity; and would devour all his opponents like ſo many ſtripling Davids, at a ſingle breakfaſt. Nay, I ſhould not marvel if he had already drawn that marvellous concluſion, which by a new ſpecies of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic, is infallibly to follow from ſuffering his appeal to remain unanſwered; I mean, that in ſuch caſe all the world muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to acquieſce in his propoſal: That is, in plain Engliſh, every man muſt be preſumed to adopt the principles contained in every book, how abſurd ſoever he conceives them, unleſs he puts himſelf to the trouble of writing another book againſt it. Would not the Doctor think it hard to be thought a Romaniſt, merely becauſe he has never publiſhed an anſwer to <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine?</hi> And is not this ſingle queſtion a full refutation of his darling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? For my own part, with reſpect to any execution this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable performance is like to do among ourſelves, where almoſt every intelligent reader is able, from his own perſonal knowledge, to contradict the facts upon which great part of it, and by far the moſt plauſable part, is ſounded; I ſhould have been very willing to leave the author to triumph in his imaginary victory. But when I conſider, that it will chiefly be read in a country, where, with a moderate ſhare of addreſs, people may be made to believe, that a man can jump into a quart bottle—that thouſands of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes who never ſo much as heard the Goſpel are notwithſtanding <hi>virtual Churchmen</hi>—that what muſt inevitably ruin a country, is abſolutely neceſſary to its welfare; and that leſs than half a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, is in reality three millions and more: When I reflect, I ſay, what pernicious conſequences may be apprehended from even ſo ſlimſey a compoſition, among a people who either have no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of knowing, or will not be at the pains of inquiring into the truth of certain facts, as confidently aſſerted in the pamphlet, as if univerſally known to be true, when they are almoſt univerſally known to be otherwiſe; I cannot but think it my duty, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter an antidote to the poiſon: and to ſhew as well the falſity of the facts, as the futility of the reaſoning, by which <hi>the appeal</hi> may
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010857_0003_0F8524CD5577C5F8"/>impoſe on the weak and credulous. I ſhall therefore, without any apology of this man's <hi>having a tremor in his hand,</hi> or that one a torpor in his head, think myſelf ſufficiently authorized as a friend of truth and of ſociety, to prevent to the utmoſt of my power, the fatal, the tremendous miſchiefs, which the <hi>appeal</hi> is ſo artfully calculated to introduce; but in the courſe of my ſpeculations, I ſhall not think myſelf obliged ſcrupulouſly to adhere to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod obſerved by the reverend Doctor. So ſyſtematical an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would perhaps not be reliſhed in a number of weekly papers, which muſt from their reſpective conciſeneſs, neceſſarily require too many pauſes for a work of that nature. Beſides, to relieve thy ſpirits, gentle reader, I ſhall often be obliged to quit the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and polemic, for the gayer and more airy parts of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's lucubration. By this means thou wilt be enabled, after a ſhort and refreſhing interlude, to return with a keener appetite, to the dry cruſt of unſavoury controverſey. I ſhall think myſelf even at liberty, ſhould ſuch a meaſure appear moſt conducive to thy edification or entertainment, to fall directly upon the centre, and ſo to move towards front or rear, as occaſion requires. Nay I do not intend, by any preliminary engagements, to reſign my right of beginning with the <hi>Nag's-head,</hi> and concluding with the preface. I ſhall, not withſtanding this my <hi>non-conformity</hi> to <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed</hi> method fully conſider every part of the pamphlet that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the merits of the cauſe; or has the leaſt tendency to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an evil more terrible to every man who ſets a proper value either on his liberty, property or conſcience, than the ſo greatly and deſervedly obnoxious ſtamp-act itſelf.</p>
               <p>Conſidering the encroachments that have lately been made on our civil liberties; and that we can ſcarcely obtain redreſs againſt one injurious project, but another is forming againſt us—conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the poverty and diſtreſs of the colonies by the reſtrictions on our trade; and how peculiarly neceſſary it is, in theſe times of common calamity, to be united amongſt ourſelves; one could ſcarcely have imagined, that the moſt ambitious eccleſiaſtic ſhould be ſo indifferent about the true intereſt of his native country, as to ſow, at this critical juncture, the ſeeds of univerſal diſcord; and beſides the deprivation of our civil liberties, lend his helping hand to involve us in eccleſiaſtical bondage into the bargain. Is this a time to think of epiſcopal palaces, of pontifical revenues, of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual courts, and all the pomp, grandeur, luxury and regalia of an American Lambeth? 'Tis true, the pamphlet is ſpecious, and appears to aſk nothing but what is highly reaſonable: and could any man, above the capacity of an Ideot, really perſuade himſelf, the <hi>Doctor</hi> and the <hi>Convention</hi> would content themſelves with a Biſhop, ſo limited and curtailed as be is pleaſed to repreſent his future Lordſhip; it were manifeſt injuſtice to deny them what in their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010857_0004_0F8524CE47CBB658"/>opinion their eternal ſalvation ſo greatly depends upon. But it is not the <hi>primitive Chriſtian</hi> Biſhop they want. It is the <hi>modern, ſplendid, opulent, court favoured, law-dignified, ſuperb, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, powerful</hi> prelate, on which their hearts are ſo intent. And that ſuch a Biſhop would be one of the worſt commodities, that can poſſibly be imported into a new country, and muſt inevitably prove abſolute deſolation and ruin to this, I ſhall abundantly evince in the courſe of theſe ſpeculations.</p>

               <p>AS civil and religious liberty is the foundation of public happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the common birth-right of mankind, it is the duty and intereſt of every individual, to keep a watchful eye over, and to cheriſh it with the utmoſt care and tenderneſs. Would we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the invaluable jewel, and act the part of true friends to our country, we ought to maintain a ſacred jealouſy, that it be not raviſhed from us by open violence, nor undermined by ſecret arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and fraud. The moſt diſtant proſpect of danger will alarm; and every attempt to rob us of our privileges, however artfully diſguiſed, or varniſhed over with the ſpecious pretence of public utility, will awaken our fears, and put us upon our guard. Nor indeed, without the higheſt reaſon, as the greateſt danger ariſes from this quarter. So jealous and tenacious are mankind of their liberty, thet every attempt to deprive them of it, by open violence is generally fruitleſs. A direct attack will be reſented, and repelled with heroic bravery; and next to life and property, men will moſt zealouſly contend for its preſervation. Conſcious of this, thoſe in all ages, who have commenced tyrants, and undertaken to enſlave mankind, have ever had recourſe to artifice; and under pretext of the public good, have, by inſenſible degrees, introduced alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations into the civil and religious conſtitutions of their country; till the deluded people are gradually wormed out of their liberty, and at laſt find the ſhackles of ſlavery effectually rivetted.</p>
               <p>This being the caſe, every new project propoſed to the public, every attempted innovation, ought to be critically canvaſſed and examined, even in their remoteſt tendency and conſequences; and adopted, if at all, with the utmoſt caution and reſerve. Barely the novelty of any propoſal is, in this light, ſufficient to alarm our jealouſy, and excite our vigilance. However plauſible it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at firſt view, or diſguiſed with the colourable pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friendly to liberty, and promotive of public happineſs; if we haſtily acquieſce in, or without examination raſhly receive it, we
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010857_0004_0F8524CE47CBB658"/>ſhall probably lament our folly; and when too late, feel the fatal effects of our temerity.</p>
               <p>What led me into theſe reflections was the reading Dr <hi>Chandler</hi>'s plea for an <hi>American epiſcopate,</hi> lately publiſhed in New-York.</p>
               <p>The Scheme for ſending Biſhops into the colonies, has it ſeems been long under conſideration. 'Tis above fifty years ſince it was firſt ſtarted; and ſome proviſion made for carrying it into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It has been lately revived, and we hear, the advocates for it, both here and in England, have ſanguine expectations of its ſpeedy accompliſhment. This revival of the project the <hi>Doctor</hi> tells us is in conſequence of ſome late applications from theſe parts. No leſs than ſeven petitions we are told, have been tranſmitted by a certain convention of the epiſcopal clergy here, to ſome of the moſt reſpectable perſonages in England, earneſtly ſoliciting Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops for America; repreſenting the deplorable condition of an unmitred church; boaſting of their incredible numbers in the colonies; their diſtinguiſhed and unſhaken loyalty, and not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring very injurious reflections upon, the other denominations, as ſeditious incendiaries, and diſaffected to the king and government. With what truth theſe aſperſions are caſt upon you, <hi>my dear coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,</hi> and why at this juncture ſo vehemently urged, you muſt judge for yourſelves. If they are juſt, and you are indeed ſuch factious incendiaries, ſuch diſloyal ſubjects to the beſt of Kings as theſe addreſſes are ſaid to inſinuate, it highly concerns you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and reform: If not you will reſent them in a manner becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an injured people conſcious of their own innocence, when baſely and falſely traduced.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> calls his piece, <hi>an appeal to the public in behalf of the church of England;</hi> and as the grand deſign of it is to ſolicit an American epiſcopate, ſome may doubt the propriety of the title; and be at a loſs what, in this caſe he means by appealing to the public. It is now generally known, that the miniſtry in England have rejected the propoſal. As they muſt be ſuppoſed to ſpeak the ſentiments of their royal maſter, this muſt be conſtrued a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial from the throne. Surely the <hi>Doctor</hi> means not to affront his Majeſty, by appealing from the King to the people. To remove his ſuit from the ſovereign to the ſubject, as to a higher tribunal. This would by no means comport with his profeſſed loyalty; or be conſiſtent with that zeal for the conſtitution and government at home, to which he and his brethren avow ſo warm an attachment. And yet, if this be not his meaning, it muſt be ſomething very like it. Why elſe ſhould he talk of appealing to the public? Why lay his grievances before the people; and expreſsly invite all objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to propoſe their objections, to be freely and candidly debated before the tribunal of the public?</p>
               <p>We have been told, that in anſwer to thoſe petitions of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010857_0005_0F8524CEF73FFF48"/>
                  <hi>Doctor</hi> and his brethren, they have been ordered to be ſilent; to deſiſt from future applications on the ſubject; and to leave the affair to the conduct of their ſuperiours. Whether it was becauſe the petitions were thought a little too pragmatical and aſſuming; or to contain ſomething too warm and petulant, has not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Be that as it will, it may perhaps not be amiſs for the <hi>Doctor</hi> a little to conſider, how far he approves himſelf an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſon of the church, in counteracting thoſe orders; and in what light his appeal will in conſequence be received at home.</p>
               <p>However, as he and his brethren have ſeen ſit, for reaſons beſt known to themſelves, to put the caſe upon this iſſue.—As they have in fact appealed from the judgment of the King and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, &amp;c. to the people; and in form ſubmitted their cauſe to the hearing and deciſion of the public; we ſhall readily follow them to this reſpectable tribunal, in full confidence of a juſt and equitable determination.</p>
               <p>The queſtion then ſubmitted to you, <hi>my dear countrymen,</hi> is briefly this, viz. Whether it is reaſonable and neceſſary, in the preſent ſtate of the country, that a number of Biſhops ſhould be ſent to reſide, and exerciſe their functions in theſe American colonies; and whether the Church of England here, is really in a ſtate of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, for want of ſuch Biſhops? That you, <hi>my reſpectable judges,</hi> may be able to determine the caſe impartially, the arguments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by the <hi>Doctor</hi> in ſupport of the meaſure, ſhall be fully conſidered, and the objections againſt his ſcheme, candidly and fairly ſtated. But as the limits allowed me, will not admit of this at preſent, it muſt be the ſubject of ſome future papers.</p>

            <head>From the NEW-YORK GAZETTE, MARCH 21. An Advertiſement to the <hi>PUBLIC.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE principal deſign of the <hi>appeal to the public</hi> was, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the reaſons for which the members of the church of England in America, are deſirous of having Biſhops to reſide in this country, to ſtate and explain the plan on which alone Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Biſhops have been propoſed and requeſted, and to obviate and confute the objections, that might be ſuppoſed to ariſe in the minds of any againſt ſuch an epiſcopate. Whether the reaſons aſſigned are not ſufficient to juſtify the late application of the clergy for Biſhops, whether the nature of the propoſed epiſcopate is not honeſtly and fairly repreſented and explained, and whether the moſt conſiderable objections againſt it are not obviated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed in <hi>the appeal,</hi> is ſubmitted to the judgment of the <hi>reader</hi>— but N. B. not one of thoſe who are not readers of the pamphlet. The author was, and is, fully perſuaded of the goodneſs of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010857_0005_0F8524CEF73FFF48"/>cauſe which he undertook to plead; and, although ſenſible of his inability to do it juſtice, he had the vanity to think himſelf able to ſatisfy the public, as to the main points on which it depended. With this opinion he entered upon the work, and in the execution of it he was particularly careful to avoid giving offence, and to treat every denomination of Chriſtians, every ſet of men whom he had occaſion to mention, with great tenderneſs and all proper reſpect.</p>
            <p>The <hi>appeal</hi> upon its firſt publication, was received as favourably as the author could expect; ſeveral perſons, of different principles and characters, who condeſcended to read it, being then pleaſed to teſtify their general approbation of the performance. If it has been treated by ſome perſons latterly in a different manner, perhaps it has been owing to motives that have occurr'd ſince the time of its publication. A general attack from different quarters has been, at length, projected, and ſome of the combatants begin to ſhew themſelves.</p>
            <p>The author is not unwilling to re-examine any thing that has been advanced or aſſerted in the courſe of the <hi>appeal,</hi> and to have the ſubject "fairly and candidly debated, before the tribunal of the public," being ſtill of opinion, that the plea for American Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, the more cloſely it is examined, and the better it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, will appear proportionably to greater advantage. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore ſhall be offered on the ſubject in a reaſonable and decent way, he thinks it his duty to attend to—but to nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As to perſonal abuſe, he thinks he does not deſerve it, even from the enemies of an American Epiſcopate, to whom he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved reſpectfully; and he is determined not to regard what every innocent and honeſt man ought to deſpiſe. But although he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to debate matters with any one, who has the appearance and manner of a gentleman; yet he chooſes not to enter the liſts, in a match of flinging dirt, with ſcrubs and ſcavengers.</p>
            <p>Which of theſe characters the <hi>American Whig</hi> (for America has whigs) will think proper to appear in, can hardly be judged from his firſt exhibition; but I am ſorry to ſay that I look upon his ſymptoms to be rather unfavourable. I have alſo been told by ſome who pretend to know him, that this ſame <hi>Whig</hi> (who by the bye is repreſented to have as many heads as the monſter <hi>Hydra</hi>) is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently enraged at <hi>Somebody</hi> and <hi>Something,</hi> and has ſworn revenge upon me. If ſo, in what manner I ſhall be treated, may be eaſily conjectured. But why ſhould I be ſingled out as a mark of his reſentment? If ſome people <hi>have</hi> failed in their application for a <hi>charter,</hi> and have been diſappointed in the late <hi>election,</hi> how can I help it? Theſe are no affairs of mine, and I am not anſwerable for them.</p>
            <p>I make it a general rule to myſelf, to treat all perſons with as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010857_0006_0F8524CF1C96A250"/>much notice and reſpect as they deſerve. Upon this principle I propoſe to conduct myſelf towards the <hi>American Whig;</hi> ſo that what treatment he is to receive from me, will depend greatly upon his future behaviour. So far as he ſhall reaſon, or ſhall appear to think that he reaſons, he will have a claim to my notice; ſo far as he ſhall rail, he will be beneath it. Not a ſingle argument that is pertinent to the ſubject, ſhall eſcape my attention; and, if it pleaſes God to continue my health, I will either confeſs its force, or ſhew its weakneſs.</p>
            <p>But he muſt excuſe my not attending him in a weekly paper. For ſuch a taſk I cannot always promiſe myſelf leiſure; and, in the preſent caſe, I confeſs, I have no great inclination. Some of my objections againſt this mode of defence are the following.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1ſt. I cannot engage with him upon equal terms. If I appear in this way, it muſt be in my own perſon; but my opponent is covered with a maſk (and for a particular <q>reaſon it is his intereſt that he ſhould remain for ever maſked</q>) and an engagement by two perſons under ſuch different circumſtances, would afford to the public an odd ſpectacle. While I ſhould riſque my own cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and reputation in the fray, I know not until I can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the real features of my antagoniſt, whether he has any repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and character to riſque. For this reaſon it has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eſteemed baſe and ungenerous, for a writer who diſguiſes or conceals himſelf, to attack an author who ſtands fairly upon open ground. Such a method of carrying on hoſtilities has been looked upon as a ſort of literary buſh fighting, to which it is almoſt as inconſiſtent with prudence to expoſe one's ſelf, as it is with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to practice.</item>
               <item>2dly. There appears to me to be a great unfitneſs and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in ſuch a conteſt, on other accounts. The <hi>Appeal,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the importance of its ſubject, was written with real and great ſeriouſneſs; and the defence of it, when undertaken by its author, ought to be carried on in the ſame manner. But the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack of our <hi>Whig,</hi> is like to be conducted with a very different ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. No. I. from which we muſt at preſent judge, is penned alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a ludicrous ſtrain; it is thickly beſpangled with drolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it frequently flaſhes with witticiſms (but obſerve <hi>gentle reader,</hi> they are of a ſpurious breed,) and in ſhort, ridicules the general ſubject of the Appeal and its various parts. Now as this has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been allowed to be the faireſt method of dealing with any thing that is ſerious, ſo ſerious anſwers to funny writers, like throwing pearls before a certain kind of animals, are looked upon as impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applied; and yet none but ſerious anſwers, as has been ſaid, doth it become the author of the <hi>Appeal</hi> to give. He propoſes therefore to reſerve himſelf for the preſent, and to watch whether any thing ſolid can come from ſo ludicrous and frothy a writer;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010857_0006_0F8524CF1C96A250"/>and as to the other matters, he is perfectly indifferent. He is ſo intirely void of ſpleen, and ill-nature, and prejudice againſt this writer, that he is ready to confeſs the nimble turns and motions of his pen, and can laugh as heartily at any monkey-tricks he can exhibit for the amuſement of his Majeſty's liege ſubjects, as any other perſon. In the mean while, if any one who is not under theſe reſtraints, ſhall incline to divert himſelf with, or to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring to order, this Huſſar in controverſy, who will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine himſelf to no rules, but as the whim takes him will fly from front to rear, and from flank to center, he has my conſent.</item>
               <item>3dly. I object againſt immediately engaging with the <hi>American Whig,</hi> becauſe it is yet uncertain whether he will produce any thing worthy of notice, and becauſe I think it adviſeable to ſee the amount of his whole performances that I may have it in my power to chooſe for myſelf in what manner to deal with him.</item>
               <item>4thly. Another objection ariſes from the ſtrange averſion I have to a repetition of the ſame things. Now it happens, that among others, a gentleman of character in <hi>Boſton</hi> has undertaken a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the hapleſs <hi>Appeal;</hi> and he is entitled, both from his known reputation, and his open and manly method of advancing, to particular reſpect. I know of no one, at preſent, that bids as fair to be the object of my principal attention as this gentleman; as to thoſe anonymous writers who ſhall pleaſe to favour me with their animadverſions on my pamphlet, they will not take it amiſs, if I conſider them as belonging to an inferior claſs. They muſt be contented, ſo far as their arguments ſhall correſpond with thoſe of Dr. <hi>C—y,</hi> to take their places in his train, and hear what I have to ſay to <hi>him;</hi> but in any caſes wherein <hi>they</hi> ſhall be thought to deſerve ſpecial notice, they ſhall have it occaſionally.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Having thus declared my intention to do juſtice to all men, I will mention the manner in which it will probably be diſtributed. In the firſt place I ſhall be careful to diſtinguiſh reaſoning from railing, from empty harrangue, from the flouriſhes of wit, and from all other heterogenious mixtures. The reaſoning I will keep for my own uſe, and leave all the reſt untouched for the original proprietors, in order, that when opportunity offers, they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it more properly. I will then make a farther diſtinction, and mark out thoſe reaſons that are immediately to the purpoſe, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating them from thoſe that are but remotely ſo, and from others that ſhall have been totally miſapplied. To thoſe of the firſt, and ſecond claſſes, I will endeavour to give proper and diſtinct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; as to thoſe of the third claſs, it will be ſufficient to ſhew their impertinence.</p>
            <p>In this way I hope I ſhall be able to ſerve the cauſe of truth, and to remove prejudices and errors; and, to whiſper a ſecret into the ears of the Public, I do not deſpair, that even our <hi>American
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010857_0007_0F8524D44D3E78F0"/>Whig,</hi> with all his briſkneſs and volatility, will be proſelyted to the ſober doctrine of the Appeal. For I think his oppoſition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of long continuance, after the honeſt conceſſion he has made towards the cloſe of his paper. <q>'Tis true, ſays he, the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet is ſpecious, and appears to aſk nothing but what is highly reaſonable; and could any man, above the capacity of an Ideot, really perſuade himſelf, that the Doctor and the Convention would content themſelves with a Biſhop, ſo limited and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed as he is pleaſed to repreſent his future Lordſhip; it were manifeſt injuſtice to deny them what in their opinion their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation ſo greatly depends upon.</q> So that nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be now wanting to his converſion, but to convince him that the Doctor and the Convention would content themſelves with ſuch Biſhops as are deſcribed in the <hi>Appeal.</hi> Now this is as really and certainly true, as that he himſelf is a <hi>Whig;</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he is obſtinately reſolved to be deaf and blind to all proper evidence, it can be clearly proved to him.</p>
            <p>By way of concluſion, the author of the <hi>Appeal</hi> begs leave to aſſure the Public, that notwithſtanding the charge brought againſt him by the <hi>American Whig,</hi> he neither knows, nor believes, nor ſuſpects, that he has miſrepreſented a ſingle fact, and to ſubſcribe himſelf,</p>

            <head>From Mr. GAINE'S GAZETTE, Monday March 28. An Advertiſement to the PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS an anonymous Writer, who ſtiles himſelf <hi>The American Whig,</hi> in his laſt Monday's Publication, viz. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> II. hath accuſed <q>a certain Convention of the Epiſcopal Clergy here,</q> of having tranſmitted <q>ſeven petitions, to ſome of the moſt reſpectable perſonages in England, earneſtly ſoliciting Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops for America; repreſenting the deplorable condition of an <hi>unmitred Church,</hi> &amp;c.—and not ſparing very injurious reflections upon the other Denominations, as <hi>ſeditious Incendiaries, and diſaffected to King and Government:</hi>
               </q> I beg leave to obſerve, that I have acted as <hi>Secretary</hi> to the Convention, from its firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and have particularly attended to, and carefully read, every petition that they have tranſmitted to England, <q>ſoliciting Biſhops for America;</q> and I do affirm, that the Convention have never made any <q>injurious reflections upon the other Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,</q> by repreſenting them either <q>as ſeditious Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries,</q> or as "diſaffected to the King and Government." I do moreover affirm and declare, that this aſſertion of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> is abſolutely, utterly and intirely falſe and groundleſs. And
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010857_0007_0F8524D44D3E78F0"/>I hereby call upon him in this open manner, both as a member of, and as Secretary to the Convention, publickly to pruduce the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities upon which he has aſſerted ſo infamous a falſhood. In this caſe the moſt poſitive proof is inſiſted on, nor will the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Public be put off with a poor, ſimple, "We are told," which is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Should any perſon think that I do not treat this writer with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſpect, let him turn to the laſt paragraph of the <hi>American Whig.</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> I. where Dr. Chandler, and the Convention, (Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at leaſt as reſpectable as himſelf) are in fact accuſed of the groſſeſt falſhood and deceit, in pretending to aſk for a Biſhop only upon the plan propoſed in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> while it is <q>not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtian Biſhop they want:</q> But, &amp;c.

            <p>DR. CHANDLER'S <hi>Appeal to the Public in behalf of the Church of England in America,</hi> which from his own account, ſeems rather to be <hi>the united effort of all the</hi> CLERCY <hi>in New-York and New-Jerſey,</hi> perfected by the kind aſſiſtance of <hi>the</hi> CLERGY <hi>from the neighbouring provinces,</hi> may by this time be ſuppoſed to have circulated pretty generally. And as the ſeaſon advances, when we preſume theſe CLERGY are again to meet in voluntary Convention, this may be the proper time to propoſe a few queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for <hi>their</hi> or if the Dr. pleaſes for <hi>his conſideration.</hi> The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance ſeems replete with bold extravagant aſſertions of facts, many of which have no foundation in truth; it is greatly deficient in Chriſtian Charity, tho' not deficient in low craft, and ſeems dangerous to the civil and religious Liberties of the Colonies in America. But I perceive that if any objections be made to his Plan, our new Doctor from a perſuaſion already formed, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to aſcribe them, rather to <hi>"the dexterity and ill will of the inventors than" to "the real fears and uneaſineſs of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants."</hi> (P. 112) Nay he is ſo bold, as to aſſert that <q>
                  <hi>every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſuch plan</hi>
               </q> as he has propoſed, <q>
                  <hi>has the nature of perſecution and deſerves the name.</hi>
               </q> (82) Again he ſays, <hi>"if
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010857_0008_0F8524D466FFA480"/>no objections ſhall be offered, it will be taken for granted that all parties acquieſce and are ſatisfied."</hi> (2) Thus on the one hand, ſilence is to be conſtrued into aſſent and approbation, and on the other hand, if we object to, or oppoſe his plan, we are to be ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized as perſecutors and the worſt of mankind. However as he ſeems to admit a poſſibility that ſome <hi>"objections may continue, which may be thought to deſerve notice"</hi> and is pleaſed to erect an imaginary tribunal, and to invite the objectors <hi>"to propoſe them that they may be debated before that tribunal,"</hi> it ſeems hard to oblige thoſe, who cannot altogether approve his plan, to yield the cauſe untried, or to bear the names of <hi>"malicious, "intolerant, "perſecutors, "enemies to all religion "and the church, "hot "headed writers, "pragmatical enthuſiaſts," &amp;c.</hi> nay even to have their loyalty called in queſtion.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs there are ſome objections to this plan, that "con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue" with me, and which, to as many as I have mentioned them, ſeem to "deſerve notice" but before I propoſe them to be debated before the "tribunal of the public," I ſhould be glad the Doctor would deign to explain ſome of his terms, and give us farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation on ſome points, that I ſhall propoſe.</p>
            <p>He begins with informing us "that application has been made to our SUPERIORS, by the <hi>Clergy of ſeveral of the Colonies,</hi> requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one or more Biſhops to be ſent to America;" he complains of "unprecedented hardſhips," and "intolerable grievances," ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the "Church" the "American Church" the "Church of England in America" for want of "an American Epiſcopate" and upon this ſounds his Appeal to the Public.</p>
            <p>We ſhould be obliged to the Doctor, if he would inform us in plain terms, who are theſe <hi>ſuperiors</hi> to whom the <hi>Clergy</hi> have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; by whom theſe Biſhops are to be ſent; by what authority this American Epiſcopate is to be eſtabliſhed; or who are the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe <hi>intolerable grievances</hi> and <hi>unprecedented hardſhips?</hi> that we may the better judge, whether the apprehenſions on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our civil Liberties, which this avowed application has raiſed in the minds of many people, be well or ill founded. As he has appealed to the public, would it not be proper for him to inform us, againſt whom he appeals? Whether againſt the King his Miniſters and the Britiſh Parliament, for not redreſſing thoſe grievances, of which he complains, and for not eſtabliſhing Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy in America, as he ſeems to think they ought to have done? Or whether the Appeal is made againſt thoſe, who, thro' fear of an invaſion and infringement of their civil and religious Liberties, think it their duty to oppoſe ſuch an eſtabliſhment? If againſt the former, the court muſt indeed be auguſt and reſpectable, which he has conſtituted to take cognizance of our Sovereign and the Britiſh Parliament. If againſt the latter, as by the rules of all
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010857_0008_0F8524D466FFA480"/>well eſtabliſhed courts, both plaintiſſs and defendants are excluded from judging in their own cauſe, I fancy there will be few in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to ſit in judgment. For let the Doctor flatter as much as he pleaſes, if ever the attempt be made, he will find that the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and objections of moſt of our Colonies are too deeply rooted and too well founded, for them ever to ſubmit quietly to an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Epiſcopate, eſtabliſhed over them even by act of Parliament; this would be to deſtroy their charters, laws, and their very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; and it will be well if the Doctor and his aſſociates are not conſidered as abettors of Mr. Greenville and thoſe Enemies of America, who are exerting their utmoſt endeavours to ſtrip us of our moſt ſacred, invaluable and inherent Rights; to reduce us to the ſtate of ſlaves; and to tax us by laws, to which we never have aſſented, nor can aſſent.</p>
            <p>We would alſo aſk the Doctor, why is the application made for a Biſhop at this particular time when the liberties of America are at ſtake? Why are ſome inſinuations of diſloyalty thrown out againſt his American Brethren? For what are the tendency of his political reaſons, but to inflame the jealouſy of the people of Great-Britain? Can there be no Biſhops without eſtabliſhments; no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination without act of Parliament? Muſt this be a new and a primitive, or a part of the Engliſh Epiſcopate.</p>
            <p>The claims of the Doctor, without an eſtabliſhment, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his ſeeming modeſty and candour, are too great, not to awaken jealouſies in the minds of free born Americans, if none had been conceived there before.</p>
            <p>The "Church" the American Church, "the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in America," are the names by which he affects to diſtinguiſh that denomination of Chriſtans, to which he belongs. I wiſh the Doctor would pleaſe to define his terms, and tell us what he means by Church, and why that name ſhould be applied to Engliſh Epiſcopalians only. Are not the Lutheran and Calviniſt Churches, are not the Congregational, Conſociated and Preſbyterian Churches; are not the Baptiſt, the Quaker and all other Churches in America, of what denomination ſoever they be, members of Chriſt's Catholic Church, if they profeſs faith in Chriſt and hold the great eſſentials of Chriſtianity? Or does he mean to lay ſuch a ſtreſs on unbroken ſucceſſion, and on Epiſcopacy as by law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in England, as to make theſe eſſential to the being of a Church? His words indeed ſeem to import as much, where he ſays, <hi>"Men may ridicule the notion of uninterrupted ſucceſſion as they pleaſe"</hi> but <hi>"if the ſucceſſion be once broken and the powers of ordination once loſt, not all the men on earth, not all the angels in heaven, without an immediate commiſſion from Chriſt, can reſtore it. It is as great an abſurdity for a man to preach without being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſent, as it is to hear without a preacher, or to believe in him
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010857_0009_0F8524D62CE25758"/>of whom they have never heard."</hi> This may be the Doctor's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion borrowed from the No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jurors and other diſturbers of the Church and State during the reigns of King William, Queen Ann and King George the firſt, but ſurely it is not the doctrine of the Church of England: it has long ſince been diſclaimed by ſome of its greateſt Doctors and ableſt Divines. However, I ſhould be glad the Doctor would explain himſelf further, and try to reconcile theſe high notions with Chriſtian Charity, and with the validity of ordination in the foreign proteſtant Churches, or of thoſe who make no pretence to an unbroken ſucceſſion. The candour of his ſentiments and (if we may believe him) of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and belief of the Church of England, with regard to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of thoſe Churches in America, which are not Epiſcopal, is worthy of notice. "<hi>If,</hi> ſays he, <hi>according to the doctrine and belief of the Church of England, none have a right to govern the Church but Biſhops, then the American Church muſt be without government.</hi> (27) But leſt we may have miſunderſtood him, we deſire he may tell us, whether he means that the Epiſcopal Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are the only Church in America, and conſequently excludes all other Churches who want Biſhops, from being members of the American Church; or whether he would aſſert that all others are without order and government for want of Biſhops, and therefore undeſerving the name of Churches.</p>
            <p>The <hi>"Church of England in America,"</hi> which he often repeats, is a new expreſſion, unwarranted by ſcripture, not known in law, and hardly intelligible in language, and therefore wants explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We read in ſcripture of the Church of Antioch, of Corinth, and of Rome; and of the Churches in Aſia and Judea; but we no where read of the Church of Jeruſalem in Rome, or of the Church of Judea in Europe or Aſia; in like manner, we hear of the Church of England, the Church of Ireland, and the Church of Scotland; but the Church of England in America is a new mode of expreſſion: Yet by this new fangled term, the Doctor and other Miſſionaries affect to diſtinguiſh themſelves and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, while with an air of arrogance and ſuperciliouſneſs, they call other denominations of Chriſtians, Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>We apprehend this is not a meer impropriety of ſpeech adopted by a man who ſeems not to be one of the moſt correct writers, but a phraſe artfully introduced with a ſiniſter deſign.</p>
            <p>The Doctor cannot have read ſo little either of civil or eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical hiſtory, or be ſo very little acquainted with mankind as not to know the magic of words, and the blind devotion paid to names and ſounds. The words <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Prieſt</hi> carry great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence with them in ſome countries, and terrible confuſions and animoſities have been raiſed in other countries by the words <hi>Church, Clergy, divine right, uninterrupted ſucceſſion, indelible character,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:010857_0009_0F8524D62CE25758"/>and ſuch like undefined nonſenſe; we hope the like game will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be played in America.</p>
            <p>The <hi>"national religion"</hi> is another phraſe of the Doctor's, wherewith he gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and the doctrine he teaches and confirms with an <hi>"indeed"</hi> concerning it. Thoſe, ſays he, "who diſſent from the <hi>National Religion,</hi> have, <hi>indeed,</hi> no natural right to any degree of civil or military power." (109) As the Doctor in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place declares, that "nothing has been aſſerted in the courſe of his work, but what the author believes, upon good evidence, to be true." We hope he will produce his evidence to prove this doctrine, which ſounds ſtrange in an American ear. In the mean time, we would aſk him, why might not Chriſtianity have been allowed the honour of being called the national reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Or why is Epiſcopacy alone honoured with that name? Is it becauſe it is eſtabliſhed by law in England? Is not Preſbytery alſo eſtabliſhed by law? And was it not eſtabliſhed in 1707, a more enlightnened age ſurely than that in which Epiſcopacy was eſtabliſhed at the reformation? If the one is a national church, becauſe eſtabliſhed in England, why not the other, becauſe eſtabliſhed in Scotland? But what is this to us in America? Becauſe theſe forms are eſtabliſhed in Great-Britain, muſt they alſo be eſtabliſhed here? Many thouſands fled to the wilds of America from Epiſcopal tyranny and perſecution, and to enjoy the free exerciſe of religion in a way moſt agreeable to their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (and as they conceived) to ſcripture and reaſon; eſtabliſhed colonies, formed governments, framed laws and founded Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and muſt all theſe be termed diſſenters, becauſe the doctor and they differ? Or have they "no natural right to any degree of civil and military power," becauſe they are not of the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al religion. That is, if we believe the Doctor, the religion which he, and "<hi>the Clergy of the ſeveral colonies</hi> (meaning the miſſionaries) <hi>profeſs?</hi>"</p>
            <p>It is not doubted but every man who wiſhes to be free will, by all lawful ways in his power, oppoſe the eſtabliſhment of any one denomination in America, the preventing which is the only means of ſecuring their natural rights, to all thoſe at leaſt who may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from that denomination. The Doctor ſeems ſenſible that the oppoſition to theſe lordly prelates, will not wholly reſt with thoſe whom <hi>he</hi> terms Diſſenters, that their encroachments in civil matters are diſagreeable to very many who admit their authority in the Church; he therefore ſolemnly aſſures us, that <hi>"the Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops"</hi> he deſires, "ſhall not interfere with the property or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, whether civil or religious of <hi>Churchmen</hi> or <hi>Diſſenters</hi>"— "that they ſhall only ordain and govern the Clergy, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010857_0010_0F8524D69E8FAF48"/>confirmation to thoſe who ſhall deſire it." But when he comes to explain himſelf farther, he cautiouſly interſperſes the words, <hi>at "preſent," now,"</hi> and ſuch qualifying expreſſions as leave the Biſhops when once eſtabliſhed, a full liberty to revive every claim and privilege they have ever made or enjoyed. Even with regard to Tithes (105) while he is obviating objections that might be raiſed on account of them, he expreſſes himſelf with ſuch cautions ambiguity, as to leave it doubtful whether he does not mean that a Biſhop eſtabliſhed in America may claim and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them by the laws of England. Nay ſuch Ideas of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Magnificence has the Doctor united with the word <hi>Biſhop,</hi> that while he is pleading for ſuch as he calls primitive Biſhops, he hints at lordly revenues; he lets us know a committee was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily appointed to find out ways and means for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and ſupport of Biſhops in America; (49) that a fund has been eſtabliſhed for that particular purpoſe for more than half a century paſt;" that many thouſand pounds have been contributed to increaſe this fund. (108) But, "if this ſtock is not ſufficient for the ſupport of a proper Epiſcopate in America," <hi>"ſhould a general tax be laid on the country and thereby a ſum raiſed ſufficient for the purpoſe" "this would be no mighty hardſhip on the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;"</hi> and he who would think much of paying it, <hi>deſerves not to be conſidered in the light of a good ſubject.</hi>" (107) That here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they may be inveſted with ſome degree of civil power worthy their acceptance. (110) In ſhort, hints, that legiſlative and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers may both be placed in their hands, (ibidem) And with all theſe princely revenues, with all this acceſſion of power, what are they to do? Only to ordain and govern the Clergy? No: They are <hi>"to defend and protect both the Clergy and Laity."</hi> Theſe things are ſo unlike the appearance of a primitive Biſhop, that we muſt ſay, that though "at preſent" we hear the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e of Jacob, we ſee and may "hereafter feel the rough and hairy hands of <hi>Eſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing more I would beg to know from the Doctor; what aſſurances (beſides his own, which are too weak to be relied on in ſo momentous an affair) are we to have that Biſhops will be ſent over with ſuch limited powers? attempts are made upon Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can liberty from a quarter where it ought not to be expected. A temper is ſhewn by ſome leading prelates even now in England, that will not ſuffer us to place a confidence in them. One of them at the head of the ſociety for propogating the goſpel was not aſhamed to oppoſe a plan for the converſion of the Indians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe concerted by a denomination of Chriſtians who "followed not with him." Another of them lately attended the board of trade to prevent the grant of a charter to the Preſbyterian Church in New-York.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010857_0010_0F8524D69E8FAF48"/>
But ſuppoſe theſe Biſhops ſent over with theſe limitted powers, is there any probability they will be content with them? can we ſuppoſe that the Clergy of a Society, which thinks itſelf peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly entitled to national favour, and aſſerts itſelf to be ſo eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally connected with the ſtate, will, if once eſtabliſhed ever give eaſe or peace to other Churches in America, whom they now treat as Diſſenters, until they have a plenary poſſeſſion of every privilege enjoyed by the Church in England by law eſtabliſhed? With Biſhops at their head, will not the cry be as loud, if they have not eccleſiaſtical courts, for diſcipline and to harraſs their neighbours? A Biſhop without a court, is as unparalleled as any hardſhip complained of? Again muſt not the <hi>Clergy</hi> have a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance? The ſociety for propagating the goſpel is not able to provide for all that may be ordained; the Epiſcopal congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot maintain them; muſt they then ſtarve in America? When in England they have a legal right to the tithes? Will not the cry at laſt be, nay does not the Doctor almoſt make it already, that they alone have a right to all places of power and profit in the colonies as well as in England and Ireland, becauſe the moſt friendly to monarchy?</p>
            <p>We hope the Doctor will explain himſelf fully, and reſolve the doubts and queries we have here propoſed. On ſome other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we may enter the liſts and examine his divine right of dioceſan Epiſcopacy; his unbroken ſucceſſion: the connection between natural rights, and a national religion; his Doctrine of tithes; the numbers of his denomination and their unparalleled ſufferings in America, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>THE firſt ſettlers of the Northern colonies fled from the cruel perſecution of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to this country, which then was an uncultivated wilderneſs. The Indians ſoon became jealous of the new ſettlers, and gave them all the diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in their power. But thoſe brave ſons of religion and liberty, choſe rather to run the riſque of the rage and malice of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010857_0011_0F8524D75DAFEE08"/>ſavages, than of the perfidious and perſecuting biſhops. They continued to ſettle the country, and God, in whom they truſted, appeared for their defence, and drove out the heathens from before them.</p>
            <p>As <hi>America</hi> is a new country, and the ſettlers generally poor, they are obliged to be very laborious, in order to procure a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſubſiſtence for themſelves and families. They have ever been, and ſtill are, too much engaged in buſineſs, to get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the parties and controverſies that continued in the mother-country, and particularly in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> eſpecially as they hoped, that their great enemies the dioceſan biſhops, would be contented, ſince they had in effect procured them to be baniſhed from the land of their nativity. Indeed, we could not but hope, they would have ſuffered us to live in peace in theſe remote parts of the earth; and that the vaſt Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ocean would have ſerved for a partition between us to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. But ſince it appears, that their ſpiritual lordſhips are invited to follow us, even into theſe diſtant corners of the earth, it is become neceſſary to conſider, with ſome degree of attention, the parties which compoſe the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, to ſhew what little regard is to be paid to thoſe ignorant zealots, who aſſert that there are no parties among them, in order that due juſtice may be done to their reſpective characters; and that it may be clearly known who are the perſons we intend to cenſure. For as there are many worthy men belonging to that communion, equally expoſed with the wiſe and virtuous of every other denomination to the peſtilent project in embryo, I mean the deſign of importing a cargo of Biſhops, it is not our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give them any offence.</p>
            <p>The reformation was begun in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth, and that from no very religious motive. Since the Pope refuſed to grant him liberty to marry, he aſſumed to himſelf the ſame ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in <hi>England,</hi> which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had uſurped over the Church and conſciences of men. And he carried this power ſo exceeding high, that his ſubjects were forced to comply with his injunctions, or be ruined. The conſequence was, that while a few embraced the reformation out of conſcience, multitudes ſubmitted merely to ſave their eſtates, and avoid perſecution. Hence, when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> commanded them to return to popery, they very generally complied. Nor is there any reaſon to think they were, for the moſt part, more ſincere in their re-converſion to proteſtantiſm, at the command of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And thus the national Church of <hi>England</hi> was erected; ſuch were the greater part of her clergy and laity.</p>
            <p>This clearly ſhews us the origin of two famous parties, viz. <hi>High-Church</hi> and <hi>Low-Church,</hi> as they are termed in <hi>England.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:010857_0011_0F8524D75DAFEE08"/>From the beginning of the reformation, it being effected ſo much by force, many who were really papiſts in their hearts, yielded to the times, and conformed out of ſelf-intereſt. Such were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtrongly inclined to prevent every farther ſtep of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and choſe rather again, to coaleſce with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Such were always mighty ſticklers for pomp in religious worſhip; for rites and ceremonies, and the uninterrupted line of ſucceſſion: And ſuch, in a word, have always been the ringlead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in perſecuting all, who, from a principle of religion and conſcience, could not adopt their meaſures. For having themſelves no idea about tenderneſs of conſcience, they would make no allowance for others. When the houſe of <hi>Stuart</hi> was called to the throne of <hi>England,</hi> and proved, as is well known by woful experience, a weak and tyrannical race of princes, who meditated utterly to deſtroy the liberties of the nation; the high Churchmen joined heartily with them, and endeavoured to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all their meaſures. The Biſhops and Clergy intoxicated thoſe monarchs with the moſt fulſome flattery, aſſuring them, that as vicegerents of God, they were not accountable to men, and that ſubjects muſt obey on pain of damnation: The kings in return promoted thoſe ſycophants to great riches and dignity, and permitted them to gratify their cruel and popiſh ſpirit, by perſecuting their fellow proteſtants. And thus they continued to ravage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the nation, till God, in his merciful providence, put an end to their tyranny, by King <hi>William</hi> the IIId. of glorious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. But have they been quiet and ſubmiſſive ſince the happy revolution? No, they greatly diſturbed the peace and comfort of that excellent prince, by many plots and conſpiracies: And they had accompliſhed the extirpation of the national liberty in the reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> had not the Almighty graciouſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and again blaſted their execrable deſigns.</p>
            <p>The ſame reſtleſs party raiſed rebellions in the reigns of <hi>George</hi> the firſt and ſecond, and involved the nation in blood and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—And who are now ſo earneſtly deſirous of having Biſhops introduced into the colonies, to lord it over them? Who indeed but the High Churchmen? Many of the American Miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries are High Churchmen; ſince they cannot on any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent plan, juſtify their conduct in gathering Proſelytes from other communions. They are the true, if not the only, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and approvers of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s principles and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>The other party is that which is commonly known by the name of <hi>Low Churchmen,</hi> and may be thus characterized. They em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the reformation from conſcience, and have always been diſpoſed to carry it farther; lamenting the many unhappy defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010857_0012_0F8524D8317CF9D0"/>of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> the relicks of popery; and the ſuperſtitious rites and ceremonies ſtill retained. They have ever been favourable to the proteſtant Diſſenters; and firmly attached to the civil liberties of their country; to the <hi>revolution,</hi> and the illuſtrious houſe of <hi>Hanover;</hi> but avowed enemies to popery ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and arbitrary power. Theſe do not deſire to impoſe dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Biſhops to undermine our rights and privileges. Nor do the <hi>Low Churchmen in the colonies,</hi> wiſh for the reſidence of thoſe eccleſiaſtic Lords amongſt us. With this part, which is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy part of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we have no controverſy. They are generally men of amiable characters; and heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in every lawful and decent meaſure, in oppoſing the late ſtamp-act. They are ſincere friends to their country; and pity it is, that the Miſſionaries do not learn moderation and candour from them; nor pay more regard to their advice and example. Then ſhould we not be perpetually ſtunned with <hi>the Church is in danger, the Church is in danger;</hi> nor with the great importance and neceſſity of rites and ceremonies; nor the introduction of Biſhops into the American plantations.—Whenever therefore, in the courſe of theſe papers, I ſhall ſay any thing reſpecting the Epiſcopal Clergy or laity, that appears harſh or invidious, I would always be underſtood as aiming at the <hi>High Church</hi> party, the reſtleſs and implacable enemies of our liberty civil and ſacred.</p>

            <p>IN my laſt paper I took notice of ſome of the favourite cant words in Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Appeal, &amp;c. which he has uſed to amuſe and impoſe on the public; the common practiſe of deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, who want to raiſe diſturbances in Church or ſtate. Such kind of words they uſually throw out to catch the unwary; the more undefined and the leſs underſtood, ſo much the better. <hi>Great</hi> is Diana of the Epheſians, was the watch-word given, when Demetrius and his fellow-craſtſmen threw the whole city of Epheſus into an uproar. Dr. Demetrius honeſtly told his fellow-tradeſmen, that by the preaching of St Paul their then Craſt, and conſequently their wealth, was in danger. Whatever weight this argument might have with them, he knew it would not have the ſame with the populace; therefore it was neceſſary to tell them that the temple of the great Goddeſs Diana and her image, were
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010857_0012_0F8524D8317CF9D0"/>in danger of being deſpiſed. This was ſufficient to alarm the people and to raiſe their ſpirits and inflame their paſſions, the cry was put into their mouths; great is Diana of the Epheſians, High-Church forever. It requires but very little reading to know how often and how ſucceſsfully the ſame art has been practiſed ſince. The <hi>Church,</hi> the Church is in danger, was a notable cry, at a never-to-be-forgotten period of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hiſtory, when the very perſons who raiſed it and kept it up, were labouring to introduce Popery, the pretender, and arbitrary power; and had not God in his providence blaſted their wicked deſigns, and opened the way for the acceſſion of the preſent royal family, before they had brought their ſchemes to bear, the conſequences might have been ruinous to the nation.</p>
            <p>The people had been taught from their infancy to revere the Church without knowing what is meant; they were told by their ſpiritual Guides that it was in danger, without being informed from whence the danger aroſe. Thus their fears were awakened, their paſſions inflamed and directed againſt the friends of liberty, religion, and their country. In ſhort ſuch men as Tillotſon, Tenniſſon, Hoadly, Burnet, the ſhining Lights and greateſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of their own Church, were vilely miſrepreſented as betrayers of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee in what manner Dr. Chandler endeavours to raiſe a clamour in America. throughout his whole appeal, he takes it for granted that the Epiſcopalians are the <hi>American Church,</hi> and that his aſſociates the miſſionaries are the <hi>Clergy:</hi> all other denominations of Chriſtians be treats as Diſſenters, Schiſmatics, and Sectaries; and to their paſtors and public teachers he hardly deigns to allow the name of miniſters; <hi>their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is at leaſt irregular and defective,</hi> but in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment null and void, and of conſequence they are no miniſters of Chriſt; for ſays he, it is as great an abſurdity to preach without being <hi>properly</hi> ſent, as to believe in him of whom they have never heard—The cry is then raiſed the American Church is in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, its ſufferings are unparalleled, it is periſhing for want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſaries, (99) its oppreſſion is ſuch as to deſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of the whole Chriſtian world, (114) "it is ready to expire, and nothing but its ruin is foreſeen, unleſs Biſhops be ſent ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily" (113)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Clergy,</hi> a word of deep import, and uſed to purpoſe in ſounding the trumpet of ſedition; the Clergy of ſeveral colonies have taken the alarm, and applied to our <q>Superiors for aid and aſſiſtance in this dangerous Criſis:</q> Who theſe <hi>Superiors</hi> are, he does not tell us, but doubtleſs they are the ſame on whom he calls for an eſtabliſhment of Epiſcopacy, namely the <hi>Britiſh Nation</hi> (87) <hi>and the Guardians of its Intereſts,</hi> (114) thoſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010857_0013_0F8524D901571FD8"/>who are <hi>entruſted with the Intereſts of the Nation,</hi> &amp;c. (113) in ſhort, notwithſtanding the Doctor's ſtudied ambiguity, this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt be ultimately intended for the parliament of <hi>Great-Britain:</hi> And to rouſe the paſſions of the Britiſh Nation, and inflame their Jealouſly, already too much raiſed by the enemies of America, he ſtrongly inſinuates, that the ſtate is not ſafe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Epiſcopacy be eſtabliſhed in America; and attempts to raiſe ſuſpicions of diſloyalty againſt all other denominations of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <q>
                  <hi>No Trumpet of ſedition,</hi> ſays he, was ever heard to ſound from our <hi>Pulpits;</hi> no ſeeds of diſaffection have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more privately to be ſown in our houſes.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">For fear this ſhould not be applied, the Doctor adds a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Note in the following Words; "This Accuſation is not intended <q>to imply any accuſation of others; who are able, <hi>'tis hoped,</hi> to make their own <hi>Defence,</hi> whenever the Occaſion ſhall require it. His Majeſty's <hi>American</hi> Subjects of all Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, belonging to the <hi>old</hi> Colonies, have always <hi>profeſſed</hi> ſentiments of Loyalty, and the author <hi>believes</hi> they have <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> been ſincere in thoſe profeſſions, &amp;c.</q>
                  </note> Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a ſecurity to the government for our honouring the King, and not meddling with them that are given to change, (41)<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Notwithſtanding the Doctor here inſinuates, that paſſive Obedience and Non-Reſiſtance are the reigning Principles of the <hi>American</hi> Church, yet to the Honour of the Epiſcopalians it muſt be allowed, that they are not of the Doctor's Stamp; but are zealous Friends to Liberty, and have always been, and no doubt are, as ready to oppoſe any attacks on their own Rights, and thoſe of their Fellow-Subjects, as any Set of Men in America.</note> it may be reaſonably expected from thoſe in authority, that they will ſupport and aſſiſt the Church in America, if from no other reaſon, yet from a <hi>regard to the ſtate;</hi>
               </q> (115) nay in another place (113) he aſſerts, that monarchy cannot ſubſiſt without epiſcopacy; ſo that in his next appeal we may expect to hear the old cry "no Biſhop no King," revived. But as if this was not ſufficient to alarm the fears of the nation, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor endeavours to perſuade, that his Church is the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by law eſtabliſhed, that they are eſſentially the ſame; that both muſt ſubſiſt or periſh by the ſame means; and that therefore unleſs Epiſcopacy is eſtabliſhed in America, the Church in the mother country will be ruined; (113) and to confound the Ideas in the minds of the populace, the term <hi>Church of England in America</hi> is uſed, juſt as the favourers of popery uſe the phraſe Church of Rome in England, in Ireland and in France, to give a colour and lay a foundation for the claims and uſurpations of the pope in thoſe countries.</p>

Let us now enquire who are the Cergy of the ſeveral colonies, who have made this application. I believe that no man will ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the miniſters of either the Baptiſt, Congregational, Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, Calviniſt, Lutheran, Preſbyterian, or Quaker congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are concerned in ſuch an application: and if I am well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (and I believe I am) not one of the Clergy of any deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Southward of Pennſylvania had any hand in it. The miſſionaries only therefore ſeem to be the Doctor's Clergy. Though their knowledge of the civil rights of mankind, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found erudition may not be diſputed, yet their rank in life at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is not very high; for this reaſon probably the Doctor thought it neceſſary, in order to give ſome weight and importance to the application, to dignify them with the title of the "Clergy, of the ſeveral colonies." By acts like theſe, men of low original have been exalted into high ſtations, and thereby enabled to diſtreſs perſons more worthy than themſelves; thus the Cardinals roſe to the high rank they now hold in the Church of Rome.</p>
            <p>As theſe miſſionaries aſſume of late an air of importance, I may be indulged while I endeavour to explain their riſe and the nature of their miſſion.</p>
            <p>Our Forefathers harraſſed by ſpiritual Courts and the <hi>Power</hi> of the lordly prelates (which in oppoſition to the Doctor I will venture to aſſert, and if he pleaſes will undertake to prove, has always been <hi>ſtrained too high,</hi> when the times would admit) being likewiſe denied the privilege of peaceably worſhipping God in a way the moſt agreeable to their conſciences, at laſt wearied out with perſecution, reſolved to leave their native country, and ſeek ſhelter in the wilds of America. The power of the Church of England by law eſtabliſhed, they imagined was confined to England; and for this opinion they had reaſon, and the authority of ſome of the greateſt lawyers; having therefore croſſed the Atlantic, they thought themſelves ſecure from the oppreſſive tyranny of any proud Ecceſiaſticks.</p>
            <p>What hardſhips they endured in forming their ſettlements, are not to be deſcribed, hardly to be conceived! However amidſt theſe diſtreſſes their ſpirits were ſupported with the enjoyment of their civil and religious liberties, and the hopes of tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to poſterity.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was the country ſettled, towns built and proſpects of peace and plenty opening to their view, than thoſe prelates from whoſe power and perſecution they had fled, began to envy them their liberty, and to lay plans and concert meaſures to bring them again under the yoke of bondage. To prepare the way, a ſociety is formed under the ſpecious pretence of propagating Chriſtianity in foreign parts; a fund is eſtabliſhed for defraying the expences, and pious well diſpoſed perſons are deſired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to this fund.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:010857_0014_0F8524D9A56DC598"/>
For every propoſal, there may be aſſigned a <hi>ſpecious</hi> reaſon and a <hi>true</hi> reaſon; the ſpecious reaſon here alledged was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Indians in America; this being cried up, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated many and procured large donations from people of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations. The true but latent reaſon, as it ſeems, was to prepare the way for Epiſcopal dominion; hence it came to paſs that tho' many miſſionaries were ſent to America, with ſalaries paid them out of the money ſubſcribed for converting heathens to Chriſtianity, not more than two or three (juſt enough to talk of and keep up the pretence) were ever ſet among the Indians, the reſt were chiefly employed in New-England, New-York, New-Jerſey and Pennſylvania, and ſettled in the cities and larger towns and villages, in which the regular public worſhip of God had been long before duly kept up and a miniſtry maintained.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">The candid Doctor Bray, the Biſhop of London's Commiſſary in Maryland, juſt before the Incorporation of the Society (who our Doctor calls the Father of the Society) after having taken great Pains to inform himſelf, ſays "that from New-York North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, be found very little Need of Miſſionaries, and in the Colonies of Connecticut and the Maſſachuſetts, <hi>none at all—</hi> And yet in <hi>1761</hi> there were <hi>30</hi> Salary Men employed by the Society in New-England, <hi>35</hi> in New-York, New-Jerſey and Pennſylvania, and only <hi>14</hi> in all other Continent and Iſland Colonies, altho' poor blind Heathen Negroes, make up the Body of the People in moſt of theſe laſt mentioned.</note> Theſe miſſionaries to magnify their office and ſhew the ſucceſs of their miſſion, tranſmit regularly to the ſociety, journals of their proceedings ſtuffed with accounts of the converſion of Quakers, Baptiſts, Preſbyterians, &amp;c. not to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but to Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. This calls to my mind the biſhop of St. Aſaph's Sermon before the ſociety who ſpeaking of the Popiſh miſſionaries, ſays, <q>Their miſſions do not ſeem to be managed with an <hi>Apoſtolic Simplicity.</hi> They ſettle themſelves in nations that are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans already and have been ſo from the beginning; and under the pretence of converting the infidels that are among them, their chief buſineſs ſeems to be to pervert Chriſtians from their <hi>ancient faith;</hi> and to draw them over to a ſubjection to the <hi>Pope;</hi> the want of which ſubjection, they think the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt error they find among them, and which they zealouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eradicate, whilſt the Infidels are very ſparingly (if ever) applied to by them</q>—How applicable is this to the conduct of the ſociety! Mutato Nomine de te Fabula narratur.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of Queen Ann's reign a violent puſh was made to eſtabliſh Epiſcopacy in America by act of parliament, and to get Biſhops ſent over whoſe power and authority might influence
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010857_0014_0F8524D9A56DC598"/>or over awe the people there, and prepare them for what was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating in England; theſe Biſhops were to have power <q>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend both Clergy and Laity.</q> (50) The demiſe of the Queen and the acceſſion of the Hanover family blaſted their hopes, whereupon the American Epiſcopate was dropt; and the colonies left to the enjoyment of their civil and religious privileges, till this time of danger and diſtreſs, which theſe reſtleſs ambitious men have again ſeized as their moſt favourable opportunity— Notwithſtanding this diſappointment the miſſionaries have been kept up, and their numbers enlarged to the utmoſt Ability of the ſociety; but of late they have conſiderably diminiſhed their ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Whether this ariſes from a failure in their funds, occaſioned by ſome attempts that have been made to explain the manner in which the ſociety have perverted the deſign of their inſtitution, and miſapplied the monies committed to their care; or whether it ariſes from the exaggerated accounts ſent over by the miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the numbers by them converted, who if the caſe had been ſo would undoubtedly have been able to have ſupported their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as is done by the people of all other denominations;) or from whatever cauſe it proceeds, ſuch is the diſagreeable ſituation of their affairs; and this ſeems greatly to alarm the miſſionaries and make them ſtruggle hard for a maintenance from other ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties. For notwithſtanding (if the Doctor is to be believed) there are a million of ſouls belonging to their Church, yet he confeſſes <q>that they have no proſpect, but muſt ſtill depend in a great meaſure upon the charity of their benefactors, until God ſhall either enable or diſpoſe their friends in this country to do more for them.</q> (107) With Biſhops at their head, their forces will be better united and their attempts to have this <hi>"more"</hi> done for them, will probably be attended with greater ſucceſs: then to be ſure will be the time to try for a general tax for the ſupport of the Biſhops and Clergy, which laſt <q>now depend on the charity of their benefactors at home,</q> and ſhould they be able to carry their point and <q>a general tax be laid on the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and thereby a ſum raiſed ſufficient for the purpoſe</q> the Doctor peremptorily declares <q>that he that could think much to pay it, deſerves not to be conſidered in the light of a good ſubject or member of ſociety.</q> (108) This he modeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands only for the Biſhops at preſent, but leaves room to think he deſires to have the miſſionaries included, as he has the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable expreſſion, <hi>for any uſe.</hi> I dare ſay if the Doctor ſhould live to ſee that time, he would have no ſcruple to excommunicate ſuch a perſon as his predeceſſors in the <hi>unbroken line</hi> have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently done in like caſes.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſeems ſenſible, that the preſent criſis of public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs is favourable; when a powerful party at home is formed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010857_0015_0F8524DA8EFC8858"/>againſt America, and therefore he preſſes the eſtabliſhment of an American Epiſcopate with all <hi>poſſible ſpeed;</hi> and no doubt it is to encourage the attempt that he exaggerates the numbers of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and would perſuade his ſuperiors in England, that it is deſired by near a million in America, a deception ſo barefaced, that if his appea had been deſigned only for the people of America, it would need no refutation.</p>

               <salute>Mr. PARKER. <hi>Pleaſe to inſert the following in your next, and you'll oblige a Friend.</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ON reading in the New-York Mercury, an advertiſement of a weekly paper to be publiſhed, under the title of <hi>A Whip for the American Whig;</hi> I could not help falling into a train of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflections, on the perſecuting genius that inſpires the <hi>high flying Tory-party,</hi> in the Epiſcopal Church: To this day, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſeverity has mark'd their character; and for aught I ſee, it is ſo deeply radicated in their <hi>very</hi> conſtitution, that they will not ceaſe to be <hi>ſavages,</hi> till they ceaſe to exiſt, without paſſing through ſome wonderful <hi>metamorphoſis.</hi> You are warned of your fate a <hi>whole week</hi> before the ſcene is opened. Sentence is paſſed, it will certainly be executed. The poor <hi>Whig</hi> muſt undergo the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the <hi>Whip.</hi> This, Sir, is but a prelude of what you may look for; you, are yet to be chaſtiſed <hi>only</hi> with <hi>whips;</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, when the <hi>apoſtolical monarchs</hi> are come over, and well eſtabliſhed in their American dominions, you, and ſuch as you, will be chaſtiſed with <hi>ſcorpions.</hi> But this is not all; the <hi>bellum epiſcopale,</hi> will doubtleſs be declared with every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of awful pomp; and this extenſive continent may ſoon be alarmed with the thund'ring ſignal, <hi>the ſword of the lord, and of the Biſhop.</hi> Then, O dreadful! The torrent of epiſcopal vengeance! Then all who will not be ſo ſenſeleſs as to adore the <hi>mitre</hi> and <hi>ſurplice,</hi> and dedicate both their conſciences and purſes to his <hi>epiſcopal Majeſty,</hi> may lay their account with— With what? With ſomething, I will not <hi>yet particularly name,</hi> but what one may eaſily diſcover, by turning over a Church hiſtory or two. This may be the fate of many, unleſs indulgent heaven interpoſe, by not ſuffering the <hi>right reverend and holy ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi> to plunge their ſpiritual ſwords in the ſouls of their fellow creatures; or, if this is permitted, by determining the ſecular powers, not to ſuffer their <hi>anathemas</hi> to be executed to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt limits of their ſeverity. I know what I am ſaying, Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans ſhall feel the truth of what I have now ſurmiſed, at leaſt, in part, if they do not now beſtir themſelves, and unite as one man,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010857_0015_0F8524DA8EFC8858"/>to oppoſe the erection of ſpiritual monarchies, with all the hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm they would diſplay in oppoſing a formidable army of <hi>dons</hi> and <hi>monſieurs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems the <hi>Whipper</hi> is not of opinion that the almoſt unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled hardſhips, which the anceſtors of many of us ſuffered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>moſt</hi> abſolute tyranny of the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> lords in the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, do not conſtitute a ſufficient reaſon for our being alarmed at the preſent conjuncture. It ſeems his ſoul within him is in agony, when he reflects, that <hi>ſuch of them</hi> as eſcaped the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſword, ſound an aſylum in the wilds of America, among In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and rattle-ſnakes, more hoſpitable to them than Biſhops, and their devoted creatures, the curates; and when he takes a view of <hi>their</hi> poſterity peaceably enjoying the repoſe that was purchaſed by unexampled induſtry and fatigue. It ſeems I ſay, this is the real temper of this epiſcopal zealot; elſe why is he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at us, and threatens us with the <hi>Whip,</hi> when we complain that the <hi>prelatical Clergy</hi> (for I dare ſay the people in communion with them, do not deſire the woful day) are inceſſantly labouring to bring over the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> men of the ſame office and ſtamp, with thoſe <hi>blood ſuckers,</hi> who obliged our anceſtors to abandon their native land, and leave behind them what is the very heaven of perſecutors, and temporiſing conformiſts.</p>
            <p>I intend to lay before the public, a tragical hiſtory of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of Britiſh Biſhops, ſince the reformation which, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded will alarm, not only thoſe who <hi>are called</hi> diſſenters, but every perſon in communion with the epiſcopal Church, who is not ſo hardened as to be unſuſceptible of every human and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an impreſſion.</p>
            <p>Mean while, I cannot help ſmiling at the cringing ſubmiſſion of the <hi>complete</hi> gentleman, who has undertaken the office of a <hi>Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> a high flying Tory ſo humbled! One, who no doubt expects to be elevated one day or other, to a deanary, perhaps to the epiſcopal throne, now brought ſo low as to ſtand at a <hi>Whipping-Poſt,</hi> and belabour the <hi>poſteriors</hi> of a poor <hi>Whig;</hi> I wiſh he would take care of the <hi>conſequence.</hi> After this, I hope I ſhall have the pleaſure to find every one who is found to be an <hi>acceſſary</hi> to the <hi>Whipper,</hi> or who favours his paper, to be laugh'd at in the ſtreets, and in every corner to meet with the ſalute, your humble ſervant Mr. <hi>Whipper.</hi>

                  <hi>If you approve of the following ſentiments, I beg you'll publiſh them to prevent Epiſcopalians in general, from being the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of undiſtinguiſhing reproach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SUCH a train of evils have followed the inveſtiture of the Chriſtian clergy with temporal powers and dignities, that it is impoſſible for a generous mind, to reflect upon the exemption of <hi>America</hi> from the dominion of rich and proud ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieſiaſtics, without exultation and tranſport. While the primitive Church was neglected or perſecuted by the princes and nobles of this world, it ſpread and triumphed; but no ſooner was it foſtered and patronized by the great, than it became diſtinguiſhed rather for corruption than piety; and manifold experience has evinced what our bleſſed Lord had declared, that his kingdom was ſo far from being of this world, that true Chriſtianity, as tho' it ſcorned all ſecular aids, flouriſhed beſt, when, inſtead of the ſmiles, it had the frowns and the contempt of the world. All hiſtory is in favour of theſe remarks; and therefore, tho' I am not againſt Kings becoming nurſing fathers to the Church, yet has ſhe no cauſe to thank them for all their flattering endowments, which tend to puff up the pride of her ſons: This inſtead of nurſing, is poiſoning her; and it would be ſo far from promoting her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to make every ſucceſſor of the apoſtles, as rich as a lord, (a condition which too many deſire) that I believe the goſpel harveſt would in ſuch caſe, find ſcarce a labourer to gather it in.</p>
               <p>I was led to theſe reflections by the peruſal of <hi>Doctor Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's</hi> lamentations for the want of Biſhops in <hi>America:</hi> This gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman thinks we have greatly ſuffered, and are expoſed to ſtill great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hardſhips, for the want of this order of Clergymen amongſt us; I ſay <hi>we,</hi> becauſe I profeſs myſelf a Churchman, tho' ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly oppoſed to his project; and I hope a difference of ſentiment upon this ſubject, will never be made a teſt, whether a man is, or is not, a true ſon of the Church. If a ſincere approbation of the worſhip, diſcipline, and doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is ſufficient to merit the character, my claim to it is free from excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and had I my reſidence in <hi>England,</hi> it ſhould not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited for want of an acquieſcence in, or indeed, if neceſſary, a conteſt for the Church, with all the temporal privileges and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities confirmed by the law of the land; becauſe I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it would be difficult, if not impoſſible, to innovate
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010857_0016_0F8524DB39981848"/>with amendments in that country, without expoſing the Church and kingdom to conſequences ruinous to both.</p>
               <p>But tho' a Churchman, I am an <hi>American Churchman,</hi> a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>American</hi> epiſcopal Church; for in my judgement there is a real difference between an <hi>American</hi> Church of <hi>Englandman,</hi> if I may ſo ſpeak, and an <hi>American Epiſcopalian.</hi> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny civil and religious appendages and annexations, the undoubted rights of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which <hi>Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> in <hi>America</hi> cannot, as friends to <hi>this country,</hi> wiſh to ſee introduced. According to this diſtinction, I am in principle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to tithes, Biſhops, baronies, and a thouſand other powers and peculiarities, occaſioned by the liberality of popes and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the ſuperſtition of the vulgar.</p>
               <p>Thus far, perhaps, I have given no great umbrage to the author of the <hi>Appeal;</hi> and I believe to but few of the Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians of this continent. But I go farther than the <hi>Doctor</hi> and his advocates will perhaps think conſiſtent with my profeſſion as a churchman. And I confeſs the oppoſition to an Epiſcopate in America, gives ſo much ground for ſuſpicion, as to render an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of a few reaſons neceſſary to vindicate my claim; theſe are too many to be crowded into the compaſs of a ſingle letter, and if they are not better urged by others, will occaſion a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our correſpondence. I ſhall at preſent confine myſelf to one ſingle topic, and that is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With the Biſhops we ſhall naturally have the introduction or eſtabliſhment of ſpiritual or eccleſiaſtical courts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The power of theſe judicatories is great and formidable; for the ſpiritual cognizance reaches to perjuries in Church matters, uſury, aſſaults and batteries of Clergymen, brawlers in Churches, and Church-yards, marriage contracts, alimony, adultery, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces, fornication, drunkenneſs, blaſphemy, abſence from Church, with-holding contributions for building Churches, ſubſtracting legacies, temerary adminiſtration, or the obſtructing the proof of wills, ſlander, diſturbing the poſſeſſion of pews or ſeats, ſubſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of marriage portions; fees of judges, regiſters and proctors, and to all other offences prohibited by the canons of the Church.</p>
               <p>As a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I am not averſe to the puniſhment of enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that bring reproach and ſcandal upon our moſt holy religion. As <hi>a Churchman,</hi> I hold, that the power to inflict it, belongs to the Biſhop. As an <hi>Old England Churchman,</hi> I aſſert, that the Biſhop's decree does legally expoſe the delinquent to civil inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies: But as an <hi>American Churchman,</hi> I would limit the power of the Church and clergy to a meer excommunication, or denial of the ſacrament of the Lord's-ſupper, and give the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſhment of the offences triable in <hi>England</hi> in the ſpiritual court, to the judges of the court of common law. For no man
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010857_0017_0F8524DBEC7AB418"/>can inſiſt, that the Engliſh Biſhops have authority, <hi>jure divine,</hi> to all that extent of power they at preſent enjoy. As ſucceſſors to the apoſtles, they can claim no right which their predeceſſors had not; and to me, the ſuppoſition is utterly incredible, that the Apoſtles either exerciſed, or claimed the authority which the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England</hi> now execute in their ſpiritual courts.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop's title is not derived from the apoſtolic commiſſion: They are ſeized by the law of the land, and will hold their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminencies till this law is altered, by king, lords and commons.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Hale,</hi> who was no zealous advocate for the eccleſiaſtical courts, tells us, in his hiſtory of the common law, <hi>that every Biſhop by his election and confirmation, even before conſecration, had ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical juriſdiction annexed to his office, as</hi> judex ordinarius <hi>within his dioceſe, and divers abbots antiently, and moſt arch dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to this day, by uſage, have had the like juriſdiction within certain limits and precincts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop's right to open his court being therefore ſecured by the common law, and that being univerſally acknowledged to be the law of the colonies, his lordſhip will find no difficulty, after his dioceſe is eſtabliſhed, to erect a tribunal, for good reaſons long diſguſtful to the people of <hi>England;</hi> and which <hi>Americans</hi> dread to almoſt the ſame degree of horror, which they feel at the thoughts of the inquiſition itſelf,</p>
               <p>As the new Biſhops will have the law on their ſide, ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ſtate of the judges in the provinces, will probably favour the deſign, not only of erecting thoſe courts, but of extending them, in all doubtful caſes, moſt to the advancement of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal claims. To be the better underſtood, I will put a caſe, which, if ever a Biſhop ſhould arrive in this country, will doubtleſs be a very common one.</p>
               <p>It may well be ſuppoſed that the zeal of ſome Engliſh or Dutch Calviniſt miniſter, in ſome private or public controverſy with one of our miſſionaries, may let ſlip the old accuſation, that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, inſtead of preaching the doctrines of the thirty nine articles of our Church, inculcates the hereſy of Arminius; ſuch a charge, if ill grounded, may be thought ſufficient to ſupport a libel for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation; upon complaint, the Biſhop's court will doubtleſs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proceſs to iſſue: A defendant wrongfully impleded there, muſt apply for his relief to the judges at common law, for a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his lordſhip. But if the matter is proper for ſpiritual cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, or even dubious, what proſpect will there be of ſucceſs; while my lord Biſhop figures away in parade and intereſt, beyond any governor upon the continent; and the judges hold their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions only during pleaſure? The inferior clergy of our own Church, I conſider as ſo many life-guards to his lordſhip, and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010857_0017_0F8524DBEC7AB418"/>ſupported by their letters in his favour, and his own connections with the reverend bench in the mother country, no remonſtrance on the part of the judges, will ſecure them from calumny and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation. In ſo unequal a conteſt, every irreſolute judge will become the dupe of the clergy; and what hopeful effects the epiſcopal influence will then have upon liberty and property, is eaſier to foreſee, than to deſcribe. In a word, as no lay charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in this country will be a match for the Biſhop's, in point of fortune, ſplendor, power and intereſt, not a man will mount the ladder of perferment, without his Lordſhip's aid; and we may have the mortification to ſee the officers of government, from his Majeſty's council, down to a juſtice of the peace, courting the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a pariſh, to recommend them to the favour of a haughty prelate, who will doubtleſs monopolize, by the creatures of his power, all poſts and places civil, eccleſiaſtic, and military.</p>
               <p>If any man thinks theſe the viſionary dreams of an extravagant deſpondency, or an over-weaning attachment to <hi>American</hi> liberty; I muſt reply, in my turn, that <hi>his</hi> eaſe and ſecurity, are owing to his ignorance of the nature and extent of the ſpiritual court; and the countenance given to it by the common law itſelf. The Biſhop has a throne of judgment for all ſcandals upon the Chriſtian name, and two ſcolds cannot fling out the charge of whoredom, free from his Lordſhip's controul. Under him there will be a regiment of deans, and chapters, arch-deans, and prebendaries, vicars-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, chancellors, commiſſaries, officials, regiſters, deputy regiſters, apparitors, proctors, and advocates, who all practiſe as our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty courts do, according to the courſe of the civil law, and will, (if the Engliſh models prevail,) be maintained by a table of fees which by emptying the pockets of the unhappy delinquents, will teach them with a witneſs, to beware of the cenſures of the Church.</p>
               <p>But the ſharpeſt arrow in his Lordſhip's quiver, is the power of excommunication.</p>
               <p>This is a cenſure by which the defaulting party is, for a time, caſt out of the communion of the church. In the primitive age it conſiſted in the deprivation of the uſe of the ſacrament; but as wickedneſs abounded, the puniſhment was contemned, and the <hi>temporal</hi> grandeur of the church made it neceſſary to ſuper-add <hi>temporal</hi> ſanctions.</p>
               <p>At this day excommunications are divided into the leſſer and greater. By the firſt, the offender is deprived of the ſacraments and divine worſhip; and it is denounced for diſobeying the proceſs of the Biſhop's court: But the greater excommunication inhibits a man from the ſociety or converſation of the faithful; and by a conſtitution of Archbiſhop <hi>Stratford,</hi> they who even trade or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with perſons excommunicated, are puniſhable by eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical cenſure. <hi>Lind.</hi> 266.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:010857_0018_0F8524DCC6DD1098"/>
As to its conſequences, according to the courſe of the common law, they are, a diſability to commence any action; and hence the excommunication of the plaintiff is pleadable in abatement to his ſuit; nor can he be a witneſs, advocate or juror, nor diſpoſe of his eſtate by teſtament: It alſo ſuſpends an executorſhip; nor ſhall his remains, according to the rubrick in the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, have the honour of the burial office, and Chriſtian interment. See <hi>Lit ſect.</hi> 201—<hi>Gib.</hi> 1050 <hi>Swin.</hi> 109, 367.— 2 <hi>Haw.</hi> 418. <hi>Godolp. Orphan Law</hi> 37, and the 68th Canon.</p>
               <p>Such being the ſeverity of the ſentence of excommunication, I believe few Americans wiſh to ſee a judicatory erected to give the law on this head, an opportunity of being applied: And the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for an <hi>American Epiſcopate</hi> muſt be an enthuſiaſt in the cauſe, if this is the diſcipline he longs to have exerciſed: For tho' the Doctor admits, that our Clergymen at preſent may, and ought, to refuſe the communion to diſorderly and ſcandalous perſons, he wiſhes for the reſtoration of ſomething more efficacious; but what that is, he has rather left to our conjecture, than clearly explained.</p>

               <p>THE violent clap of thunder wherewith this city had for a week before been daily threatened, was laſt Monday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at about ſix minutes after ten (attended with a great ſnow ſtorm, and ſome rain,) impetuouſly diſcharged from our American Vatican, having been, after great conſultation, agreed to be hurl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the coruſcatious arm of Mr. <hi>Secretary Seabury:</hi> but very fortunately for man, beaſt, and buildings, the bolt wanting an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential quality to do execution, we cannot learn that any creature, rational, animal, or material, hath received the leaſt damage from the exploſion. With reſpect to the <hi>American Whig,</hi> for whom this nitra-ſulphureous fulmination was expreſly fabricated, and at whoſe pericardium it was point-blank levelled, it hath not ſo much as ſinged a ſingle thread of his garments. The reverend ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary begins with ſolemnly affirming, that the <hi>convention have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made any injurious reflections upon the other denominations, by repreſenting them either as ſeditious incendiaries, or as diſaffected to the king and government.</hi> This affirmation happens unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to reſpect a matter of fact which it is impoſſible for him to know: For the convention being no corporation, they do not want any of his inſtrumentality to authenticate their acts. He can therefore only declare this on the <hi>poor, ſimple,</hi> "I am told," which is not worth one farthing more than the <hi>poor, ſimple,</hi> "we are told," of <hi>the American Whig;</hi> with which he is nevertheleſs in ſo violent a taking. After having delivered this part of his
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010857_0018_0F8524DCC6DD1098"/>teſtimony, <hi>which is nothing to the purpoſe,</hi> he proceeds in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing elegant and diſpaſſionate language. <q>I do moreover af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and declare, that this Aſſertion of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> is abſolutely, utterly, and intirely falſe, and groundleſs. And I hereby call upon <hi>him</hi> in this open Manner <hi>both as a member of, and a Secretary to the Convention,</hi> publickly to produce the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon which he has aſſerted ſo infamous a Falſehood. In this Caſe the moſt poſitive Proof is inſiſted on, nor will the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Public be put off with a poor, ſimple, "we are told," which is nothing to the purpoſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Should any Perſon think that I do not treat this Writer with proper Reſpect, let him turn to the laſt Paragraph of the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Whig,</hi> No. I. where Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> and the Convention, (Gentlemen at leaſt as reputable as himſelf) are in Fact accuſed of the groſſeſt Falſehood and Deceit, in pretending to aſk for a Biſhop only upon the Plan propoſed in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> while it is, not the primitive Chriſtian Biſhop they want," but, &amp;c. Such a Piece of Effrontery and Malice, I think, deſerves, and would juſtify worſe Treatment than a Regard to my own Character would ſuffer me to give him.</q> Before I give any direct anſwer to the charge brought againſt me I muſt in my turn complain of an injury little inferior to that about which he makes ſo tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous an outcry. It appears evident, by his ſaying, that <hi>Doctor</hi> Chandler, <hi>and the Convention were gentlemen at leaſt as reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as myſelf,</hi> that he is acquainted with my perſonal character; and yet he has had the aſſurance to aſſert, that I am <hi>both Secretary and a member of the Convention,</hi> which he knows in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, (to uſe his own tautological epithets) to be <hi>abſolutely, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and intirely falſe, and groundleſs.</hi> For <hi>I do affirm and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,</hi> that I never was either the one or the other; and I take it extremely unkind, to be placed pending the law-ſuit between the Convention and the Public, amongſt ſuch <hi>unpopular</hi> company. As to the remainder of this moſt delicate compoſition, I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that our Secretary did not conſider, (and indeed who in ſuch a <hi>fluſtratious</hi> ferment could be capable of any conſideration) that the reſpectable Public, before whom the cauſe is now at iſſue, is intitled to the higheſt proof of which the nature of the thing will admit. They will therefore not be ſatisfied with the bare <hi>verbum ſacerdotis,</hi> while ſuch ſuperior evidence remains in his own poſſeſſion. The proof which they have a right to expect is, that he forthwith publiſh true copies of all the petitions, that were written and ſent on that occaſion, noting what was in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal drafts, and ſtruck out by a few moderate members of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, (for luckily for the colonies a few ſuch there happened to be, or no mortal can tell of what we ſhould not have been accuſed) and that ſuch publications be declared to be true copies, upon
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010857_0019_0F8524E1D8C74300"/>oath. When this is done, the <hi>American Whig</hi> will have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſurpriſing him with a ſecret he little ſuſpects. In the mean time, I would adviſe him to lift up hands <hi>without wrath, as well as without doubting;</hi> though I ſhould not have the leaſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt inſtantly ſuffering the execution of his menaces, did I not flatter myſelf, that my life is of ſome moment to the Public, while I am engaged in exerting my endeavours to avert the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble curſe of an <hi>American Epiſcopate.</hi> This being accompliſhed, the Secretary, or any of his brethren, the diſciples and miniſters of the goſpel of peace, may uſe what violence they pleaſe, and put me to death in their own way and manner; as I ſhould really expect to die with vaſtly greater cheerfulneſs and ſerenity, on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to reflect, that I had, in any degree been inſtrumental in defeating ſo portentous a project. Relative to my ſaying, that I do not believe <hi>Doctor</hi> Chandler <hi>and the Convention want a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Biſhop;</hi> I have hitherto ſeen no reaſon for repentance, but on the contrary, <hi>Know all men by theſe preſents,</hi> that I do hereby <hi>declare and affirm,</hi> that I do not, nor ever ſhall, believe any thing like it; it being <hi>abſolutely, utterly, and intirely</hi> incredible, that they ſhould be ſo exceſſively ignorant, as not to know the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the thing. For that it is altogether impoſſible (<hi>I ſhould ſay abſolutely, utterly, and intirely</hi> impoſſible) I ſhall abundantly ſhew, in ſome ſucceeding numbers of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme mortification, and the full ſatisfaction of the Public; and if this my incredulity is to be termed <hi>effrontery</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> this Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Secretary deſerves to be told, that he has involved forty nine fiftieths of the whole province in the ſame anathematical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Obſerve you have vigorouſly undertaken a controverſy with <hi>Doctor Ch—r.</hi> Now in all controverſie, or diſpute, a good Chriſtian, who is deeply ſenſible that he muſt give an account of every idle word, will ſingly aim at nothing but the truth and right of the caſe: But this, (by the manner of your beginning,) does not ſeem to me, (a By-ſtander,) to be what you aim at, but rather to beget in your readers, all the odium you can againſt the <hi>Doctor,</hi> his cauſe, and his friends. A good cauſe does not need ſuch a method of proceeding. It is certain that the <hi>Doctor</hi> has pleaded his cauſe in a calm, ſerious, and candid manner, and as it becomes a Chriſtian. What the world expects therefore, is, that you ſhould in the ſame manner undertake to anſwer him, and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and attend to nothing, but the real merits of the cauſe.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010857_0019_0F8524E1D8C74300"/>The only queſtion of much importance, relates to the rights of conſcience, and the liberty every man ought to have, to think and act for himſelf, in matters of religion.—It is this, whether the Church hath not a right to enjoy the whole of its own conſtitution, as well as its neighbours? And ſince this is not the fact in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whether we have not an undoubted right, and whether it is not moſt reaſonable, that, at this diſtance, we ſhould be peaceably allowed, (even by a Whig) to enjoy our own Epiſcopal form of government, as well as our neighbours their Preſbyterian form? Every thing foreign to this, is quite beſide the queſtion.—Pray, therefore, Mr. <hi>Whig,</hi> attend only to this point, and let us ſee fair play.</p>
               <p>Whether right or wrong, is not now the queſtion, nor is it to be decided by ridicule, but by ſober reaſon; and I hope Mr. <hi>Whig,</hi> (as it does not become you,) you are not ſo uncharitable as to think, but that we may be as conſcientiouſly perſuaded of our Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal form, as our neighbours of their Preſbyterian. We do ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declare, that we are; nor can you be more conſcientious in your way, than we in ours; tell us, then, why we ought not to enjoy ours, as well as you yours? We ſeriouſly declare, we do not envy you yours; why then, in the name of all that is good, ſhould you be ſo bitterly ſet againſt our enjoying ours? Is not liberty our right as well as your's?</p>
               <p>You affectedly cry out, with dreadful terror, of the danger of Eccleſiaſtical tyranny: But pray Mr. <hi>Whig</hi> be ſober; you <hi>fear, where no fear is;</hi> there is no danger; you can't, (and you know you can't) be more averſe to tyranny, in any ſhape, than we are. And beſides, you know we aſk for no Epiſcopate that can have any concern with you; nor do we deſire any. We only deſire ſuch a happy ſtate for us both, as ſhall iſſue in this, that <hi>Ephraim</hi> may have no temptation <hi>to envy</hi> Judah, nor Judah <hi>to vex</hi> Ephraim.</p>

               <p>WHEN a writer publickly attacks men of good character, with virulence, and endeavours by ſophiſtry, to ſet truths, which are held ſacred by many ſincere Chriſtians, in a diſadvantageous light; it may be proper to inquire into his temper and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the motives which ſet him to work.</p>
               <p>Theſe circumſtances, I confeſs, do not much affect the intrinſic value of any literary compoſition: But if this latter has a pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010857_0020_0F8524E1FAB9DFE0"/>tendency—either to ſow diſſentions, or raiſe prejudices among honeſt men,—to unhinge religion, or unſettle any of its principles: The ſhewing what quarter it comes from, will often go a good way to confute it.</p>
               <p>Thus—if a man of unmeaning phyz, ſhould think proper to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe every animated countenance,—or, if a man of rueful length of face, ſhould take it into his head to declaim againſt round faces, and inſiſt that there is no comelineſs in any but ſuch as have the ſame degree of longitude with his own, reviling all who diſſented in opinion from him—If a libertine ſhould write againſt religion, and try to perſuade people to throw off all concern about it;—if a buſy factor in diſſention, who has long been a hackneyed jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyman in defamation, ſhould begin to ſcatter his poiſon, in order to ſet well-meaning people together by the ears; all who know theſe circumſtances, would immediately be on their guard: A knowledge of them would ſerve as an antidote againſt the miſchief which artful ſophiſtry might otherwiſe produce.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> and his <hi>Appeal to the Public, in behalf of the Church of England in America,</hi> have lately been attacked with great indecency and fury, by the <hi>American Whig.</hi> Now if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that this attack comes from an ambitious, diſappointed fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the members of which are well known to have been always enemies to the Church of England; who have wantonly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to revile it,—to ridicule many of thoſe truths which its members hold ſacred,—and who make religion a political engine to accompliſh their deſigns; The unprejudiced reader, upon knowing this, will treat it with that neglect and contempt it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</p>
               <p>To check the inſolence of this faction, is now become neceſſary for many reaſons. It is high time for the members of the Church of England, whoſe lenity has been much and often abuſed by them, to vindicate themſelves from the falſe aſperſions of theſe enemies to peace; and adminiſter ſome wholeſome diſcipline to the author, or authors of the <hi>American Whig;</hi>—which paper is to be the future vehicle of their malice. No. I. is ſtuffed with low, ſpurious witticiſms, miſrepreſentations, ſcurrility, buffoonery, falſhood, abuſe, and ſlander. But to paſs by all theſe, the author deſerves flagellation for his blunders, with which this piece is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully begrimed. Take the following ſample of theſe, gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the preſent, which I beg you would carefully obſerve. He ſays, the <hi>Appeal</hi> "ſo naturally counterfeits the voice of a ſheep, that it is not every reader who will diſcriminate it from that of a wolf." As much as to ſay,—it ſings ſo like a Nightingale, that you can ſcarce diſtinguiſh its voice from that of a hoarſe croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Raven. Or, a thing is ſo like an egg, that you can ſcarce diſtinguiſh it from an oyſter. This is the mighty man who is to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010857_0020_0F8524E1FAB9DFE0"/>adjuſt with preciſion the limits of religious Liberty, and defend it from all encroachment! And great things, no doubt, are to be expected from him.</p>
               <p>What were the motives of the preſent attack on the <hi>Appeal?</hi> Not any thing demanded in the <hi>Appeal</hi> itſelf, nor the manner in which it is executed. It is written with great moderation, and aſks nothing but what every denomination of Chriſtians has a right to, and actually enjoys in America, the Church of England only excepted;—namely, the liberty of having the inſtitutions of our Church, with its forms of diſcipline and government, to which a Biſhop, or Biſhops, are eſſentially neceſſary. Yet ſtill with this reſtriction,— <q>That the Biſhops to be ſent to America, ſhall have no authority, put purely of a ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical nature, ſuch as is derived altogether from the Church, and not from the ſtate. That his authority ſhall operate only upon the Clergy of the Church, and not upon the Laity, or Diſſenters of any Denomination. That the Biſhops ſhall not interfere with the property or privileges, whether civil or religious, of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Diſſenters. That, in particular, they ſhall have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with the probate of wills, letters of guardianſhip, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, or marriage licences, nor be judges of any caſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereto. But that they ſhall only exerciſe the original powers of their office, namely, <hi>ordain</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> the Clergy, and adminiſter <hi>Confirmation</hi> to thoſe who ſhall deſire it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Appeal to the public, p. <hi>79.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </q> This is the whole of what is deſired by the <hi>Appeal;</hi> nor does the warmeſt advocates for American Biſhops even wiſh for more.</p>
               <p>The <hi>American Whig</hi> himſelf, acknowledges that the Appeal "aſks nothing but what is highly reaſonable." And the ſuppoſed author of this Numb. with others of his fraternity have frequently owned it was juſt and reaſonable, that the Church of England, in America, ſhould have Biſhops on theſe terms; nor does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that there was any intention, until very lately, of writing againſt it in this place.</p>
               <p>What could occaſion this change of ſentiment,—this ſudden attack on the Appeal? All theſe doleful apprehenſions, as if it were replete with utter ruin to the colonies? Thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſome late tranſactions in this city, can eaſily anſwer theſe queſtions. Men who are ſolely guided by ambition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, are never ſteady in their conduct. While you gratify theſe, they will be quiet, — but no longer. Thwart them in the leaſt, and they are like ſo many bears robbed of their whelps. They will indiſcriminately wreak their vengeance on all that come in their way. To gratify it—</p>

This motto was choſe ſome years ago for a periodical paper in this city, by a writer who was no ſtranger, I dare ſay, to our <hi>Whig;</hi> but as he did not deign to give a tranſlation of it, I will beg leave to do it for him here—
<q>
                     <l>If hap'ly ſhould the pow'rs above,</l>
                     <l>Reject the vow that's paid them;</l>

                  </q>
I wiſh them joy of their company.</p>
               <p>The Appeal had been read and conſidered long enough after its publication. If not approved, why was it not then objected to? The reaſon was, no ambitious attempts were then oppoſed,—no towering expectations were blaſted. Matters went on ſmoothly; and had they gone on in the ſame manner ſince, the Appeal might have remained in peace, without any moleſtation from this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, notwithſtanding its <hi>tremendous</hi> conſequences.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Whig</hi> pragmatically aſſumes to be defender-general of the <q>religious Privileges of all Denominations of proteſtants, againſt the ſecret or open attempts of their enemies.</q> He muſt be a cunning fellow indeed to <hi>know</hi> and counteract thoſe attempts which are <hi>ſecret.</hi> But to let this paſs. Who aſſigned him this poſt? Or, who are theſe enemies? If by theſe he means the <hi>author</hi> of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> and his friends, why was not this made appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? If he had ſuch a regard, as he pretends, for the religious Liberties of others,—if the <hi>Appeal</hi> had any tendency to infringe thoſe: Surely this magnanimous Champion would not have ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered and ſlept ſo long! The truth is as I have mentioned. The ſpirit of ambition and ſelf intereſt, had not met with any ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ck 'till very lately. But now that their blooming hopes are withered, the faction is enraged to a degree of phrenzy; and the poor Church, thro' the Appeal, muſt fall the devoted victim of their vengeance.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is more than probable that the ſame motives ſet ſome Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia engineers to work, in writing a paper called the <hi>Centinel:</hi> for in No. I. the tranſactions alluded to above, are mentioned. No other tolerable reaſon can be aſſigned for their engaging in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy now, and not before. The alarm, I ſuppoſe was given from hence; and how widely ſoever the authors of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> and <hi>Centinel,</hi> may diſagree in other reſpects: Yet we ſee they can unite in abuſing the Appeal. No. I. of the <hi>Centinel,</hi> has ſomewhat more of the appearance of reaſoning than the <hi>Whig;</hi> but breaths the ſame rancorous, inſolent ſpirit; and plentifully abounds in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation, impertinence, nonſenſe, &amp;c. &amp;c. As the Church of England has ſeveral able advocates in Pennſylvania, I doubt not but ſome of them will take the Centinel to taſk, and give him proper caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation.

Some pretence however was neceſſary to ſtorm the <hi>Appeal;</hi> and one was found of an extraordinary kind,—ſuch perhaps as would be the laſt thought on by a perſon who poſſeſſed the moſt moderate portion of honeſty and charity. And what was it? Why this— <q>It is not a primitive, Chriſtian Biſhop, that the Dr. and the Convention want. It is a modern, ſplendid, opulent, Court-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, law-dignified, ſuperb, magnificent, powerful prelate, on which their heart is ſo intent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now to paſs over the defects of this laſt wonderful period, in point of propriety and ſtyle,—the whole of it I aver to be utterly falſe. There is not a ſyllable of truth in it. And here I publickly call on this Gentleman to make good his aſſertion,—to produce ſome ſort of ſatisfactory evidence, beſides his own bare word, which on this occaſion will not go far, that the Dr. and Convention de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſuch a Biſhop. Until he gives ſome proof of this, he does nothing at all. He fights with a phantom his own imagination has raiſed. Like his illuſtrious predeceſſor, Don Quixote, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters wind-mills inſtead of giants. He might as well write againſt introducing the Pope of Rome, or Mufti of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and it would be as much to the purpoſe: As writing againſt the introduction of ſuch a Biſhop into America, as no one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the CHURCH, either deſires, or wiſhes for. I repeat it again, that until the author of the American Whig produces ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic proof or teſtimonies, that the Clergy want ſuch a Biſhop as he has ſpecified,—that they want <q>to involve America in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical bondage,</q> introduce "ſpiritual courts," &amp;c. as he inſinuates: He ſtands convicted by his own declaration, when he ſays, <q>the Appeal aſks nothing but what is highly reaſonable,— and it were manifeſt injuſtice to deny church-men, what in their opinion, their eternal ſalvation ſo greatly depends on.</q> But if he cannot produce any ſuch authentic proof or teſtimony, which I am fully aſſured he cannot do, the world muſt neceſſarily look on him as an invidious calumniator, a <hi>falſe accuſer</hi> of the brethren; and certainly he knows very well what an ancient, powerful coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor he has in this.</p>
               <p>This writer diſclaims the ſetters of order and ſyſtem in his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture productions; and were I to ſuppoſe the reaſon of his doing ſo, is becauſe his principles are oppoſite to all order, it would be ſhewing him full as much, if not more, charity, than he has ſhewed to Dr. Chandler and the Convention. Doubtleſs the <hi>Whig,</hi> like his brother-ſavages, will chooſe to carry on an irregular war. I may not chooſe to follow him in all his twiſtings and windings. However, I ſhall give him ſuch chaſtiſement, now and then, as he deſerves. I ſhall develope his ſophiſtry, I mean ſuch as I think worthy of notice, and reſcue truth from his falacies and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I may ſometimes carry the war into the enemy's country,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010857_0022_0F8524E4AF3795E0"/>and make repriſals; or, digreſs to other ſubjects, as I think will be entertaining to my readers. I may not only ſtrip the wolf of his ſheep's clothing; but alſo diveſt the aſs of his lion's ſkin, and then his braying will have no other effect, than perhaps to frighten women and children.</p>

            <p>HAVING opened the general tendency of Dr. chandler's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, &amp;c. I ſhall now proceed to make ſome remarks on the inconveniencies and miſchiefs of religious eſtabliſhments.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, as hath been ſhewn, endeavours to engage "our ſuperiors in England," "the guardians of the national intereſts" on his ſide, by endeavouring to make them believe, that without an <hi>epiſcopal eſtabliſhment</hi> here, they muſt not expect due obedience from the colonies; nay that the ſtate is not ſafe. It hath, at all times, been the policy of ambitious eccleſiaſticks to perſuade the civil magiſtrate, that neceſſity of ſtate, and even his particular intereſt required him to interfere in their behalf, and inveſt them with dignity and power; and then he ought to oblige all perſons to Church conformity, and to enforce obedience by civil diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and penalties, though ſuch a conduct is obviouſly an invaſion
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010857_0022_0F8524E4AF3795E0"/>of the rights of mankind, and tends to diſturb the public peace, which can only be effectually reſtored, by removing the iniquitous reſtraint, which introduced the miſchief.<note n="*" place="bottom">Equality among ſubjects is the great ſource of concord." <hi>HUME.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Lord was the only lawgiver in his Church. He expreſly commands his followers to <hi>"call no man father upon earth,"</hi> and adds <hi>"neither be ye called maſter, for one is your maſter, even Chriſt;"</hi> Math. xxiii. 9.10. words which obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly mean to exclude all religous obedience, or claims to dictate to conſcience on the footing of human authority; yet how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly have Church governors, under all eſtabliſhments, aſſumed the place of God, and demanded a ſubmiſſion, as ſinful, as the exerciſe of the power was unjuſt and impious. Indeed the Church of Rome, by ſetting up a pretended <hi>infallibility</hi> have a more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tho' falſe pretence to contend for uniformity.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, whoever peruſes eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, ever ſince the time of Conſtantine, will find it contains little elſe than the follies, abſurdities, frauds, rapine, pride, domination, rage, and cruelty of ſpiritual tyrants; who practiſed every artifice to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade, or cajole the temporal rulers to ſupport their meaſures. They told them, that as the King's of Iſrael were bound, under that very ſingular kind of government, a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, to preſerve purity in religion, ſo were Chriſtian Princes obliged on pain of damnation, to root out error; even by racks and tortures, ſword and fire. How ill this horrid doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the followers of the meek and holy Jeſus, who refuſed with indignation to call for divine judgments on the ſchiſmatical Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, needs not at this day to be explained. Now the ſame ſpirit, which not content with the many thouſands already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed for the eſtabliſhment of a Biſhop, calls for aid from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quarter, even for a tax on all other denominations, in provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the epiſcopalians are not a fortieth, perhaps not a fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of the community; the ſame ſpirit, which repreſents the body of the people as diaffected to government and dangerous to the ſtate, and would diſable them from holding civil offices; the ſame ſpirit that unchurches all their Chriſtian neighbours, merely for the want of a particular form of Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no ways eſſential to Chriſtianity; and becauſe they make no pretenſions to a certain whimſical <hi>uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> of Biſhops from the Apoſtles, which counteracts the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the reformation, and can ſerve only to ſanctify the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of their order; this ſpirit would beyond all doubt, carry the abuſe of eccleſiaſtical domination, as high as ever <hi>Laud</hi> and his brethren did, or as far as Doctor <hi>Sacheverell</hi> contended for, if the civil magiſtrate could but be deluded once more to lend his aid. Indeed as a great writer ſpeaks "it requires an uncommon
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010857_0023_0F8524E5B21336C0"/>degree of grace and virtue in the clergy, not to abuſe ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a power."</p>
            <p>Thanks be to our wiſer ſtateſmen, of late <hi>ſpiritual power</hi> has been kept within bounds, and Diſſenters in England have been ſuffered to worſhip God peaceably according to their conſciences; and many of the Clergy of the eſtabliſhment, with a truly Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian temper, have written and preached in favour of toleration. It is evident however, that to maintain the toleration, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the rights of conſcience, the government has been careful to promote in the Church, men of moderation only, and at the ſame time, has thought it expedient to prevent the convocation from meeting to do buſineſs for fifty years paſt. They fear there is ſtill enough of the old leaven left, to work up abundance of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, whenever times ſhall permit; and on this account dare not hazard the leaſt alteration in any thing eſtabliſhed, either as to doctrine, diſcipline, worſhip or ceremony, however neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Although the body of the eſtabliſhed clergy have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of departing from the ancient doctrines, as ſet forth in the <hi>thirty-nine articles,</hi> yet they are tenacious of the words of their ſervice book, and of every rite, mode and ceremony to the laſt degree. They would diſturb the public peace, and ſet the populace, in an uproar with the old cry, <hi>The Church is in danger,</hi> if an Jota in outward form ſhould be taken away. Rather than ſuffer eccleſiaſtical authority to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and regulated on a ſcriptural footing, they chooſe to let matters, however repugnant to Chriſtianity, continue in their preſent ſtate; and are deaf to the loud complaints which many good men among themſelves, make of the neceſſity of ſome alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. They may write <hi>Candid diſquiſitions,</hi> &amp;c. and ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably wherein great amendments and improvements ought to be made in the worſhip of their Church, till they are tired; but the people educated in a narrow attachment to forms, and from their infancy, taught to look on every part of their own, as eſſential to the true worſhip of God, are eaſily led to ſhut their ears againſt every propoſal of alteration, and to revile the authors as betrayers of religion: An incurable evil this, ariſing partly from the uſe of forms, but eſpecially from the rigid manner in which governors in Church and ſtate, almoſt ever ſince the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, have preſſed uniformity.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood to aſſert that the principles of the epiſcopal Churches tend more particularly to theſe abuſes, than thoſe of others; but it is the fault of human nature, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear great power with equanimity, and perhaps is moſt apt to abuſe it in religious matters. The high rank and large revenues of the Biſhops in England muſt tempt them, however into this error, more eaſily, than the leaders in Churches whoſe influence depends on perſonal qualifications only.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:010857_0023_0F8524E5B21336C0"/>
The Doctor ſtrongly hints the need of an eſtabliſhment in the colonies for the purpoſes of diſcipline, his words are <q>Churches are ſet up againſt Churches, and thoſe who are rejected by one are received by another.</q> (31) This complaint comes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unexpectedly from a miſſionary of the ſociety: The Doctor would do well to explain which Church among us, is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for undermining the diſcipline of the reſt by receiving, with open arms, their outcaſts or deſerters; how many of theſe are among the miſſionaries, I leave the Doctor to tell? On this ſubject I would likewiſe aſk him, how the primitive Churches managed? They had no coercive aid from without, nor did they ſtand in the leaſt need of any; yet their diſcipline was rather ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; for if a Church member had not eſteemed it his honour and felicity (next to pleaſing God) to ſtand well with his fellow-Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, his preſence in their aſſemblies would have given them no ſatisfaction. Far from ſeeking to enlarge their ſociety by court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rich and great, or attracting the herd of nominal profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors into memberſhip, by winking at their irregularities and vices, they chaſed out of the Church all back ſliders and ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons without reſerve. At the ſame time the terms of communion were as large as the great head of the church had left them; unembarraſſed with the trifling niceties of modern uniformity; which by fixing men's zeal on modes and ceremonies, habits and geſtures, has diverted them from the weightier matters of the law, whilſt forbearance, charity, and other Chriſtian virtues have been neglected and forgotten.</p>
            <p>Religious eſtabliſhments are very hardly kept from great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; but if the proviſion made for the Clergy be large, and the leaders are enabled to live in grandeur, it is not likely they ſhould long continue pure. Ambitious worldly-minded men, who ſeek the fleece, not the well-being of the flock, will inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves into the chief offices; their example and influence will miſlead or diſcourage others, who in better company might have been uſefully employed; the induſtry and vigilance of the ſpiritual guides in the proper buſineſs of their function will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed; and that ſkill in their profeſſion which practice, ſtudy, and attention alone can give, will not be attained. Secure in their ſalaries, they may look on it as ſuperfluous to be further active, than juſt to keep up ſome decent appearance of duty. Thus preacher and people will indolently go to ſleep, and forget the important meſſages and warnings of heaven, which from the intervention of earthly and preſent objects, are but too apt to eſcape our attention, under the moſt diligent adminiſtration of God's word.

            <p>But ſtill worſe than this: There is no probability of religion's being reformed under theſe eccleſiaſtical polities. Nothing leſs than a ſtate convulſion effected the reformation, in moſt of the countries where it took place. Generally the body of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Clergy, inſtead of promoting, violently oppoſed it, by the help of thoſe very emoluments and advantages which had been granted for the ſupport of religion; and in ſome kingdoms they ſucceeded: And even ſince that glorious period, have we not ſeen the like difficulties ſtand in the way on every occaſion? Biſhop Burnet very pleaſant ſays, in ſome of his writings, "we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our Church liable to <hi>err</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> but when you come to <hi>particulars</hi> we are <hi>always</hi> in the <hi>right.</hi>" Under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of keeping out dangerous innovations and errors, no miſtakes or corruptions, however hurtful or diſgraceful, are allowed to be corrected. <q>One might as well ſay Churches and Chapels need no repair, tho' caſtles and houſes do; whereas commonly to ſpeak the truth, dilapidations of the inward and ſpiritual edifices of the Church, are in all times as great as the outward and material.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </q> But above all, the moſt dreadful evil is the danger of perſecution; which worldly minded men to gratify their own pride and luſt of power, are forward on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per occaſions to practiſe; and which weak men with better inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are too apt to be led into. We too readily think ourſelves ſecure from error, if we have the wiſe, the powerful, and the many, in our opinions. Thoſe who differ from us we conclude muſt be obſtinate and perverſe; and are without much difficulty brought to look on it, as an act of charity as well as duty, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter ſome wholeſome reſtraints and ſeverities to ſuch manifeſt heretics. Thus is the pride of ſuppoſed right opinion nouriſhed under eſtabliſhments, till from one ſtep to another in the practice of hardſhips on diſſenters, we eaſily proceed to inquiſitions, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and death. For if penalties can be juſtified in religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, perhaps the moſt violent may be the moſt merciful, as well as effectual.

            <head type="sub">To the PRINTER,</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was pleaſed to ſee by your Advertiſement in laſt Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's New-York Journal, that you intend to republiſh in your Paper, the Pieces ſign'd <hi>An American Whig,</hi> together with the Anſwers, and the beſt Pieces that come out in the other Papers upon the Subject of that Controverſy, on both Sides of the Queſtion. The Exhibition of the Arguments on both Sides in the ſame Paper, is certainly the moſt likely Means to enable the Reader to form a juſt and equitable Judgment;—and if we muſt needs be forced into this religious Controverſy, your Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal bids the faireſt for deciding it according to Truth and Juſtice. But at the ſame Time, as a hearty Friend to the Britiſh Colonies, I cannot but expreſs my Concern, that this Controverſy ſhould have been begun at ſuch a Time as this,—when the united Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010857_0025_0F8524E7200CFC90"/>of all the Colonies are ſo neceſſary for the preſervation of their Conſtitutional Rights and Liberties.</p>
            <p>The Introduction of ſuch a Diſpute at this Time, I conceive to be in many Reſpects extremely injudicious,—as it will tend to take off the public Attention from the <hi>Main Chance,</hi> to diſunite, and ſet us to quarreling among our ſelves, and give our Enemies an Advantage over us: Beſide the Time is quite improper for the Diſcuſſion of the Subject;—When our Minds are in a State of anxious Concern,—whether we are henceforth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ourſelves as having any other Relation to Great-Britain but as being her Slaves,—whether we have any <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Lot</hi> in her beloved Conſtitution and the Rights of Nature—which have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been our Boaſt and our Glory;—whether we are a Nation of generous Freemen, or of abject deſpicable Slaves?—In ſuch a State of dread Suſpence, can our Minds be in a proper Frame for determining the ſubtil Diſputes between Arminians and Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, Church Men and Preſbyterians? Theſe Matters have of themſelves been often found ſufficient to ſet whole Kingdoms in a Flame, and ſhall we <hi>needleſsly</hi> kindle the Fire of Contention among ourſelves, when our deareſt Intereſts are in Danger, from falſe Friends within, and open Enemies without?</p>
            <p>Can we think the Deſigns of this Author of Diſſention, this Sower of Diſcord among us, are friendly to the Engliſh Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Government, or the Rights of theſe Colonies? When <hi>theſe</hi> were in the moſt imminent Danger of being overturned and torne from us by the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> did this Author, or his Party ſtir a Finger to prevent it? Or have they done any Thing ſince, in Favour of the Engliſh <hi>Conſtitution</hi> and <hi>American Rights,</hi> tho' theſe have been repeatedly attack'd, by the Acts, <hi>for Billeting Soldiers,</hi>—for <hi>impoſing Duties,</hi> &amp;c? On the Contrary, has not this Attempt of the <hi>American Whig</hi> to diſunite us, a manifeſt Tendency to bring upon us all the Evils that threaten us, and reduce us to a State of general Confuſion? And is it not, from a careful Review of every Circumſtance, at leaſt highly probable, that he and his Party would rejoice in a Diſunion between Great-Britain and her Colonies, and would be among the firſt to change a <hi>Monarchical</hi> for a <hi>Republican</hi> Government? Which may Heaven avert!</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THE ſeeming candour with which thou haſt thought proper to uſher thy performance into the world, induced me to give it a ſerious reading, in hopes therein to find ſomewhat tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to edification. But how great was my miſtake when, on pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing the firſt ſection, I ſound thee warmly reviving the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy concerning <hi>uninterrupted ſucceſſion,</hi> and torturing thy invention to produce arguments in ſupport of an opinion which the wiſeſt people of thine own order have long given up as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable.</p>
               <p>This queer part in thy creed, however, I was willing to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the prejudices of thy education, and the cloſe trammels in which thy conformity to Church diſcipline obliged thee to move. Accordingly I continued to read on—but greater ſtill was my concern on hearing thee aſſert roundly that the offices of <hi>ordination</hi> and <hi>confirmation</hi> were ſolely veſted in Biſhops, hereby deriving an argument in favour of an <hi>American</hi> epiſcopate.</p>
               <p>Here I pauſed, and reflected on the good character which thou haſt obtained with the world.—I knew it had been ſaid that thou wert expert in all things touching the Church, which compelled me to believe mine own information was very imperfect, being ſo widely different from thine.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt probably conclude from my mode of expreſſion that I am of the ſociety called <hi>Quakers</hi>—If ſo, thou art greatly miſtaken—For, tho' I agree with thoſe good people in ſome things, wherein they approach the ſimplicity of the primitive times, yet it is in thoſe and thoſe only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>confirmation</hi> are with me indiſpenſable rites, and however overlooked by the ſuperficial, bear the ſeals of the Goſpel. Yet am I conſtrained to differ from thee in thy partial repreſentation of theſe things. Surely thou haſt forgot thy Bible, elſe haſt thou wilfully prevaricated. For thus ſpeaks St. <hi>Paul</hi> to Biſhop <hi>Timothy</hi>—"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the <hi>Preſbytery.</hi> 1ſt Epiſt. to <hi>Tim.</hi> chap. iv. ver. 14.</p>
               <p>And firſt as to <hi>ordination,</hi> if we look into an impartial account
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:010857_0026_0F8524F04FA2CEC0"/>given of the next centuries after CHRIST, by chancellor <hi>King,</hi> we ſhall be convinced from many quotations which he produces, that a Preſbyter could perform all the Duties of a Biſhop. Let us take the following, which he gives us from St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> In his epiſtle to his own Clergy, he exhorts them, "to diſcharge their own and his office too, that ſo nothing might be wanting either to diſcipline or diligence."—Now doſt thou think, <hi>Doctor,</hi> that the Biſhop, who muſt be ſuppoſed to know his own conſequence. would have made ſo free with his office, as to commit the care of it to men who, (if it had been ſo) he muſt have been appriſed, could not poſſibly diſcharge it. No, no <hi>Doctor,</hi> the ſuppoſition is in itſelf abſurd, and that Preſbyters could and did ordain, we are aſſured from the uſage of the ſynods of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ordained their own Biſhops.</p>
               <p>I believe it is a point ſettled on all hands, that the ceremony of <hi>confirmation</hi> in early times, was performed immediately after Baptiſm, and as it is well known that Preſbyters did <hi>Baptize,</hi> ſo it may reaſonably be inferred that they <hi>confirmed</hi> likewiſe. To ſave thee the trouble of turning to the book, in which employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou will probably be duſt thy fingers (it being a huge folio) I will tranſcribe a paſſage from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in proof of my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, juſt as I find it quoted in <hi>Peter King</hi>'s volume. <q>As ſoon as we come out of the baptiſmal laver, (ſays <hi>Tertullian.</hi>) we are anointed, and then are we confirmed.</q> But now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, ſays that arch wag who ſtyles himſelf a diſſenting gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) as if there were ſome ſuperior ſacredneſs in the Biſhop's than in the prieſt's hands, this act is, <hi>by the authority of the Church,</hi> confined to the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abſolution</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> have often been proved to be one and the ſame ceremony. The intention of both was the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Holy Ghoſt, and as Preſbyters were gifted with the powers of <hi>abſolution,</hi> it ſeems inconſiſtent to deny them the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of beſtowing the grace of GOD at one time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               <p>I Hate controverſy,—eſpecially when I muſt enter the liſts with an unfair, abuſive adverſary one who pays not the leaſt attention to truth or decency.—who deals out ſlander and invective, as liberally as the famous diſputants of Billingſgate, and much in the ſame ſtyle. Theſe are ſome of the <hi>amiable</hi> characteriſticks which eminently diſtinguiſh the <hi>Faction</hi> now concerned in the <hi>American Whig.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing therefore but a regard to injured truth, could engage me in this controverſy. When that <hi>Church,</hi> which is the glory and bulwark of the reformation, is ſo inſolently traduced,— and traduced by thoſe whom it tolerates and protects,—when its rights are attacked, and its members audaciouſly inſulted: To be ſilent would be criminal. It is the duty of every honeſt man to ſtrip deſigning hypocriſy of its maſk, and point out thoſe who in reality are forging chains for their fellow-ſubjects. And as I am thus dragged into this conteſt, whatever bad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may attend it, will be chargeable on thoſe, and thoſe only, who began it; and will not ſuffer other to live in peace.</p>
               <p>Perhaps my readers may think that I have taken ſufficient notice of No. I. of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> already,—that a thing ſo frothy, ſo malicious, and deſtitute of argument, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:010857_0027_0F8524F1FAAEA4E0"/>not any further animadverſion. I confeſs this to be true in a great meaſure; and no perſon can be influenced by that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per either againſt the <hi>appeal,</hi> or the cauſe in defence of which it was written, unleſs he gives up the exerciſe of his judgment, (if he has any) and becomes a mere dupe to prejudice and party.</p>
               <p>However a fool muſt ſometimes be anſwered according to his folly, leſt he ſhould be wiſe in his own conceit, and lead others into the ſame predicament with himſelf. No doubt the author of this piece is the very hero of the cauſe,—the chief engineer, —the <hi>conductor-generalis</hi> of the intended operations againſt the <hi>appeal,</hi> the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> Accordingly he ſteps forth the moſt forward of the faction, and like him in the Goſpel, he gives them their name, and like him alſo he might ſay, <hi>we are many.</hi> It will not be improper therefore to examine a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the merits of this production, by which we may form an eſtimate of the author's deſigns, as well as of the cauſe in which he is embarked.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall not again repeat his egregious Blunder men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in my laſt; of which that waggiſh companion, and very good friend of mine, <hi>Jack Punlove,</hi> ſaid—<q>It was a Bull, begot by a Bear, on a Sheep and a Wolf.</q> Depend upon it, courteous reader, I ſhall not be ſo prolix in my exercitations on any of his future productions, unleſs he ſhould throw ſome Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or matter in my way that will be worthy of it. As for the two next, low, creeping Whigs,—without life, or ſpirit, or truth, or argument in them: A laſh at the cart's tail will be enough for them. Nay, half a dozen ſuch may be diſpatched in one anſwer; juſt as a careful cook would truſs up two or three brace of <hi>Snipes</hi> on one and the ſame ſpit. Proceed we then to our firſt <hi>Whig.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He inſinuates— <q>that encroachments have been lately made on our civil liberties; and that we can ſcarce obtain redreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one injurious project, but another is forming againſt us.</q> If this be the caſe, why does he not exert himſelf in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his country? What has <hi>he,</hi> or any one member of the faction, written, or otherwiſe done, to avert theſe impending miſchiefs?—Nothing at all. He either throws out this inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and yet believes it to be falſe; or elſe he remains an idle, inactive ſpectator of our danger. Inſtead of promoting that union among ourſelves which he ſays is "peculiarly neceſſary" at this time: He is doing all he can to divide and diſtract us,— to fill <hi>thoſe</hi> with groundleſs prejudices, with mutual hatred againſt each other, who ſhould unite to carry on any ſalutary ſcheme for the public welfare; and I believe would willingly do ſo, were it not for ſuch reſtleſs incendiaries as himſelf.</p>
               <p>Several Gentlemen in <hi>America,</hi> when they apprehended the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010857_0028_0F8524F2732644D0"/>liberties of their country were injured, engaged with a generous and noble ſpirit in the vindication of them. The author of the <hi>Conſiderations on the propriety of impoſing taxes in the Britiſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> the <hi>Pennſylvania Farmer,</hi> and others I could mention, are ſtriking inſtances of this. Theſe worthy patriots, diſintereſted in their views, and regardleſs of the dirty, ſelfiſh deſign of any particular party, inliſted in the cauſe of freedom, and acquitted themſelves with honour. Their aim was to unite their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and animate them with the ſpirit of liberty; yet ſo as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with affection to the mother country, and ſhew how much the intereſt of both depends on their harmony, and mutual adherence to the principles of our conſtitution. This was acting the part of real patriots; for which the worthy authors are juſtly entitled to the hearty thanks of every friend to <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How different the conduct of our <hi>American Whig!</hi> How per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a contract to theſe in every reſpect does he exhibit! Inflamed with party rage, actuated by low, ſelfiſh motives, and goaded on by malice: He pours out a torrent of ſlander againſt a number of innocent, inoffenſive, uſeful men, who are warm friends to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and enemies to ſlavery-of every kind; and thro' them ſtrikes at the <hi>Church</hi> for the blow is levelled at the <hi>Church</hi> in general, (as I ſhall fully evince in the courſe of theſe ſpeculations,) and tends to promote univerſal diſcord throughout the continent.</p>
               <p>And what was the mighty crime of which the members of the <hi>Church</hi> were guilty, to draw down his heavy diſpleaſure on them? Why truly they had the preſumption to apply for an indulgence which every denomination in <hi>America</hi> enjoys,—an indulgence which they neither intend ſhould interfere, nor poſſibly can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the rights or liberties, civil or religious, of any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans whatever; and have appealed to the world, in the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, decent manner, for the reaſonableneſs and equity of their claim. This is the ſum total of their offence.</p>
               <p>This poor gentleman, however, is pleaſed to be in a violent rage,—ſo violent that if his nerves are weak, it may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with fatal conſequences. This exceſs of paſſion, I muſt charitably think, is what betrays him into the abſurdities and contradictions which are to be found in every part of his piece. The Chriſtian reader, I am perſuaded, has more humanity than to expect I would be at the drudgery of enumerating and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverting on all theſe. I will juſt point out a few of them, which indeed are not a third of what it contains. He tells us in one place, that the appeal is a trifling, <q>flimſy piece, and the futility of its reaſoning</q> ſuch as can <q>only impoſe on the weak and credulous:</q> But in another place he ſays it is <q>artfully calculated to introduce the moſt fatal, tremendous
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010857_0028_0F8524F2732644D0"/>miſchiefs.</q> Now Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> "breaths a zeal for religion:" Then, he is a moſt ambitious eccleſiaſtic,—indifferent about <q>the intereſts of his country,—ſowing the ſeeds of univerſal diſcord,</q>—&amp;c. One while <q>the <hi>appeal</hi> aſks nothing but what is highly reaſonable, and it were manifeſt injuſtice to ſo greatly depends on:</q> Again, it has <q>a tendency to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an evil more terrible—than the obnoxious Stamp-Act.</q> Here <q>the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America</hi> is an epiſcopal Church;</q> There, <q>it is not the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor epiſcopal, but an independent Church,</q> With many other flowers and conceits of the ſame kind,—equally ingenious, curious, juſt and entertaining to the reader.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Whig</hi> ſays that Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> has exhibitted <q>a new ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Logic, by infering that if his appeal remained unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, all the world muſt be preſumed to acquieſce in his propoſal.</q> Now if the Dr. had ſaid ſo, it would be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Inference, conſidering the complexion of his preſent antagoniſt, and of many others of the ſame ſtamp around him. Why <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was introduced on the occaſion, no mortal can tell; his caſe having no reſemblance to that of the Dr. and therefore quite impertinent.</p>
               <p>To be even with Dr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> the <hi>Whig</hi> has enriched our rhetoric with ſeveral ſamples of new and rare wit. Take one inſtance in what follows. The <hi>appeal</hi> he ſays, <q>congratulates poſterity, if not on the hopes of reſcuing them from purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, at leaſt on the proſpect of ſpeedily introducing a kind of millennial ſtate by the <hi>epiſcopal tripple</hi> diſcharge of ordination, confirmation and government.</q> I dare ſay there is abundance of wit here, if any perſon living could be ſagacious enough to find out whereabouts it lies. This unuſual turn in thought and expreſſion, which is entirely out of the way of common ſenſe, and makes people ſtare and wonder what he would be at, is what diſtinguiſhes a <hi>great</hi> genius, and advances him to a chief ſeat among your <hi>profound</hi> authors. And this writer deals ſo much in tropes and figures, in the application of which he is peculiarly happy, that he may vie with the famous <hi>Hudibras</hi> himſelf, of whom it is recorded—</p>
               <q>
                  <l>For Rhetoric, he could not ope</l>
                  <l>His Mouth, but out there flew a Trope.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And here I join the <hi>appeal</hi> in felicitating poſterity on the many Improvements in genuine wit, without any allay of dulneſs, —in candid, fair reaſoning, without any mixture of ſophiſtry, or prevarication, they are likely to reap from this gentleman's labours. From ſuch ominious beginnings, what may we not expect!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:010857_0029_0F8524F31F944638"/>
Upon the whole—our <hi>Whig,</hi> from his firſt performance, appears to be better calculated for acting the part of a ludicrous buffoon, than a cool reaſoner—to injure a good cauſe, if he had one, than ſerve it,—kindle, than extinguiſh the flames of diſcord, —to obſcure, than elucidate truth. As the ſtrength of his cauſe lies in miſrepreſentation, and its ſucceſs depends on that miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation going undetected: So his chief talent ſeems to be the art of throwing a miſt before his reader's eyes, by <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> ſophiſtry, larded well with buffoonery. And thus the cauſe and its advocate are worthy of each other. Whilſt he, and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the faction, have the word, <hi>moderation,</hi> in their mouth, they act the part of furious perſecutors. They betray their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerant principles, and deſire to enſlave others, amidſt clamorous outcrys for liberty. As the luſt of power is one of their predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant paſſions, and the way to gratify it and others, is to kick up a duſt, and be at the head of a party: So this is the great ſpring that puts the whole machine in motion, and lends a clew to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel their conduct; for I believe it is not very clear that any of them, eſpecially our firſt <hi>Whig,</hi> either knows or cares much about religion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church</hi> ſtands in no need of ſordid, low arts and ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges to ſupport her. She appeals to the world for the juſtneſs and reaſonableneſs of her claim for Biſhops in America, on the propoſed plan. Her members deſire nothing more than to have the matter fairly and impartially examined.</p>
               <p>This ſame faction have long ſince tried their utmoſt efforts to injure the <hi>Church.</hi> They have ſcribbled, and ſlandered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, &amp;c.—they have ſnivelled, and ſnorted, and roared, and raved, and ſpit their venom, &amp;c. like lord <hi>Peter</hi>'s bulls: But it was <hi>all mighty</hi> harmleſs. The <hi>Church</hi> flouriſhed under their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, as I doubt not but it will at this time.</p>

               <p>NEVER had a nation ſuch a proſpect as Britain of erecting a vaſt and durable empire: Conſider the origin of the Perſians and Medes, Babylonians and Egyptians, Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians and Romans; hemmed in on every ſide, and acceſſible to their neighbours, they could add nothing to their extent, but at the expence of a war. Every expanſion depended upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; ſituated as they were, the enlargement of the empire, was itſelf the cauſe of its fall: When the energy of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could puſh its force no farther, a mortifying reflux enſued, and the victors in their turn were repelled and overwhelmed by hoſts from diſtant countries, which their arms were unable to reach. How inexpreſſibly ſuperior the advantages of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with the help of her American dominions! For territory, we need not quarrel with any power upon earth. This indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible ſubſtratum of empire we are already poſſeſſed of; we have a country amply ſufficient for hundreds of millions, and can ſpread out an inheritance from ocean to ocean, at a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate expence of money, and without the guilty effuſion of human blood.</p>
               <p>The benefits we enjoy from our ſituation, our climates, and the fecundity of the ſoil, are numberleſs, and not to be recounted. No quarter of the globe can boaſt a preheminence: No nation in ſome reſpects pretend to an equality: On one ſide acceſſible to the ocean for all the purpoſes of commerce, on neither expoſed to any dangerous vicinity, and from all foreign force that can eſſentially diſturb our repoſe too far removed. Never was there ſuch a <hi>Phoenix ſtate.</hi> What leſs than the power of the Almighty, with the ſtart we have gained, can prevent our arrival to the higheſt elevation of grandeur and opulence?</p>
               <p>Courage, then Americans! liberty, religion, and ſciences are on the wing to theſe ſhores: The finger of God points out a mighty empire to your ſons: The ſavages of the wilderneſs were never expelled to make room in this, the beſt part of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, for idolaters and ſlaves. The land we poſſeſs is the gift of heaven to our fathers, and divine providence, ſeems to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it to our lateſt poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:010857_0030_0F8524F3E4E32938"/>
So legible this munificent and celeſtial deed, in the events that are paſſed, that we need not be diſcouraged by the bickerings at preſent ſubſiſting, between us and our parent country. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry cloud, raiſed by the raſhneſs, and ſupported by the obſtinacy of a man, in whom oppoſition and diſappointment, have begot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible malice againſt the colonies, will ſoon be diſſipated. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain has only to learn our importance to her own intereſt, and this once underſtood, the enemies of both countries will inſtantly be put to ſilence; and America advance to felicity and glory, with redoubled rapidity and vigour.</p>
               <p>Grant it to be fact (and ſure 'tis a truth too palpable to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied) that a <hi>third part</hi> of the commerce of the nation depends upon the colonies; I ſay, if this propoſition be true, we may wind up our hopes to all the confidence of aſſurance, that Great-Britain will never ſuffer this cord to be cut, by which we are ſo intimately united. And this cord uncut, it requires no depth of policy to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, that we ſhall one day or other, draw every thing valuable at home (the Terra firma of thoſe iſlands only excepted) into the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious boſom of the continent of America. Nor need this proſpect give either of us an alarm. Happy for her, that ſhe has an aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum prepared againſt the day of her calamity. Happy for us, the work is ſo far advanced, that there is no looking back. Thrice happy for us both, that the mother and her ſons will again be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected into one houſe, and that in proportion to the abatement of the national glory in Europe, will be the brightneſs of its reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in America.</p>
               <p>The day dawns in which the foundation of this mighty empire is to be laid, by the eſtabliſhment of a <hi>regular American conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> All that has hitherto been done, ſeems to be little beſide the collection of materials, for the conſtruction of this glorious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick. 'Tis time to put them together. The transfer of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean part of the great family is ſo ſwift, and our growth ſo vaſt, that, before ſeven years roll over our heads, the firſt ſtone muſt be laid.—Peace or war; famine or plenty; poverty or affluence; in a word no circumſtance, whether proſperous or adverſe, can happen to our parent; nay, no conduct of hers, whether wiſe or imprudent, no poſſible temper on her part, whether kind or croſs grained, will put a ſtop to this building. There is no contending with Omnipotence, and the <hi>prediſpoſitions</hi> are ſo numerous, and ſo well adapted to the riſe of America, that our ſucceſs is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable; and Britain, who began the work, will not, cannot, with-hold her aſſiſtance. Her aſſiſtance did I ſay; She will ſpend all that ſhe has.—nay, ſhe is coming, faſt coming, in her own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſon, and will deſert her beloved iſland, to complete the ſtupendous and laſting monument of her power. What an aera is this to America! and how loud the call to vigilance and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

In ſome future paper I ſhall dilate this idea, and attempt to point to the proper objects of our attention, that are of civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; but the remainder of this day's lucubration, is intended to guard againſt the undue influence of our clergy, while we are moulding the great political maſs into order.</p>
               <p>Every eye ſhould be open at ſuch a ſeaſon as the preſent. No man reveres this neceſſary and uſeful part of the community, more than I do, I don't mean, therefore, to take an occaſion, with Deiſts and Libertines, for licentious abaſe. Rancour againſt the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed author of our moſt holy religion, is the common motives of the ſcurrilities uttered againſt the miniſters of his goſpel. But it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs our duty; nay, our regard to the clergy, demands the utmoſt attention, to the efforts they are conſtantly inclined to make, in favour of themſelves. As a learned and ſpeculative body, they poſſeſs <hi>knowledge,</hi> one of the moſt fruitful ſources of power, and in ſpite of all the mortifying leſſons, taught by their divine maſter, the leaven of pride and ambition works night and day, to acquire dominion; which as often as they have ſucceeded, proved to be beyond all others relentleſs and intolerable.</p>
               <p>It is ſtoried in their own hiſtory, that when the Emperor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine endowed the church with lands and poſſeſſions, the voice of an Angel was heard in the air, crying, <hi>Hodie venenum infun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur in eccleſiam. This day poiſon is poured into the church:</hi> and bitter experience has confirmed the truth of theſe words, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we believe concerning the being by whom they were uttered. Of this execrable potion, the biſhop of Rome took the firſt draught; and all Chriſtendom furniſhes inſtances of prieſts who long to tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this <hi>wine of fornication,</hi> Our wiſe and pious reformers began therefore with abſolutely renouncing the cup, and 'tis too, too evident, that in ſpite of the admonitions of prophecy, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſound policy, and the experience of every age ſince this deſtructive bowl was ſtirred up, in which ſpiritual gifts and worldly benefits, are abſurdly compounded together, that ſome of the proteſtant clergy are as deſirous to take the intoxicating ſip, as thoſe, who with the <hi>ſcarlet whore,</hi> have often got drunk, and <hi>defiled the nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I impute all the prayers, entreaties, conjurations, ſighs, and lamentations, of a certain claſs of prieſts, for the introduction of a <hi>ſpiritual Generaliſſimo</hi> into this country. I am ſenſible that they diſavow all noxious deſigns, and that like other ſots they palliate their inordinate thirſt after the inſalutary doſe, by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſeem friendly to health and conſiſtent with ſobriety and innocence. But as all attempts from an order, who abjure the roughneſs of violence, will be dictated by <hi>the wiſdom of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and cunningly affect the <hi>harmleſſneſs of the dove;</hi> we ought, for preventing the ſucceſs of their machinations, to ſet a double

Of all thraldom, ſpiritual thraldom is the worſt; and if ever any ſect acquires a dominion in this country, the fires of perſecution muſt burn with hotter vengeance <hi>here,</hi> than in any other part of the world; becauſe our nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſuaſions afford the moſt plentiful fuel. Cowards are mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and the fears of the aſſuming denomination will never be quieted till the throne they erect is free from all danger.

                  </gap>o lord it over the reſt, I have ſhewn in ſome former papers; and for that very reaſon, they of all others, ought to be content with their lot. Guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied on every ſide againſt oppreſſion, what have Epiſcopalians to fear? In the diſtribution of power they have ſo immoderate a ſhare, that the very deſire to have more, is not only inconſiſtent with all Chriſtian moderation, but gives juſt grounds for ſuſpicion that they are meditating an <hi>offenſive war.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But conſcience is pleaded—For what? that the church, ſays Dr. Chandler, may be better governed.—Over whom is this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be exerciſed?—Not, ſays he, over the laity, (a ſure proof this, that the government deſired, is not deduced from the ſcriptures) but only over the clergy.—Let them behave better. This is in their own power, and if any remain incorrigible, my Lord of Landaff, and the reſt of the ſociety at home, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per complaint, (which complaint every man is invited to make) will ſoon bring the delinquents to reaſon. As to the matter of ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the candidate's conſcience is relieveable by a trip to London; nor need the laity be afflicted, if he makes any difficulty; for thoſe muſt be ſmall motions of the ſpirit indeed, towards the work of the miniſtry, which the ſight of ſalt water will ſubdue.—And with reſpect to confirmation, ſince we have ſo long been without it, and no man is ſo ſhameleſsly uncharitable, as to ſuppoſe it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, and that our anceſtors have all periſhed for want of it, the conſcience bound on account of this defect, can be on no very pitiable rack of pain. Beſides, what is moſt fatal to this plea, is, that the majority of the continent have conſciences too, and by thoſe very conſciences, think themſelves bound to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the unſeaſonable introduction of proud prelates into this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—That it is a fact, that thouſands have horrors at the bare proſpect, the Doctor can want no proof at this day; and if the minority have ſuch unconſcionable conſciences, as not to <hi>poſſeſs their ſouls in patience,</hi> till God, in his wiſe providence, and for the puniſhment of our ſins, opens a wider door for theſe right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend fathers, and their lay and clerical officers and attendants, they can have no Chriſtian conſciences at all.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor tells us, that our fears are groundleſs, and that the biſhop he wants, is a <hi>primitive biſhop.</hi>—This, good maſter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant, is at preſent a very ſcarce commodity; and you would
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:010857_0031_0F8524F4A3E51258"/>yourſelf laugh at the wide-mouthed credulity, that can ſwallow ſuch a camel. Are they wanted for patterns of imitation?— The Doctor has not ſaid ſuch a word.—For their prayers and their ſermons?—No one aſſerts it. But to the aſtoniſhment of all that are acquainted with the hiſtory of the church, they are ſaid to be neceſſary for <hi>protection and defence.</hi>—Would not any ſtranger be led by this, to believe, that the miſſionaries were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted; And yet not a man of them all—no, not the meaneſt miſſionary upon the continent, would exchange the ſociety's bounty, for the revenues and rank of a primitive biſhop. The apoſtles, to begin with the firſt biſhops, we know lived by charity, and the labour of their hands.—For three centuries after, they were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by private helps, and the pay of their ſcholars.—Theſe were the times in which the clergy <hi>reſiſted unto blood,</hi> and by the way, the good reputation of our American clergy, is greatly owing to the neceſſity they are under, of living near theſe glorious examples. Antiently a biſhop's palace was a cottage; for the fourth council of Carthage, about the year 350, laid it down as a canon or law, that the biſhop ſhould live near his church, in <hi>Hoſpitiolo,</hi> that is, in a <hi>little cottage.</hi> In the excerptions of <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> ſo late as the year 750, the ſame canon was renewed.—<hi>Bede</hi> tells us, that their very cathedrals were built of wattle and boards pieced together, and covered with reed.—The table of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> a biſhop of the higheſt renown, as <hi>Poſſedonius</hi> relates, was ſpread with diſhes and trenchers of wood, his houſe was mean, he ſeldom had any fleſh to eat, and his whole ſervice of plate conſiſted of half a dozen ſpoons.—<hi>Spiridion</hi> tended a flock of ſheep. St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> one of the moſt learned of the fathers, tho' no biſhop, dwelt like them, <hi>in pauperi tuguriolo,</hi> a <hi>poor little cottage;</hi> and Ambroſe, the biſhop of Milan, turns the tables upon the pampered prieſts of the Gentiles, by boaſting in his maxim, that <hi>the poverty of the miniſters of Chriſt, was an honour to them, Glorioſa in ſacerdotibus domini, paupertas.</hi> Theſe are the biſhops ſome men pretend to deſire. How much more credible, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being a bulwark to the miſſionaries, unleſs by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſuch biſhops as thoſe would be a tax upon their charity, not to mention the probability that lives ſo <hi>apoſtolically</hi> ſpiritual, and abject, would render them, if not ſubjects of perſecution, at leaſt objects of contempt.</p>
               <p>If by primitive biſhops, they mean not ſuch poor miſerable bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as theſe, it remains to give <hi>this equivocal expreſſion,</hi> ſome determinate meaning, and till then the treaty between Dr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and the public, may doubtleſs remain unratified, without any impeachment of the honour and juſtice of North-America, which this writer has unwarily drawn into queſtion.</p>
               <p>We ſhould eſtem it the palladium of our liberties, if the King's
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:010857_0032_0F8524F570561D70"/>judges held their commiſſions by the tenure of good behaviour; and to the preſervation of the morals of our clergy, it is eſſential that their ſubſiſtence depend upon the ſame honourable condition. A biſhop and his officers, independent of the people!—I tremble at the thought of ſuch a powerful ſpy, in a country juſt forming a ſtate of ſoundneſs and ſtability—Rouſe then, Americans! You have as much to fear from ſuch a miniſter of the Church, as you had lately from a miniſter of ſtate, and whether this project is not a device of the latter, by dividing us to favour his deſigns, tho' he is now in diſgrace, is ſubmitted to your wiſdom, to diſcern and prevent.</p>

               <p>THE author of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> was confident from the goodneſs of his cauſe, that he ſhould ſoon drive his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives out of the fair field of battle, and reduce them to vent their diſappointed malice, in the impotent ammunition of ſcandal and miſrepreſentation; but he did not flatter himſelf, that they would ſneak behind their intrenchments ſo early, as he finds by the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Holt's laſt paper, ſigned, <hi>a Son of Liberty.</hi> Could that artleſs Tory have given any better proof of his regard to the thing, than by the unwarrantable liberty he has taken of counterfeiting the name, he would inſtead of cenſuring, have applauded the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the religious liberties of his country. My paper for this day, which was in the hands of the Printer before his letter came out, is of itſelf a ſufficient refutation of the inſinuations of this ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler.

Having thus detected a foe, under the cloak of a Son of Liberty, let the public beware of every writer, who while he affects a zeal for our civil liberties, will not declare his abhorrence of eccleſiaſtical ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which is by ſo much worſe than every other ſpecies of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as our religious, are preferable to our temporal intereſts.

               <p>AS the propoſal of introducing Dioceſan biſhops into Britiſh America is an innovation, which would probably affect the religious and civil liberties of his Majeſty's American ſubjects, I ſhall not be terrified from offering my objections, meerly becauſe Doctor Chandler has been pleaſed to call it perſecution. Appeal, page 82. The good gentleman knows that all the rejecters of epiſcopacy have diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the cauſe of liberty, and that their principles of church government are principles of freedom. He ought not therefore to think it perſecution, if they, jealous of their liberty, ſhould oppoſe this dangerous innovation; the very mention of which recalls to our minds the unrelenting rigors of epiſcopal tyranny; the heavy fines, impriſonments, and perſecutions which peopled the ſavage wilds of America; and forced many thouſands of our forefathers to ſeek a peaceful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, from the cruelty of their fellow-Chriſtians, amongſt more hoſpitable Indians. Theſe refugees have not yet forgot the groans and blood of the many myriads of oppreſſed Puritans, which cry beneath the altar "how long O Lord"! the liſt of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe inſtances of epiſcopal tyranny, which ſhould fill every reader with horror, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort from the Doctor himſelf, notwithſtanding his fondneſs for ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power, the modeſt ſoftened conceſſion, <q>that there have been formerly ſome inſtances wherein the power of our biſhops has been ſtrained too high</q> P 91. And leſt we ſhould be led to imagine, that he, out of his abundant charity, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged too much againſt his church, he endeavours to wipe off the reproach from her, and caſt it rather <q>on the times, in which neither the natural rights of men, nor the religious rights of Chriſtians, were ſo well underſtood, as in the preſent age. For even then," he ſays "the ſpirit of the church of England, like that of the goſpel, was <hi>more peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated,</hi> than that of any other national church.</q> This may ſerve to give us ſome idea of the Doctor's comparatively peaceable and gentle ſpirit. But I hope we ſhall have a ſtill more peaceable and gentle ſpirit to reign in America: Indeed he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to perſuade us, that when his ſo much wiſhed-for biſhop comes, he will bring it with him, "for the times", he ſays, "are
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:010857_0033_0F8524F622000A60"/>much mended in this reſpect," P. 90—Excuſe us, good Sir, if we think, that however the ſpirit of the times be much mended, the ſpirit of your church and her biſhops, is not yet ſo much mended, as to free us entirely from any fears of oppreſſion by their extenſive powers.</p>
               <p>In conſidering the peaceable ſpirit of the rulers of the church of England now, or in ſome following paper, I may have occaſion to point out ſome things that do not ſavour much of the ſpirit of moderation and candour. However I would be underſtood thro' the whole, not to intend any reflection on the laity of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, nor on all the clergy. The moderation of ſome is well known: they have endeavoured with a truly Chriſtian ſpirit, not only to bear a conſtant teſtimony againſt the numberleſs abuſes, which have ariſen from the powers of the clergy, but are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to bring about a reformation in many things, which they candidly acknowledge to ſtand in need of it. Far be it from me to lay that to the charge of thoſe men, which they, as well as we, acknowledge to be unjuſt and tyrannical. But there are others of a very different character and temper, eſpecially among the clergy, who have been diſtinguiſhed by the name of high-church; and who according to Doctor Chandler, compoſe the body of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional church, who have not as yet candour enough to admit of ſuch a reformation. Page 96 and 97.</p>
               <p>Although the wings of theſe high-flyers have been cropt, and their exhorbitant powers limitted in ſome degree, by the ſalutary reſtrants of ſome modern ſtatutes; yet we know it was much againſt their wills, that ſuch merciful laws were made. They muſt therefore give the world ſome more ſubſtantial proofs of their peaceable forbearing temper, than their advocate Doctor Chandler's word, before we can believe, that the ſpirit of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is not yet alive in that Church, and would not flame out again in all its wonted rage, if they were but allowed to exerciſe the powers they claim.</p>
               <p>Until that flagrant abuſe of the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper, occaſioned by the TEST Act, ſhall be removed out of the churches of England and Ireland, we muſt believe, good Doctor, that you not only <hi>would</hi> but <hi>do</hi> perſecute your brethren, and cut them off from the natural rights of ſerving their King and country, in all important places of power and truſt; unleſs they can concur with you, not only in what they look on as a ſuperſtitious mode of adminiſtering that divine ordinance; but alſo in proſtituting that ſacred rite to ſecular, nay to worſe than ſecular purpoſes; by making that which was inſtituted as a teſt of our fidelity to the King of Kings, a teſt of our allegiance to our earthly ſovereign. That this is perſecution, the Doctor himſelf will help me to prove, page 82, <q>To puniſh us for our religious principles when no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:010857_0033_0F8524F622000A60"/>of ſtate require it, is perſecution in the ſtricteſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt ſenſe. Whatever evil is inflicted on us, on account of our principles and practices, is properly puniſhment; and every good we are deprived of, is equal to an evil inflicted. As ſuch treatment has the very eſſence of perſecution, ſo it can have only its ſource in an intolerent perſecuting diſpoſition.</q> The ſacramental teſt is therefore a ſtanding monument of the perſecuting ſpirit of the church of England; even in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Doctor Chandler, unleſs he be hardy enough to attempt aſſigning reaſons of ſtate to change that <q>which has the nature of perſecution, and ariſes from an intolerant ſpirit,</q> into a ſalutary regulation. When he produces arguments to convince men, who are the leaſt converſant with the rights of men or Chriſtians, that it is reaſonable and neceſſary, that ſo large a body of his Majeſty's ſubjects, as the rejecters of his beloved hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy in England and Ireland, who have always diſtinguiſhed themſelves, for their loyalty and attachment to the preſent royal family, ſhould have ſuch an unheard of ſtigma fixed upon them, that they are deprived of the common privileges of ſubjects; then, and not till then, will the Doctor be able to wipe away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach from his church. But it is hoped, he will never ſubject his knowledge of the rights of mankind, nor his own Chriſtianity, to the ſuſpicions which muſt ariſe from ſuch an attempt. The Doctor would indeed in ſome places appear charitable enough to allow, that they are as loyal and as good ſubjects, as the epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians themſelves are, "There are," ſays he, <q>many Britiſh ſubjects both at home and in the plantations, who reject epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and yet are warm advocates for our happy civil conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. It is therefore raſh and injurious to charge any with diſaffection to the government, at this day, becauſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the national religion.</q> Page 115. Whether he means that of South or North-Britain, is not diſtinguiſhed; but it is moſt likely the former, as very few of his brethren the <hi>Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Scotland,</hi> are friends to the preſent government.</p>
               <p>What reaſons of ſtate can there be alledged, why ſo many of his Majeſty's loyal and faithful ſubjects, ſhould be deprived of their natural and undoubted rights? Poſſibly the Doctor's fertile imagination will furniſh us with ſome, which have hitherto lain hid from the penetration of men of inferior genius and invention. When he condeſcends to do this, and thereby attemps to wipe off the offence which his church continues to give by the profanation of the Lord's ſupper and the denial of civil rights to as good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as thoſe who join her communion, it will be time enough for me to give them a thorough and impartial examination. But till this ſhall be done, the good Doctor will not take it hard, that we fear the ſpirit of perſecution is ſtill alive in his church, and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:010857_0034_0F8524F6EB64AC50"/>ready to operate, with its native violence, whenever an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhall offer. There is no way at preſent for the Doctor to evade the force of this argumentation, tranſcribed from his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> unleſs he boldly cuts the knot, and aſſerts, that none who reject epiſcopacy, have any natural right to civil or military offices. He has indeed ſuch an expreſſion in page 109; but it betrays ſuch an unacquaintedneſs with the rights of mankind, and ſavours ſo much of a perſecuting diſpoſition, that charity would incline us to think it fell inadvertently from his pen, when he was ſolacing himſelf with the glorious proſpect of the clergy and the people of his church engroſſing all honourable and profitable employments throughout the colonies. The Doctor ſurely will not vindicate the expreſſion, but from a regard to his character for <hi>moderation, candour, and catholiciſm,</hi> retract it without delay.</p>
               <p>But this is not our only reaſon for concluding that the ſpirit of the Biſhops, and inferior Clergy, (as they are called) is not like the ſpirit of the goſpel, peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. Nor is it owing to the gentle temper of the conſtitution of their church, that the rejecters of epiſcopacy are not treated as harſhly now as formerly. The <hi>Act of Uniformity</hi> breathes a very cruel and ſlaviſh ſpirit. It enacts that <q>whoever ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, or ſpeak any thing in derogation, or depraving of the book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> or any thing therein contained, or any part thereof, he ſhall, for the firſt offence, ſuffer impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for one whole year, without bail or main-prize; and for the ſecond offence be impriſoned during life.</q> Weak muſt the church have appeared, which ſtood in need of ſuch a ſupport! But we are aſſured by divine authority, that <q>the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againg the Church of Chriſt.</q> This famous act however has been often called, and I doubt not Doctor Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler himſelf has long eſteemed it a grand pillar of his church. But who envies him the honour of belonging to a church, that muſt be ſupported, if ſupported at all, by ſuch a notorious infringement of the rights of private judgment; ſuch a prohibition of a fair and candid examination of her principles and diſcipline; and ſuch a reſtraint on the freedom of ſpeech, eſſential to Britiſh liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Here I can ſafely appeal to the impartial world, and even to the conſcience of the Doctor himſelf, whether this be not a very unjuſt and perſecuting law.</p>
               <p>I might eaſily proceed to ſhew, that the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Doctor's church do not beſpeak a very charitable temper; but this I ſhall have more room to enlarge upon in ſome future paper.</p>

               <p>THE eſtabliſhment of a proteſtant epiſcopate in America is alſo very zealouſly contended for: And it is very alarming to a people whoſe fathers, from the hardſhips they ſuffered under ſuch an eſtabliſhment, were obliged to fly their native country into a wilderneſs, in order peaceably to enjoy their privileges, civil and religious: Their being threatened with the loſs of both at once, muſt throw them into a very diſagreeable ſituation. We hope in God ſuch an eſtabliſhment will never take place in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and we deſire you would ſtrenuouſly oppoſe it. The reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue raiſed in America for ought we can tell, may be as conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally applied towards the ſupport of prelacy as of ſoldiers and penſioners: If the property of the ſubject is taken from him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent, it is immaterial, whether it be done by one man or five hundred; or whether it be applied for the ſupport of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtic or military power, or both.

            <p>HAVING gently corrected the <hi>American Whig,</hi> for the Licentiouſneſs of his Pen in his firſt Rhapſody, I ſhall now proceed, in Courſe, to animadvert upon No. II. of this weekly Effuſion, <hi>alias, Introduction the Second by a different Hand,</hi> having taken it into my Head to be more liberal for this Time, than I intended, or ſuch a Publication deſerves; refering thoſe who are deſirous to be informed wherein <hi>perſonal Identity</hi> conſiſts, to a Chapter on that Subject in Mr. <hi>Look's Eſſay concerning human Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Whig</hi> introduces <hi>this</hi> Introduction with two ſtiff clumſy Paragraphs upon the Subject of <hi>Liberty;</hi> the whole Meaning of which, ſo far as they have any Meaning, may be much more clearly and fully expreſſed in theſe two ſhort Sentences, reduced to plain Engliſh: <q>Liberty is a very good thing.—
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:010857_0035_0F8524F7A6E9CAC0"/>and Men ought to be careful to preſerve ſo good a Thing as Liberty.</q> I dare ſay he had not a ſingle Idea which is not fully expreſſed in theſe two Propoſitions. What Occaſion then was there for all this round about pedantic Harangue, upon ſo plain and familiar a Subject?</p>
            <p>I am at a Loſs to diſcover, what could have been the primary and immediate View of this Writer, in obſcuring theſe plain and honeſt Truths, by a Repreſentation of them through the miſty Medium of ſuch <hi>Verbage;</hi> but <q>without Breach of Charity, we may ſuppoſe at leaſt a ſecondary Motive,</q> to have been, The giving to his Friends ſome Proof of his Zeal for the glorious Cauſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Liberty. And, ſince plauſible Words are a much cheaper Commodity than commendable Actions, perhaps he had the farther Intention of reconmmending himſelf by a patriotic Example, in theſe Time of Oeconomy. Yet as to the Character he <hi>aſſumes</hi> of a zealous Advocate for Liberty, it appears to be forced and unnatural; and, with all his Study to diſguiſe himſelf, he makes but an awkward Figure, and hobbles abominably. For, to ſay nothing here of his general Deſign, which is unfriendly to the Cauſe of Liberty, as he aims con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining it to his own Party to the excluſion of others, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as ſuffered an expreſſion to drop from his Pen, which betrays the moſt diſhonourable and ſordid Conceptions,—and proves that he is a Stranger to the Charms of this amiable Goddeſs. Other Writers, when they enter upon the Subject of Liberty, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately animated: But this Writer ſhews, that he has no Acquaintance with this ſovereign Beauty, by the Inſenſibility of his Deportment. Elſe why ſuch Rudeneſs and want of Reſpect? Why does he attempt to puſh her into the Rear of Life and Property?—telling us, with much Phlegm, that <q>
                  <hi>next</hi> to Life and Property, Men will moſt zealouſly contend for its Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before he proceeds farther, I adviſe him, if he has any Regard for his own Reputation, or that of his Party, to make a Halt, and apply himſelf for a few Weeks, with the whole Force of his Abilities, to ſtudy the Principles of true Liberty, ſo far at leaſt as to underſtand the <hi>Elements</hi> of that noble Science. In the mean while, for his preſent Uſe, I will lay before him a few Maxims relating thereto, which are inconteſtable. Every ſincere Friend of Liberty, is impartial in his Eſteem for it, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhes it an univerſal Dominion. He that wiſhes Liberty uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to prevail, will endeavour to promote it in all Caſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Reſpect to Perſons. He that endeavours to promotes it in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll Caſes will be careful not to oppoſe it in any. Until he makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſelf a Maſter of theſe Principles, he will be only able, with his utmoſt Application, <q>
                  <hi>ſo</hi> naturally to counterfeit the Voice of <hi>Liberty,</hi> that it is not every Reader who will be able to
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:010857_0035_0F8524F7A6E9CAC0"/>diſcriminate it from that of</q>—<hi>Tyranny,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution.</hi> By way of Poſtſcript to what I have ſaid on this Head, I will take the <hi>Liberty</hi> to inform him, that the Members of the Church of England, in requeſting an American Epiſcopate, aim at nothing more than the Enjoyment of that <hi>religious</hi> Liberty, which all other Denominations of Chriſtians throughout the Britiſh Dominions in <hi>America,</hi> are poſſeſſed of.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>third</hi> Paragraph, the <hi>American Whig</hi> goes on to apply his general Obſervations to a particular Caſe. <q>What led me into theſe Reflection, (ſays he) was the reading Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Plea for an <hi>American Epiſcopate.</hi>
               </q> His Reflections, we have ſeen, amount to two Propoſitions. The firſt <q>that Liberty is a very good Thing</q>—was naturally enough ſuggeſted by the <hi>Appeal:</hi> But he blundered in the ſecond. For inſtead of concluding <q>that Men ought to be careful to <hi>preſerve</hi> ſo good a Thing as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</q>—he ought more logically to have infered—<q>that the Members of the CHURCH in <hi>America</hi> are right in ſeeking to <hi>obtain</hi> ſo good a Thing as Liberty,</q>—and—<q>that no true Friends of Liberty will ever oppoſe them.</q> And in this Train he might have gone on to a Number of Concluſions, which would have done infinitely more Honour to his Head, and his Heart.</p>
            <p>But he tells us, <q>the Scheme for ſending Biſhops into the Colonies, has it ſeems been long under Conſideration. 'Tis above fifty Years ſince it was firſt ſtarted.</q> This I believe, becauſe the Author of the <hi>Appeal</hi> has proved it. And moſt People will think it is high Time that it ſhould be <hi>more</hi> than conſidered; but I fancy the CHURCH may wait fifty Years longer, before ſuch Friends of Liberty as this will <hi>conſent</hi> to its being carried into Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We hear (ſays he) the Advocates for it, both here and in <hi>England,</hi> have ſanguine Expectations of its ſpeedy Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> Let us ſee whether he offers any Thing by way of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration or Proof of theſe "ſanguine Expectations." What he ſays further on the ſubject is in the next Paragraph in theſe Words: <q>It is now generally known that the Miniſtry in <hi>England</hi> have rejected the Propoſal. As they muſt be ſuppoſed to ſpeak the Sentiments of their royal Maſter, this muſt be conſtrued a Denial from the Throne.</q> Now as this will not anſwer the Purpoſe of Illuſtration, we muſt ſuppoſe it to have been intended as a Medium of Proof. And as good proof it is, as the <hi>Whig</hi> has hitherto given us Reaſon to expect. Superficial Readers may object againſt it, becauſe the Premiſes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſtand at rather two great a Diſtance from each other on his Paper; and becauſe he leaves them under ſome Uncertainty as to the proceſs—whether he means to prove the <hi>Expectations</hi> from the <hi>Rejection,</hi> or the <hi>Rejection</hi> from the <hi>Expectations.</hi> But
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:010857_0036_0F8524F92AA40018"/>upon a nearer <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> theſe Difficulties will vaniſh, and his Intention to prove the <hi>Expectations</hi> will be evident. For ſee how cleverly the <hi>Premiſes</hi> will tumble out the <hi>Conſequence,</hi> when properly managed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatever has been rejected by the Miniſtry, and denied from the Throne, is likely to ſucceed: But, the Plan for American Biſhops has been rejected by the Miniſtry, and denied from the Throne:</hi> Ergo <hi>The Plan for American Biſhops is likely to ſucceed,</hi> and, <q>the Advocates for it have <hi>ſanguine Expectations</hi> of its ſpeedy Accompliſhment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is only allowing him his Principle in his <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition, and his Fact in the Minor, and then the <hi>Conſequence</hi> he will claim in his own Right.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, <q>No leſs than <hi>ſeven</hi> Petitions, <hi>we are told,</hi> have been tranſmitted by a certain Convention.</q> Undoubtedly the Number <hi>ſeven</hi> is of moſt tremendous Import. For we read in Scripture of <hi>Seven Horns,</hi> of a <hi>Dragon with ſeven Heads,</hi> (emblematical of the <hi>American Whig,</hi>) of <hi>Seven Abominations,</hi> and of <hi>Mary Magdalene, out of whom were caſt Seven Devils.</hi> If then the Number of Addreſſes <q>tranſmitted by a certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</q> amounts to neither more nor leſs than <hi>Seven,</hi> is not our <hi>Whig</hi> intitled to immortal Honour for teaching his <q>dear Countrymen</q> to conclude, that there muſt be a deep Plot laid to ruin and enſlave them,—and, ſhould the Plot ſucceed, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than Devils, and Horns, and abominations, muſt be the Portion of him and his Party?</p>
            <p>But this is not all: Theſe <hi>Seven</hi> Addreſſes repreſent <q>the deplorable Condition of an <hi>unmitred</hi> Church.</q> It ſeems then that all that is requeſted is a few <hi>Mitres,</hi> which never did Harm in any Country. For as a late Writer well obſerves, <q>a Man bent upon Miſchief, can do it as effectually with a Pumkin-Shell upon his Head, as with a Mitre,</q> now as Mitres are not worn at this Day in <hi>England,</hi> it is probable that as many as are wanted, may be purchaſed at ſecond Hand; and in a little Time we may learn to make them in the Colonies, and, as this will be a new Manufacture, it will prove a public Benefit to our Country.</p>
            <p>Again: Thoſe who ſigned the Addreſſes, <q>boaſt of their in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>credible Numbers.</q> This is a vague, indefinite Expreſſion and I do not well underſtand it. The Tenor of thoſe Addreſſes. <hi>I am told,</hi> is the ſame of that of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> In the Appeal the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is expreſſed Page 55) in theſe Words: <q>ſhould it be ſaid that the the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> contains now <hi>near</hi> a Million of Members, the Aſſertion might be juſtified.</q> But the Author of the <hi>Appeal</hi> grants, in the following Sentence, that <q>it is not eaſy to aſcertain the Number exactly in a Country ſo widely extended, and unequally peopled;</q> and then proceeds to aſſign
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:010857_0036_0F8524F92AA40018"/>the Reaſons for his believing them to be <hi>near</hi> a Million. From no other Ground than this, the <hi>poetical</hi> Imagination of the <hi>firſt Whig</hi> raiſes him to an Apprehenſion, that the <hi>Appeal</hi> will lead People in <hi>England</hi> to believe, "that leſs than half a Million is in Reality <hi>Three</hi> Millions and <hi>more.</hi>" Did ever Poet make a loftier and bolder Flight!</p>
            <p>If the Members of the Convention boaſt of their <q>diſtinguiſhed and unſhaken Loyalty,</q> I know not who can gainſay it. Nay, this Writer himſelf in his next Paragraph, teſtifies in Favour of their general Character, and ſpeaks of <q>that Zeal for the Conſtitution and the Government at Home, to which he (the Author of the <hi>Appeal</hi>) and his Brethren, avow ſo warm an Attachment.</q> If People have a Zeal for the Conſtitution, either in Whole or in Part, may they not be allowed to declare it, on proper Occaſions? Does any one blame the late Petitioners for a certain <hi>Charter,</hi> for declaring that they <q>BOAST the moſt undiſſembled Loyalty and Attachment to his Majeſty's Perſon, Family and Government?</q> That the Members of the CHURCH ſhould not be allowed an equal Privilege of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>their</hi> Loyalty, is—is—is—not fair.</p>
            <p>As to the Addreſſes <q>not ſparing very injurious Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the other Denominations, as ſeditious Incendiaries, and diſaffected to the King and the Government;</q> Several of the Perſons who ſigned the Addreſſes, tell me this is a falſe Accuſation; and we are aſſured by the Secretary to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention <q>that this Aſſertion of the <hi>American Whig</hi> is abſolutely, utterly, and intirely falſe and groundleſs.</q> And he publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls upon him <q>to produce the Authority upon which he has aſſerted ſo infamous a Falſehood.</q> Until therefore the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Whig</hi> produces the Evidence which the Secretary to the Convention calls for, he muſt be looked upon as the Father of this infamous Falſhood.</p>
            <p>I have frequently been <hi>ſurpriſed</hi> in the Courſe of my Life, but never more ſo, than on finding it aſſerted by this Writer with ſo much Confidence, that <q>it is now generally <hi>known,</hi> that the Miniſtry in <hi>England</hi> have rejected the Propoſal</q> of an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Epiſcopate: And I have made it my Buſineſs to enquire of ſeveral Member of the Convention, with whom I am accquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether there was any <hi>Truth</hi> in the Aſſertion. They all, to a Man, agreed in affirming, that the Propoſal was ſo far from having been rejected by the Miniſtry, that it had never been made to them, to the beſt of their Knowledge. They alſo aſſured me that they have not the leaſt Apprehenſion of <q>a Denial from the Throne,</q>—and that the Inſinuation that <q>in Anſwer to their Petitions, they have been ordered to be ſilent,</q> is falſe and ſcandalous. Now as theſe Gentlemen muſt be ſuppoſed to
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:010857_0037_0F8524FA18583938"/>know as much of the Matter as any other Perſons, and as they are generally eſteemed to be Men of Integrity and Veracity, I ſhall rather take their Word for it, than that of an anonymous, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive <hi>Incendiary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I have been detained much longer with this <hi>Pair</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductions than I at firſt intended, I ſhall paſs over many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious Paſſages, without particular Notice. The Reader I believe is tired, and after a few Words more, I will take my Leave of him, promiſing not to trouble him again for—<hi>a whole week.</hi> What I would obſerve before we part is, That this Introductioner juggles with the Titles of <hi>the Appeal to the Public,</hi> and tries to make it imply <q>a Removal of the Suit from the Sovereign to the Subject, as to a higher Tribunal.</q> That the Author of the <hi>Appeal</hi> looks upon that of the People as the higher Tribunal, he has never declared; but I preſume he takes it to be an Article of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican <hi>Whigiſm,</hi> that all Power, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, is derived from Them; and according to our <hi>Whig's Logic,</hi> it may be proved from Scripture, <hi>for the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> Nor does Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> appear to have had any Deſign of <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving his Suit from the Sovereign to the Subject.</q> He uſes the Word <hi>Appeal</hi> freely and properly, and not in that <hi>technical</hi> Senſe to which the <hi>Pedants</hi> of the Law would confine it. He has clearly explained his own Meaning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which was to ſubmit the Reaſonableneſs of an American Epiſcopate, to the Judgment and Conſciences of Men, in order to know whether any Reaſonable Objections can be offered againſt it. This is the Queſton to be debated before the Tribunal of the Public; and as our <hi>Whig</hi> declares his Willingneſs to appear there in Behalf of his <hi>Clients,</hi> I adviſe him to be careful in what manner he behaves,—and to remember that a <hi>Whip</hi> is prepared for his Flagellation whenever he deſerves it. In a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Manner let him guard himſelf againſt his conſtitutional Sins of "evil-ſpeaking, lying and ſlandering,"</p>

            <p>DOCTOR <hi>Chandler's</hi> Appeal, begins with a denial of the validity of the ordination of all the proteſtant miniſters in the world except thoſe of his own denomination. This to be ſure is no great recommendation of his project, to the people of a country, who, a few only excepted, are firm in the opinion he attacks. Had he proceeded to expreſs himſelf in the ſpirit of his principles, the bulk of the reformed clergy, and ours among the reſt, would

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a voluntary conſent to the ſcheme of eſtabliſhing a proud hierarchy on this continent.</p>
            <p>It is far from my intention, where the Doctor delivers himſelf with the benevolence of a Chriſtian, or the candour of a gentleman, to excite cenſorious and ill grounded jealouſies. I mean only to expoſe artful diſguiſes, contrived to conceal the true ſpirit of the Appeal, and an inſidious affectation of courteſy, the better to promote a pernicious deſign. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> with the generous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of a friend to truth, ſome where declares, that the man who wilfully connects ideas to terms, foreign to their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſenſe, deſerves the puniſhment of him who ſtops the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits of water to a city. And a much greater authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>the Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.</hi> A profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed addreſs therefore to all ranks of people, upon a ſubject of the utmoſt importance to their liberties and intereſts, ſhould not only be free from <hi>the entangling weeds of chicanery,</hi> but dictated with a contempt of the reſerves forbidden by an honeſt open-hearted ſincerity.</p>
            <p>After aſſerting the poſition, that biſhops are <hi>jure divino</hi> above preſbyters; or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> other words, that they are ſo by the Authority of Chriſt; the conſequence was plain from that premiſe, that all the non epiſcopal churches had departed from the true ſtandard of government, and were cenſurable as ſchiſmatical and erroneous. And whatever might be the effect, as to the project he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to promote, I appeal to the reader, whether it would not have done honour to the Doctor's ſincerity, to have applied his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net to the American churches with <hi>apoſtolic plainneſs of ſpeech?</hi> Inſtead of ſo commendable and courageous a conduct, we are firſt told, that none not ordained by a biſhop can officiate as clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and then follows the mincing concluſion, that every other ordination is eſteemed <hi>to be at leaſt irregular and defective.</hi> Would not every man imagine from theſe ſoft words, that tho' the writer conceived other ordinations to be, when ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, not preciſely regular, yet that they might nevertheleſs paſs muſter, and the main end be anſwered? But no two points of the compaſs are more directly oppoſed to each other, than ſuch a ſuppoſition to the Doctor's true and real ſentiments. The reaſon is apparent; at preſent the church he belongs to, is ſuppoſed, with the woman in the viſion, to be in a ſtate of perſecution; perſecuted for the want of wealth, pomp and power; perſecuted as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, for the want of wealth, pomp and power
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:010857_0038_0F8524FAC6E532A0"/>to enable her to perſecute others. Without the concurrence of the diſſenters thoſe benefits it ſeems, are not to be expected. In this ſtate a little velvet-mouthed delicacy was thought to be reaſonable and prudent: 'Tis therefore to carnal policy, and not to Chriſtian moderation, this tenderneſs is to be truly aſcribed. The Doctor's creed unchurches all the churches on the continent, except his own, and the church of Quebec. According to that, not one of the miniſters of other denominations, are ſent out by Chriſt to promulge his goſpel; and let my lords the biſhops be once landed and fortified in their palaces, guarded by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, and ſupported by their courts, and inſtead of this coaxing and trimming, we ſhall ſoon hear the thunder of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication uttered with all the confidence and pride of ſecurity. The ſoft bleatings of the lamb, will be changed into the terrible howling of the wolf; and every poor parſon whoſe head never felt the weight of a biſhop's hand, will ſoon know the power of his paſtoral ſtaff, and the arm of the magiſtrate into the bargain.</p>
            <p>If any man doubts my prediction, and fondly preſumes upon the charitable indulgence of eccleſiaſtical clemency, after it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to the power of applying puniſhments at will and pleaſure, which muſt inevitably be the caſe, upon the introduction of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al lords into a country where they will find no lay-men for their match, let him learn wiſdom from hiſtory. Without the knowledge of mankind, it is impoſſible to govern them well. This neceſſary accompliſhment ſeldom falls to the lot of ſpeculative mortals immured in a ſtudy. Hence their conceit, contraction, and obſtinacy. Give the reins to one of theſe book-worms, and he will attempt to drive the chariot of the ſun: let him be an eccleſiaſtic beſides, and impelled by the two irreſiſtible momentums of <hi>the glory of God and the ſalvation of ſouls,</hi> and how can he refrain from adopting the Popiſh comment upon the text, <hi>compel them to come in!</hi> He will compel them with a witneſs. The dignity of the end juſtifies all ſorts of means. Mines and galleys, fire and faggot, pains and penalties, the rack and the croſs, have all been applied inſtead of reaſon and argument; and thus man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind will ever be pilaged and butchered, as often as they are ſubjected to the unbridled power of zealots, who as we ſaid of archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> by the pride of a good conſcience, will be more obſtinately in the wrong.</p>
            <p>There can be no dependence for the continuation of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if ever a lordly clergyman is clothed with ſufficient power to put down all oppoſers. Give him that, and his conſcience will ſet it to work; nay, judging from experience, he will think himſelf conſcience-bound, by the ſword of the ſpirit, to brandiſh
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:010857_0038_0F8524FAC6E532A0"/>for our conviction, a ſort of weapons of a very different nature.</p>
            <p>That the Doctor's principle leads to condemnation of all who deny it, none can diſpute; and however artful the terms in which it is conceived, I have ſtill ſo high an opinion of his veracity, that I will riſk the credit of the aforementioned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, if he does not give an affirmative anſwer to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing queſtion. It is this, and for the information of the ſimple part of the tribunal he appeals to, I challenge a categorical reply to the interrogatory propoſed, <hi>Whether he has not a better opinion of the validity of an ordination performed by the biſhop of Rome, whom ſome Chriſtians ſuppoſe to be the very ſcarlet whore mentioned by St. John, than of any one in which all the clergy of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal churches of Holland and Scotland, ſhould concur?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While this is preparing, or becauſe the Doctor may perhaps be diſinclined to have any correſpondence with an American Whig, I will relieve the impatience of my readers by reminding them of two notable inſtances, which may help their conjectures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the anſwer requeſted. It is not long ſince the Rev. <hi>Monſ. Haudin,</hi> took the paſtoral charge of the epiſcopal church of Trenton, in New-Jerſey, and afterwards that of New-Rochelle, <hi>without any re-ordination;</hi> but before Mr. <hi>Munro</hi> could be qualified to ſerve the chapel of Philipſburgh, he was obliged to make a viſit to the biſhop of London, for his hand and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. What other reaſons can be aſſigned for theſe differences, than that as this <hi>former,</hi> tho' a fugitive from Canada, had prieſtly orders from the Popiſh biſhop of that country, his right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the ordinances of the goſpel was inconteſtibly clear; ſo the latter was inadmiſſible to the chapel, becauſe he had only the defective ordination uſed in the <hi>ſchiſmatical,</hi> or ill diſciplined, tho' <hi>national</hi> and <hi>law-eſtabliſhed</hi> church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following paſſage is another inſtance of the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing prudence: <q>It is, ſaid the appellant, not neceſſary to enter upon a particular defence of this doctrine, in an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of this nature, ſince our preſent plea is EQUALLY valid, whether theſe principles are founded <hi>rightly</hi> or <hi>wrongly:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a <hi>brief ſketch</hi> of the arguments whereby the neceſſity of Epiſcopal government is <hi>defended,</hi> may on this occaſion be not <hi>altogether</hi> uſeleſs or improper.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It being impoſſible, as <hi>the laws now ſtands,</hi> to introduce a biſhop into America, who will not have authority the inſtant he arrives, to ſet up an eccleſiaſtical court, to which all denominations will be equally ſubject; the Doctor's plea can have no validity at all; ſince no man can plead conſcience for a meaſure miſchievous or dangerous to his neighbour. But admitting the validity of this plea, ſurely it muſt at firſt view appear to be a myſterious declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:010857_0039_0F8524FB703727A8"/>that it is equally valid whether the divine right of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy is well or ill grounded. If the doctrine was not thought to be of importance to the grand thing in deſign, why is a whole ſection taken up in an attempt to ſupport it? His words and his conduct certainly have the ſhew of repugnancy, and it may ſerve a good purpoſe to gueſs at the reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſuppoſes a Biſhop to have powers, which no clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in America, <hi>ſave the right reverend father in God, the preſent biſhop of Quebec,</hi> can pretend to. If the generality of the reformed churches are not miſtaken, every preſbyter is a biſhop to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes, in the ſcripture ſenſe of the word. According to this opinion, the Doctor himſelf, and the reſt of his brethren, who are of the order of preſbyters, being in very deed biſhops; the cry ſet up in the Appeal is idle and abſurd; all this appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, intreating, weeping, coaxing, and lamentation, being for a boon already poſſeſſed. It was therefore of vaſt importance to the ſucceſs of the ſcheme he aims at accompliſhing, to convict the American churches of error, in denying the ſuperiority of biſhops above preſbyters; ſince if this could be done, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is undeniable, that every prohibition upon the importation of ſpiritual lords into this country, is nothing leſs than a direct oppoſition to the great head and founder of the Chriſtian church. It is eaſy then to diſcern, not only that the plea is not <hi>equally</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid whether the principle advanced, is founded <hi>"rightly</hi> or <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly."</hi> but the reaſon of aſſertion that it is ſo.</p>
            <p>I am aware of his ſubterfuges, 'tis enough if <hi>we believe the doctrines, and it will be perſecution not to allow us the benefits of this article of our faith.</hi> As a Whig, I am utterly oppoſed to the irrational and execrable practice of puniſhing people for opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in no degree hurtful to civil ſociety, and if the ſcheme which the author of the Appeal ſo ardently eſpouſes, portended no evil to others, I ſhould bid it <hi>good ſpeed.</hi> But after all, as nothing would more effectually advance the favourite project, than the eſtabliſhment of the divine right of epiſcopacy, for an inconteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth; it can never be ſaid that the plea in its behalf is as valid, if that doctrine may be diſproved, as it would be if it triumphed over all poſſible objection; and hence my conjecture that there was a reaſon for the Doctor's aſſertion, not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſimplicity of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>The ſum of the whole matter is this, and I ſubmit it to the impartial conſideration of the public. Apprehenſive that great execution might be done by the pretended <hi>jus divinum</hi> of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, the Doctor advances, and attempts to ſupport it: Aware that the application of the doctrine would ſtartle his countrymen, he affirms the validity of his plea, <hi>independent</hi> of his tenet. Silence upon the ſubject might expoſe him to his ſuperiors; avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:010857_0039_0F8524FB703727A8"/>its conſequences would alarm the people whoſe aſſent is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited. In this dilemma, the doctrine is aſſerted, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences tenderly mentioned. Like a treſpaſſer who means to ſteal a poſſeſſion, he works with haſte and trepidation. He gives and takes back; builds upon the foundation of the divine right of epiſcopacy, and yet treats it as a point of little or no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. He runs ſwiftly through a ſection more important than the reſt with a reference to a dignified author in England, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>le read, and to a humbler one here ſcarce known; does all he can to eſtabliſh his point, and foreſtalls the ſeverity of the application, by roundly aſſerting that the plea is as ſolid without it. After Rat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN your laſt <hi>Journal,</hi> I gave my Countrymen a Word of Caution, againſt what I believe to be a wicked Deſign of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> Whom I take to be <hi>a Snake in the Graſs</hi> a lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy bent upon Miſchief; who under the ſpecious Pretence of Zeal for Religious Liberty, (which no Body pretends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, and which is as dear to Epiſcopalians as to Whigs or any other Denomination whatſoever) would raiſe needleſs Fears, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, Ill-will and Diviſions among us, and thereby divert our Attention from the Dangers that threaten our political Liberty, and the neceſſary Means for its Preſervation. This I believe to be the real and principal Deſign of the Whig, and when I
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010857_0040_0F85250A5D633D38"/>have told my Reaſons for this Opinion, I believe I ſhall not be ſingular in it. But whether I am miſtaken or not, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this Deſign, I am certainly not miſtaken as to the Effects, that, if not check'd and prevented in Time, muſt, whether fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen and intended or not, naturally reſult from its Proſecution: Theſe are Diſaffection, Diſunion and Diſtruſt among ourſelves; our Attention, our Counſels, our Power, will be divided and weaken'd, we ſhall loſe all Confidence in each other, our Enemies will gather Strength from our Weakneſs, and we ſhall have no Power of Reſiſtance left. Let us only, a little, conſider our Situation.</p>
            <p>We <hi>Americans</hi> are a Body of People who claim and poſſeſs ſeveral Rights and Privileges, ſome of which are common to us all, ſome belong to particular Societies of different Sorts, and ſome to Individuals. Before any Diſputes among ourſelves can ariſe concerning theſe Rights, there muſt be ſomething nice and intricate in the Nature of the Caſe, otherwiſe there could be no Diſpute; for how can a Diſpute ariſe about a Matter that is quite plain and ſelf evident? Every ſuch Diſpute therefore neceſſarily occaſions a Diviſion among ourſelves.—and in order to ſettle the Difference between the Parties, we muſt intereſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on both Sides of the Queſtion. While the Matter is in Suſpence, it is not to be expected that every Perſon who hears of, and in ſome Meaſure becomes engaged in it, will fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, or underſtands the Caſe, and act as an impartial Judge. No,—Intereſt, Connection with the Parties, imperfect Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Inattention, Paſſion, Prejudice, &amp;c. in every ſuch internal Diſpute, will divide us into at leaſt three Parties,—one on each Side of the Queſtion, the other, Neuters.</p>
            <p>Now if thoſe Rights that we all poſſeſs in common, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, Common Prudence and Intereſt, direct us to unite in repelling the Invader: But the Rights that we are in Danger of loſing, are common to us all,—of every Denomination,—and we are all equally concerned in their Defence and Preſervation. Common Senſe then, directs us in ſuch a Caſe, to wave all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of private Diſpute among ourſelves, that ſo our whole Force may be collected and exerted in Defence of our Common Intereſt; we may thus eaſily defeat an Enemy, who if we were divided into the different Parties of which we are compoſed, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſubdue us all, one after another. When an Enemy is at Hand that would plunder us all, of our whole Property, is this a Time to diſpute and determine the Difference between our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? When a City is on Fire is it a proper Time to determine the particular Property of the Inhabitants? What then ſhall we think of a Man who manifeſtly labours,—who impertinently introduces every far fetch'd Pretence, who makes uſe of all the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:010857_0040_0F85250A5D633D38"/>Arts of Miſrepreſentation,—caluminates, reviles, abuſes, inſults, and forms Concluſions againſt Probability, againſt Reaſon,— in order to embroil all America, and our Friends in England, in a Diſpute concerning the Reſpective Rights of Churchmen and Preſbyterians? Judge my Countrymen! is this Man a Friend or an Enemy? this <hi>Whig,</hi> in his Advertiſement in Parker's laſt Paper, artfully endeavours to ſcreen himſelf from all Poſſibility of Detection, by raiſing a Suſpicion againſt every Perſon that ſhould write any Thing againſt him. He tells, <hi>the Public to beware of every Writer who while he affects a Zeal for our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Liberties, will not declare his Abhorence of eccleſiaſtical Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi>—That is, every Writer in favour of our Rights, who don't join in the ſame Cry with the <hi>Whig,</hi> and, like the Demon <hi>Anarchy</hi> in Milton, help to promote the Strife, are to be ſuſpected? According to this Rule, the Pennſylvania <hi>Farmer</hi> muſt fall under Suſpicion. I beg the Reader's Attention to the following Tranſcript, from his 12th Letter, the 6th, 7th and 8th Paragraphs.</p>
            <p>["Our <hi>vigilance</hi> and our <hi>union are ſucceſs</hi> and <hi>ſafety.</hi> Our <hi>negligence</hi> and our <hi>diviſion</hi> are <hi>diſtreſs</hi> and <hi>death.</hi> They are <hi>worſe.</hi> They are <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>ſlavery.</hi> Let us equally ſhun the benumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtillneſs of <hi>over weening ſloth,</hi> and the feveriſh activity of that <hi>ill formed zeal,</hi> which buſies itſelf in maintaining <hi>little, mean</hi> and <hi>narrow</hi> opinions. Let us with a truly wiſe <hi>generoſity</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> baniſh and diſcourage all <hi>illiberal diſtinctions,</hi> which may ariſe from differences in ſituation, forms of <hi>Government,</hi> or modes of <hi>religion.</hi> Let us conſider ourſelves as <hi>men—freemen— Chriſtian-freemen—ſeparated from the reſt of the world,</hi> and <hi>firmly bound together</hi> by the <hi>ſame rights, intereſts,</hi> and <hi>dangers.</hi> Let <hi>theſe</hi> keep our attention inflexibly fixed on the <hi>great objects</hi> which we muſt <hi>continually regard,</hi> in order to <hi>preſerve thoſe rights,</hi> to <hi>promote thoſe intereſts,</hi> and to <hi>avert thoſe dangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let theſe <hi>truths</hi> be indelibly impreſſed on our minds—<hi>That we cannot be happy without being free</hi>—that we cannot be free, without being ſecure in our Property,—that we cannot be ſecure in our property, <hi>if without our conſent, others may, as by right take it away</hi>—that <hi>taxes impoſed upon us by Parliament</hi> do thus take it away—that <hi>duties laid for the ſole purpoſe of raiſing money,</hi> are taxes—that attempts to lay ſuch Duties ſhould be inſtantly and firmly oppoſed.—that this oppoſition can never be effectual, <hi>unleſs it is the united effort of theſe provinces</hi>—that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>benevolence of temper towards each other,</hi> and <hi>unanimity of counſels,</hi> are eſſential to the welfare of the whole—and laſtly, that for this reaſon, every man amongſt us, who in any manner would encourage either <hi>diſſention, diffidence,</hi> or <hi>indifference,</hi> between theſe colonies, is an ENEMY to <hi>himſelf</hi> and to his <hi>country.</hi>

               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:010857_0041_0F85250CDD417C98"/>
The belief of theſe truths, I verily think, my countrymen, is indiſpenſably neceſſary to your happineſs. I beſeech you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note n="*" place="bottom">Deuteron. vi. <hi>7.</hi>

            <p>What then muſt we think of the <hi>American Whig?</hi> does he not fall exactly under the Deſcription, is he not the very Man this excellent Writer points out, and cautions us to beware of? [Let the Reader pauſe here, and think, whether the Name would not be much more proper and ſignificant, if inſtead of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> that Author ſhould be ſtiled the <hi>American Peſt,</hi> and treated accordingly.] Indeed it is no Wonder the <hi>Whig</hi> ſhould claſh with the <hi>Farmer,</hi>—their Tempers and Principles are eſſentially different, and the Tendency of their Writings as oppoſite as Light to Darkneſs. If I am not greatly miſtaken, this is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have already declared what I believe to be the true Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Deſign of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> which was my ſole Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for endeavouring to detect, and put my Countryman upon their Guard againſt him. Before I have done with him I believe the Reader will be convinced that my Opinion is well ſupported. He ſeems to triumph in his ſagacious Diſcovery that I have aſſumed a Name to which I have no Right. He has diſcover'd he ſays, that I am not a <hi>Son of Liberty</hi> but a <hi>Tory.</hi> Whether this notable Concluſion does moſt Honour to his <hi>Judgment</hi> or his <hi>Heart</hi> I ſhall not take upon me to determine. However as I ſhall demonſtrate that my Actions have always exactly correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded with the Name I have aſſumed, in the only Senſe in which it was ever in the Eyes of the Public, a reſpectable Name of Diſtinction, every one is at Liberty to judge, whether the Whig's Error proceeded from Want of Penetration, or from Conſciouſneſs—of pretending to one Thing and Meaning another, himſelf, and therefore concluding that I did the ſame.</p>

                  </gap>rther. The canons of your church, Dr. Chandler, do not ſeem to us to breathe a very gentle ſpirit. Your 4th, 5th, and 6th canons ſolemnly denounce, "that whoſoever ſhall affirm, that the form of God's worſhip, contained in the <hi>common prayer</hi> hath any thing in it repugnant to the word of God,—or that any of the 39 <hi>articles</hi> are in any part erroneous, or ſuch as may not with a good conſcience be ſubſcribed, let him be excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and not be reſtored, until he repent and publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his wicked errors." Does not this bear hard on the rights of private judgment, and the indiſpenſible duty of every Chriſtian to examine the Scriptures, "to ſee whether <hi>theſe things</hi> be ſo or not?" In the judgement, of an inſpired apoſtle, the noble Baereans were juſtly commended who ſearched the ſcripture, and by that infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible rule judged of the truth of the doctrines that were preached to them. But the higheſt cenſure of the church is inflicted by the church of England, on the perſon that would preſume to judge for himſelf and pronounce his judgment, if it ſhould happen to be againſt and thing contained in your 39 articles, common prayer and forms of ordination. Yet there are many things therein, acknowledged by your own moſt learned divines, to need alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as is abundantly evident from their <hi>candid diſquiſitions,</hi> &amp;c. And Dr. Chandler himſelf, ſpeaking of ſome of the laws, which relate to the ſpiritual courts, which are imagined to bear hard upon Britiſh liberty, ſays, (page 96) "it is probable that theſe, and all other eccleſiaſtical laws, as well as our liturgy and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic offices, and our tranſlation of the bible, will be reviewed, as ſoon as it ſhall be thought that there is good ſenſe and candour enough in the body of the nation to admit of it." It is indeed pleaſantly ridiculous to ſee the moſt zealous advocates of the church of England, and her brighteſt ornaments excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> by the gentle, peaceable ſpirit of their own church, merely for confeſſing what all the Chriſtian churches, as well as themſelves, know to be true, that there are many things in their church that need reformation and amendment. By the force of theſe canons, the Dr. himſelf is really an excommunicated perſon, if we can believe the learned primate Dr. Wake, who
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:010857_0042_0F85250D6FF6F610"/>ſays, concerning an excommunication <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>See app. in behalf of the King's Supremacy. p. 22.</p>
               <p>If theſe canons do not breathe a perſecuting ſpirit againſt the rejectors of epiſcopacy—I am ſure they breathe a very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpirit againſt the moſt valuable members of that church, who would willingly wipe off at leaſt ſome part of that reproach, which they are ſenſible has laid heavily upon her ever ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. You know reverend Doctor, that the rejectors of your form of church government, have been calling upon your church to reform many things, ſome of which the beſt men among yourſelves have confeſſed to need reformation, for more than a century paſt; and is there not yet good ſenſe and candour enough in the body of your national church, to admit of ſuch a reformation? "If this is the complection of your church, what muſt we expect from the plenary eſtabliſhment of ſuch a church among us, as has not good ſenſe and candour enough in the body of it, to admit of the removal of ſuch things as have been juſtly complained of ſo long a time, as an unrighteous perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their brethren, and even unchriſtian violation of the rights of conſcience and private judgment? The Doctor's conjecture, that "it is probable, that there will be a reformation in ſome things in his church." gives us but very ſlender encouragement to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his American epiſcopate; when we know it is at beſt juſt as probable that there will be no reformation in that church, which has ſo long continued to perſecute her brethren, and yet has not good ſenſe enough in the body of it, to remove the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. We rather conclude, that as ſhe has encroached ſo long on the rights of conſcience, and oppreſſed her fellow Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, where ſhe has the power in her hands, ſhe would continue to give ſenſible proofs of the ſame peaceable and gentle ſpirit in America, if ſhe was clothed with the ſame civil and eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical authority. When ſhe has given ſome ſubſtantial proofs of her moderation, by reſtoring her fellow Chriſtians to the full enjoyment of their civil and religious liberties, and by abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the penal laws which oppreſs their conſciences, we promiſe them we ſhall entertain fewer jealouſies of the exorbitant power of her biſhops being exerciſed in the colonies.</p>
               <p>Pray, is it an equal thing that all denominations of Chriſtians, ſhould be taxed for the ſupport of epiſcopal miniſters in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces ſouth of Pennſylvania; eſpecially when we conſider, that
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:010857_0042_0F85250D6FF6F610"/>thereby ſome miniſters of that communion, are enabled to revel in luxury and wantonneſs, who, as Dr. Chandler expreſſes it, "are ſuch wretches as are not only a ſcandal to the church, but alſo a diſgrace to the human ſpicies?—Muſt not this be a grief and a burden to ſuch Chriſtians as have any regard to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Redeemer's kngdom? And muſt it not be peculiarly grievous to other denominations, to ſupport a church in which the pure worſhip of God is corrupted and obſcured with human inventions, while they "teach for doctrines the commandments of men?" Pray Dr. would you not think it an unrighteous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, if the members of your church were taxed for the ſupport of the church of Rome? I can ſafely appeal to your own conſcience, whether you would not think it ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all your fond partiality for her, which leads you in a very Chriſtian-like manner to unchriſtianize the foreign proteſtant churches, with the church of Scotland and the Diſſenters in England, in order to ſecure to yourſelves the unenvied treaſure of an <hi>uninterrupted ſucceſſion?</hi>—Remove therefore this inſtance of oppreſſion out of your church, and ſhew us that you have as much moderation as the churches eſtabliſhed in New-England, who oblige no different denominations to pay to the ſupport of their clergy, but every one ſupports its own. Believe me, Dr. had your clergy united together in addreſſes to your ſuperiors at home, to obtain a deliverance for the rejectors of epiſcopacy in the Southern colonies, from this yoke of bondage laid on them for the ſupport of your church; you had given a more ſubſtantial proof of your moderation, and regard to the rights of your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſtians, than you have lately done in your application for an American epiſcopate. Do you expect we can lay aſide all jealouſy of a church, which we ſee oppreſſing all others both in England and in the colonies in ſuch flagrant inſtances; regardleſs of the rights of reaſon and conſcience, where ſhe has the power to oppreſs; or that we can peaceably ſubmit to a ſcheme, which threatens us with a ſtill farther loſs of our civil and religious liberties.</p>
               <p>Thus we have examined the peaceable and gentle ſpirit of the Engliſh epiſcopal church, and ſtill find in her the mournful relicks of her ancient perſecuting ſpirit, and from thence conclude, that neither her ſpirit nor that of the times are ſo much mended, as to pave the way for an eaſy and ſafe introduction of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Hierarchy, among thoſe whoſe anceſtors abandoned their native country, and all the tender endearments of relations and friends, to eſcape her eccleſiaſtical rage and perſecution.—Nor is the ſpirit of her biſhops ſo much mended, as Dr. Chandler would perſuade us. Did not almoſt all the biſhops in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vote againſt the repeal of the ſtamp-act, and uſe their
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:010857_0043_0F85250E22247A80"/>influence to rivet the ſhackles on the colonies which our enemies had formed? Can we then, expect that thoſe, that are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the property and civil liberties of their fellow ſubjects, would be tender of the rights of conſcience; or that choſe who ſo lately manifeſted a diſpoſition to enſlave us in one inſtance, would not alſo oppreſs us in another?</p>
               <p>But this is not the only indication of their preſent peaceable and gentle ſpirit. The epiſcopal congregation in New-York is eſtabliſhed by the law, and incorporated; when the Preſbyterians there applied lately for a charter, did not the biſhop of London appear againſt them, and uſe his utmoſt endeavours to render their application fruitleſs and ineffectual? with what pretext then can the epiſcopalians complain that they do not enjoy the ſame privileges with other denominations of Chriſtians in the colonies; when themſelves think it no injuſtice, to prevent others from obtaining the ſame privileges with themſelves? Nor this is not all, the legiſlature of the province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, moved with pity and compaſſion for the poor ſavages in America, who continue in deplorable ignorance, of the way of ſalvation through a Redeemer, lately by act of aſſembly erected a ſociety in Boſton, to ſpread the goſpel through theſe benighted tribes; when this law went home for the royal approbation, the pious Archbiſhop of Canterbury appeared in perſon, and made uſe of his extenſive influence to have it repealed. Why ſhould the higheſt dignitary in the church of England, oppoſe ſo well meant a deſign for the converſion of the Heathens? What have theſe poor wretches done to deſerve ſo heavy a ſtroke from his Grace? Was he afraid that the known zeal of the clergy and ſociety of Boſton would engage with vigour in carrying ſo good a work into execution, and thereby bring a reproach upon a ſociety in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land erected for the ſame purpoſe, who, for more than half a century paſt, have been ſquandering away large ſums of money, collected for the relief of thoſe ſavages, in the ſupport of a body of miſſionaries, whoſe uſual feats are ſome few converſions from other denominations of Chriſtians to their communions? His Grace can beſt tell what were his motives to this conduct; but at preſent it muſt appear very ſtrange to us at this diſtance, that his Grace ſhould have ſo little compaſſion for the ſouls of thoſe poor out-caſts of the human ſpecies; ſo little zeal for the promotion of Chriſtianity, that he would rather ſuffer the Heathen tribes behind us, to continue in their deplorable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance without God in the world, and ſtrangers to the covenant of promiſe, than that they ſhould be inſtructed in the doctrines of the goſpel, by proteſtants of a different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:010857_0043_0F85250E22247A80"/>
You will excuſe me, Dr. Chandler, that I preſume to think you alſo have imbibed a ſmall portion of the ſpirit, which ſeems to have influenced your charitable primate, and that, though the times are mended, you have yet no great abhorence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; for in pa. 31 you lament, that <q>Excommunication; however it was dreaded in the pureſt ages of Chriſtianity, has loſt much of its force in this, wherein altars are ſet up againſt altars, and churches againſt churches, and thoſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by one may be received by another; a diſpoſition to ſlight the higheſt puniſhment, which the church can inflict, has become general, and there appears to be no remedy, but <hi>in the uſe</hi> of reaſon and perſuaſion.</q> A lamentable caſe truly! that your church has loſt her diſcipline, and that there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> way to reſtore it but by reaſon and perſuaſion! What a pity is it that the penal laws formerly executed in England and Ireland againſt Diſſenters, are not in force in America; and that <hi>ſpiritual courts,</hi> aided by the <hi>ſecular arm,</hi> are not introduced to reſtore primitive diſcipline! Then might we ſee ſome more ſucceſs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the good Doctor's labours, among the <hi>Heathen</hi> in and about Elizabeth-Town; and refractory Quakers, Baptiſts and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, who never claimed any relation to the CHURCH, ſolemnly caſt out of it, and brought to <hi>due</hi> obedience, by fines, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and outlawry. Then, indeed, might there be ſome good proſpect, <q>that the word of God would mightily grow and prevail in</q> New-Jerſey, &amp;c. as well as "New-England, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the liturgy of the church of England.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that neither the ſpirit of your church, nor of her biſhops and clergy, nor of the times, if we believe Dr. Chandler, is ſo much mended as to free us from fears of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon the introduction of an American epiſcopate.</p>

               <p>I intimated in my firſt Paper, that I did not intend to confine myſelf to the ſervile Buſineſs of animadverting regularly upon every dull Eſſay that the <hi>American Whig</hi> ſhould obtrude upon us: But ſuch of his Performances as deſerve it, ſhall From Time to Time, have ſuch Notice taken of them as either their Merits or Demerits ſhall demand. For the preſent, I beg the Reader's Attention to the two following Pieces which were left at the Printer's for <hi>my</hi> Uſe, and which I hope, as they are calculated to ſerve the Cauſe of Truth, will be acceptable to the Public.</p>
               <p>EVERY careful Obſerver who hath refided any Number of Years in this Colony, muſt undoubtedly have remarked the Conduct of a certain unrelenting, perſecuting, begotted Faction, towards the CHURCH and the CLERGY. They firſt <hi>open'd</hi> with the <hi>Independent Reflector;</hi> A Paper chiefly pilfered from the hireling, republican, deiſtical Writers of this and the laſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. Their Succeſs was equal to their Deſerts. Their next Attack was from the <hi>Watch-Tower.</hi> This was more furious and worſe conducted than the other. They loſt all Patience, as they loſt all that they were <hi>contending</hi> for: And it was hoped that they had <hi>fallen</hi>—never to riſe again. For after this the CHURCH enjoyed ſome Reſpite from their Perſecutions, and <hi>poſſibly</hi> might yet have lived in Peace, had not the Ambition of the Faction met with ſome equally unexpected and mortifying Diſappointments; which together with the diſtant Proſpect of an American Epiſcopate, promiſing ſome Advantages to the CHURCH and RELIGION, fired their Envy, and put their Rancour into a Ferment. As theſe Writers have now ſerved two Apprenticeſhips in Slander and Defamation, we can be at no loſs to aſcertain what Treatment <hi>honeſt</hi> Men are to expect from ſuch malevolent Spirits.</p>
               <p>The Attack was begun by the <hi>American Whig,</hi> with a <hi>Triple Diſcharge</hi> of <hi>Falſhood, Malice</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> (true Independent Artillery!) againſt the CHURCH and the CLERGY; In order to hinder her from receiving the full Benefit of her religious Eſtabliſhment, to which, by all the Laws of God and Man, ſhe is inconteſtably entitled. The Pretence for this Aſſault is Dr.

                  <hi>Chandler's Appeal to the Public.</hi>—a Book which, even the Enemies of the CHURCH muſt confeſs, is written with the greateſt Candour and Modeſty; and as the <hi>American Whig</hi> himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, <hi>aſks nothing but what is reaſonable and juſt.</hi> One Section however, ſeems to be wanting, to render the Dr's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance <hi>unexceptionable,</hi> viz. a Section to prove, That the eſtabliſhing of Biſhops in <hi>America,</hi> would be of no SERVICE to to the CHURCH of <hi>England.</hi> Had it been poſſible to have done this, and had this been done, with the ſame Force of Argument, and Perſpicuity of reaſoning, with which the whole Book is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not <hi>a Dog had moved his Tongue againſt it.</hi> But, leſt the CHURCH, which by the mere <hi>native</hi> Force of Truth, hath ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zingly increaſed, eſpecially in <hi>New-England,</hi> where it has always laboured under the greateſt Oppreſſion;—and which, from the Number and Reputation of its Members in this Province, eſpecially in the Capital, is really venerable, and commands Reſpect; ſo as to be able to check the <hi>luſtful Thirſt of Power,</hi> for which the Ringleaders of the Independent Faction have ever been infamous, from the Day in which the Cockatrice firſt emerged from the Egg, 'till this preſent Moment:—leſt, I ſay, the CHURCH ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo great a Bleſſing as the Enjoyment of her religious Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;—leſt ſhe ſhould be put upon an equal Footing with the other religious Denominations in the Colonies, and be made as perfect and complete in <hi>her</hi> Way, as they are in <hi>theirs,</hi>—every Art is to be uſed, that <hi>Falſhood</hi> can invent, that <hi>Malice</hi> can inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, or <hi>Revenge</hi> can execute.</p>
               <p>Not content with the moſt ample Toleration,—which inviolably ſecures to them the full and peaceable Enjoyment, not only of all their religious <hi>Liberties,</hi> but alſo of all their religious <hi>Whims</hi> and <hi>Vagaries,</hi>—they continually graſp at Power; are always ſtriving <hi>to be the greateſt in the Kingdom of—England;</hi> more eſpecially in the King of <hi>England's</hi> American Dominions. And if the CHURCH has the patriotic Reſolution, to oppoſe theſe lordly Saints, and check their <hi>native</hi> Luſt of Domination,—which by God's Grace, ſhe ever has had, and I truſt in his Goodneſs, ſhe ever <hi>will</hi> have;—all Obligations of Reſpect and Gratitude, of Decency and good Manners, of Truth and Honour, are immediately broke thro', being of too <hi>flimſy</hi> a Texture to hold an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when diſappointed of his Prey.</p>
               <p>One probable Reaſon of the preſent Clamour is, that the Heads of the Faction have been diſappointed in the Iſſue of a late Election; when, by a well-timed Oppoſition of the moſt reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inhabitants of this City, their ambitious and inſidious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns were defeated; and, as the <hi>greateſt</hi> Oppoſition came from the Members of the CHURCH, ſo the CHURCH muſt bear the firſt Fury of their Revenge.</p>

                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:010857_0045_0F85250FAF222D68"/>
Another Reaſon is, that theſe ſame <hi>Sons of Diſcontent,</hi> have from true Principles of ſound Policy, met with a Repulſe in their Application for a Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>er; (of Eſtabliſhment, "we are told:")—and as it would hardly bear to vent their Spleen immediately againſt his M—y, yet his M—y's <hi>Religion</hi> they preſumed, might ſafely be attacked, and afford them ample <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the grand Reaſon of the Attack upon the Epiſcopal Order, is, that the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (as they ſay) appeared againſt their Charter at the Board of Trade; where, like an HONEST MAN, a worthy Patriot, and a conſcientious Prelate, he ſupported the Rights of the ESTABLISHED CHURCH.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons that very CHURCH, to which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for their TOLERATION, is to be painted in the moſt odious Colours, that Falſhood can Invent, or Malace dictate; and the <hi>venerable, primitive,</hi> APOSTOLICAL Order of Biſhops, (without whoſe Conſent the Act of Toleration could not have paſſed)—which was ever held ſacred, even by Hereticks and Schiſmatics,—'till Faction, and Enthuſiaſm, produced this new Sect, this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Yeſterday,</hi> this <hi>motly Mixture</hi> of Ignorance and Pride, Hypocriſy and Superſtition: This ſacred Order, I ſay, is to be deſcribed with all the vile Epithets, that the moſt envenom'd Malice could ſuggeſt, or the moſt flatulent Fuſtian could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. But why it ſhould be a Mark of Reproach to the Engliſh Biſhops, that they are <hi>court-favoured,</hi> and <hi>law-dignified,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive. I rather think the <hi>American Whig</hi> intended by thoſe Epithets, to hint to his <hi>gentle Readers,</hi> the great Bigotry, Profaneneſs, and Impiety, of the K—, the Court, and the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> in giving their Countenance and Protection to <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant Biſhops.</hi> That it is the introduction of <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant Biſhops</hi> only, in the Colonies that they oppoſe, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Conſideration,—that a <hi>Popiſh Biſhop</hi> is fixed at <hi>Quebec,</hi> and <hi>Moravian Biſhops</hi> have been in this and many other Provinces, without giving any Offence to theſe <hi>Antiapoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi> Oppoſers of Epiſcopacy. But talk of an <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant Biſhop's</hi> reſiding in the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant Colonies,</hi> for the <hi>ſole</hi> Purpoſes of <hi>ordaining</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>confirming</hi> ſuch as are ſo attached to the <hi>primitive Chriſtian Church,</hi> as to deſire to receive that <hi>Apoſtolical Rite;</hi> and <hi>ſuch a Biſhop,</hi> ſent for <hi>ſuch Purpoſes,</hi> and for <hi>ſuch Purpoſes only,</hi> is ranked with Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions upon Trade; is declared to be worſe than the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi>—the worſt Commodity that can be imported; and that his Introduction muſt prove <hi>the abſolute, inevitable Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Ruin of this Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Whatever Arts theſe <hi>Sowers of the Seeds of public Diſcord,</hi> may make uſe of, to inveigle the other religious Denominations, to join them againſt the CHURCH; the other Denominations—
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:010857_0045_0F85250FAF222D68"/>all of whom, as far as I perceive, live quietly and peaceably under the preſent Religious Eſtabliſhment,—will, I truſt, ſee and purſue their true Intereſt; and conſider the CHURCH as in Truth ſhe is, their grand Security againſt Independent <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> For I dare pronounce it, That ſhould God, for the Puniſhment of our Sins, ever give up the preſent happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, into the Hands of that perſecuting Faction, no one re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligious Denomination would enjoy the leaſt <hi>Toleration</hi> from <hi>them;</hi> but like the poor, harmleſs, inoffenſive Quakers in <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts,</hi> muſt be content—to be HANGED for their Religion.</p>

                  <p>NO Proteſtants have ever given the Government ſo much Trouble, nor ſhewn ſuch fixed and Rooted Enmity to the eſtabliſhed Church, as that Denomination called Preſbyterians:—Whether this ariſes from real zeal for the Cauſe of Chriſtanity or any other Motive, may be an Inquiry.—At preſent, I will paſs over every Thing that hath happened on the other Side the Atlantic, and only take a View of them upon, and ſince their Settlement on this Continent.—in Britain, they were ever calling out for Toleration and claimed it as a Right. Upon their Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in America, their Spirit of Perſecution broke out in full Blaze; and no ſooner had they the Power, than every Denomination, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Quakers, very ſenſibly felt, that this Sect of Men, have little other "Grace than what is founded in Dominion." While other Denominations have contented themſelves, with the free Exerciſe of their Religion, and an equal Share in the Offices of Government, this Reſtleſs Sect has in every Colony either at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, or actually ſeized all Power, and ſhewn an equal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to tyrannize over all others; to root out not only the eſtabliſhed Religion, but every others Denomination from theſe Colonies.—Hardly a Colony on the Continent, but has groaned under their Tyranny, or been agitated by violent Parties fomented by theſe People, to advance and procure their favourite Point, Dominion.—The eaſtern Governments are a Proof of the firſt, and the Parties in New-York and Pennſylvania, are recent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the latter.—But ſenſible, that their darling Point can never be attained, while the Church, as by law eſtabliſhed ſtands in their Way, they have ever paid their greateſt Attention to prevent its Increaſe.—How have they calumniated her Miniſters, and ridiculed her Ceremonies from Time to Time, as beſt ſuited their Purpoſes? And when ſhe aſks, only equal Toleration on this Continent with them, their Pens are employed to alarm the People that ſome Encroachment is intended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their religious Liberties; and according to the Candor of theſe Men, every Story, whether true or falſe, we may expect to ſee revived, and new ones propagated, to prevent that Church from being able to ſtem them in their Career to Power, and
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:010857_0046_0F85251063B8A740"/>hinder them from aſſuming Dominion over all others. During a late Adminiſtration, the Province of New-Jerſey, ſaw and felt the Effects of Preſbyterian Power; her ſeats of Juſtice, &amp;c. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of the Peace, were preferably conferred upon them; their Meeting houſes, which now they affect to call Churches, were every where incorporated, while Charters were denied, not only to Churches, as by Law eſtabliſhed, but to other Diſſenters, who had equal Right with Preſbyterians.—The Inſtances of their Luſt for Power, and uncharitable Treatment of thoſe who differ from them in Opinion, are notorious every where; nor have they ever ſhewn a Zeal for Religion, or a charitable Diſpoſition to their fellow Chriſtians, but when it ſuited their Purpoſes and favoured their darling Scheme.—At this Time, when Peace and Chriſtian Charity ſhould moſt abound among us, that Spirit again raiſes its Head, aims to throw the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient into Confuſion, and "ſow the Seeds of Diſcord," to prevent the Church from having its Government fully and freely enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that too after the Church has, for many Months laid before all Denominations, in an honeſt Appeal, the Difficulties ſhe labours under, and the Means ſhe propoſes to procure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; which is in a Manner, that can give no one Sect any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Cauſe of Oſſence: Nay, it hath been repeatedly acknowledged, by ſome of the beſt of them, to be a Meaſure which they cannot diſapprove of; and what the <hi>American Whig</hi> owns to be "highly reaſonable." But it then ſuited their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics to be ſilent; it now ſuits their Purpoſe to kick up a Duſt, and inflame and divide all Men as much as poſſible.—All other Diſſenters need not be told, that in the Ruin of the CHURCH will be involved the Ruin of them all, excepting the Preſbyterians: And as they have never experienced, nor can from any Thing propoſed in the Appeal, entertain a Doubt that the Church intends the leaſt Injury to the religious or civil Rights of any Diſſenters; ſo, I hope they will not be led away by the Arts and Inſinuations of theſe Men, to join in a Cry raiſed only to prevent the Profeſſors of the Church of England, from enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like Freedom in Church Government with Diſſenters,—but will attend to their Reaſonings, if happily any may be found in their Publications, and not permit Witticiſms, or Inſinuations unſupported by good Authority, to beguile their Underſtandings; and if then they diſcover, that the Church meditates any Thing againſt their civil or religious Liberties, it will be their Duty to prevent it: But, if, on the other Hand, it ſhall be found, that ſhe hath no ſuch Intentions, Chriſtian Charity muſt induce them, not to deny her equal Toleration with themſelves.</p>

               <p>THE ſaid Appellees by proteſtation, not confeſſing or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging all, or any of the matters in the Appellant's ſaid Appeal contained, to be true, in ſuch manner and form as the ſame are therein ſet forth and charged; theſe Appellees for plea to ſo much thereof as claims a divine right to epiſcopacy, for, and in behalf of the Engliſh biſhops, theſe Appellees ſay, that in the year of our lord 1533, the nation being tired of the exorbitant claims of the clergy; and their ill-gotten wealth, as well as ill-uſed power, being grown intolerable to mankind, it was by a certain act of Parliament of our ſovereign lord King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth, late King of <hi>England,</hi> began and held at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on the 15th day of <hi>January,</hi> in the year laſt above ſaid, and thence continued until the 30th day of <hi>March,</hi> then next enſuing, declared and enacted, that the clergy of the realm of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall never from thence forth preſume to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, alledge, claim, or put in uſe, or enact, promulge, or proſecute any new cannons, conſtitutions ordinance provincial, or other without the King's licence.</p>
               <p>And theſe Appellees for plea farther ſay, that in the ſame ſeſſion of parliament, the manner of proceeding upon the <hi>conge d'lire,</hi> is directed, that is to ſay, a licence from the crown is to be
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:010857_0047_0F85251120BF9350"/>ſent to the chapter, to chooſe or elect an arch biſhop or biſhop, and a letter miſſive with it, to nominate the perſon whom they are to chooſe, which if they do not obey, nor ſignify the ſame according to the tenor of the act within twenty days, they are ſubject to a proemunire; and if the election be not made within twelve days, the King may nominate a biſhop by letters patent, without any election at all.</p>
               <p>And theſe Appellees do farther ſay, that by another act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made in the 26th year of the ſame reign, reciting, that the King juſtly and rightly is, and ought to be, ſupreme head of the church of <hi>England,</hi> the ſame is enacted into a law, and that he ſhall have full power to viſit, redreſs, reform, correct, and reſtrain all errors, hereſies, abuſes, offences, contempts, and enormities, whatſoever they be, which by any manner of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al juriſdiction ought, or may be reformed, redreſſed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And theſe Appellees farther ſay, that by another act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made in the 37th year of the ſame reign, reciting, that archbiſhops, biſhops, or arch-deacons, and other eccleſiaſtical perſons, have no manner of juridiction eccleſiaſtical, but by, from, and under the King's majeſty; it is enacted, that laymen qualified as the law appoints may exerciſe all parts of eccleſiaſtical juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and all cenſures, coercions, appertaining, or in any wiſe belonging thereunto.</p>
               <p>And theſe Appellees farther ſay, that by another act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made in the firſt year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it is enacted, that all Juriſdiction, privileges, ſuperiorities, and pre-eminence ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical, at any time lawfully uſed, or received, for the viſitation of the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, or perſons, and for the reformation, order, and correction of the ſame, and of all manner of errors, hereſies, ſchiſms, abuſes, contempts, offences, and enormities, ſhall be annexed to the imperial crown of the realm. Wherefore, theſe Appellees do ſay, that there is no other right of epiſcopacy within the realm of <hi>England,</hi> than what is derived thereunto by human laws, and that all claim or pretence to any <hi>divine right</hi> of epiſcopacy by any of the Engliſh clergy, (who have ſworn to the aforeſaid acts, and are ſubject to a proemunire, if they contradict them) is as abſurd, illegal, and nugatory as <hi>the divine right of geography.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe Appellees farther ſay, that they are adviſed by their counſel, that there is no matter or thing in the ſaid Appeal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, good and ſufficient in the law, to call them in queſtion in a plea of equity before the tribunal of the publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, but that there is good cauſe of demurrer thereto, and for cauſe of demurrer they ſay,</p>
               <p>Firſt. That the Appellant's ſaid Appeal (in caſe the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein contained were true, which they do in no ſort admit) contains not any matter of equity whereon the people can ground
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:010857_0048_0F852511F87A6790"/>any decree, or give the Appellant any relief, remedy, or aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but that the ſame is properly, and only cognizable before the parliament of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. For that it appears by the Appellant's own ſhewing, that he claims, or pretends title in behalf of the biſhops, to one full and equal tenth part (the whole into ten equal parts to be divided) of the premiſes in the Appeal mentioned, that is to ſay, of all the lands in <hi>North-America,</hi> as perſons next in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in tail under a deviſe of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the ſaid Appeal mentioned and ſet forth, (or in lieu thereof, by way of a <hi>modus decimandi</hi> to a pecuniary tax to be laid on his Majeſty's liege ſubjects in <hi>America,</hi> by the reſpective legiſlatures of the colonies, as ſoon as the ſaid legiſtatures ſhall be ſufficiently ſwayed by prieſtly influence to commit ſo great an iniquity,) which theſe Appellees are adviſed is a matter merely triable at law, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, he may ſufficiently aſcertain their title by ejectment or ejectments to be brought at law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. For that the Appellant hath made a profert of all the negroes in the Weſt-Indies, whoſe teſtimony cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in evidence, barely on their being <hi>virtual churchmen,</hi> while they continue, as it appears by his own ſhewing that they do, in a ſtate of <hi>heatheniſm</hi> and <hi>infidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly. For that the Appellant propoſes a <hi>harmleſs biſhop,</hi> which theſe Appellees are adviſed is a thing not known in the law.</p>
               <p>Fifthly. For that it appears by the Appellant's own ſhewing, that he claims title to the ſaid tenth part of the premiſes in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as agent or attorney to the ſaid biſhops, by virtue of the <hi>uninterrupted ſucceſſion;</hi> and thereby deduces their title through the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who by the laws of the land, as theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellees are adviſed, cannot be ſeized of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments within his Majeſty's dominions in <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly. For that the Appellees are charged in the ſaid Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal with <hi>blowing the trumpet of ſedition;</hi> and they ought not to be compelled to diſcover, or ſet forth any matters, whereby they may impeach or accuſe themſelves of any crime, for which they may ſuffer corporal puniſhment, or be grievouſly fined.</p>
               <p>Seventhly. For that the appellant has appealed to the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Appellees, and by the law of the land no perſons can be judges of their own cauſe; but if the Appellant will never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs inſiſt on having the cauſe determined by them, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge and decree, againſt him, and do order and decree, that no biſhop do preſume to ſet his foot on the continent of <hi>North-Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> on pretence of exerciſing his function on the ſame; and do farther order the Appellant's ſaid Appeal to be diſmiſſed with coſts of ſuit. And.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:010857_0048_0F852511F87A6790"/>
Laſtly. For that the Appellant hath only made profert of part of a certain inſtrument in ſupport of his title, pretended to be executed by the right reverend father in God, <hi>John,</hi> lord biſhop of <hi>Landaff;</hi> when by the rules of law, he ought to have proffered the whole, that the court might be able to judge, whether by ſome precedent or ſubſequent clauſe therein, the ſame is not null and void, by reaſon of ſundry defects, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and untruths, which theſe Appellees have heard, and do believe is really the caſe. And therefore, and for divers other good cauſes of demurrer, in the ſaid Appellant's ſaid Appeal of his own ſhewing, appearing, theſe Appellees as to ſo much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, do demur, and do demand judgment of the court, whether they, or any of them ought, or ſhall be compelled to make any anſwer thereto, other, or otherwiſe than as herein after followeth; and for anſwer to ſuch part of the ſaid Appeal as is not pleaded and demurred unto, they ſay, for anſwer to ſo much thereof as is to compel them to ſet forth and diſcover their approbation, or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Appellant's propoſal, of importing one or more biſhop or biſhops, into the American colonies; that they do utterly diſapprove thereof, and will by all lawful ways and means in their power, let, hinder, moleſt, interrupt, diſturb, obſtruct, gain-ſay, gain-write, gain-reaſon, expoſe, defeat, refute, impede, repel, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn, reſiſt, repulſe, oppoſe, and contravene, the ſame. And as to ſo much of the ſaid Appeal as ſets forth, that the Appellant did not intend to keep the matter a ſecret, theſe Appellees do ſay, that the Appellant and his aſſociates, commonly called, and known by the name of the convention, did, and each, and every of them, did endeavour to keep the ſame ſecret, privy, opake, covert, and occult; and have expreſly denied the ſame, until it was caſually diſcovered, by reaſon of ſundry and divers petitions, by them indited and tranſmitted to that part of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> called <hi>England;</hi> which ſaid petitions, as theſe Appellees have heard, and do verily believe, did contain manifold untruths, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, aſperſion, reflections, miſrepreſentations, defamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, prevarications, evaſions, tergiverſations, villifications, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, ſophiſtications, twiſtifications and conundrums. And theſe Appellees further anſwering, do deny, that any of them have ever perſecuted the church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> or that ſhe has ever been to the knowledge of theſe Appellees perſecuted by any other perſon or perſons whatſoever; but that on the contrary, they have heard, and hope to be able to prove, that ſhe appeareth more like a church <hi>triumphant,</hi> than a church <hi>militant;</hi> and all that ever they have, or do intend to deviſe and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt her, was and ſhall be, only <hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> that ſhe ſhall not alſo become a church <hi>rampant</hi> and <hi>gubernant;</hi> which they are adviſed is well lawful for them to do. And theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellees do deny, that they, or any of them, now have, or hath,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:010857_0049_0F852513B026A900"/>or have ever had in his or their poſſeſſion, the ſaid pretended laſt will or teſtament of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whereby the tenth, or any other part of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of his Majeſty's loyal ſubjects in <hi>America,</hi> is deviſed in tail to any biſhop or biſhops: nor do they believe that he ever made or executed any ſuch laſt will and teſtament; or if he did, that any lands or tenements did, or could paſs by the ſame; becauſe they have heard, and hope to prove, that if he was ever ſeized of any lands or tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by right apoſtolic, he was ſeized thereof as joint-tenant with eleven other perſons, of whom St. <hi>John</hi> was the ſurvivor, from whom the Appellant has not deduced any right or title whatſoever. And they do further deny, that they or either of them, now have, or hath, or have ever had, the ſaid charter of the <hi>uninterrupted ſucceſſion,</hi> in the ſaid Appeal mentioned; nor do they, or any of them, claim any intereſt or title in, or to the ſaid premiſes, from under the ſame. And theſe Appellees do ſay, that they hope to prove, that the ſaid Appeal is not exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be relieved againſt any real grievance or oppreſſion, but for the aggrandizement and exaltation of the epiſcopal churches, on the ruin of all other Chriſtian denominations in his Majeſty's American dominions; and that this ſuit is not proſecuted by any number of the members of the ſaid churches, but at the ſpecial inſtance and requeſt, and at the proper coſts and charges of the ſaid Convention, who not having the peace and tranquility of theſe colonies before their eyes, but being moved and inſtigated with an inordinate luſt of eccleſiaſtical power, have retained the Appellant to inſtitute the ſaid Appeal, with intent and purpoſe to ſubject this flouriſhing country to prieſtly dominion, and the power of high-church; and that the ſaid Convention have cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, and unneceſſarily, and not only without, but againſt the leave, conſent, and approbation of their reſpective churches, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the ſaid Appeal, to vex and trouble the Appellees, and to put them to unneceſſary charges in the law; of which theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellees hope the court will take due conſideration, and conſider the ſame in coſts, Without that. &amp;c.</p>

                  <salute>MY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Thus addreſs, you as well as Mr. Whig, becauſe I beg you will believe, as the truth is, that our country, its people and liberties, are as dear to us of the church, as they can be to any of our neighbours.—It is but too evident, from the furious and declamatory manner in which the American Whig writes, that he has no notion of attending to the real merits of the cauſe; it therefore greatly concerns you, to be much upon your guard againſt him; for he is certainly a man of too much ſenſe, not to know that he is miſerably trying to impoſe upon his dear country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as all his wild talk is quite beſide the queſtion, and aims only at raiſing a ſpirit of venom and bitterneſs towards his neighbours, that are of the church.</p>
               <p>This is evident from his pretended hiſtory of high-church and low-church, N. III. by which he would have it believed, that we being high-church, are little better than papiſts in diſguiſe, and aim at ſetting up a ſpiritual tyranny in the country; than which, nothing can be more falſe and groundleſs. But the truth of the matter is this, that thoſe who were called high-church, were <hi>Jacobites,</hi> or diſaffected to the preſent Royal family; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we can defy the Whig to produce among us one inſtance or ſymptom of the leaſt diſaffection to that dear prince, our preſent moſt gracious ſovereign King George the III, whom we do know to be a friend to us and our cauſe So that the only diſtinction that can be here, is between thoſe that are intemperately and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently zealous for the church, (if ſuch there be) and thoſe who are of a moderate and Chriſtian temper, tho' ſeriouſly zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in its cauſe, and ſuch Dr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> and the reſt of us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be. In this ſenſe, there are alſo high and low-preſbyterians, as well as churchmen. Of the high ſort, are thoſe that are furiouſly and venomouſly zealous, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Whig.</hi> The low preſbyterians are of a moderate and charitable temper towards the church. Of ſuch I know a great many, (I hope they are much the majority,) with whom I live in good neighbourhood and friendſhip, and who declare to me they think Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> is in the right, and that it is moſt reaſonable that the church ſhould have biſhops, as well as they their way.</p>

But ſays the <hi>Whig</hi> N. IV, with biſhops, there muſt needs come in ſpiritual courts, &amp;c. I anſwer there is no neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between them: It is the ſtate, and not the church, that has made that ſettlement; and without the ſtate no ſuch ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be made here; which therefore never will, nor can be. But pray my dear countrymen, how is it poſſible to quiet and ſatisfy ſuch a ſuſpicious and unreaſonable mortal? We do ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declare, as the truth is, that we do not deſire any ſpiritual courts relating to any of thoſe matters he mentions; we are as much againſt them as any of our neighbours; nor was any ſuch thing ever thought of, nor that our biſhops ſhould have any juridical concern with the laity. We can only beg of you, not to give any heed to him, as it is plain he only deſigns to deceive you, and without any manner of ground, to blow up in you the ſame malicious and contentious ſpirit, that reigns in himſelf. The apoſtle's advice is, <hi>From ſuch turn away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do we deſire, or expect any other than ſuch a moderate and reaſonable ſupport for our biſhops, as ſhall be judged neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to enable them to live decently, as it becomes their ſtation, and to be exemplary in the good works of piety and charity, and that without a farthing's expence to the laity; and our de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re is, that their peculiar buſineſs ſhall be, <hi>only</hi> to ordain and govern <hi>our</hi> clergy (as the primitive biſhops always did) and admit <hi>our</hi> children when <hi>adult,</hi> to renew their baptiſmal covenant, which we call confirmation. And for all this, we do (without uncharitably cenſuring you,) ſeriouſly plead conſcience; as we do really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it grounded on the moſt ancient facts of ſcripture and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, for which we think we have as much evidence, as for the canon of the new teſtament.</p>
               <p>And now, my dear brethren, do but mind how ludicrouſly he makes a ridicule of our poor conſciences, and of the national eſtabliſhment, in No. V. Now it is well known, that the very heathen thought it ill manners, and a crime, as well as ill-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to vilify and ridicule the eſtabliſhed religion of their nation; and I would only beg leave to add, that if Mr. <hi>Whig</hi> has any ſeriouſneſs, to make it his own caſe, and to lay his hand on his heart, and ſay, whether he would not think it a barbarous thing, if the preſbyterians were obliged to ſend a 1000 leagues for every ordination, as is our unhappy caſe? But alas! it may deſerve to be well conſidered, whether a man that makes a ridicule of other people's conſciences, can be reaſonably ſuppoſed to have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his own?

               <p>LIBERTY is a moſt tender plant that thrives in very few Soils; neglected, it ſoon withers and is loſt; but is ſcarce ever recoverd. Nothing leſs than a ſupreme regard to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable bleſſing, could have induced me to undertake the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable taſk of a diſputant. I conceived it was dangerouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by Doctor Chandler and his aſſociates in their attempt to introduce dioceſan Biſhops among us, and my deſign was to ſhew the manifeſt tendency of the Innovation, to undermine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh that religious freedom by which theſe northern colonies are ſo remarkably diſtinguiſhed from every other country; and under the auſpices of which, joined with an excellent frame of civil Government, they have beyond all example grown up and proſpered. In ſome future papers I ſhall purſue the ſubject; but at preſent, I wave it, to make room for the following letter, juſt received from an ingenious correſpondent; who conſiders the manner in which our civil liberties muſt be violated, by this ſcheme of an American Epiſcopate.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AT a time when the liberties of America are at ſtake; when claims are ſet up deſtructive of our rights as free-born ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, we cannot be too much on our Guard againſt any meaſure, that has a tendency to give colour or ſtrength to theſe claims, nor ought we to give the leſs oppoſition, becauſe it has been undertaken with a different deſign.</p>
               <p>In this light I view the application for an American epiſcopate, lately made, by ſome of the Miſſionaries from the Society for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Goſpel. I would fain acquit the applicants of any intention to infringe the civil rights of the coloniſts; and yet I am clearly of opinion the application has a direct tendency to this, and therefore ought to be oppoſed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not enter on any diſputes about <hi>uninterrupted ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the divine right of epiſcopacy,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are ſubjects to which I am altogether a ſtranger. I apprehend Chriſtianity can well conſiſt with the enjoyment of civil liberty; and that a man may worſhip God and be "accepted with him" without becoming a ſlave, or parting with the rights of a Britiſh ſubject.</p>
               <p>It is not more lamentable, than true, that the clergy of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations and in every age, have diſcovered a fondneſs for power, and have ſeldom been ſcrupulous about the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:010857_0051_0F851F7003FCDBD8"/>it; nor have they uſed it with moderation when obtained. This might be improved as an argument againſt every attempt they may make to increaſe their power. But waving this, I ſhal at preſent conſider the ſubject in another view, and endeavour to ſhew that the application of Dr. Chandler and his brethren, is in itſelf a dangerous attack upon the civil liberties of this country. If this can be made evident I hope the Miſſionaries will not only decline every attempt of the like nature for the future, but that they will, from a regard to the liberties of the colonies, unite with their fellow ſubjects in oppoſing any ſteps that may be taken, in conſequence of the application already made; and that the Doctor will admit, that the oppoſition, neither ariſes from a ſpirit of perſecution, nor from diſaffection to monarchy.</p>
               <p>It is well known, that the far greater part of thoſe who firſt ſettled the northern colonies, left their native country, and took ſhelter in the wilds of America, in order to be free from the perſecution of eccleſiaſtical rulers, and to enjoy the liberty of worſhipping God in a way agreeable to their conſciences.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>It muſt be acknowledged, that it was the <hi>unhappineſs</hi> of New England and the adjoining Parts, to be firſt planted and inhabited by perſons who were generally diſaffected to the church by law eſtabliſhed in England, and many of them had taken refuge in thoſe parts, on account of their ſufferings for non conformity here at home.</q>

               <p>In conſequence of theſe grants, both they and their poſterity ever ſince, as free born ſubjects, have always claimed, and do ſtill claim, not only <hi>the ſole right of diſpoſing of their property,</hi> but alſo <hi>of making, with the conſent of the crown, ſuch la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Without the full enjoyment of theſe rights, it is impoſſible for them to preſerve the leaſt ſhadow either of <hi>liberty</hi> or <hi>property.</hi> For what <hi>property</hi> can any man have in that which another can

                  </gap>titution and charters of the ſeveral colonies, are lodged, where nature and reaſon and juſtice point out that they ought to be lodged; with the Repreſentatives of the people.</p>
               <p>Sufficient caution is taken that this power may not be abuſed. The laws in the colonies muſt be made 'as near as conveniently can be agreeable to the laws and ſtatutes and rights of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England:"<note n="‡" place="bottom">The Words of the charter from K. Charles 2d. to W. Penn.</note> They muſt receive the ſanction of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor or the King's Repreſentative. And even after that, a power is reſerved to the crown of repealing, within a limited time, any law that may be enacted.</p>
               <p>Every application<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Chandler, in his appeal, tells us, <q>Application has been made to <hi>our ſuperiors;</hi>
                     </q> and in ſundry Places he calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>"Nation"</hi> to eſtabliſh Epiſcopacy in America. Who theſe Superiors are, he does not explain: but by the nation he muſt mean the parliament; for the Nation has no mode of acting, but by its Repreſentatives in Parliament.</note> therefore, to any other than the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the reſpective colonies, for laws or regulations relative to our internal police, I conſider as an attack upon the liberty of the colonies. The regulating of church diſcipline, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular forms of religion is certainly a matter of internal police. If the parliament, or any other power upon earth, may eſtabliſh in the colonies any form of religion, or the heirarchy they pleaſe, they can grant to the members of that eſtabliſhment what immunities and exemptions they ſee fit, and inflict penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon ſuch as do not conform If they may, without the conſent of the colonies, eſtabliſh biſhopricks and biſhops among us, they may appoint revenues for their ſupport, erect ſpiritual courts, and enforce obedience to the authority and juriſdiction of thoſe courts. And if the people muſt yield obedience to ſuch
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:010857_0052_0F851F70DCCF1B58"/>laws and eſtabliſhments made not only without, but againſt their conſent, I would gladly know wherein their liberty can conſiſt.</p>
               <p>In vain did our anceſtors leave their native land, and fly into the wilderneſs to avoid ſpiritual tyranny, if thoſe who eſtabliſhed it in England can extend it to America. In ſhort if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is to interfere, and regulate one part of our internal police, why not every part? if they among whom we have no repreſentatives; who from the diſtance between them and us, muſt be unacquainted with our condition, circumſtances, &amp;c. they in whoſe election we have no choice, over whoſe conduct we have no check, as the laws they make for us, will not affect them; if our ſuperiors in Britain, can bind on us religious eſtabliſhments, and rule us by laws made at the diſtance of three thouſand miles, we may boaſt of our liberty, as we pleaſe, but it is no more, than, "The baſeleſs fabrick of a viſion."<note n="†" place="bottom">Shakeſpear.</note>

                  </gap>rn has been a favourite maxim with moſt tyrants, and has been practiſed, time immemorial, with ſucceſs, by thoſe who were laying dark ſchemes to enſlave others. Let us now examine how Mr. <hi>Whig</hi> endeavours to inveigle his readers and bring about his deſign to divide <hi>Churchmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He tells us—<q>That <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, began the reformation— that whilſt a few embraced the reformation for conſcience ſake, multitudes ſubmitted merely to ſave their eſtates, and avoid perſecution. Hence the Origin of two famous parties, viz. High church and low church. The former were papiſts in their hearts—conformed out of ſelf intereſt—were always mighty ſticklers for rights and ceremonies, and the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted line of ſucceſſion—perſecuted all who from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of religion and conſcience could not adopt their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:010857_0053_0F851F7187D0F230"/>—whoſe true, if not only deſcendants, he ſays, the American miſſionaries are at preſent, becauſe they deſire biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops." The low church party were ſuch as embraced the reformation from conſcience, and were diſpoſed to carry i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q> But theſe were chiefly diſtinguiſhed by their grievous lamentations over the <q>unhappy deficiencies of the church of England, the relicks of popery, &amp;c.—by their being favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to proteſtant diſſenters; and to crown all theſe do not now deſire to impoſe dioceſan biſhops upon us</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here, to be ſure, is a curious ſpecimen of exact hiſtorical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and of fair, impartial repreſentation! That ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the reformation from temporal views, and motives, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, even, altho' a Whig—nay, even altho' the American Whig himſelf affirms it—that moſt conformed on that account, fact and hiſtory evince to be falſe; and it ſtaggers me much to think how any proteſtant could throw ſuch an injurious, unjuſt reflection on the reformation. As for the other particulars here mentioned, and throughout his paper, they ſhew in general that this writer is either ignorant of the hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> in thoſe days, and ſince that period; or elſe that he is guilty of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious miſrepreſentation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> VIII was no reformer, nor is he called ſo by any that I know of, but papiſts. He quarrelled indeed with the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his holineſs would not grant him a divorce, and therefore threw off the papal ſupremacy. But ſtill he was a true catholic, if any thing. Before this, he wrote a book againſt <hi>Luther,</hi>— after it, he burn'd thoſe who denied tranſubſtantiation. It pleaſed God, it's true, to order matters ſo that this quarrel with the Pope proved favourable and <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the reformation; for hereby <hi>Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley,</hi> and many others had an opportunity of carrying on the glorious deſign. Nor was this <q>effected with much force</q> or violence, as the <hi>Whig</hi> injuriouſly repreſents; but with great mildneſs and Chriſtian temper, conſidering eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſpirit and circumſtances of thoſe times. His inſinuation that the diſtinction of high church and low church originated from theſe different motives upon which the reformation was embraced, is as oppoſite to truth as any legend in the Koran. That diſtinction was not known for more than a century after; and was invented by thoſe who were enemies to the <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Church of England.</hi> But the high church party, ſays our <hi>Whig</hi>—were Papiſts in their hearts—perſecuted diſſenters— were ſticklers for ceremonies, and the uninterrupted line of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; whereas the low church party, diſavowed all theſe, and were for a further reformation. Did the limit of this letter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, I could, by an induction of facts, ſhew how contrary to truth theſe aſſertions are—that the greateſt ſticklers for cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:010857_0053_0F851F7187D0F230"/>were among the greateſt oppoſers of popery; and that the warmeſt friends of <hi>diſſenters,</hi> were among the moſt ſtrenuous aſſerters of the uninterrupted line of ſucceſſion in biſhops, and divine inſtitution of their order. Let two inſtances ſuffice.—</p>
               <p>The unfortunate LAUD, (ſeveral of whoſe meaſures I do not approve, though they were the fault of the times, more than of the man; nor was he ſo blameable by any means as his enemies would repreſent;) He, I ſay, was one of thoſe no doubt whom our <hi>Whig</hi> will call a ſtickler for ceremonies; yet he was ſo far from being a "Papiſt in his heart," that no proteſtant ever oppoſed popery with greater warmth. He wrote againſt it with more ſpirit and more to the purpoſe, than any one <hi>diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>—nay, than <hi>all of them put together,</hi> from the time of <hi>Harry</hi> VIII, to this day. The pious and learned biſhop HALL is well known to have been a favourer of puritaniſm,—was repreſented as ſuch to the king, (which we learn from himſelf) and was one of thoſe who aſſiſted at the Synod of DORT. Yet he was ſo zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an advocate for the uninterrupted line of ſucceſſion, that he proved it in a book he wrote for that purpoſe, entitled—Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy by Divine Right. And it may with truth be averred, that there has been ſcarce one clergyman of any note in the Church, however favourable to diſſenters, who did not hold the ſame principle with the good biſhop HALL in this reſpect. Indeed all hold it, except <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> who teach that purely ſpiritual powers, like civil are derived from the ſtate. Even Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, ſuch of them I mean as know, and will adhere to their own principles.— believe the uninterrupted line of ſucceſſion as much as churchmen; but with this difference—that the former place the ſucceſſion in preſbyters; the latter in biſhops.</p>
               <p>High churchmen however, with all thoſe vile qualities he is pleaſed to give them, were enemies to any further reformation, according to our <hi>Whig;</hi> but low churchmen were perpetually grieving over the relicks of popery, and wanted them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. The enemies of the church have often practiſed this method to ruin it, by blackening thoſe who thwarted their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. No Church on earth is more diſtinguiſhed for moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on however, or has ſhewed more indulgence to ſcrupulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, than the Church of England; and accordingly, ſhe has made frequent reviews of her liturgy, endeavouring to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy all reaſonable requiſitions. But were ſhe to gratify the demands of every heated enthuſiaſt,—every factious ſectariſt,— every reſtleſs Heretic; ſhe would ſoon be utterly annihilated, ſhe would neither have ceremony, nor creed, nor article, nor canon left; to the great <hi>contentation</hi> of <hi>Papiſts, Arians, Socinians, American Whigs,</hi> and <hi>Deiſts,</hi> who have been formerely, and are
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:010857_0054_0F851F71DE241C38"/>at this day, as loud as our author himſelf could wiſh them to be, in their demands for a further reformation.</p>
               <p>As this writer's aim is to divide the church, by reviling her friends, and all this to ſerve his preſent purpoſe, he prudently paſſes over that period when his party triumphed in her ruin. it was his intereſt to do this; as the bare mention of it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive no very pleaſing ideas in his readers, nor ſuggeſt any thing favourable to his partizans. But it may be proper to remind Americans, that when the predeceſſors of our <hi>Whig</hi>—(into whom, as well as into the faction he is leagued with, the ſpirit of theſe king-murderers, and church-deſtroyers ſeems to have <hi>tranſmigrated;</hi>) when they, I ſay, had gained the aſcendency by cutting off the King's head, and overturning the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they exerciſed ſeverities on the members of the Church, which were ſcarce exceeded by the moſt perſecuting <hi>Heathens.</hi> In the year 1645 <q>a fine of £. 5 was impoſed on any perſon who uſed the prayer book in any Church, or private houſe, for the firſt offence; £. 10 for the ſecond; and one whole year's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, without bail or mainprize for the third.</q> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of SEVEN THOUSAND clergymen were ſequeſtered, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and ruined; many of whom were, for piety, Wiſdom, and learning, the brighteſt ornaments of Chriſtianity ſince the reformation.</p>
               <p>Nor can this be wondered at, if we reflect on the intolerant principles that prevailed among thoſe ſanctified <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and were reſounded even from the pulpit by their moſt admired teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The following is a ſmall ſample of what I have collected from their writings; more of which I ſhall hereafter produce, if neceſſary. "Toleration." according to them, <q>was a city of refuge in men's conſciences for the devil to fly unto,—a toleration of ſoul murder; for eſtabliſhing whereof. damned ſouls in Hell will curſe men upon earth,—a tranſcendent, catholic, fundamental evil,—the abomination of deſolation. all the devils in hell, and their inſtruments, are at work to promote a toleration.</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>O MY COUNTRYMEN!—beware of thoſe who are the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed defenders of the men that taught theſe principles; and who give but too glaring proofs that they inherit the very ſame temper and ſpirit! What might churchmen, and every other denomination, look for from them, ſhould Heaven permit them again to domineer over their fellow ſubjects!</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Whig</hi>'s attempt to diſunite us reminds me of the practices of Papiſts, (in which the Jeſuits were principal agents) to divide and diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſtory of <hi>Heath,</hi> a Jeſuit, is well known. He was diſcovered by a letter which he accidentally dropt; and at his examination confeſſed—<q>That he had been ſix years in <hi>England,</hi>—had laboured to refine Proteſtants from all <hi>Smacks</hi> of ceremonies, and to make the Church purer.</q>

And what heightens my ſuſpicion is, that altho' a Popiſh biſhop has been lately ſent to America, I never could learn that the faction made the leaſt clamour or noiſe about him. A Proteſtant epiſcopate is what they oppoſe. And they are wiſe in their generation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall take no further notice of the palpable falſhoods in this piece, which may boldly contend for number with the lines;" but ſhall requeſt every honeſt, candid diſpaſſionate reader to reflect, whether it be conſiſtent with reaſon or equity, that the Church ſhould labour under the hardſhips with which it now ſtruggles! whether it be right or juſt that our clergy ſhould be at the expence of going three thouſand miles for ordination, and run the reſque of croſſing the Atlantic Ocean, which has proved
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:010857_0055_0F851F7404BB1328"/>fatal to ſo many of them; Whether it be right that many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Chriſtians ſhould be deprived of the apoſtolic ordinance of confirmation, which they think it their duty to receive?— Or whether ſo many Churches ſhould continue vacant and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute, for want of proper officers to ordain Clergymen to ſupply them? All the motives of piety, truth, reaſon and equity, ſtrongly remonſtrate againſt each of theſe grievances, and urge that they ſhould be redreſſed. 'Till they are redreſſed, we enjoy not the common rights of freemen, or Chriſtians. Nor do I in the leaſt doubt, but the man who can brandiſh his pen againſt the removal of theſe hardſhips from his fellow-ſubjects,—perſecute them thus much for their religious opinions; would alſo ſtretch forth his right hand to bind the victims to the ſtake, and kindle the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring flame with his left, had he but power and authority to ſupport him.</p>
               <p>As for the clamour which the Whig and his aſſociates have raiſed concerning a Biſhop clothed with all the Inſignia of power, and that we can have none but ſuch, it is abſurd and groundleſs, and only intended to frighten the weak and credulous. I am a Churchman from principle, and earneſtly deſire Biſhops, becauſe the welfare and even the exiſtence, in a few years of the Church, depends on it; (for every ſociety that has not the means of its own preſervation within itſelf, muſt inevitably periſh.) Yet I here declare, I am utterly and abſolutely againſt biſhops having the ſame powers they have in England; and for this plain reaſon, that it would injure both the Church &amp; the Colonies. I only want Biſhops on the plan propoſed in doctor Chandler's appeal. That we can have Biſhops on that plan, ſhall hereafter be ſhewn, if you do not think that every perſon of ſenſe and candour is already convinced of it.</p>

               <p>THE prerogatives peculiar to a Biſhop above preſbyters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reverend doctor of a neighbouring borough, are thoſe of ordination, confirmation, and government. And as he confeſſes that our own miſſionaries have authority to exclude the profane from the ſacrament, which is the higheſt ſanction for preſerving the purity of the church, as he knows our epiſcopal candidates can make voyages to England, and get the biſhops hand on their heads and learn politeneſs into the bargain; and as he dare not aſſert, that faith and repentance will not ſave an American ſoul, without epiſcopal confirmation; I cannot ſee the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:010857_0055_0F851F7404BB1328"/>advantage, and much leſs the neceſſity, of importing a cargo of ſpiritual carnalities into the country, to tyrannize over a people, who fled three thouſand miles to be relieved from their tythes and their courts.</p>
               <p>There muſt therefore be at the bottom of his earneſt and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate appeal, ſome attribute of his lordſhip, which the Doctor thinks incommunicable to a preſbyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r, and which he hath not yet been pleaſed to diſcloſe. All the power neceſſary for good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is already transferred; and as to the trip for ordination, it it is ſo far from an inconvenience, that it doubtleſs conduces much to the reputable figure of the miſſionaries. It is alſo a proof of their courage and zeal, two indiſpenſible qualifications of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſoldier, and if the expence was conſiderably inhanced, the church would be better ſecured againſt an old complaint of the Jews, that prieſts were made of the meaneſt of the people.</p>
               <p>Upon the preſumption, that the biſhop will bring powers that can be delegated to no other order of the clergy, it ſtands the Doctor in hand to prove, (and for that reaſon doubtleſs we are obliged to him for his ſketch in favour of) the divine right of epiſcopacy.

                  </gap> poiſonous fruit, I ſhall fill up this paper with ſome general remarks introductory to a minute exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in ſome ſubſequent numbers, of the Doctor's argument, in ſupport of a tenet, given up by ſeveral biſhops of great name; and which, while it claims peculiar honours for his own church, and the church of Rome, contains odious imputations upon all the other churches in Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>In that ever memorable eccleſiaſtical revolution, commonly called the reformation, moſt of the clergy who revolted from the dominion of the beaſt, avowed the principle, that the diſtinction between a biſhop and preſbyter, was a popiſh ſubtilty, contrived to favour the ſpiritual deſpotiſm of antichriſt. This, after the example of other monarchies, advances in a regular gradation from the humble prieſt or curate, thro' the intermediate order of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, vicar, prebend or canon, dean arch deacon, biſhop, arch biſhops, and cardinals, up to the Pope, or infallible Emperor, of the great ſpiritual body. Finding no ſcriptural authority for this regimental progreſſion, the reformers very naturally imputed the whole contrivance to that pride which began to work in the mother of the two ſons of Zebedee, and was prophetically foreſeen, and foretold by the humble Diſciple whom Jeſus loved. They ſet out therefore, with a declaration of the equality of the clergy, as moſt agreeable to the will and words of our bleſſed Saviour, that he who would be greateſt, ſhould be the ſervant of the reſt; and indeed it appeared neceſſary to the permanence of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; the order of biſhops liſting laſt of all others, as they
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:010857_0056_0F851F746C6ED8F0"/>had moſt to loſe, under the banners of the reformation. The glorious, work was began by preſbyters, and if they were not admitted to be biſhops, and authorized to ordain others, the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect was clear, that unleſs the biſhops joined in the revolt againſt his holineſs, the cauſe could laſt no longer than the lives of the firſt inſurgents: They therefore denied the epiſcopal prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to be founded upon the authority of Chriſt; and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the powers of biſhops and preſbyter, were the ſame, the greater part of the reſomed churches became Preſbyterians.</p>
               <p>As it is natural to ſuppoſe, the proteſtant clergy in general, to have had ſimilar ſentiments of the hierarchy of Rome, the church diſcipline of England, if their diſſent had been conducted by her prieſts, would have been nearly the ſame with that ſet up in France. Switzerland, Holland, Scotland, and the other reſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as a King took the lead, and the pride of Henry VIII. induced him on the one hand to oppoſe the Pope, and on the other to diſapprove the humbling caſt of the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian model: it is not to be wondered at, that he contented himſelf with rejecting the ſuperior, and leaving all the lower or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders inviolate; his true aim being only to be the Pope, or his Holineſs of England Hence the permiſſion of the old popiſh ranks as high as the arch biſhop, and his contempt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The people of England ſaw the imperfection of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that Kingdom, but there were a thouſand objections to their interpoſition.

               <p>For the truth of theſe remarks, I appeal to the hiſtory of the church; and they are introdaced to ſhew that an attachment to the dogma, that biſhops are ſuperior to preſbyters, is peculiar, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively

By ſome it will be thought a full anſwer, that the ſentiments of the reformed, are in this caſe, authorities infinitely preferable ſo that of a church, confeſſed on all hands, to have corrupted the ſaith; and which was the more ſucceſsful, as like other harlots, ſhe had philtres and love potions to beſtow "out of the golden cup in her hand, full of abomination and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But this it not the moſt logical uſe I would make of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, if I may ſo ſpeak, of the proteſtant diſavowal of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of biſhops to preſbyters. I will grant the Appellant, that the firſt ages of the church, before the ſcarlet whore had defiled the nations, furniſhed inſtances of martyrs and confeſſors, who do hounour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the religion which they ſealed with their blood; and it will be no prejudice to my argument, if I even admit (tho' Lord Chanceller King is of a very different opinion, and for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which no biſhops have yet ſatisfactorily anſwered) that thoſe holy men of old conſidered a prieſt as a biſhop's inferior, I ſay all this I will admit, and that the opinion prevailed from century to century, down to the dawn of the reformation. But, on the other hand, it will not be aſſerted, that any primitive Chriſtian died a martyr to that tenet, nor denied that the proteſtant churches have exhibited an innumerable company of illuſtrious witneſſes for the purity of the ſaith, who believed and practiſed the very reverſe, as moſt agreeable in their conceptions to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of divine inſpiration. If the zealous contender for an American epiſcopate, ſupports the divine right of epiſcopacy, the glorious inſtruments of the reformation in Holland, Scotland, and Switzerland. and elſewhere, who tho' preſbyters ordained others, and governed their churches; and all thoſe numberleſs lights of the church, who without the aid of a biſhop in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, and to this very day, have ſounded, and are ſtill ſounding the goſpel trumpet, with a ſucceſs that ſhews the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the unerring ſpirit of all truth; they muſt, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authoriſed for the work, be conſidered as miſtaken or impudent pretenders, to a commiſſion they neither had nor have. But as their erudition and abilities give ground for ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions in favour of their knowledge; and their lives defy the impeachment of malice itſelf; and we have ſenſible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if I may ſo ſpeak, of the power of the goſpel upon the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:010857_0057_0F851F74E4F8FF10"/>hearts of millions, by their inſtrumentality, and ſtill more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable proofs of the non-neceſſity of epiſcopal authority to ſave ſouls from perdition; I conclude from theſe premiſes, what I have always believed, that the ſacred volume makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a biſhop and any other miniſter. Nay, farther, that as God the father of all, left mankind at liberty to ſet up that kind of civil government which tends moſt to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral felicity; ſo our bleſſed lord eſtabliſhed no particular form of church government, but (a ſew general canons excepted, friendly to the general diſcipline of the reformation, and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated as a preſervative againſt that execrable ſpirit of pride, which by his omniſcience he foreſaw would ſoon ariſe in the churches,) left his followers to chooſe ſuch models, as beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ends of good order, and the preſervation of ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both in faith and in manners.</p>
               <p>In all ſocieties whether civil or eccleſiaſtical, ſome kind of government there muſt be; and no one can pretend, that the militant ſtate of the church, requires the aid of revelation to point out a proper form of diſcipline, more than the general condition of mankind does any mode of national government. Both muſt be adapted to the circumſtances of their reſpective members; and as Chriſtianity, whenever it comes, finds civil government of one kind or another already formed; and it was certainly not the deſign of our lord to demoliſh the old bond of ſociety; and to ſome of theſe, one form of church diſcipline would be more agreeable than another; and in others, ſcarce any of the known models could conveniently take place; it is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural preſumption, and a tolerable argument a priori, that none of the various forms for which mankind contend with ſuch deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructive and unchriſtian zeal, have any other <hi>jus dìvinum</hi> for their foundation than the dictates of found reaſon, and with that on their ſide, what need there any other? for of all that have this, it may be alledged, whether the government be a civil or religious, one, that it is the ordinance of God, and to be ſubmitted to for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>But to return more immediately to the point which the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor aſſerts. Since the divine author of Chriſtianity doubtleſs aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, above all things aimed, at the converſion of the heart, for the recovery of a revolting world to the allegiance due to the creator; and this was infinitely of more conſequence, than the ſubſiſtence of Chriſtian ſocieties under a monarchial, or repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, or any other particular form of government; and ſince of the many millions of honeſt men, who have ſdulouſly peruſed the ſcriptures to find a difference between a prieſt and a biſhop, it ſtill remains a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I HAVE already endeavoured to ſhew from the principles of liberty, that the Britiſh parliament ought not to interfere in the civil police of the colonies; and that any application to that auguſt body, directly or indirectly, to make laws for us, or to eſtabliſh among us any form of church diſcipline, deſerves to be
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:010857_0058_0F851F7FD93D9BE0"/>treated as an attack upon our civil liberties. I ſhall further evince this, from the ſentiments of thoſe who gave, and the conduct of thoſe who received, the ſeveral provincial charters: This will tend not only to enforce the arguments already advanced, but to give a clearer view of our conſtitution, by tracing it back to its firſt principles.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>I wiſh the maxim of <hi>Machiavel</hi> was followed; that of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining a conſtitution at certain periods, according to its firſt Principles; this would correct abuſes and ſupply Defects.</q>

            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed, it may not be amiſs to offer a few reflections on the nature of charters.</p>
            <p>I have heard it advanced by men, who ought to know better, that the people derive their rights and liberties from the charters granted by the crown. Nothing can be more groundleſs than this. A people derive their liberty from God, the author of their being.<note n="§" place="bottom">Abeo Libertas, a quo Spirites. <q>We are born free, as we are born rational; ge that brings one brings the other too.</q> 
                  <hi>Locke on</hi> Govt. <hi>61.</hi> Again, <q>voluntary Agreement gives political power to Governors, for the benefit of the ſubjects, and ſecures them in the Poſſeſſion and uſe of their properties.</q>
               </note> When for the ſake of ſecurity and other advantages they enter into ſociety, and form governments, individuals part with ſome of their natural rights, freely giving up ſuch as are inconſiſtent with government, and inveſt their chief magiſtrates with ſuch power as is deemed neceſſary for the defence, protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſecurity of the whole. Hence it appears, that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and protection are relative terms: where the one is not granted, the other is not due.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved, that different nations, according to the degree of ſtrength, valour, underſtanding, and public virtue, or vigour of ſpirit, that prevailed in them, have ſurrendered more or leſs of their natural rights. But as power is of an encroaching nature; ever on the watch to extend its ſway; and ever tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of what it has obtained; hence it comes to paſs, that the wiſeſt and beſt nations, thoſe endowed with the greateſt degree of ability, bravery, and public ſpirit have often found it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to guard againſt the encroachments of their rulers, and to defend their Liberty againſt the attacks of wicked Princes.</p>
            <p>Our anceſtors, whether we trace our orgin from the ancient Britons, Picts, Scots, Saxons or Angles, preſerved an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable love of liberty. Though they paid a ready obedience to government, and revered the juſt authority of their Kings, yet they kept the legiſlative power in their own hands; and obliged their Princes to ſwear, "that they would hold, keep and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:010857_0058_0F851F7FD93D9BE0"/>the juſt laws and cuſtoms, <hi>quas vulgus elegerit</hi>", (which the people ſhould chooſe)<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See the</hi> Coronation Oath.</note>. But as ſome of their Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by wicked deſigning miniſters, endeavoured to ſubvert the liberties of the people, and to eſtabliſh arbitrary government, it became neceſſary to reduce them to reaſon, and to aſcertain the limits of their power. This gave riſe to charters; which are no more than ſolemn declarations of the rights inherent in the people, and the privileges they are intituled to under that government to which they are ſubject; and which being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or in other words acknowledged, and ſubſcribed by the King, or ſupreme magiſtrate, bound his power, and limit his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Of this nature is that commonly called Magna-Charta; the great charter of England; which is only an abridgement of the ancient laws and cuſtoms of the realm. Of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the petition of rights, granted by King Charles the firſt, and confirmed at the revolution. Charters therefore are not to be conſidered as mere matters of favour, conferred by the grace of the prince, but declarations of the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges inherent in the people.</p>
            <p>Thus at the ſettlement of a colony far diſtant from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Country, when the King grants a charter to the coloniſts, with power to make laws for their good government, it is not to be ſuppoſed, that they derive that power from the charter. It was inherent in them as freemen. They enjoyed it before in their native country. They carried it with them. And when ſettled in the new country might have exerciſed it, though no charter had beed granted.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Thus the former Colony of <hi>Plymouth</hi> in New-England, acted for many Years without Charter or Commiſſion,—See <hi>Hutchinſon's</hi> Hiſtory of Maſſachuſetts.</note> It was prudent indeed to receive a charter, in order to ſettle their rights, to direct the mode of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing their privileges, and to aſcertain the bounds of royal prerogative with regard to them, and the authority of the crown to which they acknowledged allegiance.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I am ſorry the charters which have been granted are not explicit enough. It is indeed to be lamented, that the prerogative of the crown, or the privileges of the people ſhould ever be liable to diſpute, in any ſingle branch of either. By means of this, the public has often ſuffered great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. Had the rights of the people been fully and clearly expreſſed in theſe charters, according to the ſpirit of the Engliſh conſtitution, and the idea that even then prevailed in the minds of people, it might have prevented claims that have lately been ſet up, and diſputes that threaten the peace of the empire. Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer matters in government may be reformed without any ill effects,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:010857_0059_0F851F81167CF540"/>while the ancient conſtitution remains entire; but when the very nature of the government is attempted to be changed, and the foundation of it to be overturned, it is hard to ſay, what may be the conſequence.</p>
            <p>It is a firſt principle in the conſtitution of England, that the happineſs of the Subject is the end of government, and that the ſafety of the people is the ſupreme law. As then the people are ſuppoſed to be the beſt judges of what will promote their own good, and moſt intereſted in what conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us their own ſafety it is an eſtabliſhed maxim, that no human laws, can, or ought to bind them, unleſs made with their conſent. This is the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous privilege of Britons; a priv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ge of the moſt ineſtimable value; ſo eſſential to liberty, that without it, a ſtate can make no pretenſions to freedom.</p>
            <p>Whatever reaſon there might be for granting particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences to thoſe who with great danger, fatigue and expence undertook to ſettle colonies in the wilds of America, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to extend the Britiſh dominions, and increaſe the power, wealth and influence both of the crown, and inhabitants of Britain, yet ſurely there could not be the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon for depriving them of the privileges of the Britiſh conſtitution. Had there been the moſt diſtant proſpect of this, it is not to be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that freemen, much leſs men of rank and fortune, ſuch as many of the firſt adventurers were, would ever have hazarded the attempt. Far different were their views. In going abroad to ſettle colonies they conſidered themſelves intituled to all the civil rights and liberties of Britiſh ſubjects, at the ſame time that they were freed from the oppreſſions of eccleſiaſtical courts, as well as from ſome particular cuſtoms, tenures and uſages, which by the common and ſtatute law, were confined to certain diſtricts in England.</p>
            <p>Thus in every charter granted to the colonies, the rights of Engliſh free-born ſubjects, are confirmed to the coloniſts; and in particular a power of making laws for their internal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is indeed provided, that the laws ſo made ſhall not be repugnant to the laws of England: a proviſion founded on wiſdom and good policy. For a ſimilarity of manners and cuſtoms is a great bond of union among ſubjects of the ſame King. In ſome charters, particularly thoſe granted to people who left their native country from religious motives, a liberty of conſcience in the worſhip of God, is allowed to all Chriſtians, except Roman Catholicks.<note n="¶" place="bottom">

               </note> The only ſtipulation in ſavour of any particular denomination, is that found in the charter granted to William Penn; which provides, that <q>If any of the in habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.

The concluſions therefore, which I would draw from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are theſe; that the making of laws for internal police, is eſſential to liberty; that this power is, by the reſpective charters, confirmed to the legiſlatures of the ſeveral colonies, and has been accordingly exerciſed by them; and that the regulating or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhing religious denominations is a part of that internal police: for any perſon therefore to apply to any other than the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the colonies to which they belong, for an eſtabliſhment, or other public ſupport or preference of their ſect, it is very derogatory of the authority of thoſe legiſlatures; injurious to the rights and liberties of Americans; and ſubverſive of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their country.— "There is a way which ſeemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death." —<hi>Prov</hi> xiv. 12.</p>

            <p>I Am ſorry to find any one, who calls himſelf a churchman, endeavouring to propagate ſuch crude notions as are contained in a letter "to the American Whig," which he has thought fit to publiſh in his 4th number. I have heard it diſputed in ſeveral companies, (to the credit of the church of England be it ſpoken) whether it is poſſible this letter-writer can be a churchman in any ſenſe; and, whether this piece is in reality any thing elſe than a letter from the American Whig—to his own dear ſelf. The former of theſe two queſtions was generally decided in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; the latter in the Affirmative; and the pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting a letter of this ſort from a Churchman, was looked upon as a Manaeuvre, from which it was natural to expect ſome degree of ſucceſs. Againſt this opinion I have no material objections; and yet, upon the whole, I ſee no neceſſity on the other hand, for concluding that the perſon in queſtion is not a churchman in ſome ſenſe, as the ſtrangeneſs of ſuch a Phaenomenon may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, upon St. Paul's maxim expreſſed in the motto to this paper. But whether he be American Whig or American Churchman, ſince he attempts to reaſon, I will readily hear him. For I love reaſoning dearly, eſpecially after ſuch tedious expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and wretched diſappointments.</p>

               <pb n="119" facs="unknown:010857_0060_0F851F845E012700"/>
Before this writer enters upon the main point which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to defend, he makes an introductory remark upon the tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of wealth and power to ruin the Chriſtian Church; intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the great pleaſure it would give him, to ſee the Church in puris Naturalibus, without a Fig-Leaf to cover her, as ſhe firſt exiſted—when ſhe was perſecruted and oppreſſed by the vicil power,—and when the Miniſters of this religion were obliged to ſhelter themſelves "in dens and caves of the earth," being, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, "diſtitute, afflicted, tormented." The Clergy in particular ought to be obliged to him for his kind wiſhes, well knowing that every man will exert himſelf, as he has opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to bring about an event which is the object of his wiſhes. But after all, he has ſaid nothing againſt the power and wealth of the Clergy, which will not conclude as ſtrongly againſt wealth and power in the hands of other perſons. If power has been abuſed by the clergy, it has been no leſs wantonly abuſed by Princes and civil magiſtrates. If wealth has a tendency to corrupt the Clergy, it is not found to have a better effect upon Chriſtians in any other ſtation of life. He might therefore with as much Propriety "be oppoſed" to the "Annexations" of private Chriſtians, becauſe they have better bread and butter, and are ſuffered to eat it more quietly, than the primitive Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
            <p>But could we ſuppoſe wealth and power have a tendency to corrupt the clergy only, and that theſe things operate in the ſame manner upon no other human creature; the obſervation notwithſtanding, as it is made here, is intirely miſplaced. It is become the common practice of the various writers againſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, to harangue upon this popular ſubject; and yet I am not able to diſcover that the Appeal has given any juſt occaſion for it. For any one with half an eye, that is willing to uſe it rather than to ſee by hearſay, as Don Quixotte ſaw his Miſtreſs, may eaſily and clearly ſee for himſelf, that the Appeal propoſes no ſcheme to aggrandiſe and enrich the American Clergy, or to impoveriſh and depreſs the American laiety. It propoſes indeed Biſhops to be ſent to America, but without any temporal power, and without juriſdictions over any perſons at all, the Clergy of the Church only excepted. What foundation then is there for all this Racket and Fluſtration about the power of American Biſhops, when, upon the propoſed plan, they are to have no power at all over the Clergy of other denominations, nor over the laity of any denomination? But, it ſeems, the contrary to this is attempted to be proved by the writer before us; and I am impatient to ſee in what manner he will acquit himſelf.</p>
            <p>The reader therefore will excuſe my paſſing over his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibly ſublime and exquiſitely ſagacious criticiſm upon the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:010857_0061_0F851F84E4B13FE0"/>diſtinction between a Churchman, an American Churchman, an American Church of "Englandman," and an American Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalian: eſpecially when I aſſure him of my utter inability to explain the diſtinction, made by our critic, between an American Church of Englandman, and (to uſe the ſame phraſeology) a Church of England in America-man.</p>
            <p>Let us then attend to a proceſs of reaſoning, which now, for the firſt time, appears in the American Whig. The point under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to be proved is this, that <q>with the Biſhops (propoſed to be ſent to America) we ſhall naturally have the introduction or eſtabliſhment of ſpiritual or eccleſiaſtical courts</q> Our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant ſtates his propoſition with all the ſolemn ſtiffneſs of a Ramus or a Burgerſdicius, and gives the ſignal that the mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain is in Labour, with ſuch awful formality, that every reader has a right to expect that the production will be more than a mouſe.</p>
            <p>For my part when I had proceeded thus far in reading the paper, I expected to ſee a terrific movement of Syllogiſms ranged in rank and file, and to hear the ratling of a ſtrong logical chain, to the end of the chapter. But I was miſtaken. I find but little marching and countermarching of arguments; and the chain conſiſts of but three ſhort links, which have neither ſolidity nor ſtrength.</p>
            <p>For, of the thirteen paragraphs that follow, there are but three wherein any proof is attempted.—Two others are manifeſtly intended to ſhew his immenſe erudition in the Eccleſiaſtical-Law,—and as to the deſign of the other eight, I am unable to fix it with any certainty. All that I know about them is, that they prove nothing, and that they take the thing for granted which it was their buſineſs to prove. As I think it not worth while to ſay any thing farther to them, or about them, <hi>i. e.</hi> to or about theſe eight paragraphs of the epicence or doubtful Gender; I will confine myſelf to the three reaſoning, and the two oſtentatious ones.</p>
            <p>Let us then firſt conſider the three, and take them in their order. <q>The Biſhop's title, ſays this writer, is not derived from the apoſtolic commiſſion: They are ſeized by the law of of the land, and will hold their preheminencies 'till this law is altered by King, Lords, and commons.</q> If by the <q>Biſhop's title</q> he means the right to their temporalities, we are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to grant, that it is not derived <q>from the apoſtolic commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</q> for the ſame reaſon that a clergyman's right to the uſe of a Parſonage, or to the money ſubſcribed or promiſed for his ſupport, is not derived "from the apoſtolic commiſſion." Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops in England are inveſted with rights of this nature <q>By the law of the land;</q> but I have never yet heard that any "law of the land," <hi>i. e.</hi> of England, conveys or confirms, or
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:010857_0061_0F851F84E4B13FE0"/>ſpecifies, or meddles with the rights of Biſhops who do not reſide in the land, <hi>i. e.</hi> in England. The laws of England, ſo far as they relate to Biſhops, have reference only to Biſhops in England: what ſhall be the condition and authority of Biſhops in America, or any other country, they have never yet undertaken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.—Our letter-writer having gained nothing by his firſt effort, let us ſee how he ſucceeds in his ſecond.</p>
            <p>"Lord Hale, ſays he, meaning Sir Matthew Hale, Lord Chief Juſtice (as we ſay, not Lord Sherlock, but Dr. Sherlock, Lord Biſhop, &amp;c.) "tells us—that every Biſhop by his election and confirmation, even before conſecration had eccleſiaſtical juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction "annexed to his office." What juriſdiction every Biſhop formerly had, and how he obtained it, are to us matters of mere ſpeculation: what juriſdiction every Biſhop now has, is a more important queſtion, I have not lately read Sir M Hale's <q>Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the common law,</q> to which we are here referred; nor do I remember what he ſays of the rights of Biſhops: but in this I am clear, that he undertook not to define the rights of any Biſhops, but of thoſe in England,—that he meant not to explain what would be the rights and powers of American Biſhops. And the preſent queſtion is, not what rights the Engliſh Biſhops have had, or now have, but what authority American Biſhops will have when they are appointed. So that this ſecond paragraph of our American Wh—I mean Churchman, we may ſay, Item, gained nothing.</p>
            <p>But perhaps, according to the old proverb, it may concern us to beware of the third; and it is certain that in this he endeavours to drive home and clench the argument. Thus he goes forward: <q>The Biſhop's right to open his court being therefore ſecured by the common law, and that being univerſally acknowledged to be the law of the colonies, his Lordſhip will find no difficulty, after his dioceſe is eſtabliſhed, or erect a Tribunal, &amp;c</q> This writer does not tell us, what he means by the eſtabliſhment of the American Biſhop's dioceſe,—nor whether he thinks "his dioceſe is eſtabliſhed" by common law. If by eſtabliſhment he means a legal eſtabliſhment, we may, as is propoſed in the appeal, have Biſhops in this country without any eſtabliſhment of dioceſes, in this ſenſe of the word. But let us ſuppoſe, for the preſent, that the dioceſes in America will obtain a legal eſtabliſhment; yet ſtill it will depend upon the nature of the eſtabliſhment, what powers will thereby be granted to American Biſhops. An <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d power in the Biſhops that govern them. It will hardly be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted that the dioceſes in England are eſtabliſhed dioceſes; and yet the Biſhop of Durham has ſome rights and powers, to who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> other Biſhops in England are not intitled; as they all have ſome
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:010857_0062_0F851F856B39FAA0"/>rights to which the Biſhop of Man has no claim or pretenſion; and yet the Biſhop of Man is as much a Biſhop of the Church of England, and all the acts of epiſcopal power,—his ordinations, confirmations and government of the Clergy,—are equally valid with that of the Biſhop of Durham, or any other Biſhop whatever. What has been here ſaid proves, that altho' dioceſes ſhould be eſtabliſhed in America, it does not from thence follow that there muſt be an "eſtabliſhment of ſpiritual or eccleſiaſtical courts.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the body of Engliſh eccleſiaſtical law is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the civil law, the common law, the canon law, and the ſtatute law. Now a right to hold ſpiritual courts, which is founded on the common law only, can be no more than a general right; and if there be no canons, nor ſtatutes, to regulate and direct it, it can never operate. Such a right is an abſtract idea, and it can produce only abſtract courts, which can have nothing to do with individuals, or with particular caſes. I have ſo good an opinion even of American Whigs, as to believe they have no great averſion to ſuch ſpiritual courts as theſe, which can never exiſt but in theory and ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>If by the common law, or any other law, American Biſhops will have a right to hold courts, in the ſame manner that they are held by biſhops in England, it muſt be by virtue of the Church of England's having a full and general eſtabliſhment in the American colonies. For upon any other principle I defy this writer and his patron, and their confederates, to ſhew, that <q>with the biſhops, we ſhall naturally have the introduction or eſtabliſhment of ſpiritual or eccleſiaſtical courts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It may therefore be proper, before we proceed to other matters, to ſettle this capital Point; whether the church of England is eſtabliſhed in the colonies? if it is, perhaps ſome act of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature will be neceſſary for the election of ſuch an epiſcopate as is propoſed in the appeal, which act the friends of an American epiſcopate can probably obtain, without much difficulty. If the church of England is not eſtabliſhed in the colonies, than all this clamour againſt ſpiritual courts as neceſſarily connected with an American epiſcopate, is groundleſs and impertinent. But as too much of "the dry cruſt of controverſy" at one time, may have an ill effect upon the ſtomachs of the American Whig and his fellows, I will withhold my hand for the preſent, having, I fancy, already given him and them more than they can manage at one breakfaſt. I propoſe however to reſume this ſubject in ſome future paper, and to give out ſome more of this dry cruſt, by the time they ſhall have well ſwallowed, chewed the cud upon, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, and digeſted their preſent meal.</p>

               <p>THO' the Author of the appeal aſſumes, at the beginning of his journey, and retains thro' a conſiderable part of his progreſs, a great appearance of moderation and candour, in order to render his ſcheme of an American epiſcopate the more palatable to diſſenters; and by the moſt ſoothing ſtrains, to coax them into a tame compliance; or at leaſt to prevent any oppoſition by way of anſwer; he found it nevertheleſs impoſſible to keep on the maſk, till he arrived at his journey's end. The conſtraint was too unnatural to be of any long duration.</p>
               <p>Naturam expellas furca, tamen uſque recurret. And if, like Jaſon in fabulous ſtory, he endeavours to caſt the watching Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon into a ſleep; like him too, it is for the inſidious purpoſe of carrying off the Golden Fleece of our religious liberty. He had in the preceding part of his pamphlet, done ſtrict juſtice to the American Diſſenters, if indeed it is not the greateſt abſurdity to talk of diſſenters, in a country where, upon his own plan, there is no eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment to diſſent from. He had hitherto wrote like a gentleman, and a Chriſtian. But alas! alas! that this gentleman, and Chriſtian, ſhould not be able to weather the 41ſt page, without betraying the old leaven. Thus far had we rambled through the flowery fields of catholiciſm and benevolence, when behold, within a foot of us,—latet anguis in herba! With whatever gales of lenity and temper, his little bark had hitherto been wafted along, it is now unfortunately daſhed againſt the rock of offence, by a ſudden guſt of obloquy and intolerance. <hi>But while we ſuffer,</hi> ſays he, (would not a man lay ten to one, that he heard the groans of a perſon under violent perſecution?) While we thus ſuffer, <hi>(Oh! Jemmy Thompſon! Jemmy Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Oh!) We are not apprehenſive it can be owing to the diſpleaſure of our ſuperiors, as we are conſcious of no crime with regard of the ſtate. On the other hand, we claim a right to be conſidered as equal with the foremoſt in every due expreſſion of fidelity and loyalty. We eſteem ourſelves bound, not only by preſent intereſt and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but by the more ſacred ties of our religious principles, and Chriſtian duty, to ſupport to the utmoſt, the national civil, eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment. Accordingly, no trumpet of ſedition was ever heard to ſound from our pulpits: No ſeeds of diſaffection have been ſuffered more privately to be ſown in our houſes.</hi>

<pb n="124" facs="unknown:010857_0063_0F851F8639E98BD8"/>to inſinuate, that ſome other denominations among us, are conſcious of crimes with reſpect to the ſtate? If otherwiſe, why not ſatisfied with ſimply averring that his brethren were as-loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſubjects as others? this has never that I know of, been called in queſtion. Where then the neceſſity of all that follows, which tho' artfully, is yet evidently intended, to run an odious parallel between the Epiſcopalians and Non Epiſcopalians of North-America? <hi>But on the other hand, we claim a right to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as equal with the</hi> MOST <hi>foremoſt in every due expreſſion of fidelity and loyalty.</hi> And ſurely it is to be hoped, that the <hi>moſt</hi> foremoſt claim a right of being conſidered as equal with him, and all thoſe who conſtitute his important <hi>we,</hi> in every the like expreſſion. Where then again the neceſſity of reſounding the peculiar fidelity and loyalty of a particular church? But mark the grand diſcrimination between thoſe of his perſuaſion, and all the reſt of the continent. <hi>We eſteem ourſelves</hi> (if all this cannot, by the rules of grammar be called Egotiſm, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt fulſome Noſmetiſm to be met with; <hi>we eſteem ourſelves) bound, not only by preſent intereſt and inclination, but by the more ſacred ties of our religious principles, and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian duty, to ſupport, to the utmoſt, the national civil eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Would not every reader unacquainted with the true character of the coloniſts, neceſſarily conclude, from the great ſtreſs laid on this moſt ſignificant <hi>we,</hi> that ſome of us at leaſt, either do not think it our intereſt, or have no inclination to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the civil eſtabliſhment? Muſt he not neceſſarily conclude, that except the Doctor and his party, all the reſt have either wholly diſcarded the Chriſtian religion; or iniquitouſly perverted it to the partronizing of diſobedience to the ſtate? would any man imagine, that we learnt our religious principles out of the ſame bible, or entertained the ſame ideas about the obedience due to government? But leſt this inſinuation of our ſecret principles, cruel as it is, ſhould prove inſufficient to draw down the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our mother country in that moſt tremendous expreſſion of it, the ſending us a Biſhop, without a farther ſuggeſtion of ſome more overt acts, to deferve her ſevereſt indignation, the Doctor is determined to make thorough work with our political characters: <hi>Accordingly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>no trumpet of ſedition was ever heard to ſound from our pulpits; no ſeeds of diſaffection have been ſuffered more privately to be ſown in our houſes.</hi> And pray in what pulpits has this gentleman ever heard the trumpet of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I think I may challenge him to produce a ſingle inſtance of any other trumpet's having ever been heard to ſound from any diſſenting pulpit, than that very trumpet, which it were to be wiſhed was oftener heard to ſound from all the pulpits in the world, I mean the trumpet, ſo ſolemnly commanded to be blown
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:010857_0063_0F851F8639E98BD8"/>in the 50th of Iſaiah, and the 33d of Ezekiel; even that trumpet which is to warn the people, and to ſhew them their tranſgreſſions. This trumpet, I am confident, is as faithfully ſounded from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, as from epiſcopal pulpits; and I am further confident, that the ſound thereof is of much greater moment to the cauſe of virtue and true religion, than the obſtreperous noiſe of that little paultry Rams-Horn of epiſcopal-Sectarianiſm, (which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly blown, where ever the ſociety will club for a blower,) to increaſe the party by a collection of fugitives from other religious ſocieties; which, with notable aſſurance and the moſt ſolemn profeſſions of truth, is annually repreſented to the diſſenters in Britain, (who are great contributors to this perverted charity) as propagating the goſpel among the native pagans of America. It is in a word, a trumpet of infinitely greater importance to the ſouls of men, than the creaking, ſqueaking, ſkreaking Bag-pipe of Arminianiſm, which is perpetually played by thoſe who have ſolemnly ſworn and ſubſcribed never to play it; and whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural whiſtlings, are enough to whiſtle us all into perdition.</p>
               <p>The Doctor has however, tho' probably without deſign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the true foundation of his exuberant zeal for the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment. <hi>We eſteem ourſelves bound by preſent intereſt, &amp;c. to ſupport to the utmoſt the national civil eſtabliſhment. Accordingly,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>therefore, no trumpet of ſedition was ever heard to ſound from our pulpits,</hi> Is not this a tacit confeſſion, that it is his preſent intereſt that holds him to his duty; and that if he got no more by being a churchman, than others do by being diſſenters, he would blow ſedition upon all the trumpets, and rams-horns, and conck-ſhells he could lay his hands on? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, gentle reader, the mighty power of his magic wand! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had finiſhed the ſentence, theſe ſame ſeditious trumpeters, are all at once metamorphoſed into the moſt villainous gardeners that ever handled rake or mattock; and what ſeed doſt thou imagine they ſow? and in what kind of a garden? and in what manner and form? Why verily it is a ſeed ten times worſe than Devil's weed, or Hemlock ſeed, even the execrable ſeed of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection; and it is ſown in the garden of their chimney-corners, and that in ſo private a manner that no man knoweth thereof, ſave Doctor Chandler alone, and he only gueſſeth thereat.

               <p>THIS ſcurrilous author may pretend to what he pleaſes, but the public is well apprized of his deſign; he wants to be the head of a faction; and to throw the province into confuſion; he is a perfect Hydra; or may more properly be called Legion; for he is poſſeſſed with many devils; they are ſcrubs and ſcavengers; nor are we ignorant of his perſon: He is a long-noſed, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin'd, ugly looking fellow. Nay I have the authority of a doctor of divinity, to call him that animal, before which we are not to throw pearls. He is a man of a rueful length of face, a libertine, a buſy factor in diſſention, of an ambitious diſappointed faction: His papers are ſtuffed with low, ſpurious witticiſms, miſrepreſentations, ſcurrility, buffoonery, falſehood, abuſe and ſlander. He is a cunning fellow, and a pragmatical aſſumer. His faction is enraged to a degree of phrenzy. He is ſucceſſor to Don Quixote, an invidious calumniator, a falſe accuſer of the brethren, and a brother of ſavages. He was a friend to the ſtamp Act; for I never heard that he wrote againſt it, and therefore he did not write againſt it, and therefore he was a friend to it; and how then can he be a friend to religious liberty? yea, I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and intend to repeat it a thouſand times; he was a friend to the Stamp-Act, to the Stamp-Act, he was, was, was, a friend to the Stampt-Act. He is, (or for the ſake of variety, let us have the plural number,) they are public incendiaries, ſowers of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, abuſive adverſaries. He pays not the leaſt attention to truth and decency. He is an abominable hobbler, and a deſtroyer of that harmony which ought now to be ſo greatly encouraged. For what is religious liberty in compariſon of our civil privileges? It is nonſenſe, and not worth contending for. They are preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, independents, Abaddons, Apollions, deiſts, ſons of Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and grandſons of Belzebub, arch-rebels, apoſtates, Browniſts, Muggletonians, fifth-monarchy men, Oliverians, Spinoſiſts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, fanatics, and king-killers. They oppoſed the college, they oppoſed the harmleſs ſcheme of eſtabliſhing epiſcopacy in the manor of Philipſburgh; and would, if they could, beſtride the north-weſt wind, fling the church out of the windows, make the convention dance a hornpipe behind the moon, ſtrike fire out of a cucumber, build ſtone ſences of ſpider's webs, turn the whole world topſey-turvey, and ſet fire to the pacific ocean. Nay, this very ſame identical fellow, who writes againſt the Biſhops in
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:010857_0065_0F851F87A073B188"/>New-York, writes alſo againſt them in Philadelphia. This ſame Whig, ſcrub and ſcavenger, is the ſole and only author, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigator of all the miſchief on the continent, and is the only man who is againſt an American Epiſcopate, tho' not one in a thouſand is for it. He was begotten by deſperation in a total eclipſe of the ſun, on the bodies of ſeven infernal furies Nor does he write from any regard to liberty, but from a diſappointment at a late election. For tho' his Printer can inform any man, that he had agreed to publiſh the Whig before that election; yet, for all that, it was the diſappointment in that election, that was the ſole cauſe and origin of the Whig. Yea, it was alſo the origin of the Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and of Dr. Chauncey's anſwer to Dr Chandler's appeal. The diſappointment I ſay, at a late election: The diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! The diſappointment! This I will alſo repeat a thouſand times; and it is a full anſwer to all that has, or ever can be wrote againſt an American Epiſcopate. He neither values his own reputation, nor the reputation of any one elſe. He has no more conſcience than a dog that p—s againſt a church door.</p>
               <p>They are an unrelenting, perſecuting, bigotted faction, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the church and the clergy. They have ſerved two ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhips in ſlander and defamation. They began with the triple diſcharge of falſehood, malice, and revenge againſt the CHURCH, (the church I ſay, in capitals, that is to ſay, the only church in the colonies, the epiſcopal church,) and the clergy, that is the convention, who are the only clergy in the country. The metamorphoſis of this creature is unaccountable; firſt he was an Independent Reflector, which loſt us half the money out of which we intended to defraud the public, for the public good, that is to ſay the College: Then he was a watch Tower, and gave ſo true and ſhocking an account of our perſecutions and iniquities, that we never can renew them, but the province is alarmed. At preſent he is a Whig, and a Devil of a Whig he is; and ten to one, but before he is a year older, he will ſubmit to circumciſion, and turn Mahometan. I have aſſerted three times already, and intend to do it forty times more, that himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that the Appeal aſks nothing but what is reaſonable and juſt; this I know to be a lie, becauſe he ſays, it is ſpecious, and ſeems to aſk nothing, &amp;c. and then declares in ſubſtance, that none but an ideot will take the appearance for reality. But where is the harm of lying for the church, eſpecially when it can be done ſo eaſily as by the omiſſion of a ſingle word? To return to the argument, he is a dog, and moves his tongue againſt the Appeal; he is a cockatrice, and uſes every art that falſehood can invent, that malice can inſtigate, or revenge can execute. He breaks through all obligations of reſpect and gratitude, of decency and good manners, of truth and honour. Though he is tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:010857_0065_0F851F87A073B188"/>in a country, where there is no eſtabliſhment, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no toleration, yet he paints the very church that tolerates him, in the moſt <hi>odious colours, that falſehood can invent, or malice dictate.</hi> He is a <hi>new ſect, and his religion of yeſterday, a motley mixture of ignorance and pride, hypocriſy and ſuperſtition.</hi> He is the peſt of ſociety, and a combuſtible, fit for eternal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion. He has a chin of a foot long, and a noſe of ſixteen inches. It is true, Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> invites every man to offer his objections to his Appeal. But his Appeal was wrote with real and great ſeriouſneſs, and the author never ſo much as thinks of it but with ſolemnity and devotion; and ſhall ſuch a ſerious, ſolemn, reverend, right-reverend, and thrice-reverend, precious little book as this, be attacked by <hi>ſcrubs,</hi> and <hi>ſcavengers,</hi> and <hi>ſwine.</hi> Beſides, the Whig muſt either write gravely or merrily. When he attempts to be merry, I inſiſt upon it, that he is ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous; and when he writes ſeriouſly, I inſiſt upon it, that he is dull; and is the doctor to be anſwered either with ſcurrility or dullneſs? <hi>He is born with an evil ſpeaking, lying, and ſlandering conſtitution, and he deals out ſlander and invective, as liberally as the diſputants of Billingſgate. They deſerve to be laſhed at the cart's tail. Inflamed with party rage, actuated by low ſelfiſh motives, and goaded on by malice, he pours out a torrent of ſlander. He is in a violent rage, a Jeſuitical ſophiſter, and furious perſecutor, and of intolerant principles, deſigning to enſlave others, amidſt his cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous outcry for liberty. His effrontery and malice, I think de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and would juſtify worſe treatment than a regard to my own character would ſuffer me to give him. He is a ſcribbler, a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, a reviler, a ſniveler, a ſnorter, a roarer, a raver, and a ſpitter of venom.</hi> Thus <hi>have I gently corrected the American Whig,</hi> for the licentiouſneſs of his pen; and whoever denies that I have wrote with the greateſt decency, moderation, and ſtrength of argument, is a villain and a ſcoundrel.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>MY view in theſe letters is not to combate any religious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, nor to oppugn the theological opinions of any man or ſet of men, but to defend the liberties of my country. Had any other ſociety of Chriſtians applied in the ſame manner for an eſtabliſhment, I ſhould have thought it my duty to object to it, and as far as my influence could extend, to oppoſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Biſhop, Prieſt, Preſbyter or paſtor have no magic in them to juſtify with me, any attempt prejudicial to public liberty.</p>
               <p>It is very unfortunate that any diſpute ſhould be raiſed in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, at a criſis, when union of ſentiment and deſign, ſeem eſſentially neceſſary for preſerving our civil rights.<note n="‡" place="bottom">This Affair ſeems to have riſen in the time of the <hi>Stamp-Act.</hi> How ſome people love to fiſh in troubled Waters!</note> A ſhip's crew quarelling in a ſtorm, or when an enemy is within gun-ſhot, does not argue a greater degree of infatuation. For what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or with what view it is ſtarted at this critical time, I do not willingly allow myſelf even to conjecture. For the ſake of their country, their poſterity, and themſelves, I hope the friends and lovers of America, will conſider themſelves no further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this diſpute, than as it relates to civil liberty.</p>
               <p>For the debate, as I view it, is not concerning a Biſhop, nor concerning epiſcopal diſcipline; but about the manner of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Biſhop, and eſtabliſhing that diſcipline in America. It is evident from ſundry Parts of the Appeal, that application has been made to our ſuperiors in Britain to procure an act of parliament to eſtabliſh Epiſcopacy in the colonies.<note n="§" place="bottom">Appeal. Page <hi>52.</hi>—We are told, <q>An Order was obtained from the Crown for <hi>a Bill to be drawn and laid before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for eſtabliſhing an American Epiſcopate;</hi> but when the Affair was in a fair Way of being ſpeedily accompliſhed, the Death of Queen Ann that excellent Princeſs,</q> put a ſtop to it. And we are further informed that "in the Beginning of the next Reign," (George the firſt) <q>the Attempt was renewed, and the Proſpect of Succeſs was moſt encouraging; but it proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</q> The Archbiſhop of Canterbury, and the Biſhop of London, had in this latter Occaſion propoſed, that part of the Lands in St. Chriſtophers, which had belonged to the French Clergy, ſhould be applied to ſupport two Biſhops; one to be ſettled in the Iſlands, the other on the continent of North-America.—Page <hi>80,</hi> we are aſſured "no reaſon has been given to ſuſpect a <q>Departure from the general Plan aimed at.</q> Again, ſame Page, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that his Majeſty is to fix the Places of Reſidence for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> But it muſt be allowed, that whether the preſent attempt "for eſtabliſhing an American Epiſcopate," was begun by ſome of the Miſſionaries,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:010857_0066_0F851F886FF1B268"/>or ſet on foot by the ſociety for propagating the goſpel, who, as Dr. Chandler ſays,) page 53) <q>have <hi>ever been watching</hi> for ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunities of exerting themſelves to obtain it,</q> they could not have hit upon a time more unfavourable to American free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. However I hope the friends of the colonies, whether of the Epiſcopal, or any other church, will unite in oppoſing an attempt, which is in itſelf an open acknowledgment of the claims which the enemies of America have lately ſet up, and which are totally ſubverſive of our rights and liberties.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the application had been made to the parliament of Ireland, or to the legiſlature of Virginia, to eſtabliſh epiſcopacy in New-England, in what light would it have appeared. Or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Scotland were at this day a ſeperate Kingdom, and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians of Pennſylvania and Maryland ſhould apply to the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature of that kingdom, to eſtabliſh the Kirk of Scotland and her diſcipline in America, how would the application be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented?</p>
               <p>The Britiſh empire conſiſts of ſeveral provinces united in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to one prince. The legiſlative power of and for each province, conſiſts of the King or his repreſentatives, with the Deputies of the people in that province. Tho' Great-Britain is now united in one legiſlative body or parliament, it was not many ages ſince, divided into ſeveral diſtricts, with diſtinct legiſlatures in each. At that time it was not pretended, that the laws of one, bound the ſubjects in another province. Each, with the conſent of the ſovereign, or his repreſentative, enjoyed the right of legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation for itſelf. Britain, ſince its union into one legiſlative body, has acquired greater <hi>power;</hi> but whether it has thereby acquired a <hi>right</hi> to make laws to bind the other parts of the Empire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be proved. There is certainly a difference between <hi>power</hi> and <hi>right;</hi> nor does the one follow as a conſequence of the other, for if power gave right, then would the ſtrongeſt have a right to whatever he pleaſed to ſeize on: and <q>the high-way man would have a right to my purſe, who demands it with a piſtol to my breaſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Locke,</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But why ſhould not the Epiſcopalians be upon an equal footing with their Neighbours?<note n="§" place="bottom">See Appeal, Page <hi>42.</hi>
                  </note> I anſwer; are they not on an equal
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:010857_0067_0F851F8921A22B20"/>footing? Are they not permitted, as freely as any other denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to form a "voluntary ſociety"<note n="¶" place="bottom">Ibidem, Page <hi>30.</hi> 
                     <q>The Church conſidered with relation to civil Power, is in the very Nature of it a voluntary Society</q> ſays Dr. Chandler.</note> for the publick worſhip of God, in the way they think moſt agreeable to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They have no Biſhop to ordain the inferior Clergy, and to govern the church and confirm Adults.</q> What hinders? Perhaps it may be ſaid they cannot have a Biſhop, unleſs ſent from England, becauſe the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> muſt not be <hi>interrupted,</hi> and that he cannot be ſent from England, placed in a Dioceſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a revenue according to his rank, without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of his majeſty, as ſupreme head of the church, and without an act of parliament,</p>
               <p>Before I anſwer to this, I ſhould be glad to ſee the edict by which Chriſt has enjoined the unbroken ſucceſſion of Biſhops<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Eutichius,</hi> elected Patriarch of Alexandria, A. D. <hi>933.</hi> ſays, <q>That the twelve Preſbyters conſtituted by <hi>Mark</hi> in the See of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, choſe one of their Number to be Head over the reſt, and the other Eleven laid their Hands on him, bleſſed him and made him Patriarch."—<hi>Jerom,</hi> more ancient than he, relates, that at Alexandria from <hi>Mark</hi> to <hi>Heraclius</hi> and <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> Biſhops, the Prieſts always took one of their Number, whom they ſet in the higheſt Place and called him Biſhop.</q>—Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> a great Name in the Church of England, in his Anſwers to Edward the <hi>VI,</hi> ſays, <q>That tho' in the Admiſſion of Biſhops there be divers comely Solemnities uſed, yet they be not of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, but only for good Order and ſeemly Faſhion; his Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are good without them.</q>—Again, <q>he that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Biſhop needeth no Conſecration by Scripture, for Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and appointing thereunto is ſufficient.</q> See <hi>Stillingfleet's Irenicum,</hi> Cap. <hi>viii.</hi>—No Proteſtant Church, ſave thoſe of England and Ireland, makes any Account of this unbroken Succeſſion of Biſhops.</note> Next I would be glad to know how the Chriſtian Church was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Biſhops for the firſt three centuries, when there was no civil power interpoſed to eſtabliſh them. Whether a ſettled revenue is eſſential to a Biſhop; or whether the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in America (as it is called) is ſo peculiarly different from all other Chriſtian Churches, that even under the fulleſt and freeſt ſtate of religious liberty, it cannot enjoy the "form of its eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical government and diſcipline, without an act of parliament to eſtabliſh it."</p>
               <p>Religion and government are certainly very different things, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for different ends: the deſign of the one being to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:010857_0067_0F851F8921A22B20"/>our temporal happineſs, the deſign of the other to procure the favour of God, and thereby the ſalvation of our ſouls. While theſe are kept diſtinct and apart, the peace and welfare of ſociety is preſerved, and the ends of both anſwered. But by mixing them together, feuds, animoſities and perſecutions have been raiſed, which have deluged the world in blood, and diſgraced hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature.</p>
               <p>In the middle and eaſtern governments of North-America, the legiſlatures have, with great wiſdom, taken care to keep the church diſtinct from the ſtate. They have made laws to ſecure to the people in general and to each member in particular, the full enjoyment of their civil rights, intereſts, and properties; and have armed the Magiſtrate with power to enforce the execution of theſe laws. But at the ſame time individuals are left at full liberty to unite themſelves into ſocieties<note n="‡" place="bottom">In ſome of the Colonies indeed, one religious Society, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, not on Account of Religion, but on Account of certain political Principles, which are ſuppoſed to be inconſiſtent with the good of the State. How far the fears which thoſe Governments have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt that Society are well-founded, I will not undertake to ſay. In <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> where it is tolerated, no inconveniencies have ariſen. However, it is not to be denied, that the Magiſtrate has a right to prohibit the propagating of Opinions or Doctrines, which are contrary to human Society, or to thoſe moral Rules, which are neceſſary to the preſervation of human Society.</note> for the public worſhip of God, in ſuch a manner as they judge acceptable to him, and effectually to procure eternal life and happineſs. This indeed may be diſagreeable to thoſe, who complain, that <q>altars are ſet up againſt altars, and churches againſt churches, and that thoſe who are rejected by one, may be received by another;</q>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Dr. C's <hi>Appeal.</hi>—Page <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> but certainly nothing can be more conſiſtent with reaſon and religion, or more agreeable to the ſincere lovers of liberty.</p>
               <p>How long we ſhall enjoy the happineſs of this conſtitution, if eſtabliſhments can be impoſed on us without our conſent, is very uncertain. Let us therefore with one heart and with one mind unite in ſupport of our common rights, and reſolve to <q>ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not entangled with the yoke of bondage.</q>

               <p>To what this ſpirited correſpondent has here, ſaid I have added ſome notes, to ſhew that if the Epiſcopalians in this country are under any difficulties, they ariſe from themſelves; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:010857_0068_0F851F89EE613310"/>cauſe they have adopted ſome confined notions concerning the Epiſcopal character; or from an arbitrary and needleſs aſſociation of ſtate eſtabliſhment with church-government in their ideas of it; or laſtly from an aſſuming diſpoſition, which prompts, them to claim the ſuperiority over their neighbours, who reject epiſcopacy</p>
               <p>For if the ſame privileges, which other denominations enjoy, would ſatisfy their Clergy, why did not the epiſcopal miniſters of New-York and New-Jerſey, inſtead of ſending ſeven petitions to England for Biſhops, proceed to chooſe one of their number to be their ſuperior, and voluntarily agree to be governed by him. Thus their hierarchy might have been completed, without lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revenue, ſtate appointment, or giving ground of jealouſy to others. The Moravian Biſhops, who ſtand on this footing, never gave any Umbrage.</p>
               <p>But a voluntary epiſcopate, in the primitive way, or as other ſocieties enjoy their forms of diſcipline, will not ſatisfy the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries. <hi>They</hi> and their people are <hi>the church, the American church;</hi> as it were emphatically and excluſively; all others are Hereticks or Schiſmaticks. <hi>They</hi> are <hi>the Church of England in America;</hi> nay, <hi>the national Church,</hi> and of the national religion; and muſt be raiſed upon the depreſſion of all other Churches, whoſe members are already termed <hi>Diſſenters</hi>

               <p>Theſe extravagant claims of ſome of the Miſſionaries, in behalf of about twenty-five thouſand of their people, diſperſed among a million or more of Britiſh ſubjects, who are ſettled between Nova-Scotia and Maryland, are very alarming; eſpecially as many of the epiſcopal lately are utterly averſe to the invidious ſcheme. But the courſe they take to obtain what they ſeek for, by applying to England for an act of the ſtate in their favour, is moſt preſumptuous, unconſtitutional, and ſubverſive of liberty and juſtice.</p>
               <p>How theſe enterpriſing geniuſes came to be authoriſed to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act for all Britiſh America, or at leaſt for all the epiſcopalians in it, does not appear. It is very remarkable, the buſtle about Biſhops ſeems to be confined to colonies generally ſettled by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple averſe to prelacy, in which <q>it would, as Dr. Chandler himſelf confeſſes, Page 47) without diſpute be improper to have any:</q> whilſt in Virginia, and Maryland, where a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous epiſcopal Clergy are provided for under acts of aſſembly, and where the pleas of uſefulneſs and neceſſity would have ſome meaning, there is little ſaid concerning them. Doubtleſs if the people of thoſe provinces, who are generally friends to the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:010857_0068_0F851F89EE613310"/>Church, found it expedient to complete their religious eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments, they would paſs laws for the purpoſe, and carefully aſcertain and limit the duties, privileges, and authority of theſe ſpiritual ſuperiors; which from the peculiar circumſtances of the colonies; from the uncertainty of the law on this ſubject; but eſpecially from the encroaching diſpoſition which this order of men has ſhewn in all Ages, would be abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
               <p>If the propriety of eſtabliſhing dioceſan Biſhops in the colonies was ever ſo apparent and the right of parliament to interfere in our internal police ever ſo clear, yet the coloniſts would ſcarce think it prudent to have an affair ſo delicate, and ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with public liberty, regulated in England. The people there, very remotely intereſted in the conſequences, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably leave it to the Clergy themſelves, to form the plan; as ſeems to have been the caſe, at the cloſe of Queen Ann's reign, when the deſign of <hi>eſtabliſhing an American Epiſcopate by act of parliament,</hi> was on the carpet before. But I hope we are not ſo infatuated as willingly to truſt this momentous affair to ſuch intereſted management. Let us then ſpeak and act for ourſelves, and be watchful that our rights and privileges be not violated, under the ſpecious pretence of advancing the intereſts of religion.</p>

            <p>MR. Whig, when I read two or three of your firſt papers I was ſorry to ſee a ſpirit riſing which tends to irritate and, inflame our brethren of the epiſcopal Church: I ſaid to myſelf, ſurely the Gentleman is pouring his milk into the churn, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to wring their noſes. Pray, Sir! conſider what we fear is that our brethren of the epiſcopal Church will fall into the ſnare that is laid for them, by certain cunning politicians on the other ſide of the water, and become a detached party in oppoſition to the intereſt of the country, and a tool in their hands in oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the liberties of America. We ought to treat the epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians with decency, leſt by provoking our brethren to wrath we induce them to run headlong into the ſnare laid for them. This thought I am confirmed in, by the impreſſion I find is made on their minds by your firſt papers. Tickle is all in a flame, and laſhes every one he meets in his way, and brandiſhes his whip in a very furious manner.</p>
            <p>As for you couſin Tim, I take the liberty to ſpeak a word or two in your ear, tho' I expect you will give me a laſh of your
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:010857_0069_0F851F8AA2257868"/>whip for it, you have aſſumed a falſe name; I know you well, by your whips; as the Philoſopher ſaid, "ſpeak that I may know, you;" your true name is not Tickle, but <hi>Scratch'em.</hi> You have got an ugly pair of claws. If you can't keep your hands off from them, you ought to have your claws cut. As to the title of " <abbr>Eſq</abbr>" with which you honour yourſelf, it is a mere piece of vanity in you, I take you to be one of thoſe diſorderly Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Dr. Chandler ſpeaks of, and ſays they want two or three ſtout Biſhops, from home, to govern them and give them due "Caſtigation."</p>
            <p>You are ſoon angry, and your mouth calleth for ſtrokes: 'tis but a word and a blow with you, if your Biſhop was here now, he would give you due "flagellation" for this. You and Mr. Whig both ſeem diſpoſed to tell certain ugly ſtories about your holy mothers, and great grand fathers you proceed, I expect to hear one of you ſaying to the other, <q>your mother is a tyrant whore;</q> and the other replying, your mother is a baſtard, a hyprocrite and a fanatic. I adviſe you both to forbear and be ſilent. It is not prudent for the pot to call the kettle ugly names. If you muſt have a thorough ſcold, go out into the field, as cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorick Gentlemen do with their ſwords, and ſcold it out between yourſelves; but don't diſturb the publick peace, by brawling in the ſtreets—I recommend to your ſerious conſideration, the juſt and amiable character which an ancient writer gives of the true wiſdom which is from above. To walk in her ſteps is true policy, and beſt ſerves every valuable intereſt.</p>
            <p>I would that all the hot, angry, party Men, and narrow big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goted zealots, on all ſides, would altogether hold their peace: it would be their wiſdom. If the greateſt and beſt man that ever lived was now in America, he would ſay to them, "If ye have bitter zeal and ſtrife in your hearts ye are carnal; and if ye bite and devour each other, like angry dogs fallen together by the ears, take heed leſt ye be conſumed one of another." The fiery zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots of all ſides would do well, in their lucid intervals, to conſider that the ferments they are raiſing, in their wrathful folly, threaten the deſtruction of American liberty and honour. When the Prince of Orange, Britain's deliverer, was croſſing the ſea with his fleet, bringing ſalvation, he was aſſaulted by a furious ſtorm. As he ſat in the great cabbin with ſome of his Officers, at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, the Dutch pilot at helm, was heard repeatedly to cry out, "ſteady,! ſteady!" the prince reply'd, <q>If my father of England had been as wiſe as this honeſt tar, I ſhould not have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to this ſtorm.</q>

Couſin Tim, I obſerve in your laſt pieces you fall to rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Preſbyterians in America, and others, in a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner. You ſeem to act like one of Solomon's mad men, who caſt fire brands, arrows, and death. I ſee you dearly love to flouriſh your whip about. I adviſe you to apply to the general, and beg of him the goodly office of whipper general to the army.— There you may whip the poor rogues till your heart is ſatiated, but forbear your mad whipping of your neighbours; or you will expoſe yourſelf to public ſcorn. "A Biſhop muſt be no ſtriker"— I obſerve too, you uſe the ſtyle of the Romiſh miſſionaries in ſpeak-of the eſpiſcopal Clergy and churches in America, "the Clergy, the Church." As if there were no Clergy and churches in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica but yours; This is very impudent in you, I ſuppoſe you think of the church of England, as the Romiſh Clergy do of the church of Rome, that ſhe is the miſtreſs of all churches in America, out of whoſe communion there can be no true church, nor Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in America.</p>

            <p>SINCE the publication of Num. V. of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> no perſon, "above the capacity of an Idiot," can be at a loſs to determine, what the <hi>Hopes</hi> of the <hi>Faction</hi> are, who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in writing that paper; nor what the particular deſigns are, which they have in view, and which they purſue, <hi>per fas et neſas,</hi> with ſuch <hi>unremitted</hi> Clamour. Avowedly to have ſown the ſeeds of diſaffection, between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her colonies, might have ſubjected them to ſome inconveniencies. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent attack upon the Church and Clergy, was therefore both <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>convenient;—neceſſary,</hi> becauſe the Church, in its very frame, as well as doctrines, is unfavourable to <hi>republican, leveling</hi> principles in government; and the Clergy, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways boaſted of their attachment to the preſent happy conſtitution, (<hi>Amer. Whig,</hi> No. 11) It was <hi>convenient,</hi> becauſe a common News-Paper which circulates far &amp; wide, is an admirable vehicle to propagate thoſe principles, by which the minds of a virtuous, and as yet a loyal people, are it ſeems to be tainted, and their affections to their mother country, debauched. Some ſymptoms and indications of this deſign, were noted by conſiderate people,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:010857_0070_0F851F8B81E634C0"/>in the <hi>Independent reflector,</hi> and <hi>Watch-tower,</hi> of old. The expreſſions in thoſe papers, were indeed more guarded: ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cant phraſes, left us to gueſs what their particular, ultimate end was. But now the maſk is dropped, as being of no farther uſe; ſince "the work is ſo far advanced, that there is no looking back."—A <hi>"Cord,"</hi> it ſeems, more tough than Whalebone, ſtronger than chains of braſs and iron, is <hi>ready ſtretched</hi> from <hi>America,</hi> to <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> every thing of <hi>value</hi> in the mother country, is tied to one end of this cord, the other end is in the <hi>ſtrenuous</hi> hand of the <hi>American Whig-Faction,</hi> who are to <hi>pull</hi> and <hi>tugg—hic Labor, hoc opus eſt</hi> —'till <q>every thing valuable at home, is <hi>drawn</hi> ſafely over, into the ſpacious boſom of the continent of <hi>America.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let the inhabitants of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> be dejected at the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of that horrible deſtruction which is ſoon to overwhelm them, it ought to give them no concern. For <q>in proportion to the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the national glory in <hi>Europe,</hi> will be the brightneſs of its reſurrection in <hi>America.</hi>
               </q> The Whig-Confederacy have been long employed in preparing their grand <hi>Machine</hi> for this new kind of water-conveyance; and in the <q>collection of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for the conſtruction of this glorious fabrick.</q>—viz. "a <hi>regular American conſtitution.</hi>"—Their machine is now at <q>work, and "the transfer of the European part of the great family is ſo ſwift,</q> that in order to accommodate it upon its arrival, <q>before ſeven years roll over our heads, the firſt ſtones muſt be laid.</q> And ſo deeply has the faction laid the plan for their intended <hi>revolution,</hi> that the <hi>American Whig</hi> profanely aſſerts, that no poſſible contingencies, not even the ſore judgments God, war and famine, can hinder its execution: But take it in his own words, tho' I tremble at the horrid impiety, while I tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them;— <q>peace or war; famine or plenty; poverty or affluence; in a word, no circumſtance, whether proſperous or adverſe, can happen to our parent; nay, no conduct of hers, whether wiſe or imprudent; no poſſible temper on her part, whether kind or croſs grained, will put a ſtop to this building.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Like a true <hi>Fanatic,</hi> he alſo boaſts of the preſence of the deity with him, in his inſidious deſigns; and pretends to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>prediſpoſitions</hi> of the Almighty; and—by way of compliment to the Almighty, I ſuppoſe—let us know that theſe <hi>prediſpoſitions</hi> are <hi>well calculated</hi> for the riſe of <hi>America.</hi>— <q>There is no contending with omnipotence, and the <hi>prediſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are ſo numerous, and ſo well adapted to the riſe of <hi>America,</hi> that our ſucceſs is indubitable; and <hi>Britain,</hi> who began the work, will not, cannot withold her aſſiſtance. Her aſſiſtance, did I ſay? ſhe will ſpend all ſhe has,</q>—that ſhe will Mr. <hi>Whig,</hi> before your ſcheme takes place.— <q>nay, ſhe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:010857_0070_0F851F8B81E634C0"/>faſt coming.</q>—pull away my lads— <q>in her own proper perſon, and will deſert her beloved iſland,</q>—<hi>i. e. Britain</hi> will come over and leave herſelf behind.—to complete the ſtupendous and laſting "monument of her power."</p>
            <p>What is to become of the <hi>terra firma</hi> of thoſe iſlands, he has unkindly concealed from us; nor has he told us what thoſe things of no value are, which are to be left behind; for <hi>N. B.</hi> it is <hi>only</hi> every thing of value—in the eſtimation, I ſuppoſe, of this faction—that is to be brought over. We may therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the K—, the Church, and the Biſhops will be left <hi>behind,</hi> as not being of value enough to compenſate the labour of <hi>warping</hi> them acroſs the Atlantic. For if we may judge from the known and avowed principles of the <hi>faction,</hi> theſe things are in their eſtimation, not only of <hi>no value;</hi> they are <hi>worſe;</hi> they are <hi>malignant,—hurtful</hi> and <hi>deſtructive</hi> to any country. Biſhops have already been declared by them, to be the <hi>worſt commodity that can be imported: They</hi> muſt therefore of courſe be reprobated. The Church muſt finally ſtand or fall <hi>with</hi> the Biſhops; the K—muſt be—But judge of his fate, from the fate of one of his predeceſſors, whom God, for the puniſhment of the ſins of the nation gave up, into the hands of this <hi>very faction.</hi> I ſay, this <hi>very</hi> faction;—for it is principles, not men, that make a faction: where principles are the ſame, the faction is the ſame, tho' the men be ſhifted a thouſand times. The things of <hi>value</hi> then, that are to be brought over, are the <hi>ſacred</hi> perſons, and <hi>pious</hi> effects of preſbyterians, independents, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.— —all that differ from the eſtabliſhed Church, except <hi>Quakers;</hi> for <hi>N. B.</hi> the <hi>Quakers,</hi> tho' they have always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved toward the government in the moſt peaceable and orderly way, are as much a <hi>contraband</hi> article, with this <hi>faction,</hi> as the Biſhops themſelves: witneſs the law made formerly by the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts</hi> government againſt the <hi>importation</hi> of Quakers,—witneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſaw made in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> entitled <hi>Hereticks,</hi> by which it was enacted, that no maſter of any veſſel ſhould land any Quakers, without carrying them away under the penalty of £. 20—<hi>Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs</hi>'s ſum. vol. I. 447—vol. II. 340—which law was diſallowed by Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> as <hi>being contrary to that liberty of conſcience, which was allowed to all diſſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus far purſued this <hi>filthy Dreamer</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who ſpeaks evil of dignities,</hi> I beg the <hi>candid</hi> of every denomination, and of every claſs, to reflect—whether ſuch publications as this 5th Numb. of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> have not a direct tendency to raiſe ſuſpicions and jealouſies in the mother country, againſt the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies?—whether it be conſiſtent with our <hi>intereſt</hi> not to ſay <hi>duty,</hi> to give any juſt offence, any <hi>reaſonable</hi> cauſe of diſguſt, to the government at home?—whether the colonies have not reaſon
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:010857_0071_0F851F8C2F1B5768"/>to look upon the author of this number of the <hi>Whig,</hi> as an <hi>incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary,</hi> endeavouring to diſunite the colonies from <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> For what purpoſe can theſe ſentiments be propagated, but to raiſe a ſpirit of animoſity againſt the government at home, by foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prejudices of the ignorant, and winding up <q>their hopes to all the confidence of aſſurance.</q>—Tho' according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of this prophet, the completion of theſe hopes, muſt end in THE RUIN AND DESTRUCTION OF GREAT-BRITAIN.</p>
            <p>No <hi>Whig</hi> that ever exiſted can have a warmer attachment to to the intereſts of Britiſh <hi>America,</hi> than I have. It is the country that g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>e me birth; that holds all the dear connections of life. No one could rejoice more to ſee it flouriſh in commerce, arts and ſciences,—in every thing that can make a people <hi>virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, happy and great;</hi>—in the full and quiet enjoyment of all <hi>civil and religious liberty.</hi>—But I cannot <hi>pleaſe</hi> myſelf with contemplating the ruin and deſtruction of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>— avert it heaven! may ſhe ever continue the miſtreſs of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, —the grand ſupport of <hi>liberty,</hi> the ſcourge of oppreſſion and tyranny!—may all diſguſts, ſuſpicions, jealouſies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mother country and the colonies, utterly ceaſe, and be for ever buried in oblivion!—may they ever be <hi>cloſely, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, affectionately</hi> united; mutually happy, in the mutual advantage they receive from each other! and may the <hi>Wretch</hi> who attempts to diſunite them, meet with that juſt contempt from the public, which I dare ſay, the <hi>American Whig,</hi> has before this time, in part experienced, from a ſenſible, virtuous and loyal people.</p>
            <p>The remainder of this hodgepodge of ſedition, nonſenſe, folly, falſehood and ſlander, is employed againſt the <hi>peculiar</hi> objects of his ſpleen and malice, the Church and Clergy. After ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place declarations of <hi>reſpect</hi> to the Clergy, he repreſents them as—"longing to tipple the wine of fornication;"—to take the <hi>intoxicating ſip</hi>—with "the ſcarlet whore," and to <q>
                  <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file</hi> the nations.</q>—How the <hi>Whig</hi> can judge ſo exactly of the ſtrength of this <hi>wine of fornication,</hi> I cannot conceive, as he will hardly <hi>own,</hi> that <hi>he himſelf</hi> was ever ſo intoxicated with it, as to <hi>defile the nations.</hi> Poſſibly a <hi>Noſe</hi> of the incredible length of "ſixteen inches," according to the menſuration of his correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent Jack-Catch,—<hi>par nobile fratrum</hi>—may have helped him to form a judgment of it; or poſſible there is ſome analogy between the <hi>wine of fornication,</hi> and the <hi>luſt of fornicating.</hi> If ſo we may caſily judge how he came by his knowledge, viz,— having felt the <hi>force</hi> of the one, he eaſily gueſed at the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps this <hi>fornicating</hi> period is to be underſtood <hi>myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and—"longing to tipple the wine of fornication," means
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:010857_0071_0F851F8C2F1B5768"/>the <hi>the luſt of worldly power;</hi>—if ſo. I ſhall take the liberty of replying by <hi>recrimination,</hi> which <hi>William Livingſton,</hi> in his letter to the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> ſays "is reputed to be juſt."— If then it be true, as her enemies ſay, that the Church and Clergy have now and then taken a "ſip of this bowl,"—it is equally true, that the <hi>Engliſh independents</hi> have ever been moſt beaſtly drunken with it.</p>
            <p>Their whole exiſtence hath been one continued revel of intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſo that their <hi>nakedneſs</hi> have been ever <hi>uncovered,</hi> and <hi>ſhameful ſpewing</hi> hath been conſtantly <hi>on their glory.</hi>—The Metaphor is the <hi>American Whig's,</hi> he cannot be angry at my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Whig</hi> ſays, "he is ſenſible they"—the Clergy— "diſavow all noxious deſigns,"—that they— <q>abjure the roughneſs of violence.</q>—I wiſh I could return him the compliment;—but on the contrary, I am conſtrained by the paper now under conſideration, to believe, that ſhould his ſect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that dominion in the colonies, which his ſoul ſo ardently longs after, the "fires of perſecution would" indeed <q>burn with hotter vengeance <hi>here</hi> than in any other part of the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Appeal</hi> propoſes the introduction of American Biſhops, for the purpoſes of <hi>ordaining</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> the Clergy, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming</hi> thoſe of the laity, that deſire it.—conſcience is pleaded, in favour of the members of the Church;—they ſay it is <hi>againſt</hi> their conſcience, to ſubmit to any other paſtors, but thoſe that have received <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> orders. Thoſe of her members that are deſirous of entring into orders, that they may ſerve God and their generation in that honourable ſtate, affirm, that they cannot in conſcience ſubmit to an ordination performed by perſons, who they think have no authority to confer the powers of the Chriſtian prieſthood.</p>
            <p>This whole plea of conſcience is ridiculed by the <hi>American Whig.</hi> He cannot ſuppoſe a <hi>Churhman</hi> to be governed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in any thing, I muſt therefore conclude, that he is utterly unacquainted with the force of conſcience <hi>himſelf;</hi> and that, of conſequence, he is always ready, whenever it is in his power, to <hi>perſecute</hi> thoſe, who he ſuppoſes, are not <hi>governed</hi> by conſcience, but are carrying on a horrid deſign of ruining and enſlaving the country, by bringing in a "Biſhop" as a ſpy,"—"a miniſter of the church" "as much to be dreaded as a late miniſter of ſtate."</p>
            <p>With regard to the preciſe meaning of the words <hi>primitive Biſhop,</hi> it was ſufficiently determi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by the <hi>powers,</hi> with which it was propoſed that Biſhops ſhould be ſent to <hi>America,</hi> viz.— To ordain and govern the Clergy, and confirm ſuch of the laity as deſired it.—No great powers have been aſked for, wiſhed for, or expected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="unknown:010857_0072_0F851F8CF43F9858"/>
But if the <hi>Whig</hi> will need ſuppoſe that poverty, diſtreſs and perſecution, are eſſential to the character of a primitive Biſhop; it is more than probable, that the <hi>American</hi> Biſhops will be <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> primitive. No revenues, no one ſingle worldly advantage, has been aſked for them; and the <hi>Whig</hi> is laying up in ſtore a good <hi>magazine of perſecutions again their arrival.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it pleaſed God, that the Chriſtian religion ſhould make its way into the world, thro' the poverty, reproach, perſecution and death of the firſt preachers of it, that his power might the more conſpicuouſly appear in its eſtabliſhment; no good reaſon can there be drawn to ſhew why a man, who from a ſincere deſire to ſerve God in his Church, and to qualify himſelf for that purpoſe, has ſpent his little fortune in his education, and in an expenſive voyage of a thouſand leagues for ordination, ſhould not live de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and comfortably upon the income of his Pariſh. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of the Clergy ſeems a favourable topic with the <hi>American Whig;</hi> and I doubt not it would pleaſe him much, to ſee them reduced to the moſt abject ſtate of penury and contempt—to all the perſecution and tortures which the firſt preachers of the GOSPEL underwent.</p>
            <p>The education of a lawyer is not more expenſive, than that of a Clergyman; the profeſſion requires no greater abilities,—no greater labour; nor is it, that I know of, either more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or more uſeful. Yet I dare ſay the <hi>American Whig</hi> would not think 1500 or 2000 <abbr>l.</abbr> a Year <hi>too much,</hi> even tho' it ſhould be obtained from the <hi>poor,</hi> the <hi>fatherleſs</hi> and the <hi>Widow.</hi>

            <p>"I Have read the letter you ſent me, from Mr, Livingſton to the Biſhop of Landaff with particular pleaſure. I am well acquainted with Mr. Livingſton, and from his known good ſenſe I had great expectations when I heard that ſuch a piece was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out: The honeſt manly way in which he has addreſs'd the Biſhop, muſt, I think, recommend him even to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>"In civil affairs the times have been ſuch, of late, that bad, very bad men have found their way up to thoſe in power by the moſt infamous miſrepreſentations of the wealth, loyalty, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this country; and I fear the Epiſcopal Clergy, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſt of the times, are falling too much into the ſame

A prime miniſter, (even Mr. G.) may ſtand unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachable, ſhould he be able to lay upon the table the opinions and earneſt reccommendations of the firſt order of people that the crown knows in this country, in favour of taxation, and ev'ry other ſevere meaſure that has been taken, in conſequence of the rebellious colours Americans have been painted in. The manner in which our Clergy, (for I am a Churchman) aim at ſtealing a Biſhop into America, is low; and I ſincerely wiſh that Mr. Livingſton's letter may put the Biſhop of Landaff upon review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his authorities for the ſtate that he has given the public of this country: and I think <hi>He</hi> will ſtand in ſome meaſure excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, ſhould he be able to give the ſociety's <hi>miſſionaries</hi> as vouchers for the ſentiments that he has thrown out. Indeed I think his lordſhip cannot well avoid entering upon this buſineſs in good earneſt, after the late publications that I have ſeen. Dr. Tillotſon whom I admire in all his writings, and who has done ſo much honour to the church of England by his moderation, candour, and good ſenſe, ſays in one of his ſermons, <hi>ſome men have a ſcurvy trick of lying for the honour and glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would be underſtood to think that the government at home, both in church and ſtate, had no premeditated deſign to injure this country, but they have been moſt ſhamefully and groſsly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon in the repreſentations they have receiv'd, and from ſuch quarters, as they had a right to expect <hi>pure facts only.</hi> And let me whiſper a ſingle obſervation to Dr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> that ſuch a ſort of Biſhop as he has ſketched out for America, without his full ſuit of power and glory would by no means anſwer the Doctor's purpoſes.—It would be like the young gentleman, who for the ſake of being in bed with his miſtreſs, conſented to be ſwaithed round with a whole piece of new linnen, but was afterwards very reſtleſs indeed, and ſomewhat impatient of his confinement."</p>

            <head>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE. May 16, 1768. THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. X]</head>
            <p>I HAVE engaged in this courſe of periodical papers, as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the general liberties of my fellow ſubjects in North-America. I have entered upon the queſtion of an American epiſcopate, and a conſideration of Doctor <hi>Chandler's appeal to the public,</hi> in favour of it; as I eſteem the queſtion to be of greater importance, in its conſequences, to my native country, than the impoſition of any cuſtoms, or commercial reſtrictions. which affect not the right of conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:010857_0073_0F851F8DAAA82698"/>
The Doctor addreſſes the public, with an air of the higheſt aſſurance, of the propriety and expediency of his plan; and, with deſign no doubt, to engage his ſuperiors in the immediate proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it, very ſhrewdly inſinuates, that the apprehenſion of any general popular diſcontent or oppoſition, is entirely groundleſs. <q>Of any conſiderable diſcontent or uneaſineſs, (ſays he,) there is no reaſon to be apprehenſive. Whatever notions the diſſenters of this country may have formerly entertained, concerning the church: yet of late years they have greatly come off from their prejudices—excepting here and their a hot-headed writer, or a pragmatical enthuſiaſt.</q> So alſo to prejudice unwary minds, againſt any preſumptuous opponents, he anticipates his clerical anathemas of every objection, <q>that may be hereafter ſuggeſted againſt American Biſhops,</q> as <q>proofs rather of the dexterity or ill-will of the inventors, than of the real fears and uneaſineſs of the inhabitants—that artful men may raiſe objections, in a way that ſhall appear plauſible to thoſe who are unacquainted with the legerdemain of cavillers and ſophiſts.</q> And that "whoever employs his talents in this exerciſe," that is, gentle reader, of offering any objections to his darling epiſcopate, <q>is as unworthy of the public attention, as the child that engages at crambo or puſh-pin.</q> This reader, is the language of the celebrated Doctor <hi>Chandler,</hi> whoſe fame for ingenuity and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, has of late, been ſo much trumpetted by his brethren of the Clergy. Theſe are the candid and ingenuous remarks of our reverend appellant; who, in the introduction of his appeal, with ſo much ſeeming fairneſs, had even invited objections, that <q>they might be fairly and candidly debated, before the tribunal of the public.</q> Did the Doctor hope, by thus previouſly thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pontifical bull, to ſilence all oppoſition? Or, forgetting his ſituation, before the impartial bar of the public, did he now conceive himſelf in a ſpiritual court, and his cauſe in the deciſion of an epiſcopal judge, where the <hi>verbum ſacerdotis</hi> would have all the influence he could wiſh; where, to gain his point his ſingle aſſertion, againſt the teſtimony of twenty laies, might poſſible be ſufficient,—that there <q>neither now is, or ever has been, any conſiderable noiſe or public clamour,</q> on the expectation of an American epiſcopate,—that, <q>of any conſiderable diſcontent and uneaſineſs, there is no reaſon to be apprehenſive;</q> and that all ſuggeſtions to the contrary, proceed merely from the <hi>malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> of <q>here and there, a hot-headed writer, or pragmatical enthuſiaſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to any "public clamour upon this account," before the public had been informed of the ſeven famous petitions, and the united attempts of the clergy, to introduce biſhops into this
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:010857_0073_0F851F8DAAA82698"/>country; perhaps the Doctor had not "heard of any", nor, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, did he "foreſee any." But I may now appeal to himſelf, whether, ſince the publication of his appeal; a very general uneaſineſs is not viſible among the people; and a general popular oppoſition expreſſed againſt his epiſcopal project, among all ranks of men, as they become daily more diffuſively acquainted with the reality of the deſign. The Doctor will unqueſtionably find himſelf groſsly miſtaken, in his opinion of the tame acquieſcence of the inhabitants. And, if the zealous opponents of his American epiſcopate, merit the genteel appellation of "noiſy hot-heads, and pragmatical enthuſiaſts," he will hear of not a few ſuch, among the lay members of his own communion. Let him look into the dominion of Virginia, where, it our information may be depended upon, the laity of the church of England, are warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and almoſt univerſally oppoſed to it. And I am perſuaded, that ſhould the voices of the epiſcopalians only, be fairly collected throughout the colonies, there would be found a majority, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their averſion to the project of introducing the Engliſh eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical hierarchy into America. Should any Britiſh miniſtry therefore be found ſo weak, or ſo corrupt, as to betray the true intereſt, and diſregard the tranquility of the provinces, by the eſtabliſhment of ſpiritual lordſhips; for my part, I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no ſcene more likely to open, than ſuch a one as we have recently ſeen; I mean the conduct of the populace with reſpect to the officers appointed under the late unpopular ſtatute: Nor would I be anſwerable for the ſafety of the ableſt prelate that ever wore a mitre, was he to arrive in this country, under the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a <hi>Proteſtant American Biſhop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſooth the public into a favourable opinion of, and quiet ſubmiſſion to the ſpiritual yoke, the Doctor aſſures them, that really nothing more is deſigned than a mere primitive epiſcopacy, ſtripped of all its temporal and adventitious appendages, and without <hi>any authority derived from the ſtate.</hi> This is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended fundamental argument for the appeal, for this American epiſcopal ſuperſtructure;— <q>It has long been ſettled (ſays he) by <hi>our friends and ſuperiors</hi> at home, and the Clergy of this country have often ſignified their entire approbation and acquieſcence therein, that the Biſhops to be ſent to America, will have no authority but purely of a ſpiritual and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal nature, ſuch as is <hi>derived altogether from the church, and not from the ſtate.</hi>
               </q> And for the truth of this declaration, the Doctor appeals to every reader, "who is accquainted with the matter." If by "friends and ſuperiors at home," he means the miniſtry and government, I muſt, in my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>n appeal to every man, who has the leaſt acquaintance with the civil and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal eſtabliſhment of the mother-country, for the falſity of it? as
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:010857_0074_0F851F8E73A8E250"/>no ſuch ſyſtem ever has or can be adopted by the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in any conſiſtency with its conſtitutional principles. It by "friends and ſuperiors," he means the dignified clergy of the Church of England, his declaration is as idle as their plan is chimerical, as neither can have the leaſt weight or operation, unleſs we can ſuppoſe the Britiſh legiſlature to be entirely at the will and pleaſure of their ſpiritual lordſhips: or, that they will ſtrike at the fundamental principles of the political machine, in ſo eſſential a point; and thereby raiſe a ferment among the commons of England, as well as America, merely to gratify the deſires of the clergy. Therefore if the grand baſis of the Appeal be found chimerical and abſurd, the ſuperſtructure will neceſſarily fall. If his lordſhip of America is to have <q>no other authority but purely of a ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical nature, ſuch as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived altogether from the church, and not from the ſtate; and even this power is only to operate upon the clergy, and not on the laity,</q> whence in the name of common ſenſe, the propriety of this long Appeal! theſe pathetical addreſſes to the public? Whence theſe terrible outcries of <hi>partiality, perſecution,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd hardſhips,</hi> ſufficient to excite the pity of every church in Chriſtendom? Is not all the power here contended for, in the hands of the clergy themſelves? Why is the civil government called upon to interpoſe? Did ever any miniſter of the church of England receive the leaſt moleſtation in the exerciſe of his cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal office in any part of America? have not commiſſaries been heretofore appointed in different places, and have they not always been treated in a manner, worthy their ſacred character?— If "no authority is to be derived from the ſtate," for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is the ſtate applied to, and ſo pathetically folicited? And why theſe proteſtations of being "conſcious of no crimes with regard to the ſtate?" If none are to be affected but the clergy, why are the laity addreſſed with all this warmth of expoſtulation, and ſeeming vehemence of paſſion? Amidſt all this ſtrange incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency and jargon, the world will ſuſpect ſome unavowed ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical machinations; and that tho' <hi>the voice may be Jacob's voice, yet the hands are the hands of Eſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us, for argument's ſake, ſuppoſe the plan to be carried into execution, and an act of parliament obtained for the creation of an American Biſhop, upon ſuch anti-conſtitutional principles, diveſting his lordſhip of all the temporal powers belonging to the Engliſh Epiſcopate—What, in this caſe, would be the natural reflections of our fellow ſubjects, the inhabitants of South-Britain, on ſo ſtrange a production?—Would they not have reaſon for ſuch reflections as theſe— <q>The Americans are a people tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their liberty; who have ſucceſsfully oppoſed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of biſhops, as political perſons dangerous to their
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:010857_0074_0F851F8E73A8E250"/>civil and religious privileges. Our parliament have now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly acknowledged this; and in favour of American liberty, have deprived their Biſhops of all temporal juriſdiction; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined them ſolely to "the exerciſe of the original powers of their office" in the Chriſtian church. If fellow ſubjects are thus indulged with an exemption from eccleſiaſtical dominion, why ought we to remain ſhackled with a yoke, which we and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſo hardly borne?</q>—it is plain, the Doctor takes it for granted, that the temporal powers of the Engliſh hierarchy, are not to be admitted here, as incompatible with the civil and religious rights of the community. What would be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch reflections as theſe, among the commons of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? Would any miniſter eſpouſe a meaſure, that might have a tendency to excite ſuch reflections? For, tho,' the pretence of diſburdening the mother country, by a taxation of her American children, might blind the eyes of the populace to their true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and lead them to approve an injurious Stamp-Act; yet in the preſent caſe, there could be no ſuch pretence, and they might ſoon cry out for the like indulgence. And can it be thought probably, that the dignify'd clergy themſelves would willingly ſuffer a continual acknowledgment of an anti-chriſtian power, as ſubſiſting in the Engliſh eccleſiaſtical hierarchy—inconſiſtent with that fundamental maxim of the great founder of Chriſtianity, <hi>my kingdom is not of this world?</hi> Are theſe gentlemen at once become to mortified to worldly grandeur, worldly power, and worldly aſſluence, as to wiſh for a diſſolution of that dignity and authority, in the epiſcopal order here, which they are themſelves exerciſing every day?—'Tis a ridiculous pretence not to be impoſed upon an American underſtanding, even by the <q>plauſible arts and legerdemain of <hi>clerical</hi> ſophiſtry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But can any ſenſible American imagine, that his liberty or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be long ſecure, even ſhould Biſhops be eſtabliſhed in the colonies, in the very harmleſs character pretended. From whence would their gentleneſs proceed? Not from want of inclination to exerciſe the powers of the Engliſh Epiſcopate—but from the reſtraint of an act of parliament—an act, which being paſſed in direct repugnancy to the conſtitution, and rendering the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican, independent of the Engliſh eſtabiiſhment; would ſoon be found to be inconſiſtent with a juſt ſyſtem of politics: Nor would ecleſiaſtical policy fail to ſet every engine at work, for the abolition of an act ſo invidions in itſelf, and derogatory to the epiſcopal character. And would their American lordſhips, upon their full inveſtiture with the conſtitutional powers of the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal office, in Chriſtian renderneſs to the laity here, refuſe to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them, or return to their native country? No, ſurely; but rather would they not piouſly adopt, with a little variation, the
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:010857_0075_0F851F8F4479F730"/>language of our reverend Doctor— <q>A diſpoſition to flight the higheſt puniſhments, the church could inflict, had become general; the voice of reaſon was no longer heard, nor the ſtrength of argument regarded; and <hi>tho' for reaſons of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian policy,</hi> no attempts were, <hi>at firſt,</hi> made for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſcipline of the church, <hi>under our American Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate,</hi> ſo far as it related to private members, (it being at that time, a matter rather to be <hi>wiſhed for and deſired,</hi> than rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally attempted,) yet thanks to God! it is now eſtabliſhed, and our epiſcopal power is full and complete.</q>—Behold now, my countrymen, the banners of epiſcopal dominion lifted up in your land! See your ſacred incloſures, where once you ſat undiſturbed, under your own vines, and enjoying the fruit of your own fig-trees, now ravaged and laid waſte by that dreadful monſter, called a SPIRITUAL COURT!</p>

            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all the ſeeming candour and moderation of the pitiful ſcribbler of the <hi>lonely Cottage,</hi> it is not difficult to any reader of diſcernment, to diſcover the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the <hi>high,</hi> even under all the diſguiſe of the <hi>low, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and the <hi>wolf</hi>'s hide (to make uſe of a common ſimile) thro' the tatters of the <hi>ſheep's</hi> ſkin. Perſons of penetration will pretty readily ſee, that his piece was intended as an <hi>opiate,</hi> to calm the diſquieting apprehenſions of the public, and as an <hi>anti-emetic,</hi> to counteract the ſeveral emetic draughts, lately adminiſtered by our political phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in order to enable <hi>America</hi> to diſgorge the <hi>ſugar'd arſenical pills,</hi> preſcrib'd by Dr. Ch—r; but this paltry quack has, to his <hi>opiate,</hi> &amp;c injudiciouſly added ſo many ingredients of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary tendency (of which he ſeems not to have known the virtues) that his compoſition muſt needs have an effect, contrary to that which he deſign'd, on at leaſt a very conſiderable part of his <hi>begotted</hi> patients; but leſt ſome ſhou'd be more affected by the former than by the latter, I beg leave to caution the public againſt ſwallowing the doſe.</p>
            <p>The principal nauſeous and bitter ingredients (to purſue for a moment longer the allegory) in this ſtupid mountebank's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:010857_0075_0F851F8F4479F730"/>are an impudent <hi>charge of bypocriſy,</hi> and impertinent <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminations</hi> againſt, an inſolent <hi>triumph</hi> over, and a worn out (yet groundleſs and miſtaken) <hi>interpretation of the conduct of the preſbyterian party.</hi> Theſe I ſhall make remarks upon in their order, as they conſtitute the ſubſtance of the whole, and perhaps afterwards take ſome notice of ſome things leſs material, or at leaſt leſs <hi>tautologiz'd</hi> upon.</p>
            <p>This pretended <hi>Low Churchman,</hi> charges the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> with <hi>canting and roaring,</hi> and <hi>ſounding the trumpet of diſſention, &amp;c.</hi> out of <hi>hypocriſy.</hi> If I have often already been unjuſtly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled and chaſtis'd by a certain perſon, and, after I have fled away from his cruelty, and been betray'd by falſe brethren, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee the ſame inſtruments of torture preparing for me as before; what right has any <hi>dunce</hi> in the univerſe to impute my out-cries to <hi>hypocriſy?</hi> Or ſhou'd one of my betrayers call my cries <hi>canting and roaring,</hi> and blame them as <hi>hypocritical,</hi> and yet at the ſame time inadvertently acknowledge, that he and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, had by their artful machinations, expos'd me to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures I dreaded; what man of honour is there but muſt deſpiſe him as a villain? who then can help deſpiſing this wretched ſcribbler, who (line 12) has implicitly, but inadvertently, own'd that <hi>ſnares</hi> have <hi>indeed</hi> been laid for Diſſenters, and that his party is a <hi>deſigning</hi> one; tho' he wou'd fain perſuade the public, that the oppoſite one is more ſo? 'Tis true indeed, he levels his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious reflections profeſſedly againſt the <hi>preſbyterians</hi> only, and brings no expreſs charges againſt Diſſenters of other denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but this tenderneſs of his has its motive; and is no doubt, the reſult of the ſtale ſyſtem of church-politics this ſcribbler's party has long ſince made uſe of, and deſigned to divide Diſſenters of different denominations, tho' their intereſts, with regard to the eſtabliſhment of epiſcopacy, are inſeparably connected. From theſe principles of low cunning, he takes care to charge no <hi>canting</hi> and <hi>roaring,</hi> no <hi>hypocriſy and double dealing,</hi> upon the members of the <hi>Independent, Dutch, Luthuran, Ana-Baptiſt, Moravian or Quaker</hi> Churches: but the poor <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> forſooth (becauſe they are ſomewhat more jealous of their religious &amp;c. liberties than others, and therefore in general are more active in their own defence) muſt be accuſed of <hi>canting and roaring,</hi> with a view of <hi>diſturbing the public tranquility, and raiſing commotions in the community, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> Would not any man of ſenſe laugh at a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who, on hearing one of his fellow ſubjects <hi>roar,</hi> when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended he was about to be unreaſonably chaſtis'd, ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his vociſerations to an <hi>aim at diſturbing the public tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility &amp;c?</hi> Moſt certainly. From what I have ſaid, ſome may perhaps think I am myſelf a <hi>Preſbyterian;</hi> I am not; but wou'd as zealouſly oppoſe <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> as <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> domination. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:010857_0076_0F851F9005913B60"/>tho' I wiſh the zeal of the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> was more <hi>prudent,</hi> I can't help alſo wiſhing that, on the preſent occaſion, all denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Diſſenters were as <hi>zealous</hi> as the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to this ſcribbler's recriminations; and here I will grant him all he can reaſonably deſire. I will allow that human nature is univerſally (without regard to religious diſtinctions) the ſame; that pride, ambition and thirſt for power, is a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> as well as <hi>Epiſcopalian</hi> vice; and I will agree with him, that no rational man, wou'd <hi>deſire to ſee Presbyterianiſm rampant and unbridled in dmerica;</hi> and in theſe conceſſions I'm well aſſur'd, from their writing, already publiſh'd, thoſe <hi>doughty ſcribblers thoſe diſponding incendiaries, the American Whig and Centinel,</hi> will readily concur with me; tho' I fancy we ſhall none of us grant, that, we are fully aſcertain'd by any <hi>hiſtorian,</hi> that there never was a <hi>Presbyterian individual,</hi> but what had ſo evident a <hi>thirſt for power</hi> as to become, on that account, the ſubject of an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial</hi> hiſtory.—And what wou'd this ſtupid mortal infer from all this, and what advantage wou'd he make of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions? Why truely this—that I have a right to perfecute, and lord it over the conſcience as well as the property of a man, who, I have reaſon, or imagine I have reaſon, to believe, wou'd if it were in his power, treat me in the ſame manner; or at leaſt, that, if he loves to' torture others, he is juſtly chargeable with <hi>hypocriſy and double dealing, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> if he cries out, when he apprehends he is ſoon to be tortured himſelf. In ſhort, recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, on ſuch an occaſion, are miſerable arguments, and have no imaginable tendency, but to add oil to the flame, increaſe animoſities, and <hi>diſturb</hi> (what this ſcribbler pretends to be ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about) <hi>the public tranquility &amp;c.</hi> Whatever incroachments Preſbyterians may have <hi>formerly</hi> made on the religious or civil privileges of others, it is evident they are <hi>now</hi> exerting themſelves merely in the defence of their own, and therefore what they may have done heretofore is nothing to the preſent purpoſe; but what Epiſcopalians are attempting at this day, is an intereſting matter, which (to uſe the cottager's words) <hi>does as intimately affect every religious denomination upon the continent, as the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians:</hi> But if they are not <hi>ignorant of,</hi> I fear they are too <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive to,</hi> their <hi>devices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall next juſt take a view of our ſcribbler, in the ridiculous attitude of a childiſh but inſolent <hi>triumph;</hi> which adds neither honour to himſelf, reputation to his party, nor force to his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Whatever joy, he, as a narrow ſpirited partizan, might have conceived from the ſucceſs of the epiſcopalians in election jobbing, and however great a malicious pleaſure he might have received from the ill ſucceſs of the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to obtain a <hi>charter,</hi> any boy in the ſtreet could have advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:010857_0076_0F851F9005913B60"/>him to ſpare his inſults, as being no proofs, either of his good ſenſe, or the juſtice of his cauſe; and any boy of ſpirit had rather be diſappointed, and even drubbed in a boxing match, than be laughed at. Misfortunes and diſappointments may be borne with patience, as the lot of humanity; but inſults under misfortunes are intolerable, unleſs, as ſometimes happens, the author ſhews himſelf not worth regarding.</p>
            <p>This <hi>violent-moderate, this High-Low Churchman,</hi> in order to divert our attention, from the attempts of his party, would ſain perſuade us, that the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> have long been aiming to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh <hi>Presbyterianiſm</hi> in America. But what proofs of this does he produce? Why as many as there are hairs on my nails:—We muſt take his word for it. What man, but he who tries to beat down a ſtone wall with his head, acts a more fooliſh part than he, who, when accuſed, defends himſelf againſt his accuſer, only by groundleſs recriminations, which every child almoſt can diſprove? This is evidently the caſe with our ſcribbler; for, ſhould the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> aim at ſuch an eſtabliſhment, the attempt would be no leſs fooliſh than his charge is groundleſs. Should they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obtain an act of parliament, in favour of ſuch an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, could they hope to ſucceed? No. Should they obtain a vote of the houſes of aſſembly, in the different provinces, for ſuch a purpoſe, would not the act be thrown out by the councils, rejected by the governors, or repealed by the king? Certainly. Have they ever avowed ſuch a deſign? Let all America witneſs. Have they ſecretly concerted ſuch a <hi>favourite ſcheme, ſuch a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling purpoſe?</hi> Speak ye deſerters from <hi>Preſbyterianiſm,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if you can, any ſuch myſteries of iniquity, by telling us the time, place, &amp;c. Have any of the <hi>deſponding incendiaries</hi> plead for ſuch an eſtabliſhment? Far from it—Both the <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Centinel</hi> oppoſe all eſtabliſhments whatſoever, and ſo will every unprejudiced man, who conſiders the nature of the goſpel church, and truly loves his neighbour as himſelf. What foundation then has this ſcribbler for his injurious concluſions? Truly none at all; and none but a perſon of conſummate impudence, would have had the effrontery to <hi>advance</hi> (I cannot ſay <hi>draw</hi>) them. Becauſe the Preſbyterians in this city have petitioned for a charter, for the ſecurity of their <hi>particular</hi> church from encroachments, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted themſelves during the late election in favour of a gentleman, whom they conſidered as a powerful advocate for diſſenting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege (though the epiſcopal church could have been in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from even a whole houſe of ſuch) they are repreſented as aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a <hi>general</hi> eſtabliſhment of <hi>Preſbyterianiſm.</hi> Horrid injuſtice! to conſtrue ſelf defence into an aſſault, and infer ambitions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns from a dread of eccleſiaſtical bondage! but it has long been the practice of deſigning perſons, to charge their own crimes on
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:010857_0077_0F851F90D85CD100"/>thoſe they could not enſnare; and every body knows that <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi>'s wife, becauſe ſhe could not raviſh <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſwore a rape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>him.</hi> This may ſerve as a counterpart to this ſcribber's ſtuff about the <hi>tribunes,</hi> and to ſhew with what propriety his 5th paragraph might be retorted upon himſelf, and his party. He ſeems to ſuppoſe the ill ſucceſs of the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> in the late e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, gave riſe to the <hi>Whig.</hi> Poor fellow! notwithſtanding the ſharpneſs of his noſe, he has taken a wrong ſcent, as Doctor C—r and others did before him. To my certain knowledge, the <hi>Whig</hi> has done no more, in publiſhing his paper, than was deſigned long enough before the election; and if, in conſequence of the refuſal of a charter to the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> church in this city, he has written in order <hi>to recover loſt ground,</hi> who is to blame but thoſe reſtleſs mortals, who do miſchief for miſchief's ſake; and can have no inducement to obſtruct the ſecurity of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but their own iniquitous deſigns upon them. Recovery of <hi>loſt ground</hi> is one thing, and encroachment another; and I leave the world to judge of the difference.</p>
            <p>Thus having finiſhed what I propoſed in the methodical way, I ſhall juſt ramble a little after this rambling <hi>Scribbler,</hi> for upon my word, I can call him nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I obſerve, that he affects (and there is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it) the character of a moderate man, and makes a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his ſandals, and a modern biſhop; but then he can't (for the ſoul of him) help making reflections on the poor <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> by whoſe great <hi>blackneſs</hi> he hopes, he and his party will appear tolerably <hi>white.</hi> In order likewiſe to preclude a ſuſpicion of bigottry on his ſide, he (in no very decent manner for a <hi>church-man,</hi>) plays with the <hi>corner of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's cap, and the fold of his canonical ſleeve;</hi> but would not <hi>for a biſhopric,</hi> have failed of laughing at <hi>the documents of every ſtripling Preſbyterian paſtor.</hi> I next obſerve, that this miſerable ſcribbler propoſes a needleſs alternative, and adviſes us <hi>(if we muſt be ſlaves)</hi> to be as comfortable ſlaves as we can; but as the Americans have long ago reſolved not to be ſlaves to <hi>civil,</hi> why ſhould they reſolve to ſubmit to <hi>eccleſiaſtical,</hi> whether epiſcopal or preſbyterian power, when there is no neceſſity of their being <hi>duped</hi> by the advocates of either? In ſhort, In ſpite of the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moderation of this wretched ſcribbler, there is reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he is at heart a favourer of the doctrines of <hi>paſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>non-reſiſtance,</hi> and that (ſo ſlaviſh are his principles) he would have made a very conſiſtent appearance in <hi>Sacheverell</hi>'s pulpit. I have already obſerved that his deſign ſeems to lull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters aſleep, eſpecially thoſe who are not Preſbyterians, but his <hi>lullaby</hi> conſiſts of ſuch harſh uncouth bellowings as muſt needs awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any perſon, though he were already aſleep, unleſs he were in an
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:010857_0077_0F851F90D85CD100"/>abſolute lethargy. As he talks of two ſorts of <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> I ſhall readily allow there are two ſorts of <hi>Churchmen,</hi> but I am ſorry to ſay, he ſeems to be of the <hi>wrong,</hi> though he would fain perſuade us he is of the <hi>right</hi> ſort. He highly blames <hi>political Preſbyterians,</hi> and why? Becauſe they do not, like their careleſs name-ſakes, (thoſe he calls <hi>religious Preſbyterians</hi>) peaceably ſubmit to all the tyranny of the mother-church, as well as that of the mother-country. If I whip, or threaten to whip you, and you ſay nothing—<hi>ah! that's a good boy!</hi> but if you complain— <hi>how dare you ſay a word, you raſcal you.</hi> This ſcribbler can't ſee any uneaſineſs about a biſhop; if his eyes are bad who can help it? he expects a biſhop as ſoon as he can be prevailed with "to forego his <hi>temporal</hi> privileges and grandeur." I doubt not but as ſoon as an <hi>American</hi> biſhopric appears to be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and profitable than the See of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE abuſe of power, has in all ages, furniſhed the moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious fund of materials to the moraliſt, and to the hiſtorian, and has ever given the greateſt perplexity to the Legiſlator. Private perſons doubtleſs affect the public weal by their vices and by their crimes, but ſtanding ſingly and alone, their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions are eaſily corrected. Whereas thoſe who by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of birth, fortune, office, or ſuperior abilities are enabled to influence others, and to direct the public views and councils, are not without difficulty and addreſs kept within the bounds of law and juſtice. The paſſions and prejudices of men are conſtantly leading them into one miſtake or another; and the remonſtrances of reaſon and duty alone, are but feeble reſtraints. In order therefore to curb the licentiouſneſs of leading men it hath been found expedient to diſtribute the powers of government among the different, ſorts and orders of which the community is compoſed, ſo as to excite, and employ thoſe of one rank and intereſt, to correct the irregularities of another.</p>
            <p>Although this may ſeem to lay a foundation for conſtant debate and faction, yet even this is a ſmall inconvenience compared to
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:010857_0078_0F851F916F08FC30"/>the galling and oppreſſive yoke of abſolute monarchy; or even the jealous ſeverity of an ariſtocratic ſenate. But the common diſadvantages of the mixed forms of government, will be found neither very conſiderable nor laſting, in caſe the diſtribution of power is made with judgment. The old Roman policy was defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in this reſpect. The patrician and plebeian orders in that republic, wanted a third eſtate to moderate between them: which defect the king in the Britiſh conſtitution admirably ſupplies; whilſt our popular branch, acting by repreſentatives, their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are more deliberate, and leſs factious, than at Rome, where the people appeared in perſon.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of the Britiſh colonies, juſt riſing out of the difficulties of an infant ſtate, do not admit of ſuch a regular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of power. To forward the full ſettlement of a new country, ſuch a diviſion, and diffuſion of the lands is neceſſary, as ſhall leave the profits wholly in the hands of thoſe who cultivate them. Hence our laws for making partition of real eſtates among all the children of the family; and for the ready ſale of lands to ſatisfy debts, equitable in themſelves, are even political in ſuch a country as this: but they render the riſe and eſtabliſhment of an upper rank among us, difficult, if not impracticable.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of things it behoves the people of North-America, to conſider fully what political conſequences and effects the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of dioceſan biſhops among them may produce. By Dr. Chandler's account of them, as ſmooth as he writes, we find they are not to be mere voluntary biſhops, ſuch as the Moravian church has, but prelates commiſſioned by his majeſty, as ſupreme heads of the church, and authoriſed by the nation, as branching from the eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment in England. Nor are theſe Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican biſhops to be ſuffered to tarniſh the ſplendor of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren at home, by being left to the precarious maintainance of the epiſcopalians here; as was the caſe in the primitive times of the Chriſtian church. But thouſands of pounds ſterling have been laying up and accumulating at intereſt, for above half a century paſt, as a ſund for ſupporting one or two of them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Chandler from recollection, inſtances in ſix gifts or lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſome of them of <hi>50</hi> years ſtanding, which amounts to £ <hi>4500</hi> ſterling; doubtleſs there are many ſmaller ones. Theſe having been at intereſt, muſt now make a very conſiderable fund; of which about £. <hi>826</hi> only appear to have been expended for a houſe at Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington. See Appeal, pages <hi>108</hi> and <hi>50.</hi>
               </note> Beſides this, it is intimated that many perſons in England, ſtand ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to this Uſe, as ſoon as the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eme ſhall be put in execution. Hereafter, great matters may be expected from the crown lands, which it is propoſed to ſet apart for the benefit of the American
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:010857_0078_0F851F916F08FC30"/>hierarchy: but till the further ſettlement and improvement of the colonies, ſhall raiſe theſe to a proper value, <hi>"the general tax on the country,"</hi> which Dr. Chandler ſpeaks of, page 107, may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all deficiencies.</p>
            <p>This ſcheme of the epiſcopal miſſionaries and their patrons, the ſociety for propagating the goſpel, whatever they intend by it, would be likely to have great influence on civil government and public liberty; and therefore, whether we conſider the thing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or the method taken to obtain it, our moſt ſerious attention cannot but be awakened on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>In their zeal for their hierarchy, theſe gentlemen, poſſibly, have not conſidered what they are about, in this view. Or if any of them have glanced ſo much beſide their own concernments, as to have perceived the obvious effects of their propoſal on political affairs, they may have reconciled to themſelves the purſuit of ſo dangerous a meaſure, by the proſpect of the ſpiritual advantage they expect will flow from it.</p>
            <p>For my part, I have often eſteemed it a great advantage to the northern colonies, that their clergy have very little weight in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This is owing to the moderate ſalaries paid them; to their debates and diviſions about the modes and circumſtantials of religion; and to the want of general connection among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and with the churches eſtabliſhed in Britain. By their diſſentions, we are ſecured from the uſurpations and encroachments they might otherwiſe make as a body: for one denomination care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watches another, and ſounds the alarm on occaſion of any ſchemes that may be deviſed to the prejudice of the public. This alſo keeps up a ſpirit of free-inquiry and prevents the ill effects of a fond ſuperſtitious credulity.</p>
            <p>But here is a meaſure propoſed, that directly tends to form and combine this order of men into a regular and powerful band; and to put them under the direction of ſuperior officers, inveſted with great powers over the reſt. It is alſo calculated to connect them by uniformity, eſtabliſhment and intereſt with the church eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in England.</p>
            <p>It was formerly propoſed that the clergy, on account of their wealth and influence, ſhould be conſidered as a fourth eſtate in parliament, but this happily did not take place.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gilbert,</hi> on the Exah. <hi>48.</hi>
               </note> Among us, they muſt be much more than a ſeperate eſtate; they can have no equals in the colonies. Whilſt for civil government the Britiſh dominions on the continent are already divided into ſeventeen provinces, the epiſcopal elergy (who may before long by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per management, and the aid of acts of parliament, be augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to three or four thouſand in number) will be collected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:010857_0079_0F851F9236102620"/>under twenty or more biſhops, and a primate appointed from home. What reſtraint and check will there be on the views and ſchemes of a body ſo well compacted, ſo weighty, ſo well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by ſtatute, and ſo well allied to powerful hierarchies in Europe. Without an order of nobility to ſtand on equal footing with the prelates; without courts of common law, of juriſdiction extenſive enough to iſſue prohibitions and correct the proceedings of the arch-biſhop and his ſuffragans, when they exceed their proper limits; as the ſpiritual courts in England frequently do; without a general aſſembly of the colonies, or other aſſociation for civil purpoſes, in what circumſtances muſt the laity be to guard themſelves againſt the ambitious deſigns of the ſpiritual power? In ſhort they muſt lie entirely at the mercy and moderation of the clergy: and what theſe are, let Spain, let Italy, let the hiſtory of England, in the papal times, and even ſince the reformation, under the government of the houſe of <hi>Stuart,</hi> picture out to the reader.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <q>It hath been a great miſtake among us, that the popiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the only one, of all Chriſtian ſects, proper to introduce and eſtabliſh Slavery.—Other religions have ſucceeded as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as ever popery did.</q> Lord <hi>Moleſworth</hi>'s Account of <hi>Denmark:</hi> He inſtances in that kingdom; yet he obſerves the ſuper-intendants or Biſhops there have no Temporalties, nor any Power over the other Clergy; being only <hi>Primi-inter pares,</hi> Firſt among Equals.</note> Men in all ages and of every character are much the ſame in regard to the uſe of power; and their conduct when they get above controul, loudly proclaims the neceſſity of attending to the proper diſtribution of it in every free government, that would preſerve its conſtitution.</p>

            <p>NOT many years ago, were tranſmitted to the public, thro' the channel of the Boſton Gazette, a ſew deſultory eſſays, on the ſpirit of the cannon and feudal law: in ſome of which were expreſſed apprehenſions of the future miſchiefs, that might be cauſed in America by the efforts and exertions of thoſe expiring and deteſted ſyſtems. That thoſe apprehenſions were too well founded, time has, already, ſufficiently ſhewn: and we have now, perhaps, ſtronger reaſons to fear, a ſtill further increaſe of thoſe miſchiefs, than we had then. It is therefore the opinion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons, who wiſh well to the religion, the learning, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happineſs of this injured and inſulted country, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumption of that inexhauſtile ſubject, would not be improper, at the preſent juncture. And it is, without any further apology, propoſed, to continue a ſeries of diſſertations upon that and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſubjects, for ſome months, if not years to come. It is claimed as an inconteſtible right to purſue our own plan, method and ſtyle: and, if in the courſe of our lucubrations, we ſhould depart from the rules of eſtabliſhed logicians and rhetoricians, if we ſhould ſometimes in haſte throw our thoughts together in rude heaps, if a few blunders and ſoleciſms ſhould eſcape us, or if we ſhould now and then miſ-ſpell and miſ-point, we ſhall not think it worth our while to engage in any contention, concerning ſuch matters, with the little ſcribblers, and paltry critics, whoſe ambition never aſpired, and whoſe capacity never attained to greater objects.— Our labours will be interrupted whenever the paroxiſms of the gout or the ſpleen, the fits of dulneſs or lazineſs, or the avocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of buſineſs or amuſement ſhall make an interruption expedient. Theſe reſervations have been thought proper to be made for our own eaſe and advantage. And we now take the freedom to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the reader, that the champion, who has lately, with ſo much heroiſm challenged America, to conteſt with him the right
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:010857_0080_0F851F92E64F3488"/>of dioceſan epiſcopacy, firſt rouſed us, from our long lethargy, and determined us, once more to try our fortune in the field.</p>
            <p>But to renounce Metaphor, and ſpeak ſoberly, The Appeal to the Public in favour of an American epiſcopate, is ſo flagrant an attempt to introduce the cannon law, or at leaſt ſome of the worſt fruits of it, into theſe colonies, hitherto unſtained with ſuch pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, uninfected with ſuch poiſon, that every friend of America ought to take the alarm—Power, in any form, and under any limitations, when directed only by human wiſdom and benevolence, is dangerous: but the moſt terrible of all power, that can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to man, is ſpiritual.—Becauſe our natural apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a deity, providence and future ſtate, are ſo ſtrong, and our natural diſpoſition to enthuſiaſm and ſuperſtition, ſo prevalent, that an order of men entruſted with the ſacred rites of religion, will always obtain an aſcendency over our conſciences: and will therefore be able to perſuade us, (by us I mean the body of the people) that to diſtinguiſh between the cauſe of God and the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, is impiety; to ſpeak or write freely of the clergy, is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and to oppoſe the exorbitancy of their wealth and power, is ſacriledge, and that any of theſe crimes will expoſe us, to eternal miſery.—</p>
            <p>And whenever conſcience is on the ſide of the canon law, all is loſt. We become cabable of believing any thing that a prieſt ſhall preſcribe—We become capable of believing, even Dr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's fundamental aphoriſms, viz. that Chriſtianity cannot exiſt without an unterrupted ſucceſſion of dioceſan biſhops, and that thoſe who deny the ſucceſſion to have been uninterrupted, muſt prove it to have been broken: which very curious and important doctrines will be conſidered more at large hereafter, mean time, I am, and ever will be</p>

            <p>IT is a very eaſy matter for a writer, who aims at carrying his point by clamour, and raiſing an <hi>odium</hi> againſt his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt, to make a ſpecious appearance in a periodical paper.— Give an author and his performance an ill name; only make the common people,—with whom poſitive aſſertions too often paſs
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:010857_0080_0F851F92E64F3488"/>for argument, and ſcurrilous expreſſions for ſpirited reaſoning,—believe that he has ſome covert deſign unfriendly to their liberty, and his buſineſs is done. Whether the <hi>American Whig,</hi> has not choſe this method of attacking Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> and his Appeal, let the impartial public judge, and let his 6th Numb. be attended to in proof of the affirmative; in which the Dr. is ſometimes found fault with, for ſpeaking <hi>too plain,</hi> ſometimes for not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>plain enough; i. e.</hi> he has not always ſpoke as the <hi>American Whig</hi> would have him.</p>
            <p>The Doctor is firſt accuſed of denying "the validity of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of all the Proteſtant miniſters in the world, except thoſe of his own denomination."—With laying down ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as would make "the bulk of the reformed clergy," to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly "non-commiſſioned <hi>Laymen,</hi> and miſtaken <hi>Pretenders,</hi> or egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Impoſtors,</hi>"—The Doctor's creed, ſays the <hi>Whig,</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paragraph, "unchurches all the churches on the continent except his own, and the church of <hi>Quebeck.</hi>"—Here it ſeems the Doctor has ſpoken too plain to pleaſe the ſour temper of a <hi>Whig:</hi> But then again the Doctor is accuſed of the want of <hi>"a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic plainneſs of ſpeech;"</hi>—of <hi>"mincing concluſions;"</hi>—of <hi>"velvet-mouthed delicacy;"</hi>—of <hi>"coaxing and trimming,"</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>modeſtly</hi> ſaid, non-epiſcopal ordinations were by the Church <hi>"eſteemed irregular and defective.</hi>—Thus inconſiſtent is malice.</p>
            <p>I am utterly unable to find that Dr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> in his Appeal, denies "the validity of the ordination of all the proteſtant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the world, except his own denomination." The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the place referred to by the <hi>Whig,</hi> ſays nothing of foreign churches at all; nor is the Doctor's diſpute with foreign church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but with the Engliſh ſchiſmatical congregations, who of late years endeavour to honour themſelves with the appellation of churches. Why all the proteſtant churches, and more eſpecially the church of <hi>Holland,</hi> is lugged into this diſpute, with which it has nothing to do, is hard to ſay, unleſs the <hi>Benevolence</hi> of the heart of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> ſuggeſted it to him, as a probable method of raiſing an odium againſt the church of <hi>England.</hi>—The churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> have always kept up the moſt friendly and affectionate regard for each other, as might eaſily be proved by the teſtimony of divines of eminent reputation on both ſides. In this country, the members of thoſe churches have ever copied the good diſpoſition of their brethren at home, and have lived together in the greateſt harmony.—That the church of <hi>Holland,</hi> is not epiſcopal exactly in the ſame manner that the church of <hi>England</hi> is epiſcopal, is readily admitted;—neither is it <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, that the <hi>Engliſh diſſenters are Presbyterian,</hi> as is evident from the diſtinction that, <hi>I am told,</hi> in
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:010857_0081_0F851F93D30EFF70"/>made in their ordination of a member of the <hi>claſſis,</hi> and an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſtor or preſbyter. When a member of the claſſis is ordained, the powers of ordination and government are committed to him; but when an ordinary paſtor is ordained, no ſuch powers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, but only the powers of preaching the word and adminiſtering the ſacrament.</p>
            <p>National churches have a right to judge for themſelves, with regard to the <hi>modes</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi> of religion, ſo that <hi>all things be done decently and in order.</hi> And the church of <hi>England,</hi> no more cenſures the church of <hi>Holland,</hi> becauſe it is not <hi>epiſcopal exactly like itſelf,</hi> than the civil government of <hi>England</hi> quarrels with that of <hi>Holland,</hi> becauſe it is not <hi>monarchial.</hi> Every true Engliſhman eſteems the civil government of his own country the moſt <hi>perfect</hi> on earth; and of conſequence muſt think the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil government of <hi>Holland</hi> leſs perfect, without <hi>ungovernmenting that government.</hi> In like manner the members of the church of <hi>England,</hi> may think their own church more <hi>perfect,</hi> and that of <hi>Holland,</hi> leſs <hi>perfect,</hi> without <hi>unchurching that church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the <hi>American Whig</hi> would know who they are who are <hi>unchurching</hi> the church of <hi>Holland</hi> in this country let him attend to <hi>thoſe</hi> who for many years have caſt a longing look at the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the <hi>Dutch</hi> church in <hi>New-York;</hi> who have uſed every art to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>auch its members from their fidelity to the eſtabliſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Holland,</hi> and to convert their churches into conventicles for <hi>Engliſh</hi> independents.—Why all this <hi>begging, demanding, coax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, threatning, cringing, bullying, whining, bluſtering, intreating, bellowing for a charter,</hi> to incorporate a thing by law and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>incorporatable,</hi> called a <hi>meeting-houſe,</hi> but to put themſelves into a capacity of covering iniquity by law;—into a legal capacity of holding the revenues of the <hi>Dutch</hi> church, when once they could lay their griping paw upon them.—Thoſe are the people who are <hi>unchurching</hi> the church of <hi>Holland,</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> church in <hi>New-York;</hi> —who <hi>Ahab like,</hi> firſt <hi>kill,</hi> and then <hi>take poſſeſſion;</hi> firſt ſow diviſions and animoſities among the members of that church by which its very exiſtence is to be <hi>annihilated,</hi> that they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon their vineyard;—and then like the whoriſh women de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Proverbs, they will <hi>wipe their mouth, and ſay we have done no harm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To anſwer the ſame <hi>pious purpoſe,</hi> of caſting an odium upon the church, ſhe is repreſented by the <hi>American Whig</hi> as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to popery; becauſe Mr. <hi>Houdin</hi> was admitted to officiate as a clergyman, without <hi>re-ordination.</hi>—Mr. <hi>Houdin,</hi> it is true, was born and educated in the popiſh religion, and ordained by a popiſh biſhop in <hi>France;</hi> he left <hi>Canada,</hi> and came to <hi>New-York,</hi> where after ſome time, he openly in the face of the congregation in Trinity-church, in this city, renounced and abjured the errors
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:010857_0081_0F851F93D30EFF70"/>of popery, and was admitted to officiate in <hi>the church without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would here beg the candid reader to obſerve, that epiſcopal ordination is not looked upon as one of the <hi>errors</hi> of popery, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Lutheran, Daniſh,</hi> or <hi>Swediſh</hi> churches, any more than by the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi>—conſequently no particular <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> ought to lie againſt the church on this account.—Again, if Mr. <hi>Houdin</hi>'s ordination in <hi>France,</hi> was ſufficiently valid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the powers of the Chriſtian prieſthood, there was no nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If God ſaw good to preſerve to us, the holy ſcriptures and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Chriſtian church, through the corrupt medium of popery, why not the Chriſtian prieſthood thro' the ſame medium?— If the Chriſtian prieſthood was not preſerved in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is extinct in the weſtern world. Upon this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I beg the <hi>American Whig</hi> to try his abilities,—and he may take all the aſſociations, con-ſociations, preſbyteries and ſynods, on the continent, to his aſſiſtance, and the leathern mitten of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ram-Chicken</hi> of <hi>Boſton</hi> into the Bargain,—in fabricating a ſingle <hi>Chriſtian prieſt;</hi> pardon the word, good Mr. <hi>Whig, Preſbyter</hi> if you had rather;—</p>
            <p>Another fountain of odium which our <hi>meek ſpirited Whig,</hi> who ſeems not in the leaſt <hi>tainted</hi> with the virtue of <hi>Chriſtian charity,</hi> has opened againſt the Church, is the imputation of a <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> ſpirit.

               <p>IT is really a thing of very malancholy conſideration to every ſerious Chriſtian, and who truly loves his country, that ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, and even malicious a ſpirit, ſo much the reverſe of the moſt benevolent temper of the goſpel, ſhould ſo much obtain in this country, and be ſo induſtriouſly propagated by the <hi>American Whig,</hi> to the utter deſtruction of every thing that is pleaſant and amiable in ſociety; and this without any manner of provocation from Dr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> who only pleads the cauſe of liberty, with a Chriſtian temper, in an affair of great importance in religion and conſcience, on the ſide of the church, the enjoyment of which, if obtained, could not poſſibly (as we deſire it,) be of the leaſt detriment to any other denomination.—How can it be, that he ſhould ſo vehemently make it his buſineſs to ſow diſcord among brethren? For brethren we are, in ſo far as we are fellow Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and neighbours.—I am ſorry, indeed, that any of the church ſhould ſuffer themſelves by however ſo bitter obloquy, to be provoked to return any thing of the like kind, (tho' he makes it ten times as bad as it is,) but it is ſaid, <hi>tread on a worm and it will turn,</hi> and I hope it will be excuſed from the frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, eſpecially, when the provocation is ſo very ſevere.

               <p>I cannot on this occaſion but expreſs my ſurpriſe, that ſo reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a body as the General Aſſembly of Boſton, in their late letter to their agent in England (in which they do well to expreſs their ſolicitude for civil liberty) ſhould be ſo inconſiſtent and ſo uncharitably zealous, as, at the ſame time, moſt earneſtly to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe eccleſiaſtical and religious liberty, with regard to the church, when they ſay, <q>We hope in God it (an Epiſcopate) may never

               <p>Another thing that I beg leave to remark upon, is a paſſage in the <hi>Centinel,</hi> No I. which ſays, "One of the biſhops, who is at the head of the ſociety for propagation <q>of the goſpel, (meaning the archbiſhop) was not aſhamed to oppoſe a plan for convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Indians, becauſe concerted by a denomination of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians that followed not with him.</q>—Now that he ever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, or for that reaſon, cannot be true, as is evident from his anſwer to thoſe who aſked for countenance and contributions to Mr. Wheelock's Indian ſchool, which may at any time be ſeen in his letter to the Rev.

            <p>THE clergy whenever opportunity has offered, have appeared as apt to pervert power as other people, and their conduct too plainly proves that "we have the treaſure of religion conveyed "to us in earthen veſſels:"<note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> iv. 7.</note> This ſhould teach us to diſtinguiſh carefully between the ſchemes of ambitious eccleſiaſticks, and the true intereſts of Chriſtianity. If this be forgotten, the laiety will ſoon be reduced to ſpiritual thraldom, and the miniſters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neglecting their proper duties, will become competitors with the magiſtrate, for civil power.</p>
            <p>Theſe are far from being conjectures only; our own hiſtory, not to recur to thoſe of other nations, abounds with numerous inſtances of this temper in men, who are by profeſſion, abſtracted from worldly buſineſs. Even the Monks, who apparently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all intercourſe with ſociety and pretended to retire to cells and deſarts, could not reſiſt the temptation of exerciſing the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:010857_0084_0F851F95E7B36FD8"/>influence, which their ſanctified character among the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous multitude, gave them.</p>
            <p>In fact, this order has ever been found to conſiſt of ſpeculative men, clear-ſighted to their own intereſts, adhering cloſely toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and purſuing their views with ſteadineſs. As an incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate body that never dies, they build for ages, and their fabricks almoſt always affect, often endanger the welfare of the ſtate. The large revenues, Privileges, immunities and juriſdictions, which they claimed and exerciſed in the days of popery, rendering them formidable to the civil magiſtrate, and inveſted with exceſſive powers a body of men, who never want a plauſible pretence for making further uſurpations. That ſyſtem had indeed been the work of many dark ages, when the ignorance, barbariſm, and ſuperſtition of rulers and people, afforded the moſt commodious opportunity of putting their ſchemes of aggrandizement into practice. Whoever looks into the hiſtory of thoſe times, will be apt to conclude that the prieſts had imagined all mankind were made for their advantage, and that the Chriſtian revelation was conſidered by them as a cunning fable, invented for the benefit of the clergy.</p>
            <p>Although popery has been aboliſhed, ſtill the clergy "are men of like paſſions with others"<note n="¶" place="bottom">

It does not yet appear, they have got above the temptations to pride and arrogance, which are apt to be excited, and gratified by dictating the religious faith and principles of the people.

               </gap>olonies, is this; the leading clergy in England deſirous of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their power, and of building up a mighty Hierarchy in the Britiſh empire, are labouring to bring the colonies under their dominion, by every device they can think of. Many circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtances ſeem favourable to this ſcheme; moſt of the provinces ſouth of Pennſylvania, and the W. India Iſlands, have by their own acts of aſſembly, provided a regular parochial maintenance for the epiſcopal miniſters. The like has been obtained by arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in ſome few deſtricts of New-York, and an attempt has lately been made to extend it. In Nova-Scotia, epiſcopacy according to the church of England, is declared to be eſtabliſhed; but as it might put a total ſtop to the ſettling of that new province, no tax for ſupporting the clergy, is yet levied on diſſenters. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts have been made, more than once, to get a legal aſſeſſment in the lower government of Pennſylvania, for the ſame purpoſe.
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:010857_0085_0F851F96A88185A8"/>And as eſtabliſhing lands for pious uſes, is not reſtrained by the laws of the colonies, as in England, and moſt other countries in Europe; and as the old ſtatute made againſt granting lands to the church, are not ſuppoſed to extend here, meaſures are taken to advance the intereſts of the deſigned heirarchy, by making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of this ſort. Accordingly inſtructions have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the crown, to the governors of New-Hampſhire to grant a proportion of every new townſhip to the ſociety for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the goſpel; and a like practice has been begun at New-York. In that city and its Suburbs the lands of the epiſcopal church are extenſive and valuable; and if the place continues to increaſe, they muſt in time become an immenſe eſtate. The Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington plantation in Barbados, which is veſted in the ſaid ſociety, for the purpoſe of ſupporting a college, is ſuffered to extend and accumulate in a moſt rapid manner. To theſe might be added the funds of the colleges of New-York and Williamſburgh, the numerous glebes and manſes of the clergy in America, and the deſigned tracks of land for the future benefit of the Biſhops, and for perfecting the ſcheme; which hereafter may become of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous value, when taken, with the above particulars, into one computation.</p>
            <p>That nothing may be wanting to perfect the ſpiritual kingdom, the moſt vigorous attempts have been making for above half a century to epiſcopize the middle and northern colonies, which were ſettled by non-conformiſts, and for this purpoſe a large fund has been employed in ſending out miſſionaries to theſe people, as if they were heathen, and utterly void of all goſpel knowledge. But as it has ever proved a difficult matter to change an anceſtorial religion,<note n="*" place="bottom">This has been very much the caſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where, ſetting aſide the Scots and Engliſh ſettlers, the alteration among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives has been very inconſiderable, notwithſtanding the proteſtant eſtabliſhment has ſubſiſted above <hi>200</hi> years. Perhaps leſs precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſeverity in this buſineſs, had been better. Any nation, eſpecially one claiming to be free, would reſent extremely an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to impoſe a new religion, to which there was no pre-diſpoſition in its people; but in that kingdom, on the contrary, the rude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated inhabitants, were to the laſt degree attached to a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, from which they ſuffered the greateſt injuries. No wonder ſtate-convulſions followed, and that when theſe were puniſhed by confications and capital penalties, general rebellions and maſſacres followed—Thus was the proteſtant religion diſcredited by its imprudent friends in the eyes of the Iriſh, and its proſpects effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindered.—Is not the preſent policy towards the Canadians wiſer and more humane?</note> eſpecially where prejudice and old debates ſtand in the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:010857_0085_0F851F96A88185A8"/>way, the progreſs of this part of the ſyſtem, is by no means an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the expence and pains it has coſt; eſpecially as theſe miſſionaries have had no ſuperior advantages, as to greater ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, pungency of addreſs in enforcing their doctrines, or novelty as to the ſubjects of them; therefore two or three Biſhops with ſtate appointment, and lordly revenue are now propoſed in order to forward this "grand affair."<note n="¶" place="bottom">In appeal, page <hi>49,</hi> The ſcheme of on American epiſcopate, is ſo ſtiled.</note> The well diſpoſed people in England have been formerly amuſed with the deſign of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Indians, and by this argument, they were induced to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute largely to the fund of the ſociety. They are now told, the reaſon, why no more has been done in this important buſineſs, is the want of well endowed biſhopricks in the colonies<note n="†" place="bottom">One Chapter of the <hi>Appeal</hi> is wholly employed on this Topie.</note>: Tho' it is evident they never engaged ſeriouſly in the matter. In ſhort, tho' the ſociety has debarred others from doing it to purpoſe, the converſion of the Indians in both caſes is a meer pretence.</p>
            <p>There are now upwards of five hundred and fifty pariſh miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in New-England; ſuppoſe all the colonies ſettled equally with that country, and equally furniſhed with religious teachers, and all theſe of the epiſcopal denomination, with Dioceſan Biſhops, and a primate, ſubordinate to a patriarch at Lambeth, what a mighty body would this connection form, what colony could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to govern the clergy within its limits, whilſt ſuch an <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium in imperio</hi> ſubſiſted? At preſent, the epiſcopal colonies find it difficult enough to oblige theſe people, (who intereſt the Biſhops of England in their pretenſions on every occaſion) to ſubmit to any Acts of Aſſembly that may affect them:<note n="‖" place="bottom">The moſt remarkable Inſtances of this ſort, that I now recollect, happened in Virginia, ſome few years ſince, on Occaſion of an Act of Aſſembly commonly called the <hi>Two-penny</hi> act. It affected all Salary men civil and Eccleſiaſtical: the civil Officers ſubmitted to the Legiſlative Regulations; but the Clergy revolted; and applying to England, by means of their <hi>great</hi> Friends, the Biſhops, got the Act Repealed, with expreſſions of Royal Diſpleaſure to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor for paſſing it.</note> but combined by a regular plan of diſcipline authoriſed by parliament, they will no longer be ſubjects, but lords and maſters ever every juriſdiction in America.</p>
            <p>It may paſs with children and the blinded devotees of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, "that no ſuch temporal powers will be exerciſed here, as have been claimed and exerciſed in England; nay that the American Biſhops, are even to be reduced much below the ſtandard there, to have no power over the epiſcopal laity much leſs over diſſenters;

But none who know the nature of man, or have conſidered the tranſactions of paſt ages can pay the leaſt regard to ſuch declarations. Can it be believed by any man in his ſenſes, that the leaders of a body of men, who by their offices, endowments, polity, connection and alliances muſt unavoidably have great weight in public affairs, will be ſo mortified to worldly conſiderations, as to renounce the influence and power their high ſtations muſt give them? No ſuch inſtance has ever happen'd in church or ſtate, ſince the world began. Some rare inſtances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may be quoted, of individuals, who being poſſeſſed of high and dangerous authority, have had the magnanimity to renounce it; but of bodies-politic, ſenates, or other combinations of men, we meet with none: Large aſſemblies or orders of men, are not diffident of their capacity to exerciſe power, or if ſome among them ſhould be ſo, the more aſſured majority over-rule the few ſqueamiſh brethren; beſides the odium of ſevere meaſures, being divided among ſo many, it has leſs effect in reſtraining their proceedings.</p>
            <p>The recapitulation of the temporal advantages, which the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal clergy have obtained in the provinces, is not made with an invidious deſign; but merely to alarm all people againſt the grand ſcheme of ſpiritual dominion, that ſeems to be planned for this country. If Church diſcipline is to be regulated by the legiſlatures here, I ſhall be in no great pain for civil liberty on this account; tho' it might be prudent to put ſome limits to the Church-poſſeſſions of all denominations. They neither ſerve any purpoſe to religion, nor government; but often prove miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to both: Without theſe, the Clergy could never be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of much diſtruſt to the magiſtrate;<note n="¶" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> obſerves, that when the Abbey and Church lands, which had been ſeized by Henry the <hi>VIII.</hi> and given to the nobility, were confirmed to them by act of parliament (1ſt and 2d. of Philip and Mary) the power of the papacy was effectually ſuppreſſed; for tho' the juriſdiction of the eccleſiaſticks was reſtored, <hi>their property, on which their power depended</hi> was irretrievably loſt, and no hopes remained of recovering it.

               <head>THE REPLICATION of <hi>Thomas Bradbury Chandler,</hi> Doctor of Divinity, to the Plea, Demurrer and Anſwer of the People of <hi>North America,</hi> Appellees;</head>
               <p>THIS repliant, inſiſting as before, on all and ſingular the matters and things in the ſaid Appeal contained, in the manner and form as the ſame are therein ſet forth, <hi>proteſting,</hi> that the matters in the appellees ſaid plea contained, are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in the law to be replied unto, nor to bar the right of the appellant and his aſſociates, the Epiſcopalians in <hi>America,</hi> to ſuch a biſhop as they pray for by the ſaid Appeal: And <hi>proteſting</hi> further, that the matters and things in the ſaid anſwer contained, are very untrue, imperfect, and inſufficient to be replied unto; nor is the appellant by the law of the land, held to make any anſwer thereto: Nevertheleſs, for replication to ſuch parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as this repliant thinks may be worth anſwering, he replies and ſays, that he doth deny all and all manner of combination and confederacy with the convention, or any other perſon or perſons for commencing and proſecuting the ſaid Appeal <hi>"merely for the aggrandizement and exaltation of the epiſcopal churches, on the ruin of all other Chriſtian denominations in his Majeſty's Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can dominions,"</hi> as in the ſaid anſwer is untruly ſuggeſted: but this appellant doth aver and inſiſt that the ſaid appeal was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and proſecuted with the good will, liking and approbation, not only of the members of the ſaid epiſcopal churches in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but that the ſame was thought juſt and reaſonable by the moderate diſſenters, many of whom did declare, at divers times and places, that there could be no objection thereto.</p>
               <p>And this appellant doth alſo aver and inſiſt, that the ſaid Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal was brought <hi>to be delivered againſt a real grievance and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> and not for the cauſe aforeſaid; which ſaid <hi>grievance and oppreſſion,</hi> conſiſteth in, and is compounded of divers great perils, labours, troubles, diſappointments, expences, and other hardſhips, obſtructions, difficulties and inconvenience which hitherto have
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:010857_0087_0F851F98225A9228"/>attended, and always hereafter muſt and will attend the croſſing the Atlantic ocean, and making ingreſs into, and egreſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs out of that part of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> called England, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ordination for every clergyman that hath already been, or hereafter ſhall be called to preach the goſpel in the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in <hi>America;</hi> which this appellant conceives doth tend to the manifeſt injury, oppreſſion and impoveriſhment, as well of great part of the members belonging to the ſaid church, as of their clergy, and alſo doth tend to impede, hinder, and obſtruct the growth, increaſe and advancement of the ſaid church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and of religion in general, in theſe his Majeſty's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; the perpetuation and continuance of which obſtructions and impediments, this appellant, without a forced innuendo, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believes in his conſcience, is an object that doth powerfully move, inſtigate and impel the ſaid appellees, to ſtir up ſtrife and contention with this appellant and his aſſociates, upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of the ſaid Appeal.</p>
               <p>And for aſmuch as every reaſonable man and catholic Chriſtian, whether churchman or diſſenter, cannot but think it very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, cruel, and oppreſſive, and againſt equity and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to deny their Chriſtian brethren any of the rights and privileges which they conceive to be eſſential to the good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and order of the church to which they belong, this repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant thinks he has good cauſe to complain of being treated with an <hi>unchriſtian</hi> temper, in the <hi>manner</hi> of the oppoſition made to the ſaid appeal; it being manifeſt that this repliant wants no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther biſhop than ſuch an one as can in no ſort endanger the civil or religious liberties of any denomination whatever, and only for the purpoſe of <hi>ordaining</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> in his own church, and <hi>confirming</hi> ſuch of his members as chooſe to be conffirmed.</p>
               <p>And this repliant doth, and will maintain and prove his ſaid charge of unchriſtian treatment, of and from the ſaid appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees, and that it is manifeſt that they, by and with the advice of their <hi>council,</hi> have miſrepreſented the true ſenſe, purport, and meaning of the ſaid Appeal, in alledging that this repliant and the convention, do ſeek for, and endeavour to obtain and procure a biſhop with all his temporal and eccleſiaſtical powers and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Whereas this repliant in behalf of himſelf, and of the ſaid convention, and of all the members of the epiſcopal churches in <hi>America,</hi> doth hereby renounce, abjure, relinquiſh, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim all pretence of right, title, and demand to any ſuch biſhop.</p>
               <p>And the ſaid repliant further ſaith, that he is well ſatisfied that the <hi>council</hi> of the ſaid appellees, muſt, for divers good cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and conſiderations him thereunto moving, have found it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and neceſſary for the undue prolixification. prolongation, and procraſtination of the ſaid ſuit, and for the <hi>abaſement</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="unknown:010857_0088_0F851F98FA884C78"/>of the ſaid church, to ſuggeſt divers pretences, devices, and diabolical projects and machinations, to have been formed on the part of this repliant and the ſaid convention, which he doth declare, it never entered into their hearts to conceive.</p>
               <p>And this repliant further ſaith, that he will prove and make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clear to the tribunal of the public here, that the <hi>council</hi> of the ſaid appellees, hath ſurreptitiouſly, wilfully, and corruptly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to law, taken upon himſelf to appear as <hi>council</hi> for <hi>all</hi> the people of <hi>America,</hi> in oppoſition to the ſaid Appeal, when at leaſt one half of them never retained him as council for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and are parties in favour of the ſaid Appeal; for which this repliant conceives, he ought to be proſecuted, as being guilty of groſs and palpable <hi>maintainance</hi> which he is adviſed by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is highly criminal. And theſe ſeveral matters this repliant hath ſet forth as materially appertaining to the premiſes in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preparatory to the particular matters of his ſaid replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are as followeth.</p>

               <p>And this repliant for further application to the ſaid plea ſaith, that as touching the matters referred to in the 26th and 27th years of the ſame king's reign, and in the 1ſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> declaring that the king is <hi>ſupreme head of the church,</hi> and veſting him with all the eccleſiaſtical power, this repliant conceives and is adviſed, that no part of the ſaid ſtatutes can have any force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſuch eccleſiaſtical power in the colonies, except what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:010857_0088_0F851F98FA884C78"/>the king, as being ſupreme head of the church: and that as religion is neceſſary to all States, there is a manifeſt propriety and fitneſs in point of policy, that the king ſhould be the head of the eſtabliſhed church in all parts of his dominions where the ſame is eſtabliſhed by law. but foraſmuch as the ſaid appellees themſelves do maintain and give our in ſpeeches, that the church of England is not by any ways or means whatſoever eſtabliſhed in the colonies, it is therefore manifeſt from their own ſhewing, that the ſaid ſtatutes, nor either of them, can or do extend, or have reference to the church of England in the colonies: for which reaſon this repliant doth alſo demur to all the ſaid laſt mentioned ſtatutes as inſufficient in the law, to prove what by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>The</hi> AMERICAN <hi>WHIG</hi> [No. XII.]</head>
               <p>THE contumacious and refractory ſpirit of our high church clergy, in endeavouring to inflame the populace, by har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranguing on their imaginary diſtreſs in being deprived of what they never poſſeſſed, that is a mitred generaliſſimo, to head their army in ſtripping us of our religious liberties, has been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of in a former paper. The unreaſonableneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty of their claim, conſidering that the mother country has done for them a thouſand times more than they deſerve, ſhall be the ſubject of ſome future ſpeculations. For this day's entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew how extremely impolitic it would be in his Majeſty's miniſters, to encourage ſo dangerous a project, conſidered as naturally tending to introduce a ſtate of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>It is not a bare addreſs in a preſent emergency of affairs, that conſtitutes the wiſdom of a politician. To deſerve the character of a wiſe and able ſtateſman, one ought to penetrate into futurity and from the contemplation of cauſes, to look into effects and foreſee conſequences. Theſe colonies have frequently been char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their enemies at home, with aiming at a deſign of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off their dependence. This aſperſion is equally falſe and malicious. The North-Americans of all denominations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept high churchmen, prefer the conſtitution of their mother country, to any mode of government that was ever deviſed by the art of man. They have always revered every one of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the illuſtrious houſe of Hanover, not only as their lawful ſovereigns, but as monarchs, from principle and affection attached to their conſtitution; and averſe to the infernal doctrine of the uncontroulable power of kings, the power of injuring and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe, of whom God and the laws have made them the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and protectors. Hence, without the moſt glaring partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Britiſh parliament in favour of their brethren at home, they will always reject the thought of ſhaking off their ſubjection, with indignation and horror. As they bear Great-Britain the ſame affection, and can boaſt equal fidelity; they think themſelves
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:010857_0089_0F851F99AB36E590"/>entitled to equal good treatment. With the duration of ſuch uſage their dependence will, without ſome unimaginable concurrence of of circumſtances, be unqueſtionably commenſurate. But ſhould a future miniſtry be weak enough to be deluded by ſuch a dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ditty, as the convention hath lately groaned out, with <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation loud;</hi> or be inveigled by clerical artifice, to gratify the ambition, the inſatiate ambition of ſome of our rampant high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church clergy; nothing is more probable than that theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies will be debauched from their loyalty, as ſoon as this ſet of men ſhall be ſufficiently powerful. The ſpirit of high church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is abſolutely incompatible with that of our excellent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and was their power equal to their wiſhes, they would neither eat nor ſleep before they had turned a limited monarchy, into an abſolute one. Whenever they boaſt of their attachment to monarchy, they mean an unlimited monarchy, which they love, becauſe it would aſſiſt them to render the church abſolute: But to the government of Great-Britain, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ay indeed be called a monarchy, becauſe it has a king at its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ad; but at the ſame time eſſentially participates of the republican form, becauſe ſuch king can make no law without the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ent of the people, they never were nor ever will be friendly. Nor are they greater enemies to civil, than to religious liberty: and in what hoſtile manner they have appeared againſt the latter, may be read in the eccleſiaſtical hiſtory of England, in characters of blood. Their hearts are not at preſent meliorated becauſe their hands are tied. When they talk of moderation, we know they mean want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. What has of late years reſtrained, and at preſent checks, their fury in England; is the moderation and humanity of our preſent ſovereign, and his predeceſſors of the houſe of Hanover. What reſtrains them here, is their dependence on Great-Britain as a body eccleſiaſtic. Having no affection for a conſtitution limited by law, as the coloniſts of all other denominations have; nothing can ſecure their allegiance but their ſubjection to the church. As this has ſome place in their affections, at leaſt ſo far as it flatters their pride and vanity, by its external grandeur; they will, while kept dependent for their religious emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be tolerable good ſubjects. But give them biſhops and an hierarchy of their own; and deſtroy their preſent neceſſary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the mother country, which would be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of granting them an independent epiſcopate, and you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the principle band of union between them.</p>
               <p>They are at preſent maintained by contributions and charities from England: This with men of their turn is one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ties in nature. But an American epiſcopate cuts aſunder this cord. Let them have funds of their own by the management
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:010857_0090_0F851F9A6A362ED0"/>of their <hi>ſpiritual father</hi> the biſhop, and adieu forever to their <hi>political mother</hi> Old England.</p>
               <p>They muſt now, to obtain orders (a cargoe of manuſcript ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons they might procure without going in perſon) take a trip to London. There they are raviſhed with the wealth and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the church. Tranſported like the Queen of Sheba, they confeſs, that ſhe <hi>exceeds the ſame that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eard,</hi> and <hi>that the one half</hi> of her <hi>greatneſs was not told them.</hi> They are dazzled if not <hi>with the wiſdom</hi> of the Engliſh eccleſiaſticks, at leaſt <hi>with their apparel,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>with their aſcent by which they go up into the houſe of the Lord.</hi> So dazzled that <hi>St. Paul's Church</hi> will be freſh in their memories, twenty years after <hi>his doctrines</hi> are utterly obliterated. So dazzled, in a word, that were they to live in their native <hi>Canaan</hi> for a thouſand years after, they would never forget the onions of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But give them all this gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, with all the <hi>Doctor's political appendages</hi> in America; and a fig for <hi>Egypt,</hi> and all her onions into the bargain.</p>
               <p>Theſe are thoughts, that in my opinion deſerve the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Britiſh miniſtry; and was there no other reaſon (tho' I hope to produce at leaſt one hundred and fifty) againſt countenancing the pernicious claim of a few aſpiring prieſts, in an affair ſo extremely unfriendly to the preſervation of their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and, dependence, and ſo generally diſagreeable to the ſerious and worthy part of their own communion; this were alone abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to reject it with ignominy and contempt.</p>

Surely he and his brethren are not ignorant, that the particle <hi>the,</hi> when placed before the word <hi>church,</hi> determines its ſignification, and leads us to underſtand him in the higheſt ſenſe. <hi>The church in America,</hi> if it has any ſgnification, means all thoſe of whatever denomination, or in whatever place reſiding through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the continent which Jeſus Chriſt owns as his people.

He at leaſt grants, that the Engliſh plan of epiſcopal government is diſputable; and that the other proteſtant churches, of which there are ſo many in this country have ſome appearance of argument to ſupport them: Whether he will or not, his betters have granted it a thouſand times. Since then it is diſputable, a writer of candour and modeſty, ſhould treat the other churches with ſome degree of reſpect; nor ſuffer any expreſſions to drop, that ſeems to unchurch all other denominations. It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of littleneſs of mind to think that there are none but our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the world. When this writer, with ſome others of his ſtamp, calls his denomination, by way of diſtinction <hi>the church,</hi> as if there was none other but that which conforms itſelf to the eſtabliſhment in England, as if the church of Chriſt in this wide continent, was confined to that minority, who take <hi>for ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the commandments of</hi> their eccleſia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT was remarked in a former paper, that if the juriſdiction of parliament to interfere in the internal police of the colonies, was ever ſo well eſtabliſhed, yet it would be extremely dangerous for us to have ſo very delicate a part of it as church-policy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by that reſpectable body; eſpecially as the propoſal has come from the clergy, ſpeaking as they pretend, in behalf of a million of American Epiſcopalians. The members might indeed afford it as much attention as they uſually give to American buſineſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Witneſs the ſucceſs of Captain Cole, in getting the free expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of rice reſtrained, for his own purpoſes; the blunders in the late regulating ſtatutes, concerning the word <hi>Ireland;</hi> as mentioned in the patriot <hi>Farmer's</hi> Letters.</note>; and whilſt they incautiouſly adopt the financiers ſchemes for taxing us, they might as readily receive from the clergy, a ſyſtem of faith and diſcipline for the American church. If it had the outward appearance of the religious eſtabliſhment of England, they would ſcarce examine further, but agree to it without a Vote; and however unſuitable and inconvenient to the circumſtances of this country, they would doubtleſs conſider any complaints from America, as humourſome, if not factious, and highly inconſiſtent with the ſubmiſſion and reverence due to the ſupreme legiſlature.</p>
            <p>However highly we may think of the wiſdom and juſtice of the Britiſh ſenate, yet we cannot but ſee ſtrong marks of their ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a quite different character in conſidering home affairs, from what they do in providing for us. It is eaſy to perceive, that when the ſubjects within the realm, and conſequently the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:010857_0091_0F851F9F87261FB8"/>of the legiſlature, are to be aſſected by the parliamentary proceedings, the debates are ſerious and lively; the ſcrutiny into the conſequences of the buſineſs propoſed, ſtrict and curious; and the appearance of intereſt and feeling viſible to all. Hence their ſtatutes in theſe caſes being penned with care, and corrected with caution, uſually become laſting monuments of the prudence of the national councils<note n="‡" place="bottom">How different the late regulating and revenue laws for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica! hence the ſeveral repeals; the inconſiſtencies and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>But this is by no means the caſe, when a bill is brought in to bind the ſubjects <hi>without</hi> the realm, for the benefit of thoſe <hi>within</hi> it. Here the character of the watchful Repreſentative no longer appears; the buſineſs if at all attended to, and not treated as a thing of courſe, is only regarded as it affects the ſuperior king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Whilſt the people in the ſubordinate ſtates and diſtricts of the empire, are left to learn their inferior ſituation from the crude and miſtaken proviſions of the new ſtatute; which without really ſerving the real intereſts of any part of the Britiſh dominions, tend to diſtreſs and enſlave the diſtant ſubjects.</p>
            <p>There is a moſt remarkable inſtance of this, in the very different conduct of the parliament towards the admiralty juriſdiction in England, and in America. The proceedings in this court, being before a ſingle judge, <hi>according to the courſe of the civil law,</hi> have ever been looked on, and treated as repugnant to the free conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of England, which making the people judges of one another, has provided in the beſt manner for the liberty and ſafety of the ſubject. Trial by jury, is indeed that happy mode of adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring juſtice, which having ſurvived the various changes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the ſtate, has been preſerved and handed down to us; and God grant we may be able to tranſmit it to our children! To the admiralty law therefore, the temper and policy of our anceſtors have always ſhown averſion and jealouſy. They ſeemed ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

But if this court takes cognizance of a matter of a mixed nature, partly within their juriſdiction, and partly not; or ſhould ever ſo little treſpaſs their boundaries, a prohibition will be iſſued from the King's court, to correct, or wholly ſtop further proceeding.<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 <hi>Rolls Abrid.</hi> 532, 533.</note> It may not be amiſs to remark here, that the courts of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the <hi>ſpiritual courts,</hi> are under the ſame wholeſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint<note n="‡ ‡" place="bottom">Henr <hi>VIIIth.</hi> encouraged the judges on all occaſions, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes whereever they thought the law or Royal Prerogative concerned. A happy innovation ſays <hi>Hume,</hi> tho' at firſt invented for arbitary Purpoſes. See his Hiſt. Eng.— The Clergy objected afterwards that ſince all Church as well as ſtate juriſdiction flowed from the king, it was ſtrange he ſhould correct his Eccleſiaſtical Power by his Civil; not conſidering the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the law of the land, and arbitrary Nature of the other.

                  <hi>Burn's</hi> Eccleſ. Law. Preface.</note> which is extremely neceſſary, as otherwiſe we might be led into the endleſs mazes of that arbitary ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>Not content with this, ſundry acts of parliament have been paſſed to circumſcribe, and as it were to naturalize this juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is by mere indulgence, that mariners are ſuffered to ſue, in the admiralty, for their wages; it being expreſsly againſt an old ſtatute, which had rather too ſeverely forbid it. lord <hi>Hale</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that the court of Kings-Bench, had certainly a concurrent power with the admiralty in caſes of felonies done upon the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſeas, or coaſt, though it were high ſeas, becauſe within the King's Realm of England; but ſays this juriſdiction of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, was interrupted by a ſpecial order of the King and council, 35 Ed: 3d. and that ſince 38 Ed. 3d, it does not appear, that the King's courts have taken cognizance of crimes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the high ſeas<note n="‡" place="bottom">His Pleas of Cr: Vol. <hi>2,</hi> Pages <hi>14</hi> and <hi>15.</hi>
               </note>. However as trade began to extend, and trials for capital offences, before this unconſtitutional juriſdiction, more frequently to occur, the nation would not endure it; and
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:010857_0092_0F851FA08F5B7908"/>therefore, by two ſtatutes of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth<note n="†" place="bottom">Stat. <hi>27, Henry VIII,</hi> Cap: <hi>4—28 Henry VIII,</hi> Cap: <hi>15</hi>—Theſe Statues do not alter the Offence or make that Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which was not ſo before, but leaveth it as it was before the Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> Felony by the civil Law, but give a mean of Trial by the common Law: <hi>Molloy, 74.</hi>
               </note>, a commiſſion of Oyer and Terminer was ordered to iſſue out of chancery, directed to the judge of admiralty, and others, to enquire of, and puniſh all traytors, pirates, robbers at ſea, and other marine felons, <hi>according to the courſe of the common law;</hi> which practice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to this day. Again, by a modern ſtatute,<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Stat:</hi> 2, Geo. II. <hi>Cap:</hi> 21.</note> it is provided, that if any one be feloniouſly ſtricken, or poiſoned upon the ſea, and dies at ſea, or beyond ſea, the fact ſhall be triable in any county, <hi>according to the courſe of the common law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have the legiſlature, and the judges of the land, wiſely concurred, in curbing and qualifying this arbitrary mode of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as far as it relates to the mother country. If we enquire what has been the conduct of parliament towards admiralty juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the colonies, we ſhall find it has been quite the reverſe; and that a court, whoſe powers have ever been carefully circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed within the realm, has been favoured with new and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary juriſdiction in America; that matters quite foreign to its nature are made cognizable there; and all reſtraint and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency of the common law taken away.</p>
            <p>As to pirates, and other ſea-felons, they and their acceſſaries are to be tried in the colonies, before a bench of judges, appointed by commiſſion under the great ſeal, or ſeal of the admiralty,<note n="§" place="bottom">

               <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of the admiralty,</hi> that is without a jury; and the charters of the provinces are ſet aſide as far as they interfere with this court; which is the more extraordinary and dangerous inaſmuch as the judges are the reſpective governors and council, who in caſe of the abſence, or want of members to make up a competent number, are directed to aſſociate ſuch Captains in the navy, maſters of Ships, or merchants as they ſee fit; contrary to the very nature of the office of a judge, which is a truſt of perſonal confidence and ſkill, and may not be put over to others. How arbitrary is this revival of the admiralty juriſdiction towards A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans! How looſe and dangerous the exerciſe of it!</p>
            <p>This, it may be ſaid, was only reſtoring the proper juriſdiction of the admiralty. But why ſhould a juriſdiction be revived in the colonies, which had been found intolerable in the mother-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? The laws of trade have however introduced a new one;
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:010857_0093_0F851FA141440920"/>which was firſt craftily ſlipt into the act of navagation, by direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that veſſels ſeized by ſhips of war for breach of that ſtatute, ſhould in the colonies, be proceeded againſt in this court:<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>Yea, ſuch a favourite is the American admiralty, that the Britiſh legiſlature, on aſſuming a power to tax the colonies, has given much of the buſineſs of the court of Exchequer, which is a court of common-law, to this arbitrary tribunal.<note n="‖" place="bottom">

            <p>Can any thing more fully manifeſt the difference between a <hi>virtual</hi> repreſentative, and a <hi>real</hi> one? does it not ſadly expoſe the hardſhip, the authors of that <hi>ideal</hi> character, were reduced to, when they ſeriouſly advanced ſuch a wretched argument for binding America by acts of parliament? Is there any ſympathetic affection in theſe ſuppoſitious delegates, for the ſubjects without the realm? or the leaſt attention ſhewn to their intereſts! Or, is it any wonder, that miniſters of ſtate, are able to procure the parliamentary ſanction, to whatever they draw up for the colonies, without enquiry or debate?</p>

               </gap>ions of parliament, which gives a new blow to our rights as Engliſhmen. By this, proviſion is made for erecting three or four admiralty courts on this continent, each to have juriſdiction over two or more provinces; by which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional and wholeſome ſuper-intendency of the common law over the civil, is wholly evaded, as there is no court of King's Bench in America, of equally extended Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The pretence for this new meaſure might be, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of judges of admiralty and their officers, leſt without ſalaries to ſpunge upon the colonies for a living, had been a long and juſt ſubject of complaint, and could not be well remedied, except by leſſening their number, and giving proper appointments to thoſe
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:010857_0093_0F851FA141440920"/>which remained. Suppoſe the matter placed in this light, and what member, not well acquainted with the internal affairs of this country, could have any objection againſt a regulation, in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance neceſſary, and for ought he could ſee, attended with no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence, nor even the leaſt inconvenience.</p>
            <p>It is ſcarce neceſſary for me to remark on this indignant treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a loyal, a uſeful, and numerous body of Britiſh ſubjects. But can any good man in his right ſenſes think of an application to "our ſuperiors in England" for an eccleſiaſtical conſtitution, after this view of their conduct towards us in the important buſineſs of admiralty law.</p>

               <p>AND this repliant further ſaith, that as touching the ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral cauſes of demurrer, alledged by the ſaid appellees, the ſame are not ſufficient in the law to preclude this repliant from the relief ſought for by the Appeal; for that the preſent cauſe of demurrer aſſigned, is frivolous, equivocal, illuſory, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, in that it denies all equity whereon the people can ground a decree, and referrs the ſame as being only cognizable by the parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> whereas this repliant avers, that there is great equity contained in the matter of the ſaid Appeal, and that <hi>all people</hi> who are not of a <hi>gain-ſaying, gain-writing, gain-reaſoning, oppugning</hi> and <hi>contravening</hi> ſpirit, might and do eaſily ſee the juſtice upon which the ſaid Appeal is grounded.

               <p>And this repliant further ſaith, That the ſaid appellee's ſecond cauſe of demurrer, is ill taken, for that it ſuppoſes a claim to have been made by this repliant, in behalf of the biſhops, of one tenth of the lands in <hi>America;</hi> when in fact, and truth, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant

               <p>And as touching the third cauſe of demurrer, this appellant ſaith, that the ſame conſiſteth only of <hi>words</hi> without any <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that it is alſo manifeſtly defective in <hi>form:</hi> For that he is adviſed by his council, that to talk of <hi>proſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as to the fourth cauſe of demurrer, which aſſerts, That a <hi>harmleſs</hi> biſhop is not known in the law, this repliant doth charge, that the ſaid appellees do only thereby diſcover their <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> to biſhops as they are connected with the ſtate, and this repliant verily believes, that the ſaid aſſertion is falſe, ſo far forth as it reſpects them. But for as much as this repliant and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, want only a <hi>primitive</hi> biſhop, he conceives it would be ſufficient for over-ruling the ſaid demurrer, if it were found that a <hi>harmleſs</hi> biſhop is known in the <hi>goſpel;</hi> and this repliant avers, that from the goſpel it doth appear that a biſhop may be a <hi>harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, blameleſs, inoffenſive creature.</hi>

               <p>As to the fifth cauſe of demurrer, this repliant ſaith, as he has already ſaid in anſwer to the ſecond; with this further. That the title claimed by the <hi>uninterrupted ſucceſſion,</hi> was not to the one tenth of the premiſes, nor to any temporal powers, as an unali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enable appendage to the biſhops office in <hi>America;</hi> and that the ſaid appellees, whoſe clergy ſupport their right of ordination, in, by, and through the ſame <hi>uninterrupted ſucceſſion,</hi> are deriding their own order, while they are laughing at that of the church, who only place the ſucceſſion in <hi>biſhops,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>preſbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the ſixth cauſe of demurrer, wherein it is ſaid the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellees are charged with <hi>blowing the trumpet of ſedition,</hi> this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant ſaith, That he is conuſant of no ſuch imputation againſt them in the ſaid Appeal: and that he cannot conceive by what ſtrange <hi>tergiverſations, ſophiſtications,</hi> and <hi>twiſtifications,</hi> his
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:010857_0094_0F851FA1E1B14650"/>words have been ſo tortured, perverted, and <hi>tranſmogrified,</hi> as to give colour thereto. And foraſmuch as the ſaid Appeal ſought not a diſcovery in any ſuch matters that were <hi>criminal</hi> in their nature, or which would expoſe the appellees to <hi>corporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>Fine,</hi> the ſame cannot by any pretence be made the ground of a demurrer to the ſaid Appeal, which aimed at no more than <hi>diſcovering</hi> the true principles upon which an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can epiſcopate was deſired, and the <hi>ends</hi> propoſed for the church of <hi>England</hi> thereby.</p>

                  </gap>s touching and concerning the appellees ſeventh cauſe of demurrer, this repliant ſaith, That it is not drawn <hi>ſecundum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> nor is the ſame conſonant to, but tends to confound the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of good pleading which is manifeſt in that it doth per ſaltem, as it were, award the ſentence and decree of the court; which ſentence is premature, being pronounced before the iſſue between the parties were duly joined: And this repliant ſaith, that the ſaid decree is <hi>partial, unjuſt, illegal,</hi> and <hi>unconſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and therefore it is of no force either of law or equity; and this repliant is ready to aver, maintain, and prove, that the ſame is, to all intents and purpoſes, null and void.</p>
               <p>And for further replication to the ſaid anſwer of the appellees, this repliant ſaith, That from time, of which there is no memory of man to the contrary, it hath been plain and manifeſt that <hi>ſome perſons</hi> who do <hi>adviſe, council,</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> the ſaid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellees in all matters and things wherein the intereſt of the ſaid church of England is concerned, ever have done, and ever will Diſapprove of all and every propoſal made for the advancement of the ſaid church, and would at all times endeavour to <hi>moleſt, diſturb, expoſe, deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, reſiſt,</hi> and <hi>repulſe</hi> all reaſonable device and devices made on the part of, and for the benefit of the ſaid church: Wherefore this repliant as concerning the matters of <hi>diſcovery</hi> ſought for by the ſaid Appeal, did not aim to <hi>diſcover</hi> Matters and things ſo luminous, apparent, and notorious to all the good people of this province: and therefore he doth, as to the DISAPPROBATION of the ſaid appellees, ſet forth in their ſaid anſwer, charge that the ſame is impertinent, and not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial in the premiſes; and prays his coſts in this behalf, to be adjudged to him, for the unneceſſary charge he hath been put to thereby.</p>
               <p>And this repliant further ſaith, That if the ſaid appellees have ſeen or heard of any paper or papers, writing or writings, ſaid to be copies of petitions ſent by the convention to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> wherein any <hi>defamations, aſperſions.</hi> and <hi>miſrepreſentations,</hi> &amp;c. are contained, this appellant doth charge that the ſaid pretended copies have been fraudulently, and deceitfully made, fabricated, and conſtructed by the ſaid appellees themſelves, or ſome of them,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:010857_0095_0F851FABC2611D98"/>or by and with their, or ſome or one of their privity, knowledge or conſent, in order thereby to give colourable pretext to their oppoſition againſt the ſaid Appeal; which this appellant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be very unfair, unjuſt, unrighteous, and iniquitous, if the ſame be true. And as this repliant is very certain that no ſuch <hi>defamations,</hi> &amp;c. are ſpecified and contained in the ſaid ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal petitions, he is conſtrained to believe, either that ſuch ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitious copies have been made and given out as aforeſaid, or that in default thereof the ſaid appellees, or rather their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, have taken upon themſelves to <hi>ſurmiſe,</hi> and publiſh what they had not the leaſt evidence of any kind to believe.</p>
               <p>And as for and concerning the ſaid appellees <hi>denial</hi> of ever having <hi>perſecuted</hi> the church in <hi>America,</hi> or that ſhe ever was perſecuted by any other perſon or perſons, this repliant doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and will maintain and prove, that in <hi>times paſt,</hi> the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees, or their anceſtors in <hi>America,</hi> or in ſome parts thereof, have been known to uſe and exerciſe <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>perſecution</hi> towards the ſaid church; and by all the ways and means in their power, to make and render her in very deed, a church <hi>militant;</hi> and true it is, that in <hi>theſe latter days,</hi> the ſaid church hath in <hi>ſuch ſort</hi> become <hi>triumphant,</hi> as to preſerve herſelf free and clear, and freely and clearly indemnified, exonerated, and diſcharged of and from all former <hi>judgments, Fines, Amerciaments, impoſitions, Troubles,</hi> and <hi>Incumbrances,</hi> made and executed by the anceſtors of the ſaid Appellees, or any perſon or perſons claiming the <hi>right of perſecution,</hi> by, from, or under them, in <hi>America:</hi> But this repliant doth nevertheleſs believe, that there are divers cauſes, grounds, and reaſons, upon which the ſaid <hi>exemption</hi> may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, other than that of a thorough change in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the ſaid Appellees, which this repliant cannot admit to have been effectually wrought in them.</p>
               <p>And this repliant further ſaith, that he doth admit it may be true, that the ſaid Appllees have not now in their cuſtody or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, the <hi>charter of uninterrupted ſucceſſion,</hi> mentioned in the ſaid appeal; for that he conceives there might be, and really were good reaſons againſt entruſting the poſſeſſion thereof with them; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſt that the ſaid Appellees have not, nor ever had that cordial love, affection, good will, or benevolence towards the ſaid church of England, which would have rendered this fundamental right of her's ſafe in their hands. And this repliant is rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elined to believe, that had the ſaid charter ever been entruſted with the ſaid Appellees the ſame would have been kept <hi>ſocret, privy, spake, covert and occult,</hi> or otherwiſe deſtroyed, ſo that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant and his aſſociates, never could at any time or times hereafter, have had or gotten the ſame again; or if the ſaid appellees ever had the ſaid charter, and the ſame hath not been ſo ſecreted or
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:010857_0095_0F851FABC2611D98"/>deſtroyed, this repliant doubts not but that it hath been either ſo obſcured, altered raiſed, obliterated, interlined and defaced, or ſo changed by falſe gloſſes, forced innuendos, perverſions, evaſions, prevarications, ſubtilties, and unſcriptural interpretations, that it is now become not the <hi>ſame</hi> charter whereof mention is made in the ſaid Appeal, but <hi>other</hi> and <hi>divers.</hi> Wherefore this repliant doth not deny but that the ſaid Appellees may poſſibly, from one or other of the cauſes before mentioned, be well ſatisfied either that they have not, nor ever had the ſaid original charter: or if they had, that the ſame is altogether become forfeited, vacated, and repealed by the means, devices, and artifices aforeſaid.</p>

                  <p>Unacquainted! Why, can you be ignorant, that the ſame reaſons which made us enemies to the church, engage us to be equally ſo to biſhops. As we are fond of contention and diſorder, ſo it muſt be painful to ſee harmony and peace among others. The church will be a wall between us and power; we muſt therefore break thro' it, or riſe over its ruins.—I ſay then there ſhall be no biſhops, they are <hi>Holy tyrants, Apoſtolical-Monarchs,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:010857_0096_0F851FAE6D72CFB8"/>ſpiritual-Generaliſſimo's, law-dignified, court-favourred blood-ſuckers;</hi> they have drank of the cup of the whore of Babylon. If the clergy deſire ſuch biſhops as they deſire, they ſhall have them, "it would be unreaſonable to deny them what their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends on,"—but they do not deſire what they deſire, neither ſhall they have any biſhop at all, for a biſhop will perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute: If he touches a meeting-houſe, it will turn to a cook's ſhop,—He'll ſwallow down for his breakfaſt lands, tenements, with all and ſingular the poſſeſſions of independants.—His breath will blaſt the fruits of the field.—His urine will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion inundations, and the wind from his poſteriors, blow away our ſynod-men like locuſts to the Red-Sea.—He'll dig up the bones of our forefathers for his food, and drink the wine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication out of their ſcull bones. I ſay, I am a friend to the rights of private judgment, therefore, though the church thinks the ordination of biſhops neceſſary, ſhe ſhall not have it here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think it is not, I <hi>ſay</hi> it is not. If they aſked a primitive biſhop, that is, a biſhop ſuffering perſecution, and exiled from place to place. I could wiſh them <hi>good ſpeed,</hi> becauſe there are no ſuch. They appeal for a biſhop, that ſhall have power only over his own clergy, but I ſay they don't aſk for ſuch a biſhop, and whoever doubts what I ſay, is a ſuperſtitious bigot; and if he is a clergyman, I'll tell him he lies, to his face.</p>

                  <p>On the ſucceſs of this one attempt, my future ſchemes depend.—If I can once get this "ſcarlet whore, the church." bound in the chains I have prepared, I'll ſtrip her by degrees of her covering, give her to penury and want, and turn her, naked, to the inſults and contempt of the world.—Nay, I doubt not, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a precedent, (in imitation of him who ſet fire to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Diana,</hi>) I ſhall be able to eſtabliſh my reputation on the ruins of all religion. My firſt attack, after levelling the notions of an hierarchy, ſhould be made on all the prieſthood: I could aſſert, (to the great comfort of all deiſts) that the clergy of all denominations have been of more diſſervice than advantage to religion, bringing the underſtandings of men under eccleſiaſtical bondage, placing devotion in wigs and ſtarch'd bands, piety in a mortified face, and prayer in harmonious gruntings from the
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:010857_0097_0F851FAEECBCBA70"/>throat, and melodious twangs from the noſe: That they darken the truth, by teaching for doctrines the commandments of men, and never fail, when they have it in their power, to pillage and butcher mankind.—Then I could proceed to aim at Chriſtianity, as occaſioning wars and diſſentions, and the moſt bitter rancour among men, and I doubt not (as the clergy, its deſenders, would be exterminated) but I ſhould find it an eaſy taſk, to prove its uſe leſs than its diſadvantage to mankind. Here will be a ſtate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted by prieſts, or public worſhip; then will commence <hi>the foundation of a regular American conſtitution;</hi> a phoenix govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, riſing from the aſhes of <hi>Great-Britain; omnipotence contends for it!</hi> Who can retard its ſtructure?</p>

            <head>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Monday May 30th. To the Printer of the <hi>KICK.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>DOCTOR Chandler informs us in his Appeal, p. 57. that <hi>there are about eight hundred and forty four thouſand blacks in our iſlands and colonies,</hi> who are <hi>known chiefly to belong to the profeſſors of the church of England;</hi> and who according to his repreſentation and reaſoning, muſt be reputed to belong to that church, and that therefore there is great need of an American Epiſcopate, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now this part of his ſcheme may be greatly improved, by ſhewing the propriety, that the biſhop, or biſhops ſo devoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, ſhould be of the ſame colour and nation. It is allowed by all parties, that biſhops ſhould be <hi>grave;</hi> and it is equally well known that by the conſent of mankind in general, black is an emblem of gravity, Thus biſhops, and even, clergymen of all denominations, commonly wear black cloth of one kind or other, Hence it is obvious at firſt ſight, that a biſhop who was really black would have a great privilege in reſpect of gravity, which is an eſſential qualification of an Epiſcopate. This would conduce much to his venerable appearance.</p>
            <p>And ſince there are ſo many blacks who are churchmen, there would be a great congruity in appointing over them biſhops of their own colour and nation. For negroes have their national pride and prejudices, as well as other nations, and on many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts have averſion to the whites. They would therefore be much more likely to receive the inſtructions of religion from one of themſelves, than from one of another nation. This is ſo plain, that it would be to ſuppoſe too much dulneſs in the reader not to perceive it. And thus the great and good ends propoſed by Dr. Chandler, cannot be obtained, but by having a black biſhop ſent to America. And in the next edition of the Doctor's Appeal, he will doubtleſs improve this important thought, and amplify it by his fruitful genius into a pathetic ſection; eſpecially ſince without it his ſcheme is far from being uniform and complete.</p>
            <p>There are many precedents of <hi>Africans</hi> being biſhops; was not the famous St. Auſtin an African? And he informs us, that there were nine hundred biſhops in Africa, in his time. <hi>Auguſt. Tom.</hi> VII. <hi>de geſtis cumemerit.</hi> And ſince there are ſo many hundred thouſands of blacks who are churchmen, why ſhould they be denied the great privilege of having a biſhop of themſelves.</p>
            <p>It cannot be pretended, that it will put the nation to more expence to appoint negroes for biſhops, than other men, or that it will give
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:010857_0098_0F851FAF61244890"/>more umbrage to other denominations; but it would be eaſy to ſhew, that both theſe would be greatly removed by this meaſure, as every one muſt be convinced by his own candid examination of the caſe.</p>
            <p>Tho much has been ſaid about the uninterrupted line of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, yet it has never been pretended that it was neceſſary it ſhould be confined to men of a certain hue or colour. It will be readily granted, that a negroe can take as faſt hold of this rope, as any other man, and make as good uſe of it as others have done. —It is alſo certain, with regard to ordination by the impoſition of hands and confirmation, that black hands will be as commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative of divine miniſterial authority and holy impreſſions, as white ones. If any deny this, let them ſhew that the validity of divine inſtitutions is limited to a certain particular colour; or that there is not as much weight in the hands of a black dioceſan, as of any other.</p>
            <p>And thus there are many reaſons for a negro epiſcopate in the colonies, and no objections have as yet been offered againſt it, nor is it eaſily conceived that there can be any of much weight: But if there ſhould be any, let the objectors propoſe them with modeſty and candour, and they ſhall receive a due conſideration from the public's moſt humble ſervant</p>

Well! who would think that a man could draw his own picture ſo well?—but in this part alſo. (as on every occaſion afterwards) Squire <hi>T.</hi> nobly diſtinguiſhes himſelf by his pertinent criticiſms on the <hi>Whig's</hi> language. Why don't you mind words more, Mr. <hi>Whig?</hi> ſurely you don't conſider, that a fault in ſtyle, may ruin a good thought, and confute one of your own arguments.

               <p>I THANK you for the publication of my former letter, ſigned an American Churchman, and as I now renew the correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the ſame deſign of vindicating our church from the odious imputation of a deſign to introduce biſhops into America, you have leave to make the ſame uſe of it. I call the imputation odious, becauſe as the law now ſtands, we cannot have an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in this country, but upon terms more miſchievous than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial. I have already ſhewn, that biſhops will neceſſarily bring with them the eccleſiaſtical courts, and ſubjugate the colonies to the pride and tyranny of the clergy; evils of all others to be moſt dreaded; and which to prevent and abhor, I hope, is as conſiſtent with the character of a churchman, as of any other denomination. All who expect to better their circumſtances by his lordſhip's favour, will fret at the oppoſition, and be apt to deny the moderate epiſcopalians, who diſapprove their ambition and indiſcretion, to be true ſons of the church. This was a ſtratagem of the papiſts, and is now imitated by the tories, who to catch the vulgar, cover their real deſigns, under the cloak of zeal for the cauſe. But her glory never depended upon the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious devotees who crowd into her boſom: She acquired honour at the reformation, by the catholiciſm of her chief leaders; and thoſe who have preſerved it ſince, have always been diſtinguiſhed by the holineſs of their lives, the charitableneſs of their tempers, their prudence, their love of liberty, and deteſtation of bondage. Our characters of renown, are ſuch as <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Burnet, Hoadly</hi> and <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> who were as eminent for their meekneſs, as for their piety and erudition. <hi>Laud, Manwaring Sibthorp, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> and <hi>Sacheverel,</hi> are their contraſts; and with pride in their hearts, <hi>the church the church,</hi> on their tongues, and a fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in their hands; were ready for every project, which ſavage intolerance, and the execrable principles of paſſive obedience, and non-reſiſtance, could dictate. All ſocieties are expoſed to hot and deſigning ſpirits, who would be willing to turn the world up-ſide down; and men of cool heads ſind often more difficulty

                  </gap>n guarding the church againſt the raſhneſs of her friends, than the open attacks of her enemies. It was the violence of a few bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots that obliged the government to ſhut up the convocation, and deprive the church of England of the privilege of meeting in ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and councils; a privilege infinitely more important to her, than the preſence of biſhops in this country can be to us,—a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, or to ſpeak more properly, a right, perhaps eſſential to the well-being of the church of Chriſt, and certainly agreeable to the uſage of every other Chriſtian church, in all countries, from the apoſtolic age, to the preſent day. Let thoſe who conſider the diſtance of our biſhops as an unparralleled hardſhip, reflect upon this loſs, which the church of the mother-country has ſuſtained, and by which ſhe is become diſagreeably diſtinguiſhed from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian church in the world. It teaches a good leſſon to us all; ſhe ſubmits to it, and her beſt friends ſubmit willingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more evil than good, probably would continue to be the conſequence of the aſſembling of her clergy; and if ſuch is like to be the caſe, upon our eſtabliſhment of a hierarchy in America, we ſhall approve ourſelves good Chriſtians, good ſubjects, and good churchmen too, by a peaceable demeanor, under the trifling inconveniencies, comparatively ſpeaking, which we feel from the remoteneſs of the biſhop of London, to whoſe care our churches are more particularly entruſted.</p>
               <p>But whether it was our duty to be content with our preſent ſtate, or not; yet ſince the eſtabliſhment of biſhopricks in America, will make a vaſt change in our eccleſiaſtical ſtate, and naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a long train of alarming conſequences; I cannot help thinking, the very manner in which relief has been ſought for, ſubject to ſevere cenſure; and, that the people of our denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be the firſt to complain.</p>
               <p>From the beſt information I have been able to obtain, the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> iſlands, had no concern in the late peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tranſmitted on this ſubject; they ſeem to have been hatched by a few warm miſſionaries in the provinces of <hi>New-York, New-Jerſey,</hi> and <hi>Penſylvania;</hi> and propagated to the Eaſtern colonies by the help of the frequent unconſtitutional aſſemblies, latterly convoked under the name of the convention. It is a raſh enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of the clergy, without the intervention of the laity; and therefore ought not to be charged upon the church in general. I venture to affirm, that the majority of their hearers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y, that ſome of the moſt reſpectable members of the churches, uncer the care of theſe very miſſionaries, knew nothing of the deſign, till the petitions were actually tranſinitted. In ſo important a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, affecting every epiſcopal church in America, all the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and ſuch of the laity, as were moſt diſtinguiſhed for their
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:010857_0100_0F851FB0DFA2B970"/>rank and abilities, ought, doubtleſs, to have been conſulted: And had the projectors been as eminent for their prudence, as they have ſignalized themſelves for their heat and precipitation; the public would not have been expoſed to the anxieties, jealouſies and animoſities, with which the whole continent is now diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and alarmed.</p>
               <p>Admitting all that Doctor <hi>Chandler</hi> has alledged, to be true, yet <hi>a novelty</hi> was to be introduced; and though the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention aſſiſted, ſtill the ſtate of this country, as oppoſed to a hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, the dignities and privileges annexed to the order of biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, in that from whence they are expected; the effect the law might have upon the claims of the new biſhops, and the manner of guarding againſt powers, of which we ourſelves are fearful, and which the Doctor himſelf will not permit them to enjoy; all conſpired to dictate a proceeding in a matter of this weight, with the utmoſt deliberation. It is in vain to attempt a vindication, by alledging, that all men were conſulted by the Appeal; becauſe the machination was already begun to be carried into execution; the petitions being actually preferred: The Appeal was a ſecond ſtep towards it—and the very queſtion whether an alarm of the colonies at this juncture, was proper or not, deſerved the previous conſideration of all the friends of the church. The publication of the Appeal, was itſelf therefore a great error, and cannot juſtify the firſt; ſo that there has been a contempt in this proceſs of the greater part of our clergy, and of the whole laity, except a few, from whoſe inſignificancy, the projectors perhaps, expected nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aid nor oppoſition. But this not all, their conduct is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable for their ſhameful neglect, both of the government and the biſhop of London.</p>
               <p>Seven addreſſes intimately aſſecting all the epiſcopal churches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the continent, and to perſonages, and bodies of ſuch rank as the ſovereign himſelf, the two arch-biſhops, the ſociety for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the goſpel, the biſhop of London, and the two univerſities of Oxford and Cambridge, and upon a ſubject of the moſt delicate nature; ought to have been laid before the governors of thoſe provinces, at leaſt, where the petitioners reſided. If the deſign was good, their aid was expedient; and it might be expected from them, as repreſentatives of his Majeſty, who is by law the ſupreme head of the church—Add to this, that being intereſted as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries in their provinces, there could be neither decency nor juſtice, in ſoliciting an enterpriſe, in which they were, or might be deeply concerned, by a diminution of their perquiſites without their privity and concurrence.</p>
               <p>And as to his lordſhip the biſhop of London, their <hi>ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="199" facs="unknown:010857_0100_0F851FB0DFA2B970"/>the churches in this country. In theſe, while the rights of conſcience are ſecured to all proteſtants, due care is taken for the better government of our churches, by an order to the governors, to give countenance and encouragement to the exerciſe of the eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction of the biſhop of London.<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>The ſtanding inſtructions to the governors, are nearly ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in all the provinces, not chartered, nor granted to proprietors.

               <p>The epiſcopal church in the city of <hi>New-York,</hi> was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by a law of the colony, in Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s reign on the 27th of <hi>June,</hi> 1704; and the inſtitution and induction of the rectors is enacted, to be "in ſuch manner, and always, as ſhall be moſt ſuitable to her Majeſty's inſtructions to his Excellency the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of this colony, for the time being, and that canonical right and authority which the Right Rev. Father in God, <hi>Henry</hi> lord biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and his ſucceſſors hath, and ſhall have, over the ſaid church." With whatever contempt therefore, ſome may think and ſpeak of the authority of this prelate in America; the miſſionaries ordained by him, ought above all others to have treated his claims, ſo honourably guarded, with peculiar reſpect. I ſpeak as a churchman; our clergy, in my humble opinion, ought, not only to have acquainted his lordſhip of the deſign of erecting one or more dioceſes, within that which he claims for the See of <hi>London.</hi> before any petitions were preſented to others; but to have had his expreſs approbation for holding the conventions in which they were contrived. That any applications to this end, were ever made to him before the commencement of the execution of this plain, I have never heard; nor without good proof will be induced to believe. Had ſuch been the caſe, their ſucceſs could not well have remained a ſecret to this day; nor is it conceivable, that his lordſhip would have countenanced conventions or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:010857_0101_0F851ED558581228"/>of the clergy in America, not allowed of in England; or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal addreſſes to the throne, upon a ſubject ſo new and important, without bringing his majeſty acquainted with the deſign; who, would doubtleſs have ſuſpended his royal concurrence, till the governors of the provinces had been ordered to report upon the expediency, both of the aim of the petitioners, and the manner propoſed for carrying it into execution.</p>
               <p>But this cenſure upon the mode, will fall with ſo much the greater weight, as the project itſelf is to the laſt degree danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.—'Tis granted, that the introduction of biſhops will give us ſome advantage of which we are now deprived; but the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, whether greater evils will not enſue, than thoſe we now complain of. Becauſe the church in America is not ſo complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly organized as we could wiſh, are we to be regardleſs of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences injurious to our country, and perhaps to the laws of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion itſelf? Gold, as the old ſaying is, may be purchaſed too dear. I acknowledge that more diſcipline is wanting; but to the honour of our miſſionaries, the neceſſity in this reſpect is very far from being urgent, except in <hi>Maryland,</hi> and the iſlands. The expence of a voyage to <hi>London,</hi> for ordination, has its advantages and diſadvantages; and confirmation is a rite which is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly rational, and has its uſes; but I can truſt the mercy of God without it; and after all, who will dare ſay we are a church without a biſhop. We are under the paſtoral care of the biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> and if his lordſhip's diſtance is in ſome reſpects to be lamented, yet, to be honeſt, we muſt confeſs, that he has the whole ſociety for propagating the goſpel to aſſiſt him; an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage this to him, and to us, never to be concealed, but freely mentioned, and with the utmoſt gratitude. As our miſſionaries are dependent upon their generoſity, they hold the power to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them with eaſe; nor can we reproach the ſociety with any inſtance of their neglecting to withhold their allowance from a ſingle clergyman, duly convicted of immoral behaviour: So that in point of diſcipline, inſtead of magnifying our diſtreſs, we can beaſt a ſuperiority to any part of England; for there, a wicked prieſt, by a leſs precarious ſubſiſtence, and the intereſt of power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful patrons, often out-braves the paſtoral authority of his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al father. This is a grievance the biſhops greatly lament, and from which the church cannot be relieved, till the parochial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents, by a change of the law, are become more dependent upon the people, or their eccleſiaſtical ſuperiors.</p>
               <p>Happy, therefore, as the circumſtances of the churches are in America, there is really no foundation for adventuring upon the innovation, for which ſome men affect to be ſo vehemently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. The benefit ſought for, is not worth the expence of the trouble and diſgrace already brought upon us, by the jealouſy of the
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:010857_0101_0F851ED558581228"/>reſt of our countrymen. I ſpeak for myſelf, (and anxious for the honour of our church, I am happy in being able to ſay, that I know it to be agreeable to the general voice of the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and reputable perſons of our perſuaſion,) that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ther we ſhould be under the See of <hi>London,</hi> diſtant as his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is, with the aid of the ſociety to ſupport him, while the world laſts; than run the moſt diſtant riſk of expoſing this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the unchriſtian chaſtiſement of the ſpiritual courts, for the ſpace of a ſingle year. And yet, that is not the only evil which will follow from the erection of epiſcopates in America.—An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the power of the clergy of any denomination, where we are ſplit into ſo many, will diſturb and depopulate the continent, and ſpoil the faireſt proſpect of eſtabliſhing a glorious, rich, and happy empire, which the world ever ſaw. I love Chriſtianity for its philanthropy; and its friendlineſs to mankind, I eſteem as one of the beſt proofs that it came down from our benevolent father, who is in heaven.—It was ſaid by a great perſonage in the laſt reign, that it was the peculiar felicity of the plantations, that all proteſtant ſects were upon a par; and that the crown unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed by any perſecuting laws, was at liberty to reward every man according to his merit. A ſpeech this, that would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a philoſopher, and which, diſguſtful as it may be to the ſour ſoul of a bigot, would have been approved by LOCKE, that prince of philoſophers; and who was at the ſame time, one of the brighteſt ornaments of our church and nation. The principle is beſides as politic, as it is Chriſtian. Conſiſting of but a handful, what could England have done towards the ſettlement of this continent, which is now become ſo great a magazine of her wealth, had ſhe not given into the moſt liberal toleration. What matters it to the nation by what blood, or by what perſuaſion ſhe is ſerved, if ſhe is but well ſerved: And has not the experience of more than a century evinced, that the Americans, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt chiefly of foreign proteſtants, Scotch and Iriſh preſbyterians, and Engliſh diſſenters, breathe a ſpirit of loyalty, perfectly free from the Jacobitiſm and Toryiſm of thoſe Sacheverelian bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for <hi>the church, the church;</hi> who are ſo ſcandalous to her, ſo dangerous to the government, and ſo rampant in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and numerous in other parts of the mother country.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is not only agreeable to the principles of ſound po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to give no ſect an offenſive preheminence in the colonies, (which an epiſcopate tends to promote,) but it is really what the nation with which England has connected herſelf, ſince America was explored, may with juſtice expect; and to prevent which, the Americans themſelves will proceed to the greateſt extremities. For as to Scotland, ſince preſbyterianiſm has as lawful, and national, and reputable an eſtabliſhment there, as epiſcopacy has
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:010857_0102_0F851ED5E2C123F8"/>in the ſouthern part of the iſland; and this continent is peopled by emigrations from both, no reaſon can be aſſigned for any odious diſtinctions to the prejudice of the ſons of either of thoſe churches. As to the Americans, what is the language of their charters, the commiſſions and inſtructions to their governors, the ſtatute of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization, and the colony laws unrepealed, with the conſtant uſage of government, in appointing perſons to places both of truſt and profit, without any religious diſcrimination; but that if they are proteſtants and good ſubjects, nothing more will be expected? Depending upon this, people of different nations came out, and ſettled this wilderneſs; and thereby acquired a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for Great-Britain, which, if ſhe had been left to herſelf, ſhe never could have people. The Americans have therefore a compact to plead for their immunities: And all the benefits which flow from this country, whether they reſpect extent of commerce, wealth, or the augmentation of the number of Britiſh ſubjects, even in Europe; to which laſt, the growth of the colonies has greatly conduced; are what we bring in our hands in return for the privileges we enjoy. Away then with every ill-policied into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerant, contemptible, prieſtly project, contrived in a conclave, convocation, convention, or any other neſt of narrow minded, proud, ignorant, inflammatory parſons. No biſhop without a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual court. 'Tis by this rod, the church of England, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent ſtate of the law, corrects her diſorderly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. And if a number of theſe judicatories are once ſet up in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, farewell to thoſe emigrations from Europe, which have proved ſuch fruitful nurſeries to this country. The bare apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion if it ſpreads acroſs the Atlantic, will do us more harm than many are aware of. Aſſure yourſelf, Sir, that it is not the church, nor even the majority of our clergy, that wiſh ſucceſs to this ſilly ſcheme; to thoſe only who are in the pay of the ſociety, and of theſe, to ſuch as are diſcontented with their allowance, it is to be imputed. All the reſt of the epiſcopal clergy are quiet, and the body of the laity wiſh the miſſionaries had been ſo too. For the ſatisfaction of the weaker ſort, who think otherwiſe, I ſhall in ſome future letters abundantly ſhew, that, whether the non-epiſcopalians are right or wrong, in this controverſy; we ſhall be wrong, if we perſiſt in teazing the government to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize a ſcheme, that may, if it proceeds, involve us either in the calamities of a civil war; or by driving the preſent inhabitants out, or ſtopping further importations into the country, prevent the ſettlement of our lands, and by ſinking their value, plunge us into ruin, and perhaps drag the nation after us into the ſame pit of deſtruction.</p>

               <p>SQUIRE T. <hi>hates controverſy—eſpecially with an unfair, abuſive adverſary;</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> II. par. I.)

But who is this <hi>unfair and abuſive adverſary</hi> of <hi>Squire Tickle</hi>'s? The WHIG. Why, <hi>Jack Catch</hi> never dignifies the malefactor with this appellation. Alas! <hi>Squire T.</hi> (the <hi>Whig's</hi> Whipper) certainly does not conſider, that he does too much honour to a raſcal (who, taking no notice of his blows, ſays not a word to him, and whoſe backſide only is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him) in calling him his <hi>adverſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>general</hi> obſervations in par. 2d. and 4th, all the world muſt allow to be juſt; but their <hi>particular</hi> application muſt be ſubmitted to the <hi>tribunal of the public.</hi> So that par. 2d, 3d, 4th and 5th, I ſhall <hi>truſs up</hi> like two <hi>brace of ſnipes on one and the ſame ſpit;</hi> only <hi>baſting</hi> them with this obſervation, that I've often heard of a <hi>calf</hi>'s, but never of a <hi>bull</hi>'s being begot; nor did I ever before dream, that <hi>one ſingle bull</hi> could be begot upon <hi>two dams,</hi> and thoſe ſo different as a <hi>ſheep</hi> and a <hi>wolf.</hi>—Squire Tickle's <hi>very good friend, &amp;c.</hi> JACR PUNLOVE, muſt needs be a <hi>very cunning fellow!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Par. 6th. <hi>Squire T.</hi> declares, that the <hi>Whig</hi> and his <hi>faction,</hi> have <hi>written, and done</hi> NOTHING AT ALL <hi>in behalf of their country,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:010857_0103_0F851ED6B8A1C5B0"/>to avert impending miſchiefs.</hi> How he knows this, I know not; but this one thing I know, that, if the late ſcribbling about <hi>biſhops</hi> has occaſioned <hi>diviſions</hi> and <hi>diſtractions,</hi> Squire <hi>T.</hi> acts very <hi>conſiſtently (with himſelf)</hi> in charging all to the <hi>Whig</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for who does not know, that the <hi>Whig</hi> wrote <hi>againſt</hi> biſhops, long before Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> wrote <hi>for</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Par. 7th <hi>Squire T.</hi> commends ſome late patriotic writers, and that not without reaſon, any man readily commends another, who exerts himſelf to preſerve that property, which he hopes one day will be his prey; and no <hi>Tory</hi> will in any caſe quarrel with <hi>even a Whig,</hi> while his views are not inconſiſtent with his own. However, I fancy <hi>Squire T.</hi> little ſuſpects, that even that <hi>Whig,</hi> that champion for liberty, the FARMER himſelf, is one of the beſt writers againſt an American Epiſcopate; had he known this ſooner, his 7th might have been of the ſame complexion with his 8th paragraph.</p>
               <p>That the reader may diſcover the merit of par. 9th I beg leave to refer him to Dr. <hi>Ram-chicken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Par. 10th. Squire <hi>T.</hi> points out the <hi>Whig's</hi> ſelf contradictions, the groſsneſs of which every one muſt needs ſee, who conſiders, that <hi>in, by, and through the church, and ſo far as ſhe is concerned in the premiſes, Dr.</hi> Chandler<hi>'s Appeal ſeems to breathe a zeal for religion,</hi> ſignifies preciſely the ſame thing as Dr. <hi>Chandler breathes a zeal for religion;</hi> and that ASKS, <hi>without</hi> a condition, expreſſes no more than SEEMS TO ASK, <hi>with</hi> one. If in the other inſtances the reader, on again examining the <hi>Whig,</hi> ſhould be at a loſs to find the inconſiſtency, he, will no doubt wonder at the acuteneſs of Squire <hi>T</hi>'s. <hi>eyeſight,</hi> which enables him to diſcover what no body elſe can.</p>
               <p>What a fool the <hi>Whig</hi> was to talk of <hi>Bellarmine! Bellarmine</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ch—r,</hi> however ſimilar, were <hi>abſolutely, utterly, and entirely</hi> different perſons. (<hi>Compare</hi> WHIG, No. I. par. 2, and WHIP, No. II. par. 2.)</p>
               <p>Par. 12th, is full of criticiſm (which Squire <hi>T. loves dearly</hi>) and par. 13th ſuggeſts a reflection on the vaſt force it has to knock down argument.</p>
               <p>In par. 14th, Squire <hi>T.</hi> ſcolds at the poor <hi>Whig,</hi> and his party, moſt vehemently, though he had done the ſame ſeveral times before. So have I heard an <hi>old woman</hi> ſcold herſelf out of breath—then puff—and blow—and then ſcold again. <hi>Squire T.</hi> charges the <hi>Whig</hi> with <hi>miſrepreſentation,</hi> (what was it a late writer ſaid about <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s wife?) and if any man dares ſay it is an unjuſt charge, or that there is one ſingle <hi>miſrepreſentation</hi> in par. 10th, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> II of the <hi>Whip,</hi> he'll be ſcolded at as an enemy to the CHURCH, and an <hi>adverſary,</hi>—an abuſive adverſary, (oh! dreadful!) to Squire <hi>Tickle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Par. 16th proves <hi>Squire T.</hi> a maſter indelicacy of compoſition; I dare defy the whole world to produce his equal. Let <hi>ſcribbled,

               </opener>
               <p>I AM glad to find at laſt the appearance of one in your paper of the 23d of May, who ſeems as if he was willing to come to the merits of the cauſe in his ſhort way to end ſtrife: To whom I beg leave to anſwer in the order of his particulars, which, N. B. it may be well for the reader of this to have under his eye.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is indeed certain, that the convention do deſire an American biſhop, and that very earneſtly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is no leſs certain, that they do want, and deſire only a truly primative biſhop, meaning ſuch a one as Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, whoſe buſineſs ſhall be, (beſides what is common to the other orders) only to ordain and govern the clergy, and confirm the laity, which they are perſuaded the moſt primitive biſhops always did.</p>
               <p n="3">3. However uncharitably incredulous Mr. <hi>Whig</hi> is, it is alſo moſt certain, that they mean as they ſay, and that without the leaſt equivocation, or mental reſervation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is by no means certain, as the writer ſays, that a modern Engliſh biſhop, would be at all dangerous to the religious rights and privileges of any non-epiſcopalians here; nay, the contrary is at leaſt highly probable, becauſe they are not ſo now in England, nor have been for almoſt a 100 years, nor I believe ever will again.—However, <hi>bona fide</hi> we deſire no biſhops that can ever, by the conſtitution, have any concern with non-epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians, any other than Chriſtian good neighbourhood:—We would not by any means, have them have any concern with any temporal or civil matters, nor hold any ſpiritual courts, only ſuch as relate to our own clergy; let therefore our non-epiſcopal bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, henceforth, for the future lay aſide all terror about them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We do therefore aver, that neither Mr. <hi>Whig</hi> nor any one elſe, have any manner of occaſion to be alarmed about their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberty, of which we don't know how indeed, they can be more ſecure than they are.—We do not blame them for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:010857_0104_0F851ED7678FB368"/>concerned for religious as well as civil liberty, in both which we agree with them; it is only the cauſe of liberty we plead, and whether they will believe it or not, we are as heartily deſirous of their liberty as our own.—We only want to be upon as good a foot as they are, i. e. to have ordaining and governing powers of our own within ourſelves, as they have, in which we would by no means moleſt them,</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is therefore plain, that theſe Tory ſcribblers among the preſbyterians, (for the gentleman that calls himſelf a Whig, is really a moſt violent Tory, for the true old Whigs were always reaſonable, moderate, and charitable men,) I ſay, theſe Tory ſcribblers, for repreſenting us as a faction, againſt the liberties of the country, and a ſet of deſigning men, that aim at introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing eccleſiaſtical tyranny are, indeed extremely abuſive to us of the church, not to ſay outragiouſly ſo.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I know all the gentlemen of the convention very well, and have all the reaſon to believe (that men can give) that they are honeſt men, and mean no more than I have repreſented; and that they are ready to give all the ſecurity in their power; that they deſire no further. And</p>
               <p n="8">8. I beg any reaſonable man, or body of men, would tell us in the ſpirit of Chriſtian meekneſs, what further ſecurity they would deſire, beyond our ſolemn aſſeverations, that we may, if poſſible, ſatisfy them. And</p>
               <p n="9">9. I beg in the name of all that is good, to know, why till this is done, the oppoſition ſhould not be, at leaſt, ſuſpended, and opportunity be given to attend to this ſingle point. And</p>
               <p n="10">10. When this is adjuſted, I hope all controverſy, and every unchriſtian temper will forever ceaſe, and be no more.</p>

            <head>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, May 9th. <hi>The</hi> CENTINEL. No. XII.</head>
            <p>IN my laſt Publication, I ſtated the Conduct of Parliament to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Admiralty Court in England, and compared it with their very different Behaviour towards it in America. I think it a very remarkable and alarming Inſtance of the miſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Effects, that muſt follow from "our Superiors" in England undertaking to make internal Regulations for the Colonies. If they ſhould liſten to the Miſſionaries, and attempt to provide for
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:010857_0104_0F851ED7678FB368"/>us a religious Eſtabliſhment, they would probably do as much more Harm, as the Subject is of more Importance. Every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance leads to this Concluſion.</p>
            <p>No Body of Men is intereſted in ſupporting undue Stretches of Power, or Abuſes in the Admiral's Court, and it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that on proper and reiterated Repreſentations, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State might do us Juſtice, in Reſpect of that arbitrary Judicature, or other Inſtances wherein our Rights have been violated; at leaſt it would be in their Power to do it. The Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the People of Ireland, in procuring the Limitation of their Parliaments, and the Independency of their Judges after long Endeavours, ought to inſpirit our Attempts, and never ſuffer us to deſpair of recovering our Rights.</p>
            <p>But if the clergy once gain an advantage, let the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, or oppreſſions it brings on the laity be what they will, there is no coming at redreſs. Theſe people have the artifice of making a zeal for orthodoxy, and a regard for their own intereſts go hand in hand. By aſſerting their claims and encroachments to be of divine right, under eſtabliſhments they tie up the hands of the magiſtrate, and make it dangerous for him to reform the moſt acknowledged and moſt pernicious abuſes.<note n="‖" place="bottom">

               </note> have, at one time or another, been ſtiffly maintained to
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:010857_0105_0F851ED82546E478"/>be of divine right: and this, when once inſtilled, into the zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but ignorant and more numerous part of their flocks, has generally enabled them to ſupport the moſt unreaſonable uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to baffle all attempts at reformation.</p>
            <p>The riſque we ſhould run, would be heightened by another circumſtance: The <hi>ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles</hi> in England, whoſe power over their inferior clergy, whoſe revenues, dignities, and ſeats in parliament, neceſſarily give them great weight, would find themſelves intereſted to have every power, every privilege they enjoy as far as poſſible, extended to their brethren, the American biſhops. The example of a reduced epiſcopate in the Britiſh dominions, they could not but eſteem dangerous to their own juriſdiction, and they muſt of courſe be induced to exert all their endeavours, and to watch every opportunity, which a weak adminiſtration, or other favourable conjuncture, might afford, to advance and aggrandize the American hierarchy: in which, from the experience we have had of the diſpoſition of ſome, and the inattention of moſt of our <hi>virtual</hi> repreſentatives, there is too much reaſon to fear they would ſucceed to their wiſhes; at leaſt no argument can be drawn from the watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the laity of England, over the cleargy there, that a like caution would ſubſiſt as to the clergy of the colonies: Witneſs the caſe of admiralty juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>Let us for a moment ſuppoſe that Dr. Chandler's ſcheme, as exhibited in Italicks, in the 79th page of his <hi>Appeal,</hi> is <q>without <hi>reſervation or equivocation,</hi> the exact plan of an American epiſcopate, as it hath been ſettled at home.</q> viz. <q>
                  <hi>That the biſhops to be ſent to the colonies ſhall have no authority, but purely of a ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical nature, ſuch as is derived altogether from the church and not from the State—That this authority ſhall operate only on the clergy and not on the laity, nor diſſenters of any denomination—That the biſhops ſhall not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the property or privileges, whether civil or religious, of churchmen or diſſenters—That in particular they ſhall have no concern with the probate of wills, letters of guardianſhip, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration or marriage licences, nor be judges of any caſes relating thereto; but that they ſhall only exerciſe the original powers of their office as before ſtated,</hi> i. e. <hi>ordain and govern the clergy, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter confirmation to ſuch as deſire it.</hi>
               </q> let us ſuppoſe, I ſay, that the word of Dr. Chandler, a private miſſionary, is to be taken in this moſt important affair; and that the biſhops would, <hi>at firſt,</hi> be ſent over with ſuch limited Powers, what Security have we, that they and their Succeſſors, for any long Time, would remain contented with ſuch Limitations: In a Word, that they would continue ſuch harmleſs, inoffenſive People, as the Doctor repreſents them? Has this order of men been remarkable
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:010857_0105_0F851ED82546E478"/>for ſuch quiet unambitious conduct? Or have they uſually been free of a diſpoſition to intermeddle in worldly matters? Does not their apologiſt Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> intimate the very reverſe, when he ſays, Page 110, <q>
                  <hi>Should the government ſee fit</hi> hereafter <hi>to inveſt them with ſome degree of civil power, worthy their acceptance, none would be thereby injured?</hi>
               </q> Is it reaſonable to think that the American prelates, would ever be eaſy whilſt in a Condition inferior to the ſuperb, court-favoured, law-dignified biſhops of England? eſpecially, as the connections between them, would always keep alive the hopes of the former, of arriving at the ſame authority and Importance.</p>
            <p>A late writer (ſaid to be of high ſpiritual dignity beyond the Alantic) aſſures us, that as the biſhops intended for America, are "to be appointed by the crown, the ſmalleſt attempt towards an oppreſſive enlargement of ſpiritual power would be immediately cruſhed with indignation by the legiſlature; and that the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the clergy and the watchfulneſs of the laity over them, is much more likely to increaſe than diminiſh."<note n="¶" place="bottom">Anſwer to Dr. Mayhew's obſervations on the charter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, &amp;c.</note> This is plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but not ſolid. However, at preſent we ſhall ſuppoſe, that under ſuch directors of the national councils as have of late pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, there has been a diſcovery of ſo much wiſdom and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>of ſo tender a concern for the intereſts of the colonies; of ſo cautious, ſo delicate an apprehenſion of injuring their conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al rights,</hi> as leaves no room to fear any oppreſſive enlargement of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> or <hi>any other power,</hi> during the continuance of ſuch an <hi>happy</hi> guidance of public meaſures: Yet times may change; men of a different ſtamp may be employed; who knows what another reign may produce? Whatever may be promiſed now, yet rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſtate, (which Dr. Chandler already holds out to our ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors) it may be ſaid, require more to be done for this <hi>new-fang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> hierarchy; for a biſhop without authority over the laity, is really a novelty, which no denomination of Chriſtians, that allowed of a regular Miniſtry, ever before thought of. Either ſole or aſſiſted, the biſhops or paſtors of all ſects have exerciſed it as of ſcriptural and unalienable right; nor can there be any church of Chriſt on earth, without this, or ſomewhat equivalent to it.</p>
            <p>When the biſhops (to carry on the ſuppoſition) ſhall be once quietly ſettled among us, we ſhall be told by Dr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> or ſome equal advocate for the order, "that the church in America is in a moſt wretched and deplorable condition, periſhing for want of common neceſſaries, and under ſuch diſeaſes, as muſt prove fatal to her, if much longer neglected; that ſhe only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, that proper remedies may be provided for her ſufferings,

"The people are ſenſible of the want of this power over them, and find themſelves free from all reſtraints of eccleſiaſtical, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And though the church, as far as it has relation to civil power, is in the nature of it a free ſociety, yet after men become members, the laws of the church are in force againſt them."<note n="†" place="bottom">Appeal, <hi>P.</hi> 29.</note> It is true, this was at firſt given up, but we find, we "are a body without ſtrength, liable to be deſtroyed by innumerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents;<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>This granted, (how can Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> talk of giving it up) the neceſſity of civil co-action, or the aid of the magiſtrate to enforce the cenſures of the clergy, may be eaſily urged." Thoſe, who are rejected by one "church," it can be ſaid, "are received by another." A diſpoſition to ſlight excommunication, "the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt puniſhment the church can inflict, has become general; in this age the voice of reaſon will not be heard,"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Appeal, 30, 31.</note> Civil inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and the writ from the King's court for impriſoning the excommunicate perſons,<note n="§" place="bottom">This writ iſſues in <hi>40</hi> days after excommunication, in caſe the offender continues obſtinate.</note> are the only remedy; and why ſhould not the American church be enabled to reduce obſtinate offenders to obedience, as well as the mother church of England?</p>

Then "a tax on the country to ſupport the biſhops will be wanted;" for their rank requires greater revenue than can be raiſed by charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, and it cannot be expected that the mother country will maintain the clergy of America. And if a tax can be juſtly levied for the prelates, why not for the pariſh miniſters?

Other nations have taken equal care for the eſtabliſhment of eccleſiaſtical, as of civil government in their moſt diſtant colonies.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT an inſidious faction has long endeavoured to cruſh the CHURCH of England in America, in order to erect a ſpiritual tyranny, when that great obſtacle is removed, will, I believe, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to every one who conſiders the ſteps they have taken. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry engine that malice could invent has been ſet at work. The characters and conduct of her clergy, however innocent or reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, have been traduced.—Her doctrines miſrepreſented. Her decent ceremonies expoſed to ridicule, and her ſons, beſides other opprobrious Names, branded with the odious title of Perſecutors; when, by all men of candour, it is acknowledged that the CHURCH of England is not only the bulwark of the reformation, but poſſeſſed of a truly Chriſtian ſpirit of meekneſs and toleration.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding theſe baſe arts might prejudice the weak and unwary, ſtill there was great danger, leaſt the rays of truth ſhould diſpel the cloud of miſrepreſentation, and crafty politicians fail of their deſired ſucceſs.—Under this apprehenſion, it was neceſſary to perſuade all denominations of Chriſtians to unite againſt the CHURCH, as a common Enemy: And at the ſame time, leſt any ſhould be hereafter competitors for dominion, it became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to ſow the ſeeds of diſſenſion among them, that by their inteſtine diviſions, they might become an eaſy prey to theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Incendiaries. For Proſecution of the latter part of ſo notable a ſcheme, they have already rent to pieces the Dutch church within this province, which next to the church of England, bade the faireſt to oppoſe them) and introduced ſuch heart burnings and enmity among its members, as time can never remove.—The French church has alſo been practiſed upon, and ruined by them. They have not been content 'till they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a creature of their own to preach there; one connected with them both by affinity and a ſimilarity of intereſts.—All this miſchief has been done under the maſk of friendſhip; and ſo great is the blindneſs of many well-meaning perſons, that I make no doubt their eyes will not be thoroughly opened, 'till this ſubtil ſect, like Aaron's rod, ſwallow them all up.</p>
            <q>

Quod procul a nohis fortuna gubernans avertat.</q>
            <p>As to the former part of the ſcheme it muſt be obvious to every one, who has peruſed the elegant performances compoſed <q>in theſe boaſted times of moderation and candour.</q> by the celebrated and incomparable triumvirs of this inoffenſive party, under the glorious titles of the Independent Reflector, the Watch Tower, and the American Whig. Frequent uſe occurs therein of the term diſſenters, which is ſuppoſed to include all that differ from the eſtabliſhed church in the moſt minute circumſtances, however op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite they may be to one another, both in principles and intereſt. They are called upon to defend thoſe liberties which are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, and maintain thoſe rights which are not diſputed: And as fraud and falacy, are uſually practiſed in ſuch caſes, every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, however diſhoneſt, is taken to infuſe groundleſs fears, and and unreaſonable prejudices; particularly in No. IX. of the American Whig, a letter is ſub-join'd as from a Quaker, (for I ſuſpect a Forgery) evidently to induce that reſpectable body of men, who are known to have a regard for the church, to join with its enemies, the inſidious faction, who arrogantly aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the name of preſbyterians; with your permiſſion, therefore, Sir, as a means of obviating the ill conſequences that may ariſe from that letter, and opening peoples eyes. I will briefly conſider an aſſertion it contains, ſo notoriouſly falſe, that I wonder it could drop even from the pen of the American Whig; who, as well as ſome others of his party, is known to aſſert roundly.</p>
            <p>The Paſſage I mean, is couch'd, in the following terms, <q>ſince our fathers came out from their Babyloniſh captivity, into this peaceable Zion, they, and we, have ſet down under our own vines and our own fig trees, and have had none to make us afraid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Whig would undoubted intimate by the words <q>peaceable Zion,</q> that the quakers have enjoyed full liberty of conſcience ſince they emigrated to the continent of America.—But alaſs! how far is this from being the caſe? For no ſooner were the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents (who would fain be called preſbyterians) fixed in the northern colonies, to which they fled, (ſome few perhaps, for conſcience ſake, others to avoid the puniſhment due for the murder of their king, and the overthrow of the conſtitution) than they exerciſed a moſt illegal and deſpotic authority in the matters of religion. But their rage was chiefly againſt the people, who (we are now told) ſince they came into this peaceable Zion, have ſet down under their own vines and their own fig trees, and have had none to make them afraid. With reſpect to the Quakers therefore, this Zion has not been quite ſo peaceable as the Whig would perſuade us. The fires of perſecution, were lighted in it by the ſame perſons, who, if we may believe Mr. Livingſton, in his modeſt letter to the Biſhop of Landaff, "had forſaken houſes
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:010857_0108_0F851EDA64E1AA68"/>and lands, and the moſt tender connections with every thing dear and eſtimable amongſt human kind, for the undiſturbed fruition of the rights of private judgment, ſacred by the laws of God and of nature." Influenced by this motive as that gentleman ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and ſenſible that the rights of private judgment were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, they nevertheleſs became more ſanguinary than the ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſavages of the deſert with whom they had to encounter. The Quakers, contrary to the principles of juſtice and equity, were ſeverely fined and impriſoned, and their perſons treated with the moſt ſhocking barbarity. They were baniſhed by a law, ſo called, under pretence that they withdrew from orderly church fellowſhip, allowed and approved by all orthodox profeſſors of the truth, (a ready pretence for perſecution at all times, and upon all occaſions) and ſome of them were put to the moſt ignominious death for conſcience ſake, contrary to the rights of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſacred by the laws of God and of nature. Nay, ſo wantonly were theſe uſurpations over the conſciences of men exerciſed, that priſoners were refuſed a trial by jury, the undoubted right of every free born Briton and American; the dead bodies of thoſe who fell a ſacrifice to the rage of bloody bigots, were ſtripp'd, and depriv'd of a decent burial; and the exulting prieſt of ſo virtuous a people, compoſed a ludicrous ballad upon the occaſion; for which his character, with that of his worthy compatriots, will, as Mr. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingſton judiciouſly obſerves, make a bright figure in hiſtory, and be handed down with honour to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſerve to ſhew that this peaceable Zion has, in reality, been to the Quakers, a vale of tears; and as to the vine and fig tree, (a ſcriptural metaphor intended to repreſent the ſecurity that the Quakers enjoyed in the Whig's imagination, I ſuppoſe, as to property and perſon) the above remarks will ſuffice to ſhew, that they alſo are inapplicable to ſuch a ſtate of ſufferings and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; for ſurely a people baniſhed by law, under pain of death, who, like Noah's Dove, could find no reſt for the ſoals of their feet, can hardly with any propriety, be ſaid to have ſet under their own vines, and their own fig trees, and have had none to make them afraid.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould be aſſerted that the caſe was not ſo within this province; I obſerve, firſt, that theſe fanatical independents never got firm enough footing here for that purpoſe: And ſecondly, That though for the above reaſon, they did not perſecute the Quakers themſelves, yet by their artful and falſe ſuggeſtions, they prevailed upon the Dutch to do it; who, I believe, would have been averſe from the meaſure, had they been rightly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and even prepoſſeſs'd as they were, burnt not with that fiery real which enflamed their neighbour coloniſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="unknown:010857_0108_0F851EDA64E1AA68"/>
I have thus, Sir, expoſed the deſigns of the independents, and of their doughty champion the American Whig, and ſhewn that that the groſſeſt falſities are advanced by them to gain the moſt dangerous ends. I ſhall conclude with remarking, that if the church of England has ever entertained perſecuting principles, ſhe has renounced them with deteſtation, in the heighth of her power; whereas the independents have never had the upper hand, but they have ruled with the iron hand of oppreſſion, and openly practiſed that perſecution which they before affected to abhor; like Proteus, continually changing figure, and becoming, as occaſion required, one while the gently murmuring ſtream; and another, the ferocious Lion, or the bloody Bear.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I FIND that the advocates for an American Epiſcopate (how agreeable to truth I leave the world to judge) not being able to make the church of Holland epiſcopal, endeavour to divide her as being neither epiſcopal nor preſbyterian, but ſomething between both; a conduct, in ſome meaſure, ſimilar to that of the falſe mother, who ſaid, "let the child be neither thine
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:010857_0109_0F851EDD5E679D78"/>nor mine, but divide it." Agreeable to this abſurd conceit, equally groundleſs and impudent, we have lately been told, <q>That the church of Holland is not epiſcopal exactly in the ſame manner that the church of England is epiſcopal; neither is it preſbyterian in the ſame ſenſe that the Engliſh diſſenters are preſbyterian, as is evident from the diſtinction made in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, of a member of the claſſis, or an ordinary paſtor or preſbyter. When a member of the claſſis is ordained, the powers of ordination and government are committed to him; but when an ordinary paſtor is ordained, no ſuch powers are confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on him, but only the powers of preaching the word and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtering the ſacrament.</q> [I ſuppoſe they mean ſacraments.]</p>
               <p>From this, one would be apt to conclude, that we of the church of Holland in America (to uſe a parallel phraſe with Dr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler) are a kind of mongrel, neither epiſcopal nor preſbyterian, but ſomething between both. But what kind of conſtitution that ſomething is, or ought to be called, is not ſo much as hinted.—I therefore think it my duty to inform thoſe who want informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what the conſtitution of the church of Holland is; and that not from what I have been told, but from what I know to be the caſe, as an old member of that church, who have not lately, but many years ſince, made it my buſineſs to examine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral church conſtitutions, and eſpecially that, of which I profeſs myſelf a member.</p>
               <p>I therefore affirm, and hope to prove beyond all queſtion, that the church of Holland is as little epiſcopal as any preſbyterian church on earth. This appears from the 30th and 31ſt articles of her confeſſion of faith; an abſtract of the 31ſt is as follows. <q>As for the miniſters of God's word, they have equally the ſame power and authority whereſoever they are, as they are all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, the only univerſal biſhop, and only head of the church.</q> Is it in the power of language more clearly to deny epiſcopacy; or to aſſert preſbyterianiſm? Pray what is properly preſbyterianiſm? I anſwer it is that form of church government, wherein no higher authority is allowed, than that of elders, or, which is the ſame thing, preſbyters. Therefore the word ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Engliſh <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> is in Dutch tranſlated by that of <hi>Elderſhip</hi>—1 Tim. iv <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>4. Hence it appears, that not only the reformed churches of Holland, Scotland, Geneva, and many of the German churches are Preſbyterian, but that the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationaliſts and Baptiſts are alſo Preſbyterian.—The difference lies only in this, that the former extend their juriſdiction further than the congregationaliſts and Baptiſts, who reſpectively confine their juriſdiction within the ſingle congregation, of which they have the paſtoral charge; whereas the other churches have their conſiſtories (or kirk ſeſſions) then their preſbyteries or claſſis, next
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:010857_0109_0F851EDD5E679D78"/>provincial ſynods, and laſt of all a general aſſembly or national ſynod. The firſt conſiſts of the miniſter or miniſters, elders and deacons of one congregation; the next of two or more of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

                  </gap> conſiſts of the deputies of the ſeveral preſbyteries; and the laſt of the deputies of the provincial aſſemblies.—Perſons aggrieved in any of the lower judicatories can appeal to the higher. So that there is the greateſt harmony and ſimilarity in the preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian church government of the church of Scotland, church of Holland, and the preſbyterians in North America, that could poſſibly be expected, conſidering the circumſtances of two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent national churches, and the great diſtance and non-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the laſt mentioned, in America; who, nevertheleſs, have their regular church-ſeſſions, preſbyteries and ſynods.</p>
               <p>But perhaps ſome may object, that thoſe of the church of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are not called preſbyterians, neither have they preſbyteries.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, it is true, that they are not uſually diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that appellation as a denomination; neither was there ever any occaſion for it, they being diſtinguiſhed by the reformation of their doctrines, in oppoſition to the church of Rome, and other heritics, by the name of 'The reformed church of Netherland.'—But the church of Scotland, and thoſe of their perſuaſion in England, having, from time to time, had many ſtruggles with epiſcopacy, they being zealous for preſbyterian government, were, in contradiſtinction to epiſcopalians, called preſbyterians.</p>
               <p>The church of Scotland however (and thoſe who hold to the ſame conſtitution in other parts of the world) from her doctrines contained in her Confeſſion of Faith and Weſtminſter Catechiſm, have as good a claim to the title of <hi>reformed church</hi> as the church Holland. On the other hand the church of Holland may as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called the preſbyterian reformed church, as the church of Scotland. But ſhould this not ſufficiently ſatisfy ſome preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced perſon, I hope he will allow the teſtimony of an epiſcopali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hiſtorian; I mean Mr. Salmon, who in his hiſtorical geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical grammar, in his deſcription of the eſtabliſhed religion of the united Netherlands, ſays, 'Their church government is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian.'</p>
               <p>The other objection (if any one is weak enough to make it) <hi>that the church of Holland hath no preſbyteries,</hi> is altogether groundleſs; a claſſis and preſbytery being ſynonymous terms, when applied to their ſecond eccleſiaſtical judicatory, which conſiſts of a number of preſbyters convened to repreſent ſeveral congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are a claſſis of presbyters, and therefore in effect a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery: Nay, it appears from the proceedings of the aſſembly of Divines, who met at Weſtminſter, about 115 years ago; that the
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:010857_0110_0F851EDD77A9FC18"/>church judicatory, now called a presbytery, was then called a claſſis. Words in themſelves are arbritrary; it is the ideas affixed to them that determine their ſignification. 'Tis well known, that the Dutch call their Kerken Raad, or Church Seſſion, a conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; yet it is obvious, that we do not by this mean a conſiſtory of cardinals, (as among the Papiſts) So alſo the word aſſembly, when preceded by the words <hi>a wicked</hi> or <hi>a pious,</hi> convey very different ideas.</p>
               <p>From all which it appears, that the church government of Holland, Scotland, and the Dutch and presbyterian churches here, are eſſentially the ſame; and that the term Dutch and Engliſh presbyterians, may be uſed among us with the greated propriety; though the term may at preſent ſound a little ſtrange for want of the ſanction of cuſtom. But in order to render the matter if poſſible ſtill plainer, I preſent the reader with the whole, in the following ſhort view, viz.</p>
               <p>The church of Holland call their firſt, or lower church ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory, a Kerken Raad, or Conſiſtory, their 2d a claſſis, their 3d, a Provincial Synod, their 4th or higheſt, a National Synod.<note n="*" place="bottom">Can. Synd. Dort Art. <hi>29.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>The church of Scotland call their firſt or loweſt church ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory, a Church, or Kirk Seſſion, their 2d, a Preſbytery, their 3d, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod, their 4th, or higheſt, a General Aſſembly of the church of Scotland.</p>
               <p>But what ſimilarity is there between the church of England, and the church of Holland, in their ſeveral offices, judicatories, &amp;c, &amp;c? It is pretended, that the church of Holland makes a diſtinction between a meer presbyter, who has only power to preach, and adminiſter the ſacraments, and one who is ordained a member of the <hi>Claſſis,</hi> to whom the powers of ordination and government are committed.</p>
               <p>This is a meer pretence; for the reader may be aſſured, that nothing like it is either known, or practiſed in the church of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.—Candidates for the miniſtry, after they have gone through their neceſſary ſtudies, are preſented to the claſſis; there they are examined not only by the proeſes or moderator, but alſo by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number appointed for that purpoſe, or ſometimes by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in general: When they have given ſufficient proofs of their ability, they are licenced to preach in a kind of itinerant way, (but not to adminiſter the ſacraments) to exerciſe their talents: When they receive a call for any particular congregation, they are to paſs a ſecond examination; and after that they are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ordained, each one in the preſence of the congregation of his charge, by prayer, and the laying on of the hands of the claſſis, thereunto appointed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="unknown:010857_0110_0F851EDD77A9FC18"/>
By virtue of this paſtoral charge, he is qualified for a member of the claſſis to which his congregation doth belong; and where a congregation has more miniſters than is thought needful to ſend to the claſſis, the congregation or conſiſtory ſend whom they think proper, from whom they or he muſt have proper credentials.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens, that a perſon is ordained before he is called to a particular charge, or for a foreign place where no claſſis is erected. Then, indeed, he is no member of the claſſis, not for any defect in his ordination, but becauſe he has no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to repreſent, or no claſſis near the place of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
               <p>Nor can I by any means adopt the parallel of monarchial and epiſcopalian, republican and preſbyterian, or if you pleaſe church of Holland, church government. It has pleaſed God to tolerate ſeveral forms of civil government on earth, and in his word to enjoin obedience to magiſtrates in general; but it is hard to prove, that he has given ſo extenſive a toleration in the government of his church, reſpecting eſſentials. It does not therefore follow, that there may be as different church governments in different countries, as there are different civil governments. Neither we of the Dutch church, nor the church of Scotland, blend civil and eccleſiaſtical government together, as the church of England does; according to ſuch parallel it muſt follow, that every ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of a city, town or village, in Holland, muſt be of equal rank with their higher order (for I have ſhewn that there is no ſuperiority in point of ordination and government in their clergy) and that all, without diſtinction, were fit to compoſe their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of ſtate; their provincial ſtates, and the ſtates general of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and Weſt Vrieſland; but this it is obvious is not the caſe.</p>
               <p>Nor can I help obſerving how fruitleſs the efforts of your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, to evade the charge of the epiſcopalians unchurching all the reſt of the reformed churches, by pretending that, as the eſteeming republican civil government, leſs perfect than monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical, is not ungoverning them; ſo the eſteeming the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church of Holland, leſs perfect than the epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, is not unchurching them.—The parallel here will not hold; for no man in his ſenſes, will pretend that monarchy is eſſential to the very being of government: But the advocates for epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy inſiſt, that the ordination, by an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of biſhops, is ſo neceſſary for the ordination of goſpel mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that, <q>that being once broke, not all the men on earth, nor all the angels in heaven, without an immediate commiſſion from Chriſt, can reſtore it.</q>—Another ſays, <hi>there are three orders in the church of Chriſt, biſhops, prieſts and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons;
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:010857_0111_0F851EDE76271150"/>and whereſoever any of theſe are wanting, there can be no church.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">A hard ſaying indeed, though ſaid to be uttered by St. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius; let us hear, believe, and practiſe what the ſaints or fathers tell us, as far as is agreeable to unerring truth, contained in holy writ; let us be followers of them, as far as they are followers of Chriſt. Now an inſpired apoſtle tells us, that Chriſt having aſcended on high, hath given ſome for apoſtles, and ſome for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſome for evangeliſts, and ſome for paſtors and teachers. <hi>Eph. iv. 11.</hi> The three firſt were evidently extraordinary miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ceaſed with the firſt age of the church, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for no longer time, otherwiſe the ſpirit of God would have continued them.—Between theſe extraordinary miniſters, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and teachers, we find none others, conſequently no other kind of biſhops or overſeers, but paſtors and teachers were ever deſigned; and as for Chriſtian prieſts, as ſome people affect to call the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the church of England, we know the word prieſt is no where applied to any miniſter of the new-teſtament, but only to all real believers in general, as a royal prieſthood in a ſpiritual ſenſe. <hi>1 Pet. ii, 5, 9. Rev. i. 6.</hi> Let any epiſcopalian produce a ſingle text to the contrary if he can.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Conſequently as we do not hold epiſcopal ordination neceſſary, we muſt be without miniſters of Chriſt; we are unbaptiſed; we have never partaken of the holy ſupper, according to Chriſt's appointment. In a word, we are almoſt in a ſtate of heatheniſm, and in reſpect to ordination, the church of Rome is right; and we indeed, without any peradventure, all in the wrong; and can be no church on earth, whatever ſome of us may be in heaven.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the late Mr. Houdin being received as a prieſt of the church of England without re-ordination; it is demanded, by your adverſary, whether on his renouncing the errors of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and embracing the doctrines of the meeting, they would not have done the ſame? Before I anſwer this, I muſt examine what the religion of the meeting is. To know this, I muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what meeting they mean. If they mean a meeting-houſe, I believe the materials of lime, ſtone, wood, &amp;c will not effect the orthodoxy of the houſe; whether they be epiſcopal or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, or even popiſh, in regard to the perſons of whom pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, or even by whom fabricated; but if by the meeting, they underſtand a denomination of Chriſtians meeting together; then I ought to know, whether they mean Lutherans, Moravians, Baptiſts, French or Dutch Calviniſts, congregationaliſts, quakers, or preſbyterians.—I only know that they do not intend a meeting of epiſcopalians.—I ſhall therefore take it for granted, as the
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:010857_0111_0F851EDE76271150"/>moſt probable that they mean, the meeting or church of preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians here or elſewhere; whom, from a ſpirit of the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bigotry, they cannot deign to call any thing elſe but meeting independants, diſſenters, or the like—any thing but a preſbyterian church. But to return to the queſtion, I anſwer that I ſincerely think they would not, or at leaſt, it is my humbly opinion, they ought not to receive ſuch a one, without re-ordination, becauſe that the church of Rome is ſo very corrupt and ſuperſtitious, as to ceaſe to be a church of Chriſt, but is rather a ſynagogue of Satan, and conſequently it were better to ordain twice, than not at all. Were an Engliſh epiſcopalian to become a proſelyte to preſbyterianiſm, it is well known that his ordination would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed valid, not becauſe he was ordained by a dioceſan biſhop merely as ſuch, but becauſe he had what we deem the eſſential powers of ordination, as any other lawful miniſter, paſtor or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, which in ſcripture language are ſynonimous terms: That every preſbyter appointed to the charge of a flock is a biſhop, or overſeer, I could eaſily prove from ſcripture, did the limits of this paper permit.</p>
               <p>As the epiſcopalians themſelves ſay, that a biſhop is alſo a preſbyter, they cannot reaſonably fault the conduct of the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, for allowing the validity of their ordination; ſeeing they have a right to view the biſhops in the light of preſbyters.</p>
               <p>But how uncharitably does that boaſted charitable church act towards her proteſtant brethren in Scotland, Holland, France, Germany, Geneva, and this extenſive continent of America! For if any one of them; however orthodox and learned, is by any means inclined to become a preacher in their church, nothing elſe but a formal re-ordination will qualify him for the miniſtry in the church of Chriſt: What is the language of ſuch a conduct? Actions ſpeak louder than words.—Therefore I don't aſk what apology they can make, or what charitable conſtruction they can put on non-epiſcopal ordination, but what is the language of their actions? 'Tis not <q>that it is at leaſt imperfect, irregular and defective;</q> tho' Doctor Chandler is pleaſed thus to evince the matter, for he ſays, <q>that the line of ſucceſſion once broke, and the powers of ordination once loſt, is not to be reſtored without an immediate commiſſion from Chriſt.</q>—Neither need the epiſcopalians (whether really or under colour of charity) to ſay, "that the non-epiſcopalians are in the dark in theſe things:" No, we have, bleſſed be God, among us, both of clergy and laity, at leaſt as clear heads and honeſt hearts, as there are among the epiſcopalians (and doubtleſs in greater numbers) who attend to the ſure word of prophecy of the old and new-teſtament, and give heed thereto, in preference to any fallible ſayings of the pious fathers, or traditions of men. The language of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:010857_0112_0F851EDF24531A50"/>then is this; the perſon, or perſons, who pretended to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain you, had no legal authority from Chriſt ſo to do, neither you nor they, were lawful miniſters, but intruders and uſurpers; the people you miniſtered unto were no church, but an unlawful meeting or conventicle.—Tho' your pretended miniſter warned you of the evil of your ways, God ſent him not; and woe to him that runneth not being ſent. Thus the epiſcopalians do as much as in them lies, grieve by their conduct the hearts of thoſe whom God will not have grieved; however ſoft their words; however genteel their apologies. Let us ſuppoſe, for inſtance, a perſon to be accuſed of houſe-breaking, and taking thence things of great value; whether the accuſation is true or falſe, will it be deemed a proper apology to ſay, I did not deſign to call you a thief; your action was only imperfect, irregular and defective—you only was in the dark. The application is eaſy; all non-epiſcopalians are guilty of the worſt of thefts, even of ſacrilege, by laying hands on an ordinance, to which (we epiſcopalians being judges) they have no right; on the contrary they harden, by the ſame conduct, the hearts of many formaliſts and hypocrites, who, as the Jews of old, called <q>the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are theſe;</q> ſo they are ever vainly boaſting, of, "<hi>the church of England, &amp;c. &amp;c. are we.</hi> But, bleſſed be God, we have a better teſtimony of the lawfulneſs of the miniſtry, and the other ordinances among us, than can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be derived from all the epiſcopal churches on earth, even the undoubted operation of the bleſſed ſpirit of all grace, on the hearts of many to their converſion and confirmation in their moſt holy faith; and if the epiſcopal church can boaſt its thouſands in this reſpect, we may ſay we have our ten thouſands.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude, I beg leave juſt to mention the abſurd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and unparall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d bigotry, of uſing the word <hi>church,</hi> as the name of a particular denomination. The leaſt that can be ſaid, of ſuch people, as that they appear extremely ignorant of the true meaning of the word <hi>church,</hi> by their conſtant affectation of calling ſome places, dedicated to the public worſhip of God, by the name of meetings and others by that of churches. If they mean, by this term, the buildings where people aſſemble for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, they may may be called either churches or meetings, whether the aſſembly conſiſts of epiſcopalians, or of any other denominations of Chriſtians. Thus the building called TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY CHURCH, is one of the houſes in which epiſcopalians meet, and conſequently it is an epiſcopalian meeting-houſe, as well or rather more properly than an epiſcopalian church. But no building ſtrictly ſpeaking can be called a church, being impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, from the members of the viſible church of Chriſt, who there aſſemble for the public worſhip of God.—If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:010857_0112_0F851EDF24531A50"/>they will not allow the meeting-houſes of baptiſts, preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, &amp;c. to be called churches, in the ſenſe juſt mentioned, as well as the epiſcopalian meeting-houſes, they unwarily (even in an external ſenſe) un-church all thoſe other denominations; who, no doubt, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſmall part of the viſible Chriſtian church. Now as to the Dutch church, which I have ſhewn, may, with the greateſt propriety, be called preſbyterian, they as effectually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church it with the reſt; becauſe no charters, conſtitutions or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, can conſtitute any denomination, a church of Chriſt. They can only deſerve that appellation, as being profeſſors of Chriſt and his doctrines, agreeing in the unity of ſaith.</p>
               <p>Thoſe members of the Dutch church, who have a tolerable underſtanding of their conſtitution, want no ſuch apologies. We know that the unchurching of any non-epiſcopalians whatever, who profeſs themſelves part of the viſible church, is in effect to unchurch us, as has now been made fully to appear.</p>
               <p>How well the holy ſcriptures have been preſerved to us, thro' the medium of the church of Rome, together with the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ordination, (or according to the popiſh epiſcopalians phraſe, Chriſtian prieſthood, already refuted) appear by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the firſt by many corrupt tranſlations, adulterating bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm by human inventions, turning the Lord's Supper into the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the maſs, the idolatrous doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, and making ordination one of their ſacraments. But the truth is, that God, even in the midſt of popiſh darkneſs, raiſed up wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for the truth both of doctrine and diſcipline, who ſealed the truth with their blood. But probably this ſet of men have never read the book of Martyrs.</p>
               <p>Here I thought to have finiſhed, but I cannot help obſerving on the deſpicable attempt of perſuading the public, that Engliſh Preſbyterians are for unchurching the church of Holland, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is a baſe inſinuation without the leaſt foundation, and will be treated by every judicious member of the Dutch church, with the contempt it deſerves. What do they mean by turning the Dutch churches into conventicles for Engliſh independents? if they are men of ſpirit, let them explain themſelves if they dare. We of the the Dutch church, know of many epiſcopalian bigots, who have ſtirred up ſome of the weaker members of the Dutch church, againſt the ſalutary method of preaching the goſpel in the language of the country; and enticed away ſeveral of its members; but in ſpite of all their art, our gain is more than 10, perhaps 20 to one, to our loſs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>What a blunderbuſs was the Whig alſo to argue thus, <hi>Liberty is a very good thing;</hi> ergo, <hi>men</hi> in general <hi>ought to be careful to preſerve it!</hi> How much more logical is <hi>Squire Tickle</hi>'s concluſion; ergo, <hi>The Members of</hi> THE <hi>Church in America</hi> (what church?) <hi>are right in ſeeking to obtain it.</hi> Hunters know that game poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd is often worth little; but <hi>obtaining</hi> it during it's ſtruggles for <hi>ſelf-preſervation</hi> is a clever trick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Squire Tickle</hi>'s maxims likewiſe are inconteſtible, where he ſays, "Every ſincere friend of <hi>real religion</hi> is impartial in his eſteem for it, and wiſhes it an univerſal dominion. He that wiſhes <hi>real religion</hi> univerſally to prevail, will endeavour to promote it in all caſes, without reſpect to <hi>religious diſtinctions.</hi> He that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to promote it in all caſes, will be careful not to oppoſe it in any" <hi>Squire Tickle</hi>'s maxims are not about <hi>real religion,</hi> ſay you? Very true, gentle reader; and ſurely you don't imagine <hi>Squire Tickle</hi> would by any means reflect upon thoſe prelates, who prevented the grant of the <hi>New-York Preſbyterian charter,</hi> or procured the repeal of the act incorporating a ſociety in <hi>Boſton,</hi> for the purpoſe of <hi>Chriſtianizing the heathen!</hi>

His reaſoning is no leſs judicious, and his wit no leſs brilliant, in his 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th paragraph; for who is ſo ſtupid as not to ſee, that knowlege of the <hi>rejection</hi> of any propoſal in <hi>many,</hi> is <hi>abſolutely, utterly,</hi> and <hi>entirely</hi> inconſiſtent with the <hi>ſanguine expectations</hi> of it's ſucceſs in <hi>a few?</hi> A—h, this WHIG is a blockhead.</p>
            <p>In par. 10th, <hi>Squire Tickle,</hi> ſhews a great deal of merit (I mean what I ſay) in drawing parallels.

            <p>In par. 11th <hi>Squire Tickle,</hi> very juſtly ridicules the notion of <hi>American manufactures,</hi> as he had (par. 3d) <hi>American oeconomy.</hi> What buſineſs has <hi>America</hi> with oeconomy or manufactures?

            </p>
            <p>On par. 13th, I muſt needs obſerve, that it is very <hi>unfair</hi> to blame <hi>Tories</hi> for <hi>boaſting of loyalty,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. under a <hi>mixed,</hi> i. e. under a <hi>Whig</hi> monarchy.

            </p>
            <p>Par. 16th Is too learned for me. From what ever quarter power comes, and whatever may be the meaning of the word <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> I muſt beg leave to aſk Squire <hi>Tickle</hi> whether (in caſe Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s had met with little or no oppoſition) <hi>American com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance</hi> was not deſign'd to remove <hi>European objections,</hi> and ſerve as oil to facilitate the <hi>ſtiff clumſy</hi> motion of the wheels of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected <hi>epiſcopal</hi> machine?</p>

            <div type="article">
               <p>THERE ſeems to be ſomething perverſe in human nature, that prompts men to give partial and unfair repreſentations, when it ſuits their purpoſe. They conceal truths, extenuate faults, and diminiſh or magnify difficulties as it ſerves their turn, or contributes to carry their deſigns into execution. The client loudly proclaims his wrongs, and magnifies his pretenſions, while he induſtriouſly conceals from his lawyer ſome of the ſtrongeſt circumſtances that operate againſt him.</p>
               <p>Doctor Chandler ſeems in his Appeal, to labour under this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity: he complains that the epiſcopal church in America ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers unparalleled hardſhips: he inſinuates, that the complaints which he makes are the complaints of a million of Britiſh ſubjects in America, ſuffering under unprecedented hardſhips; and that all the epiſcopal clergy and laity are joint petitioners with him and his friends for an American Epiſcopate, on the plan he has mentioned. Whereas, in fact, the people were never conſulted on the meaſure, nor were they ever heard to complain. The whole was concerted and curried on by a few miſſionaries (whom the Doctor ſtiles the clergy) of New-York and New-Jerſey met together in a <hi>voluntary</hi> convention. By what right they aſſume ſuch power it may be well to enquire.</p>
               <p>According to the Engliſh conſtitution, every part of his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's extenſive dominions, where governments are eſtabliſhed, has a power to take care of religion in a way ſuited to the genius and perſuaſion of the people. At the reformation, the Engliſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament formed their articles of religion, and inveſted their king with all power, as well eccleſiaſtical as civil, and modelled church government according to their pleaſure. They afterwards by the Act of Toleration made proviſion for diſſenters from the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed church. The legiſlature of Scotland, (after that kingdom became a branch of the Britiſh empire) took care of religion in their own way, and eſtabliſhed church diſcipline on a plan diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of England, which plan was afterwards confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Britiſh parliament when both kingdoms were happily united. In Ireland, though the religious eſtabliſhment be nearly the ſame as the Engliſh, in worſhip and government, the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture claim the ſole right of eſtabliſhing articles and canons, and of regulating the affairs of their church as to them ſeems beſt. In ſome of the Britiſh colonies in America, one religious denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in others another denomination of Chriſtians have been the peculiar care of the government; while in ſome, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the ſtate, all enjoy equal privileges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="unknown:010857_0114_0F851EE413C130A0"/>
I would therefore be glad to know by what authority the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries of New-York and New-Jerſey, in violation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Britiſh governments, and of the rights of their fellow ſubjects, uſurp a power of acting for all the epiſcopalians in America; of forming a new plan of epiſcopacy for them, and of petitioning "our ſuperiors" in Britain, that this <hi>plan</hi> may be eſtabliſhed in his majeſty's American colonies by the Britiſh legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature? Who commiſſioned them to act? They will not pretend to ſay, they exerciſe this power by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> or as inherent in them? Who then, entruſted them with the care of religion in America? Or who, for inſtance, empowered them to intermeddle with the ſtate of it in the Weſt-India iſlands? Do the people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>per clergy or laity there complain of "unparalleled hardſhips?" With regard to the clergy in the iſlands, an honourable proviſion is made for their ſupport by the reſpective legiſlatures. And if the people think themſelves aggrieved, they know where to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for redreſs. They have governors and aſſemblies, in whoſe power it is to regulate the affairs of the church in their reſpective diſtricts, and to rectify what they think amiſs in its polity. Or, if they had not this power, is it to be imagined that ſo reſpectable a body of his majeſty's ſubjects, were they groaning under into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable grievances, as the Doctor repreſents, would not have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed his majeſty, for relief themſelves rather than have entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo important an affair with a few miſſionaries in North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, who are ignorant of their laws and circumſtances? Let the world then judge whether the petitions ſent home by the miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of New-York and the Jerſeys, and the Appeal publiſhed by Doctor Chandler, as far as they reſpect the iſlands, are not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent invaſion of the rights of others, and a buſy intermeddling with their laws and conſtitutions without their conſent or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of Virginia and Maryland. Have the clergy or laity of theſe provinces ever complained of 'unparallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufferings' or empowered the 'miſſionaries met in a voluntary convention' to complain in their name? Are they not the beſt judges, when an epiſcopate is neceſſary, and what plan of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy will beſt ſuit themſelves? At leaſt are they not as good judges as the members of the convention at Amboy? If an epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate be neceſſary to "ordain, and govern the clergy and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter confirmation to ſuch as ſhall apply for it," the common appendages of epiſcopacy are not neceſſary; but may and muſt be varied, as the laws and conſtitutions of different governments may require. And to the body of the people, to the aſſemblies and governors does it belong to regulate theſe appendages. Theſe governments have provided for the maintainance of the clergy, in a way moſt agreeable to themſelves, and when they think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:010857_0115_0F851EE429C43AF0"/>to have a biſhop, they will, doubtleſs, fall upon meaſures to have one. But what right the miſſionaries of New-York and New-Jerſey have to publiſh complaints in the name of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, while they themſelves are ſilent, or to repreſent their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as intolerable and their grievances as unparalleled, while they themſelves expreſs no uneaſineſs, I cannot well comprehend.</p>
               <p>But the preſumption of the convention which voluntarily met at Amboy, and took upon themſelves to act as repreſentatives of all the members of the Engliſh epiſcopalians in America, ſeems greatly heightened when we conſider, firſt, that it was illegal according to the canons of their church; ſecondly, that none of the laity met in it; and, thirdly, that it was compoſed of but a part of the miſſionaries. Not above one, or at the moſt two of the epiſcopal clergy in Pennſylvania (if I am well informed) met in convention, or were taken into their conſultations; and very few from New-England. The epiſcopal clergy in Pennſylvania are men of too much underſtanding to complain without reaſon, and too well acquainted with the charter and laws of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, not to know that they enjoy the ſame liberty as any other religious denomination. They claim no ſuperiority over their fellow Chriſtians, nor do they conſider themſelves in a ſtate of perſecution, merely becauſe they are not eſtabliſhed by act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and their opinions and practices made a ſtate religion in preference to all others. They know that a difference in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion does not deprive a ſubject of his 'natural right to any civil or military power.' And as to the laity they are contented with the privileges which they enjoy in common with their fellow-ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Should any one aſk who theſe gentlemen are that met in this voluntary convention, and aſſumed to themſelves ſuch mighty powers; I bluſh to think of the anſwer that muſt be given. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſome reſpect ſhould have been had to governors, to the members of his Majeſty's council, to the repreſentatives of the people in aſſemblies met. They at leaſt ought to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted; before application was made to his Majeſty for an epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, and before a plan was concluded on different from what was ever known in the Chriſtian church.</p>
               <p>It might have derogated too much from the dignity of this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary convention, to have conſulted with <hi>diſſenters</hi> on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet where thoſe who reject epiſcopacy are more than thirty or forty for one that prefers it—as is the caſe in ſome of the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern governments, thinking people will admit that ſome regard ſhould be had to them.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, then, it is evident, that neither the addreſſes requeſting an epiſcopate, nor the bitter and indecent complaints, of unprecedented hardſhips and unparalelled ſufferings are the
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:010857_0115_0F851EE429C43AF0"/>voice of the clergy and laity of the epiſcopal churches in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca: Neither do they complain of a want of government becauſe they have not a biſhop reſiding among them. Agreeable to the conſtitution of their church, they conſider themſelves under the care of the Biſhop of London as their paſtor, and the king as the ſupreme head of their eccleſiaſtical polity. Their worſhip they regulate by the canons and rubries, their diſcipline by the laws of the community to which they belong, and their faith by the articles of the church of England. The diſtance of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors does not in their opinion deſtroy the regularity of their government, nor tempt them to demand a change; and until the Doctor convinces us that <hi>near a million</hi> of Britiſh ſubjects in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica have commiſſioned him and his aſſociates to petition and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, we muſt vindicate ſo reſpectable a body from the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>convention,</hi> who by aſſuming an authority and power never delegated to them, would paſs themſelves upon the world for men of importance.</p>

<pb n="230" facs="unknown:010857_0116_0F851EE5E4F326F8"/>my excuſe, while I take the liberty to addreſs the public in favour of the Rev Dr. Bradbury Chandler, who has been mal-treated and cruelly abuſed and perſecuted by a certain writer, who ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the CENTINEL. Not that I have any doubt of the Doctor's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Public carrying conviction wherever it finds its way; but as many people may read the Centinel who have not ſeen the Appeal, and may thence form prejudices againſt the gentlemen who have been promoting a church eſtabliſhment in this country, it ſeems proper that they ſhould be preſented with the ſum of thoſe arguments, which may be offered in favour of an American biſhop.</p>
            <p>After ſo eminent a writer as the Rev. Dr. Chandler, the reader is not to expect that I ſhould offer any new arguments on the ſubject.
<q>Mecum habito &amp; Novi quam ſit mihi curta ſupellex.</q>
I ſhall be contented with treading faithfully in the Doctor's foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, taking his arguments as they ſtand, or ſometimes abbrevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, at other times enlarging them, ſo as to place them in the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt light, and upon theſe arguments we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to reſt our cauſe; they are the ſentiments of a general convention of our clergy, publiſhed after the matureſt deliberation, therefore as we do not think any new arguments are neceſſary to ſupport our cauſe, ſo are we determined not to deſert one of thoſe which we have already advanced.—The prayer of our petition is to this import, "That his majeſty and the Britiſh parliament would graciouſly be pleaſed to ſend over to America one or more biſhops of the church of England, and make ſuch eſtabliſhment for their maintainance, &amp;c. as may be ſuited to the rank and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their office." Who could have imagined that any objection would have been made to a ſcheme ſo moderate and reaſonable as this? a ſcheme which muſt be equally profitable to church and ſtate. It may be of great uſe towards preſerving the obedience and loyalty of his majeſty's ſubjects in North-America, and is abſolutely neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry towards the very exiſtence of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this part of the world. That ſuch is the importance of an American epiſcopate, Dr. Chandler has effectually proved to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon, who is not hardened againſt conviction by the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate prejudices of education.</p>
            <p>It is abſolutely neceſſary towards the propagation of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in America, that biſhops be immediately ſent over to theſe parts. "for it is (ſays the Doctor) an eſſential doctrine of the church of England, that none can have any authority in the church of Chriſt, but thoſe who derive it from Chriſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or mediately. They who receive the authority immediately muſt prove their miſſion by working miracles. Thoſe who receive
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:010857_0116_0F851EE5E4F326F8"/>it mediately muſt derive it from thoſe perſons whom Chriſt has authorized to convey it, i. e. they muſt receive it by regular ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Men may ridicule the notion of uninterrupted ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as they pleaſe, but if the authority of the clergy is derived from Chriſt, (and if it is not, they are no miniſters of Chriſt) they muſt receive it in one of the ways already mentioned, and if the ſucceſſion be once broke, and the power of ordination once loſt—not all the men on earth, not all the angels in heaven, without an immediate commiſſion from Chriſt, can reſtore it." p. 4th.</p>
            <p>All perſons therefore who call themſelves miniſters, unleſs they be truly originated from this immaculate, uninterrupted line, are impoſtors and no miniſters of Chriſt. 'It is as great an abſurdity on St. Paul's principles, for a man to preach the goſpel without being properly ſent, as for a man to hear without a preacher, or believe in him of whom they have not heard.' Therefore as the teachers who are not ordained by a biſhop, or ſent by him cannot poſſibly preach the goſpel, ſo neither can the people hear the goſpel from them. And where there are no preachers of the goſpel, nor any hearers, there can hardly be any Chriſtianity. It there be any nations then who have no public teachers duly ſent by apoſtolic biſhops, we are not to think that Chriſtianity ſubſiſts in thoſe nations. Hence we ſee the ſingular propriety with which Doctor Chandler diſtinguiſhes his American epiſcopalians by the name of the Church, the American Church, the Church in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica I confeſs he might have avoided this ſeeming tautology, by calling them at once the Chriſtians in America, or the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church in America; not that he has entirely neglected this accurate diſtinction, for page 113 he tells us, 'that the cauſe of the church of England in America is the cauſe of Chriſtianity,' and who elſe are entituled to the name of Chriſtians? What other church (that of Rome excepted) has a Chriſtian miniſtry? The churches of Denmark and Sweden, the Lutherans and Calvaniſts in Germany, the churches of Geneva, Holland and Scotland, are nothing but ſhadows of churches; they have forſaken, they have ſhut out the light of Chriſtianity by rejecting the goſpel miniſtry through the only channel of conveyance, the unbroken ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. When I think of thoſe millions of ſouls who in this enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened age, ſuffer themſelves to periſh without benefit of clergy, my compaſſion is ſtirred up, my heart is moved within me.</p>
            <p>The pious Mr. Dodwell in his one prieſthood, expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this elegant manner, 'It is,' ſays he, 'the moſt dreadful aggravation of the condemnation of the damned, that they are baniſhed from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. The ſame is their condition alſo who are diſunited from Chriſt by being diſunited from the biſhop, his viſible repreſentative.'</p>

Some people who abound in a kind of falſe charity, ſuch as would preſently ſap the foundations of the church, will here aſk, What then do we make of all Proteſtant nations beſides the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh? Do we in very deed deny them the goſpel miniſtry, and conſign them to the blackneſs of darkneſs forever? To this we ſhall only anſwer by repeating what the Doctor has already ſaid, The neceſſity of epiſcopal ordination is an eſſential doctrine of our church.—.They who have it not are no Chriſtian miniſters: As this is the truth, we are bound to maintain it, let the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences be what they may; we are not accountable for thoſe, more than for the fate of the Mahometans, ſince they alſo have Chriſtianity in their offer, but obſtinately reſuſe to accept of it; and if the Proteſtant nations in Europe ſuffer themſelves to periſh without the miniſtration of the goſpel, they are ſo much the more unpardonable, as a very little care would render it univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. We do not ſay that thoſe people are deficient in a general acquaintance with the Chriſtian religion; nor that they fail in piety, benevolence, charity, or any other moral or Chriſtian-like virtue. But they have rejected or loſt epiſcopal ordination, which alone can reſtore them to the fellowſhip of the church, and entitle them to her bleſſings. But how ſhall they who live in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhut out from the benign influence of a goſpel miniſtry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this invaluable bleſſing? Their duty is plain; they may readily obtain from England ſuppoſe it were but one or two bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and even as a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, ſo will theſe biſhops in a ſhort time convey genuine ordination to all the clergy in a whole kingdom.</p>
            <p>Having thus proved the general neceſſity of biſhops, towards the exiſtence of Chriſtanity, I ſhall next ſhew that they are peculiarly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in America. For ſince there can be no Chriſtian miniſters without epiſcopal ordination, it is plain that our clergy muſt either have biſhops to ordain them here, or they muſt go to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for ordination; but the latter is abſolutely impracticable, conſidering the dangers of the ſeas.—It has happened, I don't know by what fatality, ever ſince the affair of Jonah, that the clergy have been ſingularly unfortunate at ſea. This is alſo a general obſervation of ſeamen, who doubtleſs are the beſt judges in that caſe, <hi>There have gone home for ordination from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern colonies fifty-two; of thoſe, forty-two have returned ſafe, and ten have</hi> MISCARRIED. Page 34. What a melancholy loſs is here; little leſs than 20 per Cent. which is eight times as great as our loſs on the ſeveral kinds of merchandize which we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally import. This plainly evinces the neceſſity of having an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican biſhop. The winds and ſeas forbid our continuing any longer on t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the care of the Negroes, the Indians and the white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, furniſhes us with ſo many diſtinct arguments in favour of an American biſhop.—We ſhall conſider them apart.—The cauſe of an American epiſcopate derives a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful argument from the ſtate of the Negroes, who conſtitute the majority of thoſe numerous ſouls, that fill up and adorn our liſt as members of the church in America. The number of blacks in the iſlands and colonies is above eight hundred and forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Theſe Negroes may be faid in an imperfect ſenſe to belong to the reſpective religious claſſes of their owners with whom they are connected, and by whom they are governed. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is the religion of the maſter, that alſo may be called the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the ſlave. But the maſters are chiefly known to be churchmen; conſequently above half a million of Negroes belong to the church of England. Such have been the fruitful labours of our miſſionaries, ſuch the rapid increaſe of our church in this part of the world. Now though it is generally known that theſe ſlaves are brought up in ignorance without any ray of religious hope to cheer them, and to the eternal diſgrace of teachers and maſters are no Chriſtians at all, yet as the ſenſe of religion will certainly increaſe in their maſters by the preſence of a biſhop, ſo it will alſo increaſe in the ſlaves, and the good work which we have ſo happily begun, will then be carried on to the deſired per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection. Page 57. To illuſtriate this, let us ſuppoſe a biſhop ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in Philadelphia, his pious influence would ſoon diffuſe a ſpirit of religion, as well through all the neighbouring provinces as this city. Then we might expect in a ſhort time to equal that purity of morals, and that religious diſpoſition, which is generally obſerved in London and other great cities, that have providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially become the reſidence of a biſhop. Suppoſe then a biſhop were ſettled in Philadelphia, the planters in Jamaica and the other Weſt-India iſlands, being under his Lordſhip's immediate obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, would ſoon become very ſober and religious, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their Negroes, who are in general a diſcreet, intelligent ſort of people, would, in imitation of their maſters, become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and good Chriſtians. Whoever is well acquainted with the condition of ſlaves in our Southern provinces and the Weſt-India iſlands, and has obſerved the compaſſionate manner in which their maſters expreſs their deſire of ſeeing thoſe out-caſts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity inſtructed in the Chriſtian religion, muſt readily ſee the force of this argument, and though illiterate Americans in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral may not be able to comprehend it, yet we are perſuaded that our ſuperiors in England, for whom, by the way, Dr. Chandler's Addreſs was chiefly deſigned, will eaſily perceive its weight, and will ſee that ſo glorious a proſpect of adding half a million of church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the Chriſtian church, proves beyond all doubt, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of an American biſhop.</p>

               <p>IT is not a little ſurpriſing, that a writer of a weekly piece, who confines himſelf to no order, ſpurns at truth, and deſpiſes reaſon and argumentation, ſhould be ſo ſoon obliged to recur to a figure of rhetoric, called, repetition, to fill up his abuſive pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: That this is a fact, is evident to every impartial reader, of Num. VIII. of the American Whig, in which there is nothing but what he ſaid before, except his hiſtorical account of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and the origin of the diſſenters in England;—this I muſt confeſs is new, very new, ſo intirely new, that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident it owes its exiſtence to the fruitful invention of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Whig. To evince this aſſertion, I ſhall now exhibit to the public an account of the occaſion and riſe of the Engliſh diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not indeed quite ſo new, but rather more true; and dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all the Engliſh hiſtorians, (except Neil, whoſe veracity ſtands upon no better foundation, than his friend's, the American Whig,) for a confirmation of what I advance.</p>
               <p>Henry the VIIIth, was ſo far from being a reformer, that he continued a zealous, and perſecuting Papiſt to his death. He aimed at nothing more than the gratification of his luſt and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition;— and in order that he might indulge himſelf without controul, he ſhook off the Papal authority, and enriched himſelf by ſeizing the revenues of the church. Under his ſon Edward VI. the reformation made a very conſiderable progreſs, but was far from complete, when it pleaſed God, who is unſearchable in his judgments, to deprive the nation of ſo pious and aimiable a prince, and the Romiſh religion was again introduced, under the influence and power of the bigotted tyrant Mary; who raiſed a perſecution againſt the reformed, equal to any that the primitive Church ſuffered from the Heathen emperors. Many pious and learned clergymen of the reformed church of England, as well biſhops as preſbyters, were put to the moſt cruel death; and many clergymen whoſe courage was not equal to their piety and learning, left the kingdom and ſheltered themſelves in various parts of Europe, eſpecially at Geneva, where they contracted a love and eſteem for the Genevan diſcipline, &amp;c.—When Queen Elizabeth, of glorious memory, came to the throne, a ſufficient number of men of abilities and learning, to ſupply the pariſhes that had been vacated by Mary's perſecution, was not to be found;
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:010857_0118_0F851EE7232AE248"/>which occaſioned the temporary inſtitution of non-preaching mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Thoſe that had left their livings, which were now filled in the beſt manner the times would permit, finding all eaſy and quiet at home, returned, and demanded to be reſtored to their old pariſhes. But as they had deſerted their flocks in the time of danger, it was thought unjuſt to turn out the preſent incumbents, to make room for them. Thus diſappointed, they became diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and began to ſet up for a more pure and thorough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and took the name of Puritans. In a little time they became ſomewhat troubleſome, but were too plous and well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſeperate from the church.</p>
               <p>While things were in this ſituation, the Roman Catholics at home and abroad, eſpecially the Jeſuits, were very induſtrious in making uſe of every means in their power, to obſtruct and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the reformation. Always fruitful in invention, it occured to them, that they might avail themſelves of the inſtrumentality of the Puritans, to ſow diviſions and animoſities among the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in England. A ſwarm of Jeſuits therefore embarked in the artful deſign of fomenting the diſcontent of the Puritans. Theſe adepts in art and cunuing, firſt broached the novel ſcheme of a parity of miniſters; and all the other peculiarities of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentors. Theſe were the hopeful heads under whoſe banner they liſted; the "variety of leaders," under whom they "ſplit into all that diverſity of perſuaſion," which has been "ſo favourable to liberty and philoſophy."</p>
               <p>The Whig in this ſame number, with his uſual good nature, ſtill affects to treat as trifles, the hardſhips under which the church in America labours;—the danger of croſſing and re-croſſing the Atlantic, is nothing with this heroic gentleman.—The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is an advantage; and if it was greater "the church would be better ſecured againſt an old complaint of the Jews; that prieſts were made of the meaneſt of the people"—The Jewiſh prieſthood was confined by divine inſtitution to one family, viz. Aaron's. No perſon of this family was too mean to make a prieſt of. Jeroboam, indeed, who, by his ſchiſm and idolatry made Iſrael to ſin, did make prieſts of the meaneſt of the people. He, like ſome in theſe days, paid no regard to the inſtitution of God, but ſet up a parity of families. Let this wicked proceeding be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by thoſe whom it concerns.</p>
               <p>In the Jewiſh church, by God's expreſs appointment, there was a diſparity of clergy.—High prieſts, prieſts and Levites; and as the Jewiſh church was typical of the Chriſtian, poſſibly no great abſurdity will follow from ſuppoſing that God has done the ſame in the Chriſtian church; and that biſhops, preſbyters, and deacons, are of divine inſtitution. If the American Whig, and his aſſociates, are ſo wilfully blind, that they will not ſee this, I
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:010857_0119_0F851EE7EE7E86E0"/>cannot help it: however I can pray for them, that they may have <hi>eyes that can ſee—ears that can hear, and hearts that can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand;</hi> —that they may <hi>be converted</hi> from the <hi>error</hi> of their ways, and that God <hi>may heal them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our ſagacious Whig ſuppoſes, either the preſbyterian form of church government, was inſtituted by the Apoſtles; or elſe that every community of people were left at liberty to take ſuch a form of church government as they thought moſt convenient for them.</p>
               <p>Upon this laſt ſuppoſition (which ſeems to be his real opinion) he can't poſſibly have any juſt ground of quarrel with the church of England, for preferring the epiſcopal form; for had they not the ſame right to take this form, that the church of Scotland had to take the preſbyterian form? For this writer then to oppoſe and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate the church in the ſhameful manner he does, is real and direct perſecution.</p>
               <p>But if his opinion is, that the preſbyterian form was inſtituted by the Apoſtles, and that epiſcopacy is an abberration from the truth; I beg the candid reader to conſider, that the American Whig admits that epiſcopacy "prevailed" (if he had ſaid univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, he would have ſpoken the truth for once) from "the days of St. Ignatius to Calvin; an interval of not leſs than 1400 years." He alſo admits "That the firſt ages of the church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Scarlet Whore had defiled the Nations,</hi>" furniſhed "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of martyrs and confeſſors," who "conſidered a prieſt as a biſhop's inferior."—How came theſe holy men of old to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a prieſt as a biſhop's inſerior, unleſs that was really the caſe by Apoſtolic inſtitution? Did not theſe primitive martyrs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors underſtand the conſtitution of the Chriſtian church as well as the Whigs and Independents of our day?—How was it poſſible that the whole church, which even in the Apoſtles time, was diſperſed over a great part of the Roman empire, ſhould at once forſake the preſbyterian form of church government (if that was the orginal form) and become epiſcopalians, within ſo ſhort a period as the time of St. Ignatius; and not one honeſt preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to oppoſe the abominable corruption and apoſtacy? How comes it to paſs, that this univerſal degeneracy ſhould never be noticed by one ſingle hiſtorian of thoſe times, who have been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute enough to tranſmit affairs of much leſs importance?— As to Lord Chancellor King's ſcheme which is ſo often and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouſly referred to by the advocates of the preſbyterian form of church government, it was fully confuted by the Rev. Mr. Slater, in a book, intitled—<hi>An Original Draught of the primitive Church,</hi> to which neither Lord Chancellor King (nor any one elſe, that I recollect) ever made any reply. Theſe two valuable books—<hi>King's Inquiry,</hi> and <hi>Slater's original Draught,</hi> I would recommend to any perſon, that has a mind to examine into this
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:010857_0119_0F851EE7EE7E86E0"/>Controverſy. Truth fears no examination; I therefore heartily wiſh every candid and impartial perſon among us, would read and ſearch for himſelf; and then I am confident, he would be convinced, whatever ſuch paltry ſcribblers as the American Whig, and his whole band of auxiliaries, may ſay, or write, that epiſcopacy is of Apoſtolic inſtitution; and conſequently, that it is their duty to ſubmit to it, as an appointment and ordinance of God.</p>

                  <p n="7">VII. That the friends to epiſcopacy moſt heartily deſpiſe the low deſpicable threats;—the paultry performances of a dejected, diſappointed, and tottering faction,—is true.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. That the Whig, and his party, public incendiaries, have by far, more reaſon to dread diſagreeable conſequences, than honeſt friend Tickle,—is true.</p>

                  <p n="10">X. That the Whig, No. IX. was deſignedly wrote to blind the eyes of a worthy member of the ancient Dutch church in this city, is—very true.—That it was alſo wrote in the Dutch language, for fear of an anſwer, the Whig knows to be true; but that the author will be diſappointed in this, I know— is true.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. That if the Meagre Whig, or any of his aſſociates, (I will not exclude even Dr. Ramchicken,) will oblige the public with a piece (they are all learned men) in Hebrew, Greek, or Latin, they ſhall be honoured with an anſwer, in the ſame language, by honeſt Timothy Tickle, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> or one of his correſpondents,— is true.</p>

            <head>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, June 20th. <hi>The</hi> AMERICAN <hi>WHIG,</hi> [No. XV.]</head>
            <p>SUCH is the nature of human actions, that their ſecret ſprings are not always knowable, ſave only to their authors, and the great Searcher of hearts; the ſole rule for judging of other men's motives, is by arguing from the effect to the cauſe, and by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining an action, to trace it, if poſſible, to the principle which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired its agent.—But though the characters of human actions are ſeldom ſo clear and diſtinct, eſpecially when diſguiſe is uſed, as to expreſs with certainly, the real ſources from which they flow; there is nevertheleſs a material difference, between a good and a true reaſon; not only as actually exiſting in the nature of things, but as diſcoverable by experience. And though it is often difficult to diſtinguiſh them, yet a diſcerning eye will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mark their diſcriminations, with ſufficient certainty. This, however, is a taſk rarely to be performed by common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers. Hence the wideſt door is opened for deceit, on almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſubject in life. But religion, above all others, furniſhes the moſt ample field for abuſe. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> how much ſoever the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of human nature may have warped our hearts and practice from virtue, it ſtill recommends itſelf to the underſtanding; and with thoſe who are unable to diſtinguiſh, it is enough that a ſcheme is urged by religious motives, to gain a ready, and often times, an implicit aſſent. True it is, that as the world is grown more enlightened, impoſtors muſt put on better diſguiſes than formerly.—When in times of Yore, a cry was raiſed for the heathen goddeſs Diana of Epheſus, againſt the pure and undefiled religion of Jeſus, it was attended with an expreſs avowal of the true reaſon for which it was raiſed, "by this craft we get our wealth." But our modern God-makers, find themſelves obliged to conceal their real motives; and when my Lord Biſhop is to be the Idol in America, when the ſeheme is to aggrandize the church, and to introduce prelacy, from which our anceſtors fled as from a devouring monſter, we are told it is the cauſe of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and are excited to a compliance, by an addreſs to our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in behalf of the great Author of all our benefits. Of this prieſtly cant and jargon, Dr. Chande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, in his appeal, has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us with a rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>kable inſtance. Let him ſpeak for himſelf. "As America is the region, wherein the divine goodneſs has been more remarkably diſplayed, in favour of the Britiſh nation; ſo America is evidently the very ground, on which ſome ſuitable monuments of religious gratitude ſhould be erected." To be ſure
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:010857_0121_0F851EE965DF7328"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>enial of this propoſition, would be a flat rejection of all obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to the deity. Nor will he be contradicted in the aſſertion, that this monument of religious gratitude "ſhould be made viſible to the world; that the honour of the ſupreme ruler of events may be thereby immediately promoted." Theſe ſentiments would afford juſt cauſe, in the judgment of every man, for applying to thoſe who are entruſted with the directions of our public affairs, for eſtabliſhing an anniverſary thankſgiving, to be celebrated in all the epiſcopalian and non-epiſcopalian churches in the nation. But a perſon of leſs ſagacity than the Doctor, could never have inveſtigated ſo ſingular a reaſon, for the eſtabliſhment of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy and ſpiritual bondage, in this land of religious liberty, as the ſmiles of providence, in the reduction of Canada and Louiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, and "the total annihilation of that power on this continent, whereby our former ſafety was chiefly endangered." Nor will he meet with any oppoſition to his other general aſſertion, that every wiſe nation ſees and acknowledges the hand of God, in the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch events; and that every religious nation will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make ſome ſuitable returns, for ſuch extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours." But whether thoſe returns ought to conſiſt in the legal eſtabliſhment, of any religious denomination in particular, is a matter which muſt undergo all the freedom of enquiry. If there be any force or concluſion in his argument, it plainly conſiſts in this poſition, that epiſcopacy and not Chriſtianity is the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al religion. This is evidently implied in that bright chain of reaſoning, which, to do it full juſtice, my readers ſhall have in his own words. After having excited our gratitude, and called for public teſtimonials, in honour to the deity; he argues thus; "as this honour is moſt directly promoted by public worſhip; as that worſhip muſt be moſt acceptable to him, wherein the praiſes and adorations of his creatures are regularly offered him, in the ſolemn offices of the pureſt and beſt religion; and as the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al religion muſt be ſuppoſed beſt to anſwer theſe characters, in the national opinion;" it neceſſarily follows, (mark the concluſion) that the ſtate of the "national religion here, has a right on this occaſion, to the peculiar attention and conſideration of thoſe, who are entruſted with the direction of our public affairs." The ſame argument would doubtleſs be as concluſive, in the mouth of a muſſelman, and in an addreſs to the Grand Signor. It is not a plea for Chriſtianity. It is a claim for diſtinction, in favou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the national religion. For it cannot be denied that all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious denominations among us, except Judaiſm, are at leaſt as zealous profeſſors of the religion of Jeſus, as thoſe of the Doctor's perſuaſion, which he is pleaſed to call the national religion; that the doctrines they profeſs are as pure Chriſtianity, as thoſe which the ſurpliced clergy moſt ſolemnly ſubſcribe and ſeldom preach
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:010857_0122_0F851EEA1E39F9E0"/>will require no other proof than an attendance at their numerous places of publie worſhip; and that they are far from being leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for promoting the honour of God by a ſtated attendance at publi worſhip, than their epiſcopal brethren in England and America, is an undoubted fact. There cannot therefore be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of public teſtimonials of gratitude, to the God of all our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ariſing from the want of a ſtated and regular ſupport of Chriſtian worſhip among us. Hence alſo it is clear, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for eſtabliſhing epiſcopacy in America is not, that its doctrines are more pure, the practice of its profeſſors more virtuous, or their attendance at public worſhip more regular and unterrupted, than thoſe of other denominations; or in other words, that the church of England, is properly, and excluſively the church of Chriſt; in which alone, all true Chriſtians muſt allow the honour of God can be duly promoted; but becauſe it is, as the Doctor aſſerts, the national religion, that reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on which is ſo far at leaſt removed from Chriſtian purity, that by his own confeſtion, her eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal laws, liturgy, and public offices, require a review, and would have had it e'er now "were the body of the nation poſſeſſed of good ſenſe enough to admit of it."</p>
            <p>But at all events the Doctor is involved in this dilemma; he muſt either be underſtood, as aſſerting, that the honour of God cannot be duly promoted in America, for want of that Chriſtian purity and perfection, to which we are now ſtrangers; and which cannot be introduced among us, but by the means of epiſcopacy; or, that the honour of God is not ſo much promoted by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and perfection of a Chriſtian church, as by a national eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſament of religion, however corrupt it may appear to be, if teſted by the ſacred oracles, the divine canon of Scripture. With reſpect to the former of theſe propoſitions, I ſhall think myſelf juſtified in ſuppoſing that he rejects it, until he ſhall think proper expreſsly to maintain it; that he avows the other cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while, though he admits, that the national church ſtands in need of a review, to bring it to the ſtandard of true Chriſtianity; he, nevertheleſs, attempts to erect his public monument of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, upon that national baſis. Now, to conſider his reaſoning in a juſt light, it evidently amounts to this; it is the duty of the legiſlature of a country, to promote the national religion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be; in Turkey, therefore, the lawgiver ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Mahometaniſm, in France, Spain, and Portugal, Popery; in the Britiſh Empire, Proteſtant Epiſcopacy, in China, Idolatry: All which in their ſeveral places are calculated to promote the honour of God; becauſe, in the national opinion, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively be ſuppoſed beſt adapted to that purpoſe. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly moſt excellent doctrine, from the pen of a church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land divine, and a Doctor too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="unknown:010857_0122_0F851EEA1E39F9E0"/>
But upon this plan of reaſoning, let us ſee what becomes of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive epiſcopacy. If the "national religion has a right on this, or any other occaſion, to the peculiar attention and conſideration" of thoſe in power, ſo far as to juſtify the introduction of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional religion, or in other words epiſcopacy into America, how does it ſollow, that primitive biſhops ought to be introduced? Are the Engliſh prelates ſuch primitive biſhops as the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires? Or rather did the world ever know a biſhop whoſe powers were conſined, purely to ordination, the government of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and confirmation? Surely not. Such a harmleſs creature, however, cannot be found in the Engliſh hierarchy. If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the argument drawn from the national opinion, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional religion, has any weight, it ought to command the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar attention and conſideration of our ſuperiors, in the erection of a Babel, exactly upon the plan of an Engliſh hierarchy; becauſe, according to the Doctor's mode of reaſoning, it is beſt adapted to the national opinion. But if it is the duty of our ſuperiors, thus to eſtabliſh the national religion in America, it is, of courſe, a part of the ſame duty, to enforce it by the ſame means, by pains and penalties. For, in truth, every eſtabliſhment of religion, if ſuch eſtabliſhments are in themſelves juſtifiable, ought to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as well as thoſe which are merely of a civil nature, by the infliction of temporal puniſhments on tranſgreſſors of the law. Nor, indeed, can its efficacy, as in eſtabliſhment, conſiſt in any thing elſe. Hence therefore it is as evident, in the Doctor's judgment, or at leaſt by neceſſary deduction from it, as the ſun at noon tide, that we cannot make ſuitable returns to the great author of all our benefits, but by eſtabliſhing Engliſh epiſcopacy in America, and enforcing it, (for it otherwiſe cannot be an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment) by pains and penalties. Nay, if from principles of gratitude, the national religion, by which he means the church of England, may, as he ſuppoſes, "claim a right to the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar attention, and conſideration of thoſe, who are entruſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed with the direction of our public affairs." What reaſon can be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why the whole Anglican hierarchy, with all its pomp and ſplendor, with all its pride, its riches, its dominion, its tyranny, ſhould not be eſtabliſhed over our heads? If the national re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion means the eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment in South-Britain, which upon the Doctor's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of reaſoning, muſt be allowed to be the beſt in the world: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y ſhould we have a primitive biſhop only, or rather, why a biſhop reduced even to a more humble ſtate, than that of primitive biſhops, a biſhop, whoſe power ſhould be wholly confined to ordination, government of the clergy, and the act of confirmation? Why ſhould we not have ſpiritual courts, with all their terrible appendages? Why be ſecured againſt the dreadful conſequences of excommunication, both greater and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer?
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:010857_0123_0F851EEAE41F2970"/>Why exempted from an inforced obſervation of all the holy days of the church? Why admitted to the exerciſe of any office in the ſtate, till we have taken the ſacramental teſt, in the only true, pure, catholic, and apoſtolic church? Theſe are the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines eſtabliſhed by law in England, for enforcing obedience to mother church, the religion of which, the Doctor calls the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal religion, and the Biſhop of Landaff, the native religion of our anceſtors. In ſhort it requires a very ſlender capacity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that the principles upon whith the Doctor builds his claim, to the peculiar attention of "thoſe, who are entruſted with the direction of our public aſſairs," in ſavour of the national religion, lead directly and heceſſarily, to the full and complete eſtabliſhment of epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>This concatenation could not have eſcaped his ſagacious eye. For if the national religion of South-Britain is the beſt and pureſt religion, if in the church of England, the praiſes and adoration of God's creatures are moſt regularly offered in their ſolemn offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which he more than inſinuates, why ſhould our gratitude to the Almighty be reſtrained? Why, rather, ſhould the national religion be formally excluded by eſtabliſhing an epiſcopate, as little ſimilar to the hierarchy of the Anglican church, as it would be to primitive epiſcopacy? He cannot think ſo inconſiſtently; he cannot be thus at odds with himſelf; and while he believes, that our duty to God, requires "a peculiar attention to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for our national religion; it at the ſame time muſt be his opinion," and I dare ſay it is his ardent wiſh, as an honeſt ſon of the church, that the ſplendid hierarchy may be erected, and her proud banner be diſplayed over the land; over that land, to which his own anceſtors fled ſor refuge, from the perſecuting ſpirit and prelatic intolerance of epiſcopacy; that ſpecies of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, whoſe preſent mildneſs if ſhe breathes more gently on thoſe, who are without her boſom, than ſhe formerly did, is perhaps not ſo much to be accounted for, by the aſſertion, "that cruelty and ſeverity is by no means the character of Engliſh biſhops;" as to the avowed, the ſleady and powerful protection, which his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent majeſty, and his auguſt anceſtors, of the houſe of Hanover, have always afforded to religious liberty. It cannot, indeed be doubted, that the Doctor, however conſiſtently he thinks, has not ſtamped his writings with the ſame character. Nor could this be avoided. His appeal is an addreſs, not only to the public, but to thoſe in authority. To conciliate the favour of the former, it was neceſſary to ſtrip the biſhop of all his <hi>pontificialibus,</hi> and to reduce him almoſt to the abject ſtate of a mendicant fryar; but to command the attention of the latter; ſuch ſentiments, in favour of the national epiſcopate, were to be diſcovered to them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever concealed from vulgar obſervation, as are calculated to ſhew,
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:010857_0123_0F851EEAE41F2970"/>that through the want of an eſtabliſhment, men in power are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the principal ſtate engine, for ſubduing American liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Harſh as theſe reflections may ſeem, they are fully juſtified by the paſſage more immediately under conſideration, and by many others, which I ſhall occaſionally take the liberty of diſſecting in the view of the public.—They afford the cleareſt demonſtration, that the Doctor's poſitive and expreſs declarations, in favour of primitive epiſcopacy, are thrown out meerly <hi>ad captandum vulgus,</hi> to amuſe the people; while the more ſecret deſign of the Appeal, is to lay a ſure foundation for prelatic dominion in the church, and arbitrary rule in the ſtate.—Theſe have ever been inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable companions; and while we are marking the one with a jealous eye, we ſhould as attentively watch the motions of the other.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude, it may not be amiſs to enquire into the propriety of that expreſſion, upon which ſo much is built, and by the magic force of which, we are taught, that whoever is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to the eſtabliſhment of epiſcopacy in the colonies, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of thoſe ſignal deliverances, which have lately been wrought for us, by the finger of God. To talk of a national religion of France, in Spain, or in Turkey, would be to ſpeak with propriety; but to apply this character to any church, in the Britiſh Empire, is abſurd. In England prelacy is eſtabliſhed; in Scotland preſbyterianiſm; in New-England colonies congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaliſm; and in almoſt all the other colonies, they have no religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eſtabliſhment at all.—How then, when by religion is meant, not Chriſtianity itſelf, but a particular denomination of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; how, I ſay, can any religion in the king's realm or domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions be called national? Truly I cannot conceive now, unleſs by a well known figure in rhetorick, which puts the part for the whole; but upon a ſubject of ſo much importance, and in an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the public, it is excuſable to deal in figures. I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather of opinion, that the Doctor ſuppoſes that England, though a part only of the great whole, has excluſively conſidered a right, in the plain and common ſenſe of the words, as they are uſed and underſtood by Britiſh Proteſtants, to extend her eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical eſtabliſhment throughout the colonies of the Britiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and to load Americans with burdens, which neither they, nor their forefathers could bear. And whether the ſound of this doctrine is more agreeable to an American ear, than the unmuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal periods of the ſtamp-act, I leave to my American readers to determine.</p>

            <p>SQUIRE TICKLE's aſſiſtant (No. IV.) ſeems to belong to Nimrod's hunting party, for in true ſportſmen's language he ſays, the faction firſt open'd with the Independent Reflector; —but what game was he purſuing, or (if you pleaſe) perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting? Why, the church and clergy. He was a yelping hound that's certain. He yelp'd at the exciſe; the abuſes of the road and watch; extravagant ſunerals, bills of credit, and copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, (what is more natural to the ſpecies) beef and pork, and twenty like things beſide: He likewiſe bark'd at mendicants and felons imported, creeds and ſyſtems, party diviſions, and a party colloge. How far the church of England or her clergy are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly concerned in the premiſes, ſo as to fancy themſelves only perſecuted, I leave others to judge; but for my part, I can't conceive, how, in yelping and barking at ſuch things as theſe, he ſhould have followed the example of any hireling, republican, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical dog living, much leſs of the laſt century. "The next, he ſays, was a more furious, but worſe conducted attack from (what all inſidious enemies hate moſt abominably) a Watch-Tower; but they loſt—all they were contending for; and it was hop'd they had ſallen—never to riſe again." No doubt of that Mr. Anonymous; but it ſeems they are riſen again, to perſecute the church and clergy, and oh! what will become of poor honeſt men. Alas! they will be torn to pieces (take my word for't) by theſe perſecuting blood-hounds.</p>
            <p>In Par. 2d, and 8th, Mr. What d'ye-call-him, talks of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent religious eſtabliſhment. <hi>Quere,</hi> Was not <hi>Religious</hi> put by miſtake inſtead of the word <hi>civil?</hi> Or if not, do all the laws of God as well as man, entitle any church to the full benefit of an eſtabliſhment, which (inſtead of Chriſt) makes a mortal the head of the church, and is not by a ſingle law of God authoriſed? However, if there be at preſent an eſtabliſhment, to the benefit of which the church is barely by the laws of man inconteſtibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, 'tis mighty ſtrange ſhe can't receive it. Mr. No-name ſeems to think it impoſlible to have added the ſection he mentions to the Appeal; but that, "had it been done with the ſame force of argument, &amp;c. with which the whole book is written, not a

How? why, by excluding from the aſſembly, by the <hi>fineſſe</hi> of election jobbing, a tremendous candidate, (who has lately had the honour to fright her ladyſhip moſt horribly,) as ſhe formerly commanded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect by ſaddling the faction with a tax, by means of well-timed cabals in the houſe of repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>Par. 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th, being much of a piece, I ſhall truſs them all up together. They again put me in mind of Potiphar's wife, who, becauſe ſhe could not raviſh Joſeph, ſwore a rape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; of Queen Ann's motto, <hi>ſemper eadem,</hi> and of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes's obſervation concerning oratory, which being by way of parody applied to our preſent purpoſe, will be, repetition is the beginning, and likely to be the middle, and end of Whig-Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
            <p>Par. 7th, our author ſays, "without the conſent of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, primitive, apoſtolical order of Biſhops, the act of tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not have paſs'd." Without their conſent likewiſe, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſtamp-act had never been repeal'd. Their order, no doubt, has ever been held ſacred, even by hereticks and ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; who venerated lawn ſleeves; though that St. Paul, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven St. Peter, primitive apoſtolic gentlemen ever wore them, might be as difficult to prove, as the unterrupted line of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This advocate for a church, by epiſcopalian bigots uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally abſolved of ignorance, pride, hypocriſy, and ſuperſtition,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:010857_0125_0F851EEDCD21FBF8"/>very juſtly (in ſpite of the acknowledgments of thoſe old women, Archbiſhop Uſher, Biſhop Burnet, and many other old womenly biſhops) deſpiſes the religion of the faction, as a religion of yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday; a new religion muſt needs be wrong, the Jews and Greeks in the primitive times thought ſo: But antiquity is the thing; though meerly boaſted antiquity, it will do wonders— this will infallibly prove even the uninterrupted ſucceſſion, and the divine right of paganiſm. Mr. What d'ye-call him cannot conceive, why it ſhould be a mark of reproach to the Engliſh biſhops, that they are court favoured and law dignified. I can aſſiſt his conceptions,—'tis becauſe the faction is weak enough to believe an ancient oracle, which ſays, 'Chriſt's kingdom is not of this world:' and they would condemn even Moravian and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh epiſcopacy, did they not want zeal to ſubject all denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to what they proſeſs to believe to be apoſtolical authority.</p>
            <p>This ſkilful gardiner employed by Squire Tickle, to cultivate the plants ſprung from the ſeeds of diſcord, ſow'd, (as he pretends) by the preſbyterian or independent faction, (whether he means one or both, I know not) complements the other denominations, (for others it ſeems there are) with living peaceably under the preſent eſtabliſhment. Compliments are often ill-deſerved; this I fancy is ſuch: though ſomewhat more ſilent than Balaam's aſs, no other denomination, I dare ſay, lives very quietly or peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly under the only religious eſtabliſhment I know of here, i. e. the eſtabliſhment of a tax, for the ſupport of the epiſcopal church and clergy. This is a civil eſtabliſhment, ſay you? Why that's true; however it matters not, for civil and religious, it ſeems are the ſame. That church which is ſo motherly as by a tax to treat all denominations like her children, no doubt is, and will be their grand ſecurity againſt them oppreſſion of others.</p>
            <p>Mr. What-d'ye-call-him ſays, "he dares pronounce that, ſhould the preſent happy conſtitution be given up into the hands of the faction, no one religious denomination would enjoy the leaſt toleration from them, but muſt be content (it were hard that they muſt be content) to be hang'd for their religion." Mr. What-d'ye-call-him (as well as Squire Tickle) I muſt needs ſay, does not want courage. Tremble ye factious oppoſers, for they dare affirm, deny, or pronounce any thing whatſoever; ſo daring are they, I am almoſt afraid to KICK them.</p>

            <head>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, June 23. <hi>The</hi> CENTINEL. No. XIV.</head>
            <p>AMONG the various extraordinary arguments, which Dr. Chandler makes uſe of to promote his favourite ſcheme of an Amercian epiſcopate, there is none he ſeems to lay more ſtreſs on, than that which he draws from the great increaſe, and large proportion in numbers of the profeſſors of the CHURCH among the coloniſts. This he carefully ſtates: This he inſiſts on again and again, in his appeal. Having acknowledged, that <q>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly biſhops were not greatly wanted, even in the provinces ſettled chiefly by epiſcopalians, as the beginnings were ſmall; and that it would have been, without diſpute, improper to have ſent them to provinces ſettled by people averſe to epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal government,</q> it lay upon him to ſhew ſuch a change of circumſtances in America, as would make it reaſonable to "ſettle" a general epiſcopate there; for altho it is manifeſt the numbers of people in the Britiſh plantations are greatly increaſed, yet "our ſuperiors" in England, might not be appriſed, that in the non-conformiſt colonies, the profeſſors of the church of England are, at length, become ſo reſpectable in point of numbers, as to make it reaſonable to extend the long-projected eſtabliſhment of epiſcopacy even to thoſe parts, where formerly "it would have been, without diſpute imporper" to have done it.</p>
            <p>An argument, on which ſo much dependence is placed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be well examined; and the rather, as we have ſeen that the doctor full of zeal for holy church, is apt to preſs matters too far, and to forget mentioning all the circumſtances neceſſary to enable his readers to form a right judgment of what he offers to conſideration. Thus in calculating the number of petitioners for eſtabliſhing an epiſcopate in the colonies, he takes in the people of the ſugar iſlands, and ſouthern colonies, altho' never conſulted in the forming or forwarding the ſeven potitions, drawn up by the miſſionaries of New-York and New-Jerſey; becauſe members of his church abound in thoſe parts, and every epiſcopalian, as a true ſon of the church, muſt, in the doctor's judgment, be at leaſt a virtual ſupplicant on this important occaſion.</p>
            <p>This method of exaggerating facts, being the doctor's foible, it ſhall be my preſent buſineſs to conſider this argument drawn from the increaſed numbers of his church, and the uſe he makes of it.</p>
            <p>He ſays, page 56, "a general ſurvey was made in 1762, of the proper Britiſh ſubjects in America, and communicated by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:010857_0126_0F851EEDE6EF21F0"/>of veracity; that it was then found, (excluſive of the new colonies ceded by the laſt general treaty of the peace) they amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to between two and three millions in the colonies and iſlands. Of the whites, the profeſſors of the church of England, were about a third part.—The preſbyterians, independents, and anabaptiſts not ſo many.—The Germans, papiſts and other denominations amounted to more." He adds, "the blacks in our iſlands and colonies were found, in the above mentioned ſurvey, to be 844, 000; that many of theſe it is to be feared, are not Chriſtians at all; yet, they may be ſaid in an imperfect ſenſe to belong to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious claſs of their owners, who are chiefly churchmen." Juſt before, he has theſe words; "ſhould it be ſaid, that the church of England in America, contains now a million of members, the affertion might be juſtified. It is not eaſy to aſcertain the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers exactly in a country ſo widely extended, and unequally peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled; but from general calculations, it has been frequently ſaid of late years, that the proper ſubjects of the Britiſh crown in America, amount to three millions." Elſewhere (page 89) we are told, "that of the inhabitants of this country, a full third belong to the CHURCH; and a conſiderable proportion of others, are profeſſed epiſcopalians, who cannot conſiſtently be ſuppoſed to have an averſion to biſhops." And in page 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, he ſpeaks of the complaints of near a million of Britiſh ſubjects, ſuffering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented hardſhips and intolerable grievances, for want of biſhops; argues, that it is abſurd, injurious and ungrateful, to entertain any ſuſpicion, that the adminiſtration and legiſlature will treat ſo large a number of ſubjects, with ſuch cruel partiality as to deny their requeſt.</p>
            <p>This is the amount of what doctor Chandler has advanced on this ſubject. Let us now examine what it amounts to. It may not be material to diſpute the general number of people, here ſaid to be, in the Britiſh plantations, nor the particular account of the negroes included in it; even tho' there might be ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracies in the ſurvey refer'd to. But it is of importance to aſk, why all the American colonies, except Canada and the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridas, are here conſidered in one view, and brought into one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. Why countries, ſo disjointed and ſo remote from each other, as many of them are, ſhould for the purpoſes of ſpiritual polity, be treated as capable of a convenient connection under biſhops? Is it poſſible, that ſuch an eccleſiaſtical ſuperior placed at New-York, or elſewhere on the continent, could be of any more ſervice to the iſlands, than his grace of London now is? Or, ſuppoſe two of theſe lords ſpiritual placed on the continent, and one in the iſlands, at Jamaica for inſtance, as the largeſt, (for three biſhops are the moſt, ſays their apologiſt, that have been
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:010857_0126_0F851EEDE6EF21F0"/>mentioned,) he muſt have a ſtronge eye<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. C. talks of the American biſhop, having the inferior clergy <hi>"under his eye."</hi> Page 35.</note> to ſee how the clergy behave at Barbados, and the other iſlands, which are at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of five or ſix weeks ſailing from Jamaica; yet theſe places, and people, diſtant and different from each other, in climate, cuſtoms, circumſtances and religious ſentiment, are all propoſed to be included in one plan of church diſcipline, and that too a newly projected one.</p>
            <p>I wonder this zealous advocate for the propoſed American hierarchy, when he was thus ſtriding over ſea and land, did not ſtretch a little further than the iſland colonies, in order to bring ſome other country, (Ireland for inſtance) abounding with epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians into the ſurvey, in order to counter-balance the great body of non-conformiſts in North-America; whoſe numbers ſtand ſo unluckily in the way of this grand ſcheme of the miſſionaries. By this means, they might have been alle to ſay, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of epiſcopacy, in the dependencies of Great Britain, are a great majority of all the inhabitants of thoſe countries, and therefore epiſcopacy ought to be eſtabliſhed in the middle and eaſtern colonies in North-America. Ireland is as much a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtate as Jamaica, and as much connected with North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. It is true, the major part of the people in that kingdom, are papiſts; but as they are "profeſſed epiſcopalians" and full as good churchmen, as great part of the Dr's million, <q>they cannot conſiſtently be ſuppoſed to have any averſion to biſhops.</q> In like manner it might be contended, that dioceſan epiſcopacy ought to be eſtabliſhed in Scotland; for the profeſſors of the CHURCH, are at leaſt, three parts in in four of the people of Great-Britain, taken into one account; Scotland containing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than a million of people of all denominations; and the diſſenters in England not exceeding a million, among ſeven or eight, which that part of the united kingdom is ſaid to contain. Their union in legiſlation, and their adjacency, would be additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal arguments, not ſubſiſting in the caſe of the colonies.</p>
            <p>The white people in the iſlands, ſome few quakers, papiſts and jews excepted, are all profeſſors of epiſcopacy as eſtabliſhed in England. It has not yet appeared that they ſuffer perſecution, nor have we heard them cry out for relief, on account of "unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented hadſhips and intolerable grievances." If they want an epiſcopate in every iſland, and will provide for the ſupport, and regulate the authority of ſuch an eccleſiaſtical ſuperior, by act of aſſembly, the way ſeems to be clear for them; and till the crown refuſes to concur, there is no ground for complaint. As they have not offered to do this, we muſt take it for granted, they are
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:010857_0127_0F851EEEED11A4B8"/>content with the ſuperitendency of the biſhop of London, and do not wiſh for a biſhop any nearer. The ſame muſt be ſaid of Virginia, Maryland and other ſouthern provinces, where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the doctor's church have the upper hand; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding diſſenters are numerous in thoſe parts and increaſe daily. That power, which eſtabliſhed pariſhes and taxes for the epiſcopal clergy, muſt be able to guard the CHURCH againſt all perſecution, and to give it dignitaries reſiding in America, as ſoon as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective legiſlatures, who are the beſt judges, find them neceſſary. How is it poſſible then, that near a million of people "in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, are "ſuffering for their religious principles and denied the ſame privileges, as all other denominations enjoy?" Is it inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, is it conſiſtent with the character of a miniſter of the "true religion" to repreſent the epiſcopal churches of America in general, as in diſtreſs and under perſecution?</p>
            <p>Tho' the people of the Engliſh iſlands, and of the epiſcopal colonies have been lugged into this buſneſs, yet we find, they have nothing to do with it. They have neither been petitioners with the Dr. and his brethren, for biſhops; nor are they diſtreſſed and perſecuted. As the miſſionaries are the ſole petitioners, ſo are they and their followers the only people who can have any cauſe of complaint.</p>
            <p>But even as to them, the charge is moſt unjuſt and ungrateful; Unjuſt to their neighbours, and the civil governments under which they live; Ungrateful to their ſuperiors and fellow ſubjects in England. They are here called on to ſhew any inſtance, wherein they are denied equal privileges with others. In three of the New-England governments, where a very lax kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious eſtabliſhment has obtained, the epiſcopal miniſters are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled to that part of the tax levied for ſupporting the clergy, which ariſes from their own church members. In the city of New-York, and in ſome of the counties of that colony, part of the poor tax is taken to maintain their miniſters. In Rhode-Iſland, New-Jerſey, and Pennſylvania, they are on a footing with the moſt favoured. And in all the old colonies, north-eaſt of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, they have miniſters called miſſionaries, (a name peculiar to ſuch as are ſent to inſtruct infidels) ſupported for them by the charity of well-diſpoſed perſons in England and Ireland, and in the reformed churches of Holland, Germany, and Switzerland; at an expence of between three and four thouſand pounds ſterling, per annum.</p>
            <p>It is ſome of theſe pretended miſſionaries, and theſe only, who have raiſed all the late clamours for biſhops; who are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unwearied in their endeavours to procure an eſtabliſhment over the body of the people, among whom they reſide. So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable are they, that not contented with being the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:010857_0127_0F851EEEED11A4B8"/>they would have their diſcipline extended over all other denominations, by act of parliament; tho' their church be not a fortieth part of the community. The ſtate of epiſcopacy in the old colonies north eaſt of Maryland, is nearly this. Theſe diſtricts having at firſt ſettled by people of non-conformiſt opinions, chiefly refugees from the perſecutions of the Biſhops in England, the ſew profeſſors of the church of England, who ſettled among them from time to time, would have almoſt generally joined with, and been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed at this day from the other proteſtant communions, had it not been for the ſociety for propagating the goſpel, or rather for propagating epiſcopacy. To their <q>indefatigable application and amazing perſeverance,</q> we will readily allow, it is owing, that there are above five or ſix ſuch congregations in all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try above particularized. What indeed are their ſocieties, for the moſt part, but little parties, not deferving the name of congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, utterly unable to ſupport their preachers? At this day, there is no city, town, or place, throughout the middle and eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern colonies, except Philadelphia, where the profeſſors of the church of England ſupport their clergy, without help; whilſt other denominations, unaſſiſted, maintain their paſtors, to the number of eight or nine hundred; except it may be the papiſts.</p>
            <p>The inquiſitive and accurate Dr. Stiles, of Rhode-Iſland, in his diſcourſe on Chriſtian Union, tells us, he found the epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, in all New-England, did not exceed 12,600 ſouls; yet they had 30 miniſters, and 47 places of worſhip. This was in 1760. The people of other denominations appeared to be 487, 000; and they maintained above 600 paſtors, excluſive of the public inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors among the Friends. The eaſe is much the ſame in Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. The Rev. Mr. Craig, of Cheſter, who has reſided a long time, and in different parts of the province, in his letter to the ſociety in 1764, ſays, "that of the people of the province, who as ſome calculate are 300, 000 ſouls, he can ſafely affirm not one fiftieth part, belong to the church of England; and that his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants in his three congregations, were 15 only. The Rev. Mr. Thompſon, itinerant miſſionary in the counties of York and Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, acquainted his venerable patrons the ſame year, that his people within thoſe counties, did not exceed 202 ſouls; altho' it is well known thoſe diſtricts contained at that time, thirty or forty thouſand inhabitants. And the Rev. Mr. Murray of Berks county, complained that his people at Mollattin, were reduced by removals, to twenty-nine families; that he deſpaired of ſeeing a church built within his miſſion; and expected ſoon to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ſociety's allowance for his ſupport<note n="*" place="bottom">See Society's abſtract for <hi>1765,</hi> for theſe and many other accounts of a ſimilar nature.</note> The epiſcopal
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:010857_0128_0F851EEF9DE175B8"/>ſocieties in New-York and New-Jerſey are in very little better cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. At Cohanzie, in Weſt-Jerſey, ſtands a church, but there is not the ſhadow of a congregation in the county. At Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem the epiſcopal cauſe is almoſt as low. It would be tedious, as it is needleſs, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ply inſtances to illuſtrate this matter: Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to ſay, that it is in the cities and ſome of the larger towns only, that their congregations are numerous. Yet the epiſcopal church in the non-epiſcopal colonies, never was in ſuch outwardly flouriſhing circumſtance: And no wonder; the ſociety's expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive interpoſition, could not but have ſome conſiderable effects. It has brought it from nothing to ſomething; it has kept the profeſſors of the church of England together; and, as many like cheapneſs, even in the way to heaven, ſome have joined them from other churches, who were well enough pleaſed to have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters maintained for them, by good-natured people in England, and elſewhere. How unjuſt, how ungrateful then, are theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries of New-York and New-Jerſey in their complaints of hardſhip, grievances and perſecution. They are unjuſt to their fellow ſubjects, among whom they reſide: Ungrateful to their patrons and benefactors in Europe: and their behaviour muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſeverely on their own characters, wherever this unfairneſs and diſingenuity ſhall be opened up.</p>
            <p>But the artifice of bringing all the old colonies and iſlands into one view and computation, is not the only or chief ground of complaint againſt Doctor Chandler, in his management of this argument. It is indeed but a ſmall inſtance of his infirmity, compared to one I ſhall now mention.</p>
            <p>No one will aſſert, that the whites of the Doctor's church in America, amount to "a million nearly." We may very ſafely ſay, they are not half that number. In all our iſlands, the white people do not come up to 90.000; and on the continent, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the church of England cannot be four times as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Where then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Dr. get above 500, 000 of his church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? Only among the Negroes, thoſe virtual epiſcopalians, who chiefly belong to epiſcopal owners. An attentive reader will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceive this, altho' the Dr. ſeems loth to ſpeak it out plainly. Behold a crowd of Negroes, in the Iſlands, and ſouthern colonies, almoſt all of whom "are not Chriſtians at all" ſlipt into the epiſcopal ſcale, in order to balance, in ſome meaſure, the dead weight of non-conformiſts in the northern colonies; and yet it kicks the beam! Behold at leaſt 500, 000 virtual churchmen, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually petitioning by their friends the clergy of New-York and New-Jerſey for biſhops! What low artifice is this! How unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the clerical character! Well may deiſts repreſent diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as a vice of the order: Such behaviour, but too well juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the charge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="unknown:010857_0128_0F851EEF9DE175B8"/>
Are biſhops then to be introduced into, and impoſed on the non-epiſcopal colonies, which were granted as aſylums from the power of proud prelates, by the force of ſuch wretched arguments, as this we have been conſidering? It muſt not, it cannot be: <q>It is abſurd, injurious and ungrateful to entertain any ſuſpicion, that the adminiſtration and legiſlature will treat ſo large a Number of good ſubjects with ſuch cruel partiality</q> as to put them <q>under a yoke, which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear,</q> merely to exalt a little party, ſome of whoſe clergy, affect importance, and make a great buſtle, proudly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating to themſelves the name of Church, as if all Chriſtianity was confined within their narrow pale. It may be time enough a great while hence, to think of "ſettling" epiſcopacy (the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor uſes this as a ſofter term than eſtabliſh) in theſe colonies, if numbers are to determine the point. It would be fair, however, that the epiſcopal colonies, ſhould try the experiment of import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing biſhops firſt; at leaſt, whilſt they neglect providing for ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ſuperiors, the rejectors of epiſcopacy may be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed in oppoſing their eſtabliſhment among them, by an act of the ſtate.</p>

                  <p>IT is impoſſible for hypocriſy long to remain undetected, when ſhe expoſes her actions to public attention, "in the fair face of day." Paſſion and ungoverned zeal, will inevitably put her by her guard, her maſk will fall off in the hurry of intereſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the monſter in her native hideouſneſs. This has been the caſe with the bitter faction, which now is, and always has been endeavouring, to fix the vileſt ſtains on the reputation of the church. In ſpite of all their former diſguiſes, they now ſtand confeſs'd the real ſoawn of that invenom'd brood, who burſt the bonds of gratitude, juſtice, and religion, and in a torrent over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:010857_0129_0F851EF01FF64BF8"/>turn'd altars, levell'd, churches, and laid waſte "principalities and powers." Any perſon acquainted with the hiſtory of thoſe times, muſt be ſtruck with the reſemblance there is viſible, even in the ſoam they have caſt forth. There is hardly a paper of the whig, "that whineth not of bloody perſecutions, "the Power of a biſhop's paſtoral ſtaff," "the ſcarlet whore." <q>mitred ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo,</q> "cup of fornication," <q>grandeur of St. Paul's church,</q> "Popiſh apparel, prelacy," "onions of Egypt," and other like cant phraſes, tun'd formerly from the noſes of thoſe Puritanical ſnufflers, who overwhelm'd the nation with bloody deſtruction. But what ſurpriſes me moſt is, that theſe dabblers in politics ſhould inſinuate, that "* the national church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land," was compos'd almoſt wholly of men who embrac'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſm merely to ſave their eſtates, and avoid perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." —Let hiſtory indubitably prove the falſhood and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of this aſſertion! In the times of ſevereſt perſecution, were not the clergy of the church moſt diſtinguiſh'd by their oppoſition to popery, as well in their writings as actions? Did not ſome of her moſt dignify'd eccleſiaſtics fall victims to the cruelty of papiſts? Where then (we may aſk) were thoſe firm defenders of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, who ſo much boaſt of their fortitude and Chriſtianity? Like ſerpents, when the cold winter of perſecution approach'd, they ſhrunk into their hiding-places.—But now, enliven'd by the ſerene air of moderation and ſecurity, they march proudly abroad, diſcharging their venom, and aiming their ſtings, at that boſom, which cheriſh'd and protected them.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this enmity to the church (which has occaſioned ſo many bitter jealouſies and tumults in the nation) I could never account for, till I met by chance, with the incloſed paper, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many years ago, which (if it can any way ſhow the danger of endeavouring to deſtroy the church) is at your ſervice.</p>

                  <p>To give the clearer light to theſe diſcoveries, let us look back a few ages ago, and we ſhall find a very remarkable hiſtory in the reign of queen Elizabeth, of one Faithful Commin, a Roman divine, who came over into England, and was generally reputed as a very zealous proteſtant; his ſeeming piety procur'd him a very great character with the inferior people, who were more particularly pleaſed with him for his ſevere raillery againſt the church of Rome, and his bitter invectives againſt the pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: This impoſter was at laſt detected, but by an eſcape avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hands of juſtice, and returned to Rome. The pope im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately impriſoned him for the abuſes he had ſpread about him in England; but Commin writ to his holineſs, and acquainted him that he had ſomething of importance to communicate to him, if he could have the honour to be admitted into his preſence; the pope ſent for him next day, and as ſoon as he ſaw him, ſir, ſaid he, I have heard the character you have beſtow'd upon me and my predeceſſors, among your hereticks in England, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling my perſon and expoſing my church; Commin reply'd, I confeſs my lips have utter'd what my heart never thought; but your holineſs little imagines the conſiderable ſervices I have done you: To which the pope return'd, how, in the name of Jeſus, Mary, and all the ſaints, haſt thou done ſo? ſir, ſaid Commin, I preached againſt ſet forms of prayer, and I called the Engliſh liturgy a tranſlation of the maſs book; I have made the people fond of extempore prayer, and by that means the church of England, is become as odious to my proſelytes, as maſs is to the church of England, and this will be a ſtumbling-block to that church while it is a church: Upon which the pope commended him, and gave him a reward of two thouſand ducats for his good ſervice.</p>
                  <p>To give the greater evidence to what I have ſaid upon this ſubject, I ſhall, for the benefit of the Engliſh reader, tranſlate a copy of that publick inſtrument, a Jeſuit receives from the pope, when he is ſent as an emiſſary to advance the intereſt of Rome, in any of the reformed churches.</p>

               <p>WHEN I firſt ſaw the title of your paper, I flattered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the public would have been improved and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by an examination of a Subject of ſuch moment, with all that candour, charity, and liberality of ſentiment, which conſtitutes the true character of a Whig. Coolneſs and mildneſs ought to be preſerved in every controverſy, but eſpecially, where an opponent makes uſe of the greateſt moderation and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. —A contrary conduct ſerves but to inflame the paſſions, and confuſes the ſubject in the noiſe of contention. Indeed from the conſtant tenor of your paper, this ſeems to have been your primary intention, and I muſt ſay, ſuch a purpoſe has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably anſwered;—for the ſparks of reſentment, which were before dying away, are kindled into a blaze, and will ſoon (I fear) rage with the greateſt violence.—Your firſt paper, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with ill-nature, was all over beautified with ſuch innocent puerilities, as were extremely diverting, but unfortunately, thoſe bubbles of wit (you are fond of playing with) are ſo thin and lightſome, that they ſhrink at the touch, and if blown upon by the leaſt breath of inquiry, burſt into nothing.—'Tis true you promiſe us pretty largely in that paper, "that you would ſhew as well the falfity of the facts, as the futility of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:010857_0131_0F851EF75B514558"/>in the appeal; that you would defend the liberties of your country againſt every project calculated to ruin and enſlave it." How have you performed this Promiſe? By aſſerting that the doctor does not mean what he ſays! By conjuring up an ideal hobgoblin to attack! By trumpetting out your own praiſes; or by throwing out the moſt uncharitable inſinuations againſt the church and its clergy?—Your ſpending the time of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, with long aggravated details of the evils of ſpiritual courts, or with weak, though imbittered attacks at epiſcopacy, is, I conceive, nothing to the purpoſe;—for the firſt is what the church does not appeal for; and as for the ſecond, if the church imagines it neceſſary or beneficial to itſelf, your contrariety of opinion will not be of much conſequence, ſince every denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians, in his majeſty's dominions, is allowed the free enjoyment of its religious opinions and privileges.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the ſubject in debate, I appeal to every unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced perſon, whether one ray of light has been caſt on it; or whether the miſts of prejudice, reſentment and calumny, have not been raiſed to the almoſt utter extinction of friendſhip, love, and concord among our fellow citizens.</p>
               <p>You muſt be ſolely guided by the meteor of rage and prejudice, or no public writer could have wandered ſo far from the path he propoſed to tread.</p>
               <p>As an anſwer to the appeal, the public has been entertained with a Welſh letter of kowz, and zowz, and goozy chickz. We have been puzzel'd with one in Dutch, de Staamp Act,—de act vaa ſoldaten de billeteeren, de act van ſuſpenſie of op ſchort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing —envan de de tax en revenue of inkomſt,—van ſpiritual courts—van de geeſtelike courts—poor de keerkenraad claſſis, en ſynode—van de Biſchoppelyke court, de inquiſitae van Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaal en Spanje.—We have been frighted by a BULL— thundering out excommunications againſt the church of Rome— cutting it off from the body of Chriſt, and making it a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan—raving,—of claſſes, Preſbyteries, Synods, Praeſes, Moderators.—Braying,—of meeting houſes, made of lime ſtone and wood—of the orthodoxoy of bricks and oyſter ſhells—of epiſcopalian bigots, maſſes, martyrs, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tranſlations, adulterating baptiſms, popiſh epiſcopalians, and idolatrous tranſubſtantiations—and grunting—of undoubted operations on the hearts of many to their converſion and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in faith—of ten thouſand converted in Dutch churches, to one in epiſcopal meeting-houſes, and twenty gain'd, to one loſt. From this laſt effuſion of incoherencies, I ſhould be apt to magine you, ſome fiery, mortified, ſour tempered zealot,
<q>
                     <l>Who beats a drum eccleſiaſtic</l>

               <p>How this, or any thing you have yet aſſerted, is pertinent to the point in queſtion, my eye-ſight, I muſt confeſs, is too weak to perceive.—Inſtead of entring (with politeneſs and calmneſs) into the merits of the cauſe: And by Chriſtian charity, huſhing our unhappy diviſions into peace, the ſubject has been loſt in ſcurrilous buffoonery.—You throw out the bittereſt invectives againſt the advocates for a biſhop; repreſent the church as of the moſt intolerant ſpirit—paint her clergy in the moſt odious colours and picture out in every paper, all biſhops without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the moſt perſecuting, cruel, inhuman monſters, deprived of all ſenſibility and conſcience. O! But for all this you are no enemy to the church, you imagine it would be injuſtice to deny them a biſhop, ſo curtailed and limitted as his future lordſhip is repreſented! This is not unlike the behaviour of a gentleman, who after he had (in a paſſion) ſworn a hundred times, that all the fair ſex were whores; yet (ſays he) <q>I like an honeſt woman as well as any man in the world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As I am a Whig in principles, I would willingly ſee all my country-men enjoying their religious liberties without being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted by the envy or ambiton of party.</p>
               <p>Benevolence and brotherly-love, as I imagine, are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal characteriſtics of Chriſtians; if theſe were more inculcated, than that proud narrow-hearted, uncharitable ſpirit of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſectariſm, which prevails among us, a mutual confidence would follow, productive of the greateſt advantages both to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and country.—But ſome men, influenced either by ambition or envy, have ever been (to the great detriment of this province) endeavouring to raiſe a monument of their literary abilities, on the ruin of public tranquility—to gorge their purſes as well as ſpleen, by fomenting diſſentions in religious as well as civil ſocieties.</p>

               <p>WHATEVER opinion the world may form of Dr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's candour, or his talents for reaſoning, I think no author that has ever appeared, can diſpute with him the prize of artifice and ſophiſtry. In art, he ſurpaſſes the moſt art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and the moſt ſophiſtical in his dexterity at ſophiſms. In ſupport of this aſſertion, numerous inſtances might, and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall be produced from the memorable appeal. I ſhall at preſent confine myſelf to the 109th page, which is a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-piece of the noble ſcience of logical craft; and may be of ſingular uſe, in teaching future reaſoners to refute any objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world, by a bare ſubſtitution of a different word in the anſwer, for that contained in the objection. The whole paſſage runs thus; <q>another objection has been made by ſome perſons, to the following purport, that if Biſhops are once ſettled in America, although in the manner we now propoſe, there will probably be an augmentation of their power, as ſoon as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will admit of it; and what is eaſy and inoffenſive in its beginning, may become but thenſome and oppreſſive in its end. But at this rate there can be no end of objecting. For if every poſſible ill effect of a thing, although confeſſedly proper in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and harmleſs in its natural tendency, may be made an argument againſt it, there is nothing that can eſcape. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this ſort may be as fairly and properly alledged— againſt a religious toleration, which is now generally eſteemed by proteſtants, to be a natural right of men, and a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant one of Chriſtians—againſt admitting thoſe, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the national religion, to any degree of civil or mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power, to which indeed they have no natural right— againſt allowing the common people the uſe of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, or the liberty of examining any points of religion or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment —againſt ſuffering any to receive a learned educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. for none can tell what ill conſequences and abuſes may follow, in ſome future period, from theſe conceſſions and indulgences. The truth is, men are not to be terrified or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by fears of ſuch conſequences as are barely poſſible;
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:010857_0132_0F851EF7DCF03FB8"/>but to conſider what is reaſonable and proper in itſelf, and what effects will probably and naturally follow.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The objection here ſtated is, that if Biſhops are once ſettled in America, although in the manner now propoſed, there will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be an augmentation of their power, as ſoon as circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will admit of it; and what is eaſy and inoffenſive in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, may be burdenſome and oppreſſive in its end. Now if there be any reaſon for theſe apprehenſions; or in other words if it is really probably that ſuch a cauſe will produce ſuch effects, the objection is well founded. On the contrary, if there be no probability that an epiſcopate ſo harmleſs in its original erection, will finally degenerate into the evil apprehended, it is altogether groundleſs. The firſt, and I think the only thought, that would therefore occur to an author, who wrote under the influence of truth and ſincerity, would be to remove the objection, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the probability on which it was was raiſed. But let us ſee how cleverly a writer, who cannot follow reaſon and nature when reaſon and nature are againſt him, can depart from both. <q>But at this rate (ſays he) there can be no end of objecting. For if every poſſible ill effect of a thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though confeſſedly proper in itſelf, and harmleſs in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency, may be made an argument againſt it, there is nothing that can eſcape.</q> But pray is it, at this rate, that the objection is ſtated? Nothing like it. The objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is grounded on the probability of the conſequence, which the objector is introduced as apprehending. He is not repreſented as alarmed at bare poſſibilities, which would be idle and rediculous. But he is brought on the ſtage as declaring his diſapproving of the ſcheme propoſed, on the ſuppoſition that tho' it be harmleſs and inoffenſive as requeſted, it has a natural tendency to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and probably will finally iſſue in what is deſtructive and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>icious; and in this view, ought to be alarming, and the matter of oppoſition and conteſt. For what purpoſe then is the probable! in the objection, ſo dexterouſly and inſtantaneouſly ſlid into the poſſible, in the anſwer? Does the doctor really think it either probable or poſſible to convince the world, that this was done without deſign, or with the honeſt purpoſe of ſerving the cauſe of truth? Should a man tell our author, that he was afraid to travel a particular road, becauſe, from probable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he had reaſon to apprehend it was infeſted with robbers; could he think of allaying the fears of the traveller by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing anſwer, <q>Sir if every poſſible thing is made an argument, againſt your proceeding on your journey, there is no ſuch thing as travelling at all.</q> Would not the man conclude, that the doctor greatly undervalued his life and property; or treated him like a perſon void of underſtanding?—What then muſt we
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:010857_0133_0F851EF88F3F2AF0"/>think, when an author endeavours to palm ſuch fuſtian on the world; and appears before the tribunal of the public with ſuch cobweb ſophiſtry? What a ſtrange perverſion of the noble facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reaſon, to the unworthy purpoſe of deluſion and chicanery! A melancholy inſtance of the power of prejudice, and how am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition will blind and intoxicate the underſtandings of men, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe clear and diſcerning!</p>
               <p>But inſtead of anſwering the objection as firſt ſtated, and in the form in which it is really ſtrong and forcible; he proceeds in rendering it ſtill more ridiculous, by a ſudden and artful tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation into what, to an incautious reader, would appear, and what he intended ſhould appear, no more than a bare repetition of it' in a different mode of expreſſion. 'For if every poſſible ill 'effect of a thing, although 'confeſſedly proper in itſelf, and harmleſs in its natural tendency, &amp;c.' But is this a fair ſtate of the objection? Is it ſo much as a ſuppoſeable caſe, that the ſame perſon who confeſſes the thing harmleſs in its natural tendency ſhould object againſt it, as tending to, produce the evils he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, and which conſtitute the very eſſence of the objection? The meaning of this paſſage, if it has any meaning at all, muſt therefore be this: The thing, Mr. objector, which I declare to be, and which others confeſs to be, proper in itſelf, and harmleſs in its natural tendency, you ought not to object againſt, or there is nothing that can eſcape. But in this ſenſe, the argument is as ridiculous as he has endeavoured to make the objection. For there is nothing ſurely abſurd in one man's apprehending danger, from what another conceives pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and harmleſs. But it is the higheſt abſurdity for the ſame man to object to a thing, as likely to become burdenſome and oppreſſive, which himſelf confeſſes to be harmleſs in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency. And yet ſuch is the ſubtil turn which this anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huſſar in controverſy, has given to ſo plain and perſpicuous an objection. But let us conſider the ſeveral particulars, by which he has endeavoured to elucidate, that there is no force in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection he combats; and which as he perverts it before he enters upon an anſwer, was really never made. The inſtances by which he thought proper to illuſtrate the inconſequence of the no-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection he is at preſent moſt puiſſantly attacking; and againſt which, he ſays, arguments of this ſort may be as fairly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly alledged, are the four that follow; and which, conſidering his violent antipathy to any alteration of his method, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the order he has mentioned them.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. <q>Againſt a religious toleration, which is now generally eſteemed by proteſtants; to be the natural right of men, and a very important one of Chriſtians.</q> And does this gentlemen
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:010857_0133_0F851EF88F3F2AF0"/>really think, that there is equal reaſon for apprehending pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences from a religious toleration, which has never yet produced one ſuch conſequence, as there is from the pride and ambition of dignified eccleſiaſties, which has ſo frequently turned whole nations topſy-turvy? And pray what doth he mean by the mumbling, "mincing is now generally eſteemed by Proteſtants?" Does not he himſelf eſteem a religious toleration to be the natural right of men, and a very important one of Chriſtians? If he does, why doth he not ſpeak out like a man? If he thinks otherwiſe, why afraid publickly and explicitly to avow it? But the next illuſtration is involved in ſtill greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity: and might with much more propriety be termed an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſcation of the truth. For,</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. <q>Arguments of this ſort, ſays he, may be as fairly and properly alledged againſt thoſe who diſſent from the national religion to any degree of civil or military power, to which in-indeed they have no natural right.</q> That is in plain Engliſh, it is as ridiculous to apprehend any danger from the abuſe of inordinate power in the hands of eccleſiaſtics, who appear from hiſtory to have almoſt perpetually abuſed it, as from an admiſſion of the Diſſenters to the common rights of all loyal ſubjects, which they have never abuſed. A ſtriking inſtance this, of that moderation and candour towards Diſſenters, which, for a certain reaſon, I mean ſmoothly to carry his point, he was obliged to aſſume; but which for another certain reaſon, I mean his mental bitterneſs againſt them, he could not conceal! But what means the Doctor by ſaying, <q>that the Diſſenters have no natural right to any degree of civil or military power.</q> If by natural right, he means any right in contradiſtinction to municipal or political rights; it may with equal propriety be predicated of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians, and of all men. For no man has a natural right to a political privilege: And in this ſenſe, it is nothing but downright malevolence, without any tendency to benefit his argument. If he means by it any thing peculiar to Diſſenters, what prevented him from ſhewing the ſuperior natural rights of the conformiſts? But probably it was intended by way of title, in contraſt to that of the members of the church of England, that we take care in all future times, not to be more cautions when ſpeaking of the latter, in adding as by law eſtabliſhed, than of the former, with the diſtinguiſhing addition of, "who have no natural right to any degree of civil or military power." But.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. <q>Arguments of this ſort, may be as fairly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly alledged againſt allowing the common people the uſe of the ſcriptures, or the liberty of examining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="266" facs="unknown:010857_0134_0F851EF93845FD98"/>arguments as they were, and they were as ſolid as moſt of the Doctor's) againſt ſuch uſe of the ſcriptures; but then they were brought by the Papiſts; and it muſt grieve any man to find a Proteſtant Divine ſo far adopting the practice, as to put them upon an equal foot with arguments againſt the danger of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power in the hands of eccleſiaſtics. The holy ſcriptures were given to teach men the way to ſalvation; and they are ſaid to be neceſſary for inſtruction, &amp;c. But can it be ſaid to be neceſſary for a biſhop, to be clothed with powers formidable to the civil rights of mankind? If not; how are the inſtances parallel? Without the liberty of examining any points of religion, religion would ſoon degenerate into prieſtcraft; as experience ſhews it has done, whenever ſuch liberty has been reſtrained. Without the liberty of examining into any points of government, (a ſingular phraſe!) government would degenerate into tyranny; as all hiſtory ſhew, it has done, where ſuch examination was prohibitted. How, therefore, can that which is abſolutely neceſſary to the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of religion and government; and which, inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, has prevented evil and oppreſſion, be dangerous to either? Or be compared to that, which is not eſſential to epiſcopacy, and has frequently proved deſtructive and pernicious? But,</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. The poſſible ill conſequences and abuſes of a learned education are placed in compariſon with the danger apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the probable augmentation of the epiſcopal power, as ſoon as circumſtances will admit of it. The compariſon, truly, has no kind of ſimilitude, and to give it a lift, the author is obliged to have recourſe to his wonder-working poſſible, which has probably been of greater ſervice to him throughout this whole augmentative page, than ever it was to all other the pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers his predeceſſors put together. <q>The truth is, (ſays he,) men are not to be terrified or influenced by fears of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences as are barely poſſible; but to conſider what is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and proper in itſelf, and what effects will probably and naturally follow.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus after a rotation of a page, he returns to the very ſpot from whence he ſtarted, and again gives the objection as it was ſtated at firſt. For it is of ſuch effects, as will probably and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follow, and of no other, that the objector is ſuppoſed to be apprehenſive; and which the author has metamorphoſed into ſuch, as are barely poſſible, and in that light endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move by comparing them to others, that are but barely poſſible; and whether it is either probable or poſſible, that all this was done without deſign to raiſe a miſt before the reader, I cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubmit to the tribunal of the public. To me it ſeems pretty extraordinary, that of all the things in the world, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:010857_0134_0F851EF93845FD98"/>ſhould have ſelected a religious toleration, the admiſſion of Diſſenter to any degree of civil power, the reading of the holy ſcriptures, and a learned education, as the four objects of equal terror, with the additaments to the power of biſhops, as ſoon as circumſtances will admit; becauſe theſe have not the leaſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to introduce any miſchief, while the other as naturally tends to it, as heavy bodies do to the centre; is it becauſe theſe things appear peculiarly formidable to thoſe who want an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can hierachy, that they ſo familiarly offer themſelves as things particularly liable to evil conſequences?

               <p>AS Squire T. (No. V.) has employ'd another deputy to Whip in his room, I beg leave to give a Kick or two in yours. This new Whipper (who calls himſelf Probus) ſays, (par. 1.2. &amp;c.) 'the Whig's deſign is to divide the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church of England.' No doubt of it!—when a cord and a cable pull different ways, it muſt ſurely be a prudent piece of art to divide the cord, leſt its ſuperior ſtrength ſhould break the cable; and who can blame Probus for endeavouring to
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:010857_0135_0F851EFA5C6CB008"/>give us high ideas of the greatneſs of his little party, any more than a ſchool-boy for ſtru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Par. 3d. He gives us a ſtring of quotations from the <hi>Whig,</hi> N. III in which if the reader can fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d a ſingle inſtance of alteration, decurtation, or other miſrepreſentation, I hereby oblige myſelf to pay <hi>Probus</hi>'s whipping-ſees; for nobody ſurely will take the trouble of comparing Whig and Whip together.</p>
               <p>Par. 4th. With his arms akembo, he gives himſelf airs as a critical hiſtorian, (and like doctor C—r,) implicitly boaſts of the character of a Tory; which if any man preſumes to think diſrepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or unfriendly to liberty, he is a Whig; which is, being by ſycopants interpreted, a lying raſcal, but, by all loyal patriots and friends to the revolution, an honeſt man. I expected your kicks, ſir, would ſtagger ſquire T. and his aſſociates; but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, it ſeems, is already much ſtagger'd by his own thoughts! 'Twere a pity the poor fellow ſhould break his neck before his own reformation is more complete; but if the Whig's complaint of the imperfection of the reformation in Henry VIII's. reign, ſhould make him reel ſo as to fall, who can help it? Probus has ſuch a peculiar talent at making feints with his whip, that no mortal can gueſs beforehand where it will fall;—let us conſider his merit this way. The Whig ſays, 'the reformation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by Henry VIII. from no very religious motive;" <hi>ergo,</hi> (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus infers) he conſiders Henry as a reformer,—Probus ſays, he is called ſo, by none that he knows of but Papiſts;" ergo, the Whig, (for he knows of him) is a Papiſt. [Quere, what Papiſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver complimented Henry with the title of a reformer?] The Whig inſinuates, "that the high and low-church parties, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from different motives at the reformation;" ergo, (ſays Probus) he inſinuates, "that the diſtinction originated from thence;" ergo, again, "he lies like the d—dunce Mahomet, in his Koran." "The diſtinction, it ſeems, was not known for more than a century after." So we are told, the diſtinction of Cavaliers and Round-Heads, was not known, till the reign of that king who had his head cut off; nor that of the Whigs and and Tories, till about the year 1678, in the reign of that buck his ſon; and yet, quere, were not Rehoboam's old prudent counſellors in reality Whigs, and his young hot headed adviſers Tories? I muſt, it ſeems, inform Probus, that a thing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exiſts long before it has a name. But to proceed, the Whig ſays, "ſuch as were Papiſts in their hearts, were always mighty ſticklers for rites and ceremonies, the uninterrupted line of ſucceſſion, &amp;c." Ergo, he ſays, "ſticklers for ceremonies, were always Papiſts in their hearts." Ergo again, he calls Laud
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:010857_0135_0F851EFA5C6CB008"/>and Hall Papiſts in their hearts. Probus ſays, "Biſhop Hall was a favourer of puritaniſm;" ergo, "he was one of the warmeſt friends of Diſſenters." "He wrote a book, entitled, Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy by divine right;" ergo, "he was one of the monſt ſtrenuous aſſerters of the ſucceſſion." (aſſerters! very well!) "No church on earth is more diſtinguiſhed for moderation than that of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſhe ſhews ſufficient indulgence to ſcrupulous conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;" ergo, "The demands of heated enthuſiaſts, factious ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tariſts, and reſtleſs heretics, are unreaſonable." The American Whig, &amp;c. (thoſe heated ſectariſts, &amp;c.) demand ſecurity from epiſcopal tyranny." (what preſumption!) ergo, "If they are gratified, this moderate church will ſoon be utterly annihilated: Alas! then for the dear, dear, dear ceremonies and canons!" "The independents in England perſecuted ſticklers 120 years ago, and beheaded a man who had been a king," ergo, "The Whig, and his party the Preſbyterians, (perhaps Papiſts) would fain do the ſame now in America. Quere, what induced Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus to put heathens inſtead of ſticklers, &amp;c? Anſwer Intereſt. Vid. par. 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th.</p>
               <p>Probus's probity as to par. 9th would have been more evident, had he made numerical references to authors by name, and his good ſenſe will be indiſputable, when he ſhall have pointed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He already from a conſiderable diſtance ſmells po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in New-York. He expects there are even Jeſuits here, and for his ſuſpicions gives two and a hall reaſons or ſymptoms. 1ſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and none elſe, place the reformation in a diſadvantageous light:—The Whig has done this: ergo, he's a jeſuit." Now Papiſts blame the reformation ſo far as it was, and the Whig ſo far as it <hi>was not</hi> a reformation—both the ſame thing, you know, gentle Sir! 2dly, there is a furious outcry raiſed againſt Biſhops in New-York, and this tallies exactly with the ſentiments of Papiſts; ergo, There are Jeſuits in New-York. Now you know, ſir, the moſt artful method to promote the ſuceſs of any obnoxious project, is to raiſe a ſurious outcry againſt ſomething very much like it. 3dly. The ſuſpicion heightening half ſymptom, is, "that the faction has made no clamour or noiſe, about the popiſh Biſhop of Quebec." Now, had he been ſent to New-York, inſtead on raiſing a furious outcry, no donot the faction would have quietly and peaceably ſubmitted to his

Many, who have no idea of a biſhop, ſeparate from the appendages of the office in ſome hierarchies, when they read any thing in the new teſtament concerning this miniſter of religion, apply it without heſitation to prelates of the eſtabliſhment they are beſt acquainted with; and wonder at the preverſeneſs of thoſe who differ from them. Few profeſſors of Chriſtianity deny biſhops to be of divine inſtitution; but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty lies in adjuſting their rank and powers. The Roman, the Greek, and other eaſtern churches hold, that biſhops are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right, an order ſuperior to prieſts; and that although they are preſbyters, they have alſo an higher character, and are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the other clergy, in like manner, as the apoſtles in the infancy of the church, were ſuperior to the common teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the goſpel. The proteſtant communions abroad, Lutheran and Calviniſt, have rejected this opinion as unſcriptural, as having been the ſource of much abuſe and corruption. The ſenſe of the Proteſtants of the German empire on this point, is ſet forth in the articles of the league concluded at Smalcald in 1530; in which they aſſert the power of ordaining to belong, by divine right, to preſbyters. Accordingly the Lutheran ſuper-intendants are only firſt among equals, or ſtanding preſidents of the councils of the clergy. It is almoſt needleſs to obſerve that the churches of the reformed, and the church of Scotland, have agreed in the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all prelacy; for with them every pariſh miniſter is a biſhop. In England the eſtabliſhed church has never explicitly declared herſelf on the point; if we attempt to deduce her judgment from her conduct, we ſhall find it unſettled; yet more favourable to the diſtinction of order in latter times, than formerly<note n="*" place="bottom">In the reigns of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and <hi>James I.</hi> many divines ordained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by preſbyters, were admitted to pariſhes in England; but ſince the reſtoration, all the proteſtant ordinations are treated as invalid, and orders from dioceſan biſhops inſiſted on.</note> The firſt reformers in England, with Dr. Cranmer at their head, perfectly agreed with their brethren the proteſtants abroad, and held preſbyter and biſhop to be the ſame in ſcripture. As they looked on church polity to be mutable, in much the ſame manner as civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:010857_0137_0F851EFB8D077AD0"/>they thought it very allowable for preſbyters to wave their rights, and for the ſake of better order, to ſubmit to ſuperiors of human inſtitution.<note n="§" place="bottom">See Cranmer's opinion in Stillingfleet's Irenicum, Cap. <hi>VIII;</hi> alſo the opinions of the Biſhop of St. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> It was a long time before the original Chriſtian congregations in the cities became ſo numerous as to make it neceſſary to divide their aſſemblies, they kept together till meer inconveniency forced them to it.

<pb n="273" facs="unknown:010857_0137_0F851EFB8D077AD0"/>for public worſhip, they conſidered them as chapels of eaſe, and the people as part of the original congregation. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of paſtors was in this manner neceſſarily increaſed within the pariſh or dioceſe, and it became, in proceſs of time, orderly to have a preſident at the meetings of the conſiſtory; to whom, by degrees the name of biſhop was reſtrained.

               </gap> affairs of the congregation being managed by him and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with the concurrence of the people. As it was natural for the Chriſtians in the purer ages of the church to place the moſt reſpectable of their elders in the chair, it is eaſy to conceive, how ſuperior abilities and character on the one hand, and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled love and reſpect on the other, might conſpire to give a fatherly pre-eminence to a primitive biſhop. His age and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not to mention the ſufferings which many of them endured, would unavoidably command this, and every other expreſſion of reverence, which the members of a voluntary ſociety, unſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of any ambitious ſchemes, could give. It would of courſe happen that the biſhop and the more aged preſbyters would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be reſident near the mother church or cathedral, whilſt their younger brethren itinerated thro' the pariſh, labouring from houſe to houſe, and in the dependent places of public worſhips: The biſhop would be generally deputed to ſit in the ſynods and councils of the church: And nothing of importance would be undertaken at home, without the advice of a perſon of ſo much experience and piety.</p>
            <p>In all popular aſſemblies, great regard is paid to the opinion of a few of the beſt ability and moſt knowledge; but if a great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character accompanies theſe endowments, the influence of ſuch perſons is almoſt unlimitted</p>
            <p>Such ſeems to have been the riſe of the dioceſan biſhop; an office not known in Scripture. The very large extent of the dioceſes in ſome parts, and the general converſion of the pagans (probably ſo called from <hi>pagi,</hi> a word ſignifying the people of the country) muſt have increaſed and confirmed the ſuperiority of the biſhop. As the people became too numerous to aſſemble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of their affairs, on every occaſion, the care of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to the conſiſtory; and the duties of inſtruction calling out the younger preſbyters to different parts of the diſtrict, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſcipline now increaſed, and occuring daily, gradually centered in the biſhop and the aged elders, who remained with him. Hence roſe the Chapter, or that body of clergy, who at this day make a mock choice of the biſhop, and are as a council

The greateſt kings have their councils.—Whence ſhould this ſole exerciſe of juriſdiction come? Surely one may ſuppoſe upon good grounds, from the beginning it was not thus; and that the deans and chapters were councils about the chairs of biſhops at firſt; and were to them a Preſbytery or conſiſtory and intermeddled not only in diſpoſing of revenues and endowments; but much more in ecleſiaſtical juriſdiction.—We ſee the biſhop of Rome performs all eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction as in conſiſtory.—"Of the antient mode," we ſee many ſhadows ſtill remaining; as that the dean and chapter, for form's ſake, chooſe the biſhop; which is the higheſt point of juriſdiction; and that the biſhop, when he grants orders, if there be any Preſbyters actually preſent, calls them to join with him in the impoſition of hands; and ſome other particulars."

            <p>When wealth and corruption entered the church and lovers of Pre-eminence got into the Epiſcopal ſees, that authority which had been conceded to the perſonal character of the former preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the clergy, was now claimed by, and yielded to their ſucceſſors, as their proper juriſdiction. Inſtead of flying from a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which formerly had ſet a man up as an object of perſecution, and which was thought to require an uncommon ſhare of zeal and faithfulneſs to diſcharge its duties with a good conſcience, the vain and the ambitious ſecretly intrigued for Votes, and uſed every artifice to arrive at a dignity, endowed with riches, and conſequently inveſted with ſtate influence and worldly power. Theſe abuſes, of which the prince had by his inſidious liberality been the chief author, riſing into tumults and even bloodſhed, gave him a ſpecious pretence, for taking from the people, their right of chooſing their biſhops, and to farther debaſe the church and clergy, by turning religion into a ſtate engine.</p>
            <p>The See of Rome was tainted very early. This aroſe partly from the great benefactions entruſted with her biſhops, for the purpoſe of ſending out miſſionaries to the northern and weſtern parts of Europe; which alſo ſerved to advance their Influence, and promote their authority, even under the loſs of the ſeat of empire, which was transferred to Conſtantinople. The biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Rome therefore became early the object of competition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe who ſought after filthy lucre, and were diſpoſed to

            <p>To thoſe who are the leaſt acquainted with church hiſtory, it ſeems ſtrange to find Dr. Chandler arguing, that dioceſan Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy muſt have been the original plan of government in the church, becauſe of the ſuppoſed difficulty of altering things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with religion. I would aſk him, whence came arch-biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops and patriarchs? Whence aroſe that grand corruption of Chriſtianity called popery? The truth is, the alteration was gradual, and at the time of his favourite St. Ignatius, the biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op was, as primate Ulſter wonds it, "only different in degree, not in order:" as a Lutheran ſuper-intendant at this day preſides over a conſiſtory of paſtors. To bring in the Epiſcopacy of the 1ſt. and 2d. centuries, then, to ſupport that of the church of England, is plainly begging the queſtion. It is to treat two characters as the ſame, who in fact are as different as the firſt commiſſioner of the treaſury in England, and the lord high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer; or as the Doge of Venice, the preſident of that republic, and the abſolute duke of Florence.</p>

            <p>ALTHO' I profeſs myſelf an independent, I ſhall nevertheleſs always bear public teſtimony, as I ever have done, againſt all meaſures that ſeem calculated to injure the general intereſt of religion. Nor ſhall I at any time, be aſhamed to reprehend even thoſe of my own perſuaſion, whoſe proceedings may have the ſame tendency, tho' deſigned to anſwer a different purpoſe; or thoſe who falſe to our cauſe, and true to none, ſee the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a juſt light, and yet continue to uſe means which muſt of neceſſity produce them. Now, ſince the American Whig, the Centinel, and Dr. Chauncey, have undertaken (to ſpeak in their own polite manner) to greaſe the wheels of that carriage, which lays down a load of ſcandal at each man's door who happens to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent—ſtrange! that they ſhould hate diſſenters—from their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; I have made the few following remarks upon theſe men's ſpirit and behaviour, which are at your ſervice; tho' I muſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly own, that I ſhould not have uſed your paper as a channel of conveyance to the publick, for my ſentiments, had I not been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that the writers of my own denomination would want both fortitude to acknowledge,—and by publiſhing my reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:010857_0139_0F851EFCE49251E8"/>they muſt have acknowleged—their faults, and ingenuity to amend them.</p>
            <p>Some time ago, eighteen preſbyterian parſons, (or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly independents) under the unaccountable influence of ſome deluſion or other, recommended in the warmeſt and moſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, tho' it muſt be owned, in the moſt modeſt, dutiful, and decent manner, a perſon who had deſerted our cauſe, or was thought to have done ſo, to the favour and patronage of one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed and moſt virtuous prelates in Chriſtendom; from whom nothing leſs could be expected, than the very genteel reprimand, with which he condeſcended to honour them. I then gave them a proper chaſtiſement for their miſconduct; which, it is true, <hi>they,</hi> and the <hi>public</hi> received in a very different manner. But I hoped however that they were not ſo far loſt to their cauſe, and to themſelves, as to have tranſgreſſed again, while their backs are yet reeking from the laſh of publick indignation, by fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſchemes, under pretence, at leaſt, and perhaps with a deſign, of ſupporting our cauſe, which have a direct tendency to ruin and ſubvert it. But how infecurely my hopes were founded, every week's experience doth again, and again, convince me—Once more therefore, am I obliged to take upon me the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, tho' neceſſary office of detecting the treaſons, of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended friends, but real enemies, or correcting the errors (to give them the ſofteſt Name) of our very true brethren, but very incompetent advocates; I mean (what my reader already under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands) the American Whig, the Philadelphia Centinel, and Aberratious Doctor.</p>
            <p>All theſe write with great warmth againſt biſhops; but then, alas! their zeal is without knowlege, policy, or purdence. The Whig, in his third numb. has caſt the moſt odious reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reformation itſelf, that the keeneſt malice could invent;—and the Centinel, in his ſixth numb. has repreſented the clergy of al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> denominations, and in every age, as the greateſt villains that ever exiſted. Now the world will naturally ſuppoſe that he is more acquainted with the clergy of his own denomination, than with thoſe of any other; and if people go a ſtep farther, (as it is natural enough to believe they will) and ſuppoſe (which is alſo reaſonable enough to be ſuppoſed) that the clergy of moſt other denominations, would not admit ſuch a railing accuſer many times into their company; their concluſion (a probable on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at leaſt) will be this, that, if he is an honeſt man, he has paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own teachers in the colours which moſt aptly repreſent their genuine complection; but that let him be as honeſt as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> will, he cannot be depended upon for the deſcription of other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> whom he hath not had adequate opportunities of knowing; and
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:010857_0140_0F851EFDB1DE5B80"/>whom it is probable he hath no acquaintance with at all; but that he muſt have formed his notions of all, from his knowledge of one particular ſect; and becauſe they are all clothed in black, have concluded them all together the children of darkneſs. This is acting ſtrangely indeed! as if a ſtatuary, who was ordered to make a moſt delicate reſemblance of an <hi>Adonis,</hi> or a <hi>Ganymede,</hi> according to the beſt Ideas of their beauty he could form by the livelieſt deſcriptions of the poets, ſhould, in order to avoid the trouble of ſearching, or for any other cauſe, (it matters not what) immediately turn to Homer, and chizel out an Image of Therſites. 'Tis as if a painter ſhould ſet Otway's Witch before him, while he was drawing a portrait of a Venus, or a Hellen. Theſe are the concluſions, I ſay, that people who do not think with us, will be apt to form, and which it's too evident the Worthies above-mentioned either intended to ſuggeſt, and ſo are falſe brethren, or elſe they ſpoke at random, and therefore are not properly qualified for the office which they have aſſumed, viz. That of defenders general of the faith, which is one word more than his majeſty himſelf claims in his title, and which, when taken in this Senſe, viz. The faith of independents, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent faith, or faith on which there is no dependence; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a much ſtronger advocacy than they (ſweet babes!) are able to afford it.</p>
            <p>This is one inſtance either of treachery or want of prudence. Another is, that they,—I ſay they, for I doubt not that what one aſſerts, the other will ſwear to—did publickly accuſe a convention of Epiſcopalians, of writing a number of petitions to ſome of the moſt reſpectable perſonages in England, in order to have a biſhop appointed for America;—which application, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent as I avow myſelf, I cannot in my conſcience either blame them for making, or think that their requeſt ought not to be granted;—and alſo of ſaying ſundry things therein to the diſadvantage of diſſenters.—With reſpect to the former part of this accuſation, my ſentiments are as above: With regard to the latter, our defenders,—(would not protectors, think you, Mr. Tickle, be a more ſignificant term?)—have produced no evidence to ſupport their charge. If they had evidence, why did they not produce it! If they had no evidence, and it was all poetical imagination, or, what they thought, probable conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,—and why they did think it probable becometh not me to ſay,—why did they bring the accuſation ſo openly? unleſs it were purpoſely done to betray our cauſe, and give the enemy an advantage over us. For a calumny unſupported, will for ever recoil upon the head of the propagator. The public will

            <p>The Whig, and the Centinel, of all men, ought to be deep politicians: But they ſeem to be perfectly deſtitute of every qualification, ſave one,—and that one is not Chicanery,— which helps to form that modern character. Nothing could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their inabilities in this reſpect, ſo much, as their endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to repreſent the church of England in the light of a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting church. Who could not have foreſeen,—that could ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his noſe,—that this repreſentation would put men upon making compariſons; which, in this caſe more eſpecially, are odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as they can only turn out to the advantage of the church, and the real mortification of us and our Zion.</p>
            <p>How impolitic was it likewiſe, both in the Whig and Centinel, to cry out for the liberty of Britiſh ſubjects, at the ſame time they are oppoſing that liberty, and endeavouring with all their might to preclude a great,—was it conſiſtent with my profeſſion, I would add a good—part of thoſe ſame Britiſh ſubjects in America, from the enjoyment of that liberty; I mean the moſt valuable branch of it, even in their own profeſſion, the liberty of religion; wherewith I always was wont to think that Chriſt had made them, as well as ourſelves, free? every reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature muſt at length perceive—whatever miſts are raiſed to perplex and bewilder the unthinking traveller in his journey thro' the mazes of controverſy,—that the liberty of Britiſh ſubjects, neceſſarily ſuppoſes, that thoſe ſubjects have a right, if they chooſe the enjoyment of it, to biſhops, with all the powers they are poſſeſſed of in Britain? But if the biſhops that are prayed for, are to be veſted with no civil power, who does not ſee that it would be manifeſt injuſtice, a moſt palpable infringement of every thing that is right and reaſonable, to impede their arrival? And if Biſhops are an obſtruction to the liberty of Diſſenters in England, by reaſon of the civil powers wherewith they are there inveſted; who can be ſo perverſe as not to acknowledge, that, upon the plan of the appeal, the Diſſenters in this country would not have any cauſe of complaint; becauſe none of our liberties could thereby be poſſibly affected? Nay, I might aſk farther, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſome complaints of our brethren in England, be founded in juſtice, would it not be unjuſtifiable in us to depreſs our fellow-ſubjects in this part of the world, with ſimilar hardſhips, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome burthens continue there unremoved, which the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men here cannot poſſibly be ſuppoſed to have had any hand in impoſing? Suppoſe the parliament ſhould grant theſe men their requeſt, which is, that they may have the rights of Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and ſhould moreover ſend biſhops to America, with all the
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:010857_0141_0F851EFE64623968"/>powers, civil and eccleſiaſtical, which they enjoy in Britain; is it not plain that this would be Britiſh liberty? But if the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal party make no ſuch requeſt, and only aſk for biſhops to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and govern the clergy, ſhould not we be more ready, on our own principles, to aſſiſt, than to obſtruct, ſo reaſonable, ſo neceſſary, and ſo modeſt a deſign? May they not fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we are, in heart, enemies to that religious Freedom, which our tongues ſo juſtly extol, if we continue any longer to obſtruct its eſtabliſhment?</p>
            <p>As for the doctor above-mentioned, he has acted altogether beneath the character of an honeſt man: and has thus laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf open to ſo much cenſure and reproof, that whatever he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances for the future, muſt rather diſſerve than promote our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. His intentions in ſo doing are beſt known to himſelf; but the conſequences are not to be avoided.</p>
            <p>Out of the many falſhoods he has publiſhed, I ſhall at this time, ſelect but one, which is this; that all the candidates for holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the church of England, have the expences of their voyage home, paid by the ſociety, &amp;c. The ſociety, as I and every one elſe can ſee, publiſh every year an exact account of the monies they receive, and of the purpoſes to which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. If he can produce one inſtance, wherein the expences at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the voyage of any one candidate for orders, have been defrayed in the manner he mentions, it is more than I have ever ſeen; and I think, from my ſcrupulous inſpection into the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's abſtracts. I may venture to affirm that none is to be found. Let the candid therefore, of all denominations, judge (for in ſpite of the doctor, and all our other advocates, they will judge for themſelves,) what ſpirit it was that dictated ſo infamous an aſſertion.</p>
            <p>The doctor, too ſurely, in this inſtance has endeavoured to impoſe wretchedly upon the public. If he did it wickedly, (which I muſt not ſuppoſe) he is an improper inſtrument to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs; if he did it weakly, (which I cannot ſuppoſe, as information was ſo eaſily to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) he has proved (as the Whig and Centinel, have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,) that his abilities are not equal to the taſk which he has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and therefore, that our cauſe can hope for no advantages from his feeble efforts to ſupport it. In ſhort, if he has nothing better to ſay, than what he has already advanced, every man who wiſhes well either to himſelf or his neighbour, will deſire him to put his hand upon his mouth, and ſay nothing. If this will not prevent him from injuring both our own cauſe, and the general cauſe of religion, he is hereby interdicted from any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>WHEN a writer indulges himſelf in round aſſertions, as the baſis of any ſcheme, his abilities muſt indeed be ſlender if the ſuper ſtructure is not, at leaſt, unblemiſhed with thoſe groſs irregularities, which at firſt view offend the eye of the underſtanding. It is upon a foundation of this ſort, that Doctor Chandler builds one of his moſt cogent arguments, in favour of his darling epiſcopate, to induce thoſe, whom he calls "The guardians of our national intereſts" to adopt his plan; and leſt "they ſhould be inſenſible to motives" of "a religious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he thought it prudent to aſſail them with political conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. But theſe, he muſt confeſs, can have little weight, unleſs they derive it from the aſſertion, <q>that the church of England, in its external polity, is ſo happily connected, and interwoven with the civil conſtitution, that each mutually ſupports, and is ſupported by the other.</q> A curious picture this, were it juſt, of the blind leading the blind! it is, however, a ſignal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of condeſcenſion, in ſo brave a champion for the hierarchy, to admit, that it is in any wiſe ſupported by the ſtate. What prodigious effects will a change in government have, upon men's private opinions! Thoſe of the doctor's kidney would have ſcorned ſo degrading a ſtoop, before the ſubmiſſion of the clergy, and the ſtatute that declared king H. 8, the ſupreme head of the Anglican church. But inſtead of amuſing the attention of my readers, with reflections on thoſe leſſions of humility, which haughty ecleſiaſtics are frequently obliged to read to themſelves, ſince the expulſion of papal authority, I ſhall proceed to queſtion the truth of the aſſertion, by the omnipotence of which, ſo much execution is expected to be done in the field of polities.</p>
               <p>That the church of England is connected and interwoven with the civil conſtitution of the Britiſh empire, as far as it reſpects Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:010857_0142_0F851EFF2A8CD280"/>Ireland, the principality of Wales, and the town of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick upon Tweed, cannot be denied: That it has not the leaſt relation to that conſtitution, as it concerns Scotland, and the colonies in general, is equally true; but that its connection with the civil conſtitution in England, is either happy for the ſtate, tho' it certainly is for the church according to Doctor Chandler's ſenſe of the word, or ſupports it, tho' it is indeed ſupported by the ſtate, is a poſition, which every ſound whig is bound to deny. The ſubject of enquiry, therefore in this paper, will be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that part of the Britiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pire, to which the church of England extends, or the colonies, in which the Doctor would erect his qualified epiſcopacy, can derive happineſs, or the ſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſupport from either. If we look into the hiſtory of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, before the abolition of the papacy, we ſhall find, that the church was ever inimical to the ſtate. The Pope not only claimed, but, as often as he could, exerciſed a ſupremacy over both; ſometimes excommunicating the king, and diſcharging his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from the bond of allegiance; at other times, laying the whole realm under an interdict;—anon diſpoſing of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by his apoſtlic authority, to any foreigner who would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the conqueſt of it; perpetually draining it of its wealth, by the unrighteous levy of Peter-Pence, and the continual exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of annates, or firſt fruits, and other eccleſiaſtical impoſts; convoking all ſpiritual cauſes, in their laſt remove, before the vatican; preſiding, by his legate, at the ſynods and convocations of the Engliſh clergy; diſpoſing of vacant ſees to foreigners, who in right of their temporalities, and with hearts alienated from the ſtate, took their ſeats in parliament; and not only had great weight in council; but, in ſome inſtances, bore the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſway in the political movements of the ſtate: While, to crown the power and independency of the Hierarchy, holy church, was, by magna charta, declared to be free; and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this freedom, to ſo high a pitch, as not only to make her ſpiritual courts a terror to all the king's ſubjects, but even to claim a conſtitutional exemption from civil juriſdiction, in the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the moſt flagitious crimes. That this is a juſt picture of holy church, as ſhe was formerly connected and interwoven with the ſtate, is unqueſtionably verified, by hiſtorical evidence. It is indeed too juſt and ſtriking a deſcription, of the outlines of her external polity, to be diſowned by any ſon of the church. Such was the indulgent mother, before the reformation. But who does not ſee, that this external polity, ſo far from being friendly to monarchy, was a bitter enemy to all government? Could the chief magiſtrate, under any form of civil rule whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, be ſecure in his ſeat? Could he guard the nation againſt
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:010857_0142_0F851EFF2A8CD280"/>foreign attempts, or protect it againſt internal convulſions, while ſo much power was attached to the church, which was ſo wholly at the diſpoſal of the Pope? It was utterly impoſſible. Inſtead of exalting our idea of the monarch, it actually debaſed him; ſo far debaſed him, as in one inſtance to exhibit majeſty itſelf, acting the groveling character of a groom, to an inſolent eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic. Inſtead of giving us ſecurity and ſtrength againſt our enemies, it expoſed the kingdom to become their ſpoil, by colour of a pontifical bull; it opened a ſluice for draining the nation of its wealth, the principal ſinew of national power; it expoſed the wholeſome Engliſh conſtitution, to fatal changes, by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of foreigners, in the legiſlature, in the courts of juſtice, and in the council of ſtate; it armed the ſubject againſt his Prince; In ſhort, it was the moſt deadly adverſary to the public weal, even had England been an abſolute monarchy. And yet the church was as much, and how happily let the reader judge, connected and interwoven with the ſtate, before, as it ever has been ſince the reformation.</p>
               <p>We are next to enquire, what mighty changes have been wrought, at or ſince that memorable event, which could poſſibly render that connection more happy to the ſtate, than in times of popery. In this reſearch, it will be juſt to confine our attention, merely to the external polity, without regard to the internal changes in doctrine, diſcipline and worſhip, which the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gradually, and in ſeveral ſucceſſive reigns, effected in the Anglican church. Before this Aera, the Biſhop of Rome was its ſupreme head on earth. By the reformation his holineſs was dethroned; and whom the clergy of England made ſubmiſſion, how free and unconſtrained let hiſtory declare: All dependance on or connection with the pontifical ſee, was abſolutely and total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſcinded. The king, by another act, was made the fountain of all the benefices of the ſuperior clergy; the meer form, only, of election, being reſerved to the Dean and Chapter, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in favour of thoſe, whom his Majeſty, by his letters miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſhould appoint. The clergy were alſo rendered reſponſible in criminal matters, before the king's temporal courts of juſtice, but continued in the exerciſe of their juriſdiction, over the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in the eccleſiaſtical courts. The monaſtic prieſthood was, by other legiſlative proviſions, laid low in the duſt; the abbies and monaſteries were diſſolved; and their temporalities yeſted in the crown, to be diſpoſed of for the endowment of ſchools, and other charitable and religious uſes: And by this means, twenty-ſeven lazy Abbots were turned out of parliament; and in their ſtead, fix new biſhopricks were erected by the king, in virtue of an
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:010857_0143_0F851EFFDE870488"/>act of legiſlation. The prelates, however, remained poſſeſſed of their ſeats in parliament. The convocation of the clergy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, as before the reformation; and ſtill conſtitutionally ſubſiſts, tho' the wiſdom and lenity of the Hanover family forbids the exerciſe of their dreadful power, by reſtraining them from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to buſineſs; and the juriſdiction of the eccleſiaſtical courts, ſave only in a ſew caſes, is yet entire. This, I believe, is a juſt repreſentation of the preſent external polity of the Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can church, as far as reſpects the ſuperior clergy. It therefore follows, that if the ſtate derives happineſs and ſupport from the church, or if the civil conſtitution harmonizes with it, this happineſs, this ſupport, this harmony muſt be evinced, in one or more of the following particulars. Firſt; that the king is by law, the ſupreme head of the Anglican church. Secondly; that he has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of all the ſpiritual lords in the realm. Thirdly; that thoſe lords make a part of the legiſlature of Great-Britain. Fourthly; that they are authorized to hold ſpiritual courts in England, for puniſhing offenders,—againſt the eccleſiaſtical law. Fifthly; that the king has authority to ſummon the convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and to permit them to make canons; to which, as well as to all others now in ſorce, all the inhabitants of South-Britain are bound, under temporal penalties, to ſay yea and amen. When I conſider the Doctor's aſſertions, I am in charity, and to avoid a more ſevere imputation, obliged to doubt his acquaintance with the Engliſh conſtitution. For I verily am at a loſs, upon comparing it with the external polity of the Anglican church, to diſcover in what particulars, his boaſted reciprocation of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſupport, and harmony conſiſts. It is evident that the King not only is the ſupreme, but the abſolute monarch of the church. And is his authority ſo uncontroulable in the ſtate? It is as clear, that the people have not the leaſt ſhare, in the conſtruction of eccleſiaſtical laws; but who is ignorant, that in temporal legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they have a principal and eſſential agency? In the church, the upper houſe of convocation, from the nature of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, are real ſlaves to the crown; the lower houſe are their mere dependant creatures. In the ſtate, the temporal lords have a noble hereditary independency, the commons are ſervants during good behaviour to the people. In the church, the judges are as ſubſervient as the legiſlators: In the ſtate, the oracles of the law hold their offices, by the freeſt tenure, during good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſingular bleſſing of which, while our fellow ſubjects in England and Ireland are in the full enjoyment of it, the coloniſts by an odious deſparity are deprived.</note> Or ſhould they both be thought to hang upon the
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:010857_0143_0F851EFFDE870488"/>favour of the crown, with an eye to promotion, the eccleſiaſtical judges are makers and pronouncers of the law, and triers of the facts; but the temporal judges are only ſpeakers, of what inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of their authority is eſtabliſhed law, while the people determine facts. In ſhort, none are ſo blindly ignorant, unleſs the Doctor ſhould be ſo, as not to ſee, that if our conſtitution is a monarchy, it differs widely from all other monarchical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world. It is a monarchy, two of the grand ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients in which, are, that the people, in the common law courts, are abſolute judges of facts, upon which the law muſt neceſſarily ariſe, either pro or con, as the facts are found; and that in legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, they have two voices in three. But do we diſcover the leaſt reſemblance of thoſe popular rights, in the church? Do we behold the laity ſitting either in the ſeat of the law-giver or in judgment?—Not at all; in things ſo ſacred they may not intermeddle; <hi>odi profanum vulgus et arceo.</hi> If they feel the powers of the one, or the other, it is not by participating in the exertions of either, but by ſubmitting to the weight of both; as the aſs that beareth the burden. But the temporal powers of the ſuperior clergy ſhew, in a ſtriking point of light, how little har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, at leaſt in theory, ſubſiſts between the eccleſiaſtical and political ſtate of England. The right of the ſpiritual lords to ſit in parliament, which the advocates for the church have ever, and with a good deal of reaſon, eſteemed a ſpiritual right, is, by the true friends of liberty, regarded with as jealous an eye, as are the borough repreſentations, in the houſe of commons. This right of the clergy, is a real deformity in the conſtitution; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travenes the very principles, on which the Britiſh parliament is built. The ſeveral parts of that auguſt body, as conſiſting of three eſtates, ought legally and abſolutely to be independent, in the exerciſe of authority, each of the other: And yet, in the houſe of Peers, there are no leſs than twenty-ſix unapoſtolical eccleſiaſtical lords, ever regarded by their lay-fellows, with a mixture of diſguſt and contempt; ever dependant on the will of the Prince; for who is not fond of promotion? and too often ready, not only to countenance, but execute court meaſures, as hiſtory abundantly ſhews. While every other perſon in that great and moſt illuſtrious aſſembly, is at leaſt conſtitutionally free. Nay, ſo very odd and unnatural is this connection, that, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Doctor is ſingular in his opinion, that it is productive of felicity, or gives ſtrength to the ſtate. The great diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the conſtitutions of ſtate and church, pardon me good Doctor, for the irreverent tranſpoſition, affords not, indeed, the leaſt poſſibility of a mutual interchange of happineſs, ſupport, or harmony. For how can blind ſubmiſſion and obedience in the
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:010857_0144_0F851F00FAB93FB8"/>church, accord with Engliſh liberty in the ſtate? How can that form of eccleſiaſtical government, which either actually or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually lodges all authority in the hands of one perſon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the multitude from all participation, in framing and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the laws, be ſaid to be happily connected, and harmonize with, or to have the leaſt tendency to ſupport, that form of civil government, under which the ſubject has a neceſſary agency, in legiſlative and diſtributive juſtice? The Doctor ſhould have honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in plain terms, ſpoke what he really meant; that the hierachy, of which the Prince is the ſupreme and abſolute head. is moſt happily calculated to indoctrinate the laity, in paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and non-reſiſtance, to an abſolute monarch in the ſtate. The truth of this aſſertion would, at leaſt, have been admitted. Yet, why ſhould an American preſs, groan under the weight of this doctrine? Are we not all free? Or are we indeed bond ſlaves, ſold under the power of tyrannic ſway? God forbid the thoughts! We have a Prince and a conſtitution, friendly to liberty; why then, ſuch a more than inſinuated addreſs, to thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with out public affairs? I confeſs the Doctor does not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that <q>Epiſcopacy and abſolute monarchy are in their frame, beſt ſuited to each other.</q> Thus, however, he ought to have ſpoke; or been ſilent. They are truly twin ſiſters, the genuine offspring of certain parents, equally known and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by every lover of liberty. But by his mealy-mouthed, mincing omiſſion of the word abſolute, which, nevertheleſs, is left to be underſtood, by all connoiſſeurs in the art of unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſway, he intended to gild the pill; to make it gain an eaſy paſſage into American ſtomachs. Nor can he eſcape with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that by monarchy unepithetized, he intended monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in general. For in this view, his doctrine is notoriouſly falſe. It includes all mixed, as well as abſolute monarchies. But is it not evident, that abſolute ſupremacy in the church, and the rights of a free people under a mixed monarchy, form when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be pronounced, in union, a moſt jarring diſcordant ſound? Or ſhould this be his argument, that as the <q>Engliſh hierachy and abſolute monarchy are in their frame and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, beſt ſuited to each other,</q> ſo a qualified hierachy, in which the biſhop ſhould have no other powers than thoſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining and governing the clergy, and confirming the baptiſed, "exactly harmonizes" with our mixed monarchy, let him beware of its conſequences. If it ſhould have ſtrength, ſufficient to rear his beloved idol in America, its power may poſſibly be felt, in the demolition of that more towering idol, beyond the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic, to make room for the erection of another, that will more "exactly harmonize," with the mixed monarchy of the Britiſh
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:010857_0144_0F851F00FAB93FB8"/>empire; an hierachy, in which tho' one ſhall preſide, for the ſake of order, yet the whole church, including laity and clergy ſhall give laws and execute juſtice in ſpiritualities. Such an hierachy would indeed bear ſome faint reſemblance to Epiſcopacy, ſuch as it was in the early ages of the church.</p>
               <p>But to examine the Doctor's mode of reaſoning a little farther; it is plain, that by his ſcheme of a qualified epiſcopacy, the laity are, by no means, to be affected. <q>The diſcipline of the church, ſo far as it relates to the private members, will be left as it is; and nothing further will be done, than refuſing the communion to diſorderly and ſcandalous perſons; which every clergymen may now refuſe.</q> And is this all? If ſo, how is our reliſh for a mixed monarchy to be heightened, and improved, by this ſcheme? The Non-Epiſcopal clergy, and the laity of all denominations, are not to feel the weight of Epiſcopal authority. This, it ſeems, is reſerved for the correction of the more ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable clergy of the church. All other eccleſiaſtics are to do as they liſt; and the people of all perſuaſions are to be left to the guidance of their reſpective Preſbyters, in the exerciſe of their authority to exclude from the ſacrament. This indeed ſavours of Preſbyterianiſm. <hi>Expellas naturam ſurea taemen uſque recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi> The prejudices of education, either really exert themſelves at times, or our reverend author knows, if he knows nothing elſe, how to effect political qualms. But in the mean time, it remains a glaring truth, that, however unqueſtionable the aſſertion may be, that <q>our civil rulers have always conſidered Epiſcopacy, as the ſureſt friend to monarchy,</q> the Doctor's plan of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, is not in the leaſt calculated, to merit, on that account, the peculiar attention of <q>thoſe who are entruſted with our public concerns.</q>
               </p>
               <p>My readers are, I flatter myſelf, now convinced, if they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch conviction before, that the church of England is not ſo <q>happily connected, and interwoven with the civil conſtitution, that each mutually ſupports, and is ſupported by the other; that their harmony</q> exiſts no where, ſave only in the elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate appeal; and that Doctor Chandler's plan, of an American Epiſcopate, bears not the leaſt ſhadow of a reſemblance, to the beautiful form of our civil conſtitution; for which he admits many, and were he diſpoſed to ſpeak the whole truth, he ſhould have ſaid, all <q>the Britiſh ſubjects, both at home and in the plantations, who reject Epiſcopacy, are warm,</q> nay the warmeſt, "advocates." On the other hand, he can expect little countenance from our civil rulers. They neither deſire, it is to be hoped, to enamourate us with abſolute monarchy; nor are ſo incompetent, as not to reject his plan of Epiſcopacy, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate

               <p>NO leſs than two queſtions concerning one of the Whig's correſpondents have been diſputed, it ſeems, in ſeveral companies; and Squire T. (No. VI. par. 1.) gives the church of England the credit of—the <hi>diſputation!</hi> From the preſum'd character of the judges, and eſpecially from Squire T's. very grammatical conſtruction, a perſon of common ſenſe would conclude the 2d queſtion (as well as the 1ſt) was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the negative; but Squire T. aſſures us it was decided in the <hi>affirmative.</hi> What can he mean? ſays one. Alaſs! reader, common folks (like you and I) muſt not expect to underſtand ſo myſtical a logician as Squire T. who, (to his credit be it ſpoken) can

Whether his manoevre be his, Printers manoeuvre, is a queſtion I ſhall not decide; but, if ſeveral companies ſhould diſpute it, the diſputation might probably be ſpoken of much to the credit of the church of England.</p>
               <p>Par. 2d. Squire T. ſeems to ſuppoſe the American church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, would be glad to ſee the church in <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a figleaf to cover her &amp;c. How that may be, I know not; but Squire T. (who knows the original uſe of fig-leaves) ſeems apprehenſive, as well as I, that (in that caſe) the poor church's nakedneſs would be expoſed, and ſome of my politico-anatomical friends are ſo cenſorious, as to think, ſhe would appear to be a—</p>

The Tennis Ball which Squire T. ſtrikes, (par. 3d,) he has ſo often, with ſuch a racket and in ſuch a fruſtration, bandied about before, that I ſhall not interrupt him; but let him play with it till he has tir'd himſelf. I ſhall however juſt obſerve to this accurate gentleman, that it is a diſtinction, (and not a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm upon a diſtinction,) which he takes ſuch important notice of in par. 4th.—Yet I muſt needs ſay, his own phraſeology ('a church of England in America-man") is really vaſtly pretty.</p>
               <p>As I have no great fondneſs for interfering in a diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two church of England in America-men, I ſhall paſs over the ſeven following very learned in the law paragraphs, by only obſerving, that they had all appeared unneceſſary, had Squire: T. ſufficiently attended to what he advances in the 8th, with a ſmall addition I beg leave to make, viz. 'that the preſent queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, what rights the Engliſh biſhops have had, or now have, but what authority American biſhops will have, when they are appointed? and what authority they will naturally claim when they are eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Par. 12th, Squire T. ſeems to undertake to ſettle, (what he calls) the capital point, 'whether the church of England is eſtabliſhed in the colonies?' Some are ſo ſilly as to think this queſtion admits of no diſpute; however they think, Mr. Hobart, the Independant Reflector, and others, have firmly enough ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled it in the negative. Ah! but thoſe were hireling, republican, deiſtical writers. Well then! <hi>Quid dignum tanto tulit</hi> hic <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſor hiatu?</hi> What ſays Squire T? Nothing but IF—if it is— and if it is not. 'If it is not, all this clamour againſt ſpiritual courts—is groundleſs and impertinent;' but 'if it is,—an act for the erection of an American Epiſcopate, may be by its friends obtained without much difficulty." Truly, Squire T. this is a dry indigeſtible cruſt indeed!</p>
               <p>I deſigned to have truſs'd up another bird on this ſpit, but it unfortunately happens to be a rank bird of prey, likely to prove nauſeous to nice palates, and indigeſtible, but by ſtrong ſtomachs; I ſhall therefore hereafter roaſt it by itſelf, when, if my gueſts can dine upon it, they ſhall be heartily welcome. In the mean time, I ſhall, for a deſert, ſet before them a little knick-knack, juſt now ſent me as a preſent.</p>

            <p>THE readineſs, with which you publiſhed the letters, I ſent you, emboldens me to offer ſome farther thoughts on the ſubject. I have endeavoured to ſhew that the church or rather every church in America has a right in itſelf to provide for its own diſcipline and government, that if civil laws are neceſſary for the ſupport of its clergy, or for the regulation of its members, they ought to be made by the legiſlatures of the reſpective colonies; and therefore that any application to the parliament of Britain, or any power on earth, other than the legiſlatures of the colonies, to eſtabliſh any ſect or denomination of Chriſtians in his majeſty's American colonies, is an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the rights of the people, and as ſuch ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. I ſhall now conſider what it is, that Doctor Chandler and the applicants petition for, and hope to convince you, that it is not a miniſter of Chriſt, a publiſher of the goſpel, nor an officer of the Chriſtian church, but a dangerous engine of ſtate. This will appear if we conſider for what purpoſes he is wanted with what powers he is to be inveſted, and in what manner he is to exerciſe thoſe powers.</p>
            <p>The liberty of America has ever been a matter of envy to the bigots and high flyers, as well as to the favourers and abettors of arbitrary power in England. Inſtances of this might be given, from the times of Laud, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>oft down to the time of thoſe venerable biſhops, who with one accord entered their

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>warm proteſt againſt the repeal of the American ſtamp act.—And it might eaſily be ſhewn, that whenever attempts have been made at home to increaſe the power of the crown, or ſubvert the Britiſh conſtitution and the liberties of the people; the liberty of America has at the ſame time been invaded. Nor is this to be wondered at; for while America remains a ſacred aſylum, ſhe ſhackles of ſlavery cannot well be fixed upon Britons, nor can eccleſiaſtical tyrants exerciſe arbitrary ſway.</p>
            <p>But what is particularly worthy of obſervation is, that every attempt upon American liberty, has always been accompanied with endeavours to ſettle biſhops among us. Thus in the reign of Charles I. when Laud attempted to ſubjugate the colonies, then in their infancy, he was not content with contriving to cramp their trade by fooliſh proclamations:<note n="*" place="bottom">

The unſettled ſtate of the nation after the acceſſion of George I. gave the enemies of that prince and of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſome faint hopes of accompliſhing their deſign; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the year 1714, while the ſpirit of rebellion was kindling into a flame, and the friends of Popery and the pretender were forming their party and preparing to overturn the government, and the religion of their country, the ſame reſtleſs ſpirits, who in the laſt reign had laboured to get biſhops eſtabliſhed in America, 'renewed their attempt, and made one vigorous effort to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh' what they call their 'grand affair.' But (thanks to the great over-ruler of events) the deſigns of both 'proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.' The rebellion was quaſhed, and the ſcheme of an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican epiſcopate dropt of courſe: Some perſons however ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to keep ſight of the great object, and as they are always watching for ſeaſonable opportunities of exerting themſelves to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it," we find it reſumed with great warmth not long before the rebellion in 1745.</p>
            <p>With what views a biſhop is ſo earneſtly deſired for America, and for what purpoſes he is ſent, we are now to enquire. 'His

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>'authority,' we are told, 'ſhall operate only on the clergy of the Church and 'not on the laity.' The biſhop ſpoken of in the New-Teſtament is ordered to feed the flock, and take care of the church of God. But the American biſhop is to exerciſe no authority over the laity or private members of the church, over which he preſides. His buſineſs is to 'ordain, unite,' ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and govern the clergy.<note n="‡" place="bottom">A confirmation is alſo mentioned as one of the important of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of a biſhop, and great ſtreſs ſeems to be laid on it, by Doctor C. But how high ſoever the popiſh church and its adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may rate confirmation, and the uninterrupted ſucceſſion, the Doctor ought to know, that the church of England, of which he profeſſes himſelf a member, conſiders them in no very favourable light. <q>

And yet he is to <q>have power to ſuſpend any clergyman, to deprive him of his benefice and not only ſilence and depoſe him but excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him from the ſociety of Chriſtians.</q>

This Doctor C. aſſures us is 'the plan of the American epiſcopate, and that he does not know of a ſingle inſtance wherein reaſon has been given to ſuſpect a departure from it.</q> How well this plan was calculated to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the views of a Laud, who wants to introduce arbitrary government into church and ſtate, is eaſy to ſee: Nor will it be difficult to reconcile it with the ſchemes of thoſe, who laboured to introduce Popery and the Pretender.</p>
            <p>But to add to the weight and importance of theſe biſhops, and the better to enable them to promote the deſigns of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, a hint is given that 'the government may hereafter ſee fit to inveſt them with ſome degree of civil power, worthy of their acceptance;' that as 'a clergyman may be made a juſtice of the peace or a judge of the quorum; ſo biſhops may be inveſted with a proportionable degree of civil authority;<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="283"
                   facs="unknown:010857_0147_0F851F02E2A2B300"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>require, is, that the legiſlative and execute power be placed in the hands of ſuch perſons as are poſſeſſed of the greateſt abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, integrity and prudence; and it is hoped, ſays Dr. C. biſhops will always be thought to deſerve this character.'</p>
            <p>Let us now conſider what a dangerous engine of ſtate this might be in the hands of an enterpriſing and ill-minded miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Where a man's private intereſt is united with the intereſt of his country, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, he will heartily wiſh that country may thrive, and will extert himſelf in ſupport and deſence of its liberty; but this is not the caſe with thoſe who are ſent from another part of the world, to be employed in places of profit and power: Becauſe they can bear no affection to the place where they ſojourn; their ſole buſineſs being to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by following the directions of their principals: Neither will it be the caſe with thoſe who are taken into offices, although natives of the land, becauſe they are greater gainers while they keep their offices, than they can be by promoting and defending the intereſt of their country.</p>
            <p>The people of America are to have no concern in the election of this biſhop, over his actions they have no controul. The clergy as they will hold their livings at his pleaſure, muſt pay the ſame implicit obedience to his commands, which he himſelf will always pay to the miniſter of ſtate, whoſe creature he is, and on whom his hopes of preferment depend.</p>
            <p>I cannot therefore wonder if the adminiſtration of a B—e or a G—e is diſtinguiſhed with an attempt to introduce an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican epiſcopate.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Dr. I am perſuaded, had good reaſons for his general opinion; but I apprehend him to have been miſtaken in one circumſtance, as he ſeems not to have imagined that the number of 'hot-headed writers' againſt the propoſed epiſcopate would be ſo conſiderable as now appears—and I will not affirm but he may have been alſo miſtaken as to the real number of <q>prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical enthuſiaſts</q> in this country.

            <p>Now upon this paſſage the queſtion ariſes, whether the author of the appeal has here ſaid any thing that cannot be juſtified on the common principles of truth and candour? No ſmall number of 'artful men' have been for ſeveral months, employed in raiſing objections againſt American biſhops; and it is ſubmitted to the judgment of every candid and intelligent perſon, whether they have yet produced any new objections, but ſuch as are perhaps, ſome ſmall proof of the 'dexterity,' but which are in reality, a much greater proof of the ill-will of the 'inventors?' Has it not been the ſtudy of the American Whig, and his confederates, to 'raiſe objections and difficulties in the plaineſt caſes?' Have they not been ſounding a falſe alarm, and aiming to terrify peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with imaginary dangers? Have they not trifled with, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, the patience of the public to that degree, that ſeveral of their quondam friends have deſerted them, and others are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them? In ſhort, have they not 'employed their talents' in ſuch a manner, as to have rendered themſelves <q>as unworthy of the public attention, as the child that engages in crambo, or puſh-pin?</q>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
The author of the appeal is accuſed of thundering out <q>cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal anathema's' againſt his opponents, and of ſaying, that whoever employs his talents in this exerciſe,</q> that is, gentle reader, ſays the Whig. of offering any objections to his darling epiſcopate, <q>is as unworthy of the public attention, as the child that engages at crambo or puſh-pin,</q> the whole paſſage of the appeal, upon which the accuſation is founded, is inſerted above, and every reader can judge for himſelf, whether the author ſays any ſuch thing as he is here made to ſay—or thunders out any ſuch anathema's as he is made to thunder. He is evidently there conſidering, not objectors in general, but one ſpecies of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors, namely, 'cavillers and ſophiſts,' who by their 'legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main' or the tricks of their art, <q>make any thing appear to be an argument againſt any thing,</q> to the ignorant and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced. As to open and fair objectors, Dr. Chandler al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſpeaks of them decently and properly, and has declared his readineſs to treat them with due reſpect. So that the Whig's repreſentation of him is deceitful and falſe; it is a prepenſely malicious attempt to impoſe upon the good-nature and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the reader, and merits the reſentment of every lover of truth and ſincerity. He that deceives another, or attempts to deceive him, is no better than a liar; and he that attempts it publickly, is a public liar, and as ſuch ſhould be treated. A man had better play at 'crambò or puſh-pin' to eternity, than engage in ſuch practices. And ſo much for puſh-pin.</p>
            <p>The author of the appeal had ſaid, that he knew of no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic clamour that had ever been made in this country upon the proſpect of an American epiſcopate, and that he did not ſoreſee that any would be made. The American Whig al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ows, that perhaps it may have been ſo—that Dr. Chandler had neither heard of any, nor did foreſee any. But now, in his turn, he makes his appeal to the Doctor. <q>whether ſince the publication of his appeal, a very general uneaſineſs is not viſible among the people; and a general popular oppoſition expreſſed againſt his epiſcopal project, among all ranks of men, as they become daily more diffuſively acquainted with the reality of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</q> The Dr. will himſelf reply to this appeal, if he thinks it deſerves a reply, in due time; in the mean while, if I may be allowed to make ſo free with his property, I will offer a few words upon it. If by, 'ſince the publication of the appeal' is meant from the time of its publication, my anſwer to the queſtion muſt be in the negative. It is well known, that the appeal was publiſhed many months before there was any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of uneaſineſs on the account of it; nay, ſo far from it, that it was read by many of the diſſenters, who declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:010857_0149_0F851F0775ED4470"/>perfectly eaſy and ſatisfied, with regard to the plan, and thought it liable to no reaſonable objections.</p>
            <p>But is not 'a very general Uneaſineſs' now <q>viſible among the people?</q> I anſwer again in the negative. What is viſible is this, that ſome factious writers have endeavoured to create a 'general uneaſineſs among the people.' and have ſpared no pains, and neglected no arts, that were likely to effect it. Some ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs they have undoubtedly had, but in my opinion, far ſhort of what is pretended. The late election in this, and a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing province, has clearly evinced, that, in the ſeveral coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties where the matter was put to the trial, the majority of the people were free from the 'Uneaſineſs,' and 'very generally' expreſſed their contempt of the low and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous methods that were uſed to deceive them. And I will venture to prophecy, that 'among all ranks of men, as they daily 'become more diffuſively acquainted with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eality of the 'deſign,' the more it will be approved. The Whig, I believe has ſeen his beſt days, people for a while, were diverted with the caperings and twiſting of ſuch a ſcaramouch, but theſe things will not always entertain.</p>
            <p>The American Whig pretends, that among the lay-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church, there are not a few <q>zealous opponents of an American epiſcopate.</q> Others can judge of this matter as well as he; and I appeal to every reader, whether he knows of many ſuch perſons. For my part I have never met with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle churchman, to my knowledge, or ſo much as heard of one, who zealouſly oppoſes, or has a diſpoſition to make any oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all to American biſhops, ſince the plan has been publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained; excepting always the Whig's friend, the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can churchman, whoſe good manners, if he ever had any, have been miſerably corrupted by evil communications. Now if by 'not a few' be meant a ſingle perſon, and if the American be in reality a churchman; then indeed it muſt be allowed, that 'not a few' churchmen are <q>zealous opponents of an American epiſcopate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What he ſays of churchmen in Virginia, he offers with unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual diffidence and modeſty; from whence the conſequence is as clear as any in Euclid, that he is deſtitute of evidence to ſupport it. the people of Virginia are ſo diſtant, that neither he nor I can be ſuppoſed to be competent judges of this matter. But Maryland is nearer; and both by perſons and letters from thence, I am well aſſured, that the laity of that province are, in general, moſt impatiently deſirous of an epiſcopate—that they declare themſelves ready to join in a petition for that purpoſe—and willing to do every thing in their power in order to obtain it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="298" facs="unknown:010857_0150_0F851F081EDABE20"/>And I ſee not what ſhould make any great difference between the people of Virginia and Maryland in this reſpect, unleſs the nature of the propoſed epiſcopate has not been ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and conſidered in the former of theſe Provinces. In a word I have yet met with no reaſons for believing, that there is a churchman upon the continent, among the laity, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the ſubject, that has any inclination to oppoſe the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in queſtion, (excepting as before excepted)—or, that there are any clergymen in America, who do not earneſtly deſire it, excepting thoſe only who have reaſon to fear it.</p>
            <p>After a ſly grin at the fate of the late ſtamp-act, our Whig pecks at the foundation of the appeal: But it is in no danger from ſuch efforts. The plan of an American piſcopate was formed by thoſe perſons whoſe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>per buſineſs it was to form it. They well underſtood what they were doing, and needed not the inſtruction of American Whigs. This being the caſe, not 'the baſis of the appeal,' but the baſis of this attack, will <q>be found to be chimerical and abſurd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But <q>is not all the power here contended for, in the hands of the clergy themſelves? Why is the civil government called upon to interpoſe?</q> If this ſagacious gentleman is unable to diſcover the true reaſon of this, I will inform him; and I deſire him to remember, that the clergy of the church of England chooſe to have the approbation of the government in all their proceedings. They alſo think it their duty, not to proceed in an affair of ſuch conſequence, before the nature of the meaſure is explained, and application has been made to the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for their conſent and patronage. They would chooſe alſo to have the approbation of all people, of every denomination, both at home and in the colonies; not forgetting the American Whigs. For this reaſon the plan has been freely ſubmitted to the inſpection of the public, that all perſons may ſee with their own eyes, that nothing is propoſed or intended which can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with their intereſt or happineſs.</p>
            <p>In return for this open, candid and generous conduct, the elergy have been moſt illiberally ſlandered and abuſed. They have been repreſented as ſo many public liars, furious bigots, and enemies to their country. In the very paper now before me, the elegant and polite author of it, charges them with <q>unavowed eccleſiaſtical machinations,</q> and more than inſinuates, <q>that tho' the voice may be Jacob's voice, yet the hands are the hands of Eſau</q>—having thought fit, for reaſons well known to himſelf, to drop his original metaphor of the Sheep and the Wolf.</p>
            <p>In the next paragraph, a ſuppoſition is firſt made of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:010857_0150_0F851F081EDABE20"/>of the plan for an American epiſcopate, in the manner wherein it has been propoſed; and then <q>the inhabitants of South-Britain,</q> (for there are no Engliſhmen nor Scotſmen, ſince the act of union,) are introduced as reflecting and reaſoning upon the matter, at ſuch a rate, as none but American Whigs have ever reaſoned. <q>The Americans, (they are taught to ſay) are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tenacious of their liberty; who have ſucceſsfully oppoſed the introduction of biſhops, as political perſons, dangerous to their civil and religious privileges, &amp;c.</q> In which paſſage it is conceded, that the epiſcopate now in diſpute is the ſame which is ſtated in the appeal, contrary to what this writer has ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:—This epiſcopate is ſuppoſed to be carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under the ſanction of an act of parliament:—The epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate of the appeal is thus eſtabliſhed, in conſequence of the American Whig's ſucceſsful oppoſition to it:—And his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it conſiſted in his oppoſing the introduction of ſuch biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops as the appeal had no concern with.

               <p>AS Dr. Chandler, in his appeal to the publick, has been pleaſed not only to advance reaſons in favour of ſending biſhops to America, but alſo to plead the cauſe of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy itſelf; vainly declaring that he ſhould look upon the ſilence of the diſſenters, with regard to his pamphlet, as a tacit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſtrength of his arguments; I think it my duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by the channel of your paper, to convince the reader of the weakneſs of his reaſoning, and to prove that dioceſan epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy is not of divine original, but merely of human invention.</p>
               <p>The diſpute between the epiſcopalians and preſbyterians is this. The epiſcopalians aſſert that there are different orders of goſpel miniſters, ſuch as biſhops, prieſts, &amp;c. the one ſuperior
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:010857_0151_0F851E314C62CE90"/>in power and authority to the other; and that the right of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining miniſters, is veſted ſolely in the biſhops: The preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, on the contrary affirm, that there ought to be a perfect equality between all the miniſters of the goſpel, and that the right of ordaining to the paſtoral office belongs to the preſbytery, or a collective body of preſbyters. Theſe are the reaſons they advance in favour of their ſentiments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One preſumptive argument againſt epiſcopacy, and in favour of preſbytery, is this; that the firſt reformers, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the errors of popery, rejected with it epiſcopacy, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation introduced into the church of Chriſt, and adopted preſbyterianiſm, or the doctrine of equality amongſt miniſters, as the moſt conſiſtent with goſpel purity and ſimplicity. Calvin in his inſtitutions expreſly declares, <hi>"caeterum quod epiſcopos, et preſbyteres, &amp; paſtores, &amp; miniſtros, promiſcue vocari qui eccleſias regunt, id feci ex ſcripturae uſu quae vocabula iſta con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundit."</hi> i. e. But the reaſon why I have promiſcuouſly called thoſe who rule the church, biſhops, and preſbyters, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and paſtors, is my following the cuſtom of ſcripture, which confounds, or indiſcriminately uſes thoſe words. Indeed had epiſcopacy been of apoſtolic inſtitution, and eſſential to a proper conſtitution of the church of Chriſt, there a thorough reformation of the church from the errors and corruptions of popery would have been morally impoſſible, as the popiſh biſhops were entirely oppoſed to the firſt reformers. And in as much as thoſe firſt reformers were remarkable inſtruments under Chriſt, in purging his church, as they enjoyed a large meaſure of the ſpirit of God, as they were very good and great men, and as they rejected epiſcopacy, we may rationally preſume it was not of divine original.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another preſumptive argument againſt epiſcopacy is this. Almoſt all the preſent churches, except that of England, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it; and even a great part of the Engliſh nation, and thoſe perhaps among the beſt Chriſtians in it, are oppos'd to it. The churches of Holland, Geneva and Scotland, the proteſtants in Germany and France, the diſſenters in England, Ireland and America, are all againſt it. Now if we compare the proteſtant epiſcopalians and preſbyterians together, (I mean thoſe referred to above) we ſhall find that the latter greatly exceed in number; and if we conſider that there have been amongſt the latter, men of as great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>lities, knowledge, learning and virtue, as amongſt the former, which, I think, cannot well be deny'd; we may rationally preſume againſt epiſcopacy, as the majority of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judges have voted againſt it. This argument will be
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:010857_0151_0F851E314C62CE90"/>ſtrengthened if we conſider that the Waldenſes and Albigenſes, thoſe ſtrenuous aſſerters of, and martyrs for the truth, diſavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed epiſcopacy; whilſt the church of Rome at once over-run with error and vice, were the zealous patrons of it. Surely if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Lord is with them that rear him, as the royal pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt teaches; and if an exact conformity to the precepts of the church is the beſt method to obtain the knowledge of his doctrines, as our bleſſed Saviour declares, and if we compare the character of the Waldenſes and Albigenſes, with that of their adverſaries, we may rationally preſume that epiſcopacy is not of divine original.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another preſumptive reaſon againſt dioceſan epiſcopacy, is this. Although it is the form of church government in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and although all the honours, riches and conveniencies of the preſent life, are on its ſide, yet there has been, and ſtill is, a vaſt body of Chriſtian miniſters and Chriſtian people, many of them the brighteſt lights in the nation, who could not in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence conſent to it. How many poor preſbyterian miniſters are there not in the land, whoſe ſallaries are ſo ſmall that their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are in a ſtarving condition, and who have it in their power to mend their circumſtances greatly by entering into the ſervice of the church of England, and yet they chooſe rather to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with all the perplexities and diſadvantages of indigence than to do it. Now if we conſider what a powerful motive an increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſalary is to a man in want, and who ſees his dear wife and children thereby expoſed to innumerable dangers, difficulties and diſaſters, we cannot avoid concluding, that nothing but the force of conſcience, and a ſecret conviction that epiſcopacy is wrong, could prevent ſuch perſons, many of them confeſſedly men of good ſenſe, and earneſtly deſirous to promote the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their families, from ſubſcribing to it:</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another preſumptive argument againſt epiſcopacy, is this, that it ſeems not ſo conſiſtent with the genius of the goſpel, and the humility it ſo ſtrongly inculcates, as the ſchem of an equality amongſt miniſters. As the ſon of man came not to be miniſtered unto, but to miniſter, ſo it ought to be with his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors; they ſhould not deſire to lord it over their brethren, but as the Apoſtle ſays to the Romans, they ſhould in honour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one another. As Chriſt their great lord and maſter waſh'd the feet of his diſciples, ſo they ſhould waſh one another's feet, and chearfully ſubmit to the loweſt offices of mutual kindneſs. But is not the epiſcopal office incompatible with the exerciſe of theſe duties? Our bleſſed Lord reproved the ſons of Zebedee for aſpiring to a ſuperiority over their brethren; and the beloved apoſtle complained of Diotrephes, who loved the preheminence.
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:010857_0152_0F851E31F3B63C48"/>How then could either have inſtituted epiſcopacy which counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ſuch a ſuperiority and preheminence? It was a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſaying of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which he frequently repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>every one that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed, but he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</hi> His continual advice to his followers was, <hi>learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi> He told his apoſtles, that thoſe who were deſirous of being the greateſt in his kingdom, ſhould become the leaſt, and ſervants of all. Now I leave it to any candid judge to determine, what form of church government is moſt agreeable to theſe maxims, and the genius of the goſpel, the epiſcopal or the presbyterian? Surely there is ſomething in them that doth not well harmonize with the former, but is very conſiſtent with the latter. What language ſounds moſt avangelical, ſuch as an inferior clergyman would uſe to a biſhop, or ſuch as a presbyterian would uſe to a presbyter? Surely the latter. Nay I am apt to think, that the names and titles aſcribed to biſhops are highly diſpleaſing to God, and diſagreeable in the ears of every pious prelate. The arch-biſhop of Canterbury is ſtiled, his grace, the arch-biſhop of Canterbury, metropolitan, primate of all England. The biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op of London, is called the right reverend father in God, the lord biſhop of London, &amp;c. How contrary is the giving and aſſuming ſuch ſounding and lofty titles to the genius of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nay to the poſitive declarations of Jeſus Chriſt? It was an expreſs commandment of this great head of the church, <hi>call no man maſter, for one is your maſter who is in Heaven; call no man father, for one is your father even God.</hi> It is not impious for a man to aſſume the name of lord, when his great matter was diſtinguiſhed by that title?</p>
               <p n="5">5. A farther preſumptive argument againſt epiſcopacy, is this. It is more apt to ſwell proud ambition, and promote its danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and horrid effects, than preſbytery; moderate revenues and common privileges will never engage haughty aſpiring minds in the goſpel miniſtry, but a ſwelling title and a large revenue will; and epiſcopacy naturally verges to high titles and great ſalaries. Thus the hierachy has made men aim at holy orders for the ſake of honour and riches, who never would have done it for the glory of God and the good of ſouls. But how is this conſiſtent with going forth unto Chriſt without the camp, bearing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? How is it compatible with denying ourſelves, taking up our croſs and following our great maſter? How is it learning to endure hardneſs like good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt? The hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy has been the cauſe of very great luxury and prodigality in the church of Rome, and in ſome proteſtant churches; to wit, ſuperb palaces, large reveaues, grand and magnificent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:010857_0152_0F851E31F3B63C48"/>and much external pomp and ſplendour; nay, I dare affirm, that if there had not been a diſtinction of orders among the clergy, and if one order had not been greatly exalted above another, there never would have been ſuch ſpiritual tyranny in the church of Chriſt, and ſuch perſecution and oppreſſion, as the annals of paſt ages, and our own experience acquaint us with: There probably never would have been popes, patriarchs, cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and ſuch like domineering eccleſiaſticks, if there never had been dioceſan biſhops. Therefore from theſe, and many other bad effects which have flowed from epiſcopacy, and to which preſbyterian government would have been an antidote, we may juſtly conclude, that the former is inconſiſtent with the purity and proſperity of the church of Chriſt, with which the other is entirely conſiſtent.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another preſumptive argument againſt dioceſan epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and in favour of presbyterian church government is, that the latter (all things conſidered) is more likely to promote the welfare of the church of Chriſt than the former. One man is more likely to be impoſed upon, to miſtake and to act wrong in eccleſiaſtical affairs than a great number. Thoſe very reaſons which rendered it expedient in the apoſtles time, that they ſhould be conſulted about the ordination of miniſters, on account of their ſupernatural abilities to diſtinguiſh the qualifications of the candidate; thoſe very reaſons, now extraordinary gifts have ceaſed, render it proper that a preſbytery ſhould have the power of ordination, and not a biſhop; for ſuppoſing them all men of equal goodneſs and abilities, ſurely the deciſion of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will be more juſt and conſiſtent than thoſe of one man, and this is entirely agreeable to the maxims of the wiſe king, that in the multitude of counſellors there is ſafety. One man, though never ſo honeſt, may ſooner be deceived than a great many, and thus be the inſtrument of introducing a wicked and unworthy candidate in the miniſtry. A ſingle man may ſooner be bribed or corrupted to lay on hands ſuddenly than ſeveral. Beſides, if a biſhop he as wicked a man as a preſbyter, the former will be a much greater detriment to the church than the latter; for one wicked biſhop may do much greater injury to religion than ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wicked preſbyters; thoſe of the latter order will be mutual checks upon each other's ambition and wrong meaſures, but the former being free from all reſtraint, is at liberty to put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the wildeſt ſchemes. To this we may add, that under biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, corruptions in religion may more eaſily be propagated than under preſbyters. A biſhop may ſcatter his poiſon through a whole dioceſs, whilſt a preſbyter may be reſtrained by his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in a ſingle congregation.</p>

                  <pb n="304" facs="unknown:010857_0153_0F851E329C024DA8"/>
7. Another preſumptive argument againſt dioceſan epiſcopacy, and in favour of congregational biſhops or preſbyters, is this. It is impoſſible that one man can ſo properly govern and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend a whole dioceſs as a great many. A faithful miniſter finds it hard and difficult enough to take care of the ſouls of a ſingle pariſh, how then could he take care of the ſouls of many pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es? and therefore we read in ſcripture of no other ordinary rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſpecting a miniſter of the goſpel, than that which ſubſiſts between him and a particular flock committed more eſpecially to his care. As to the apoſtles, they were eye-witneſſes of Chriſtis reſurrection, extraordinary officers endowed with the power of working miracles, and divinely inſpired, and therefore they could have no ſucceſſors to their peculiar office; and, till modern biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops can prove their ſuperiority over their brethren by miracles, and a divine inſpiration, they muſt excuſe us from acknowledging the reaſonableneſs and divine appointment of ſuch ſuperiority. As to the evangeliſts, their miniſtry was not indeed confined to a ſingle congregation, yet there was nothing peculiar to their office which could not be performed by a common preſbyter. In ſhort, a careful overſight of the flock of Chriſt, a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>on into their manners and conduct, the inſtruction of the riſing generation, preaching the word continually, adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the ſacraments, and a due attendance upon his people in ſickneſs and ſpiritual diſtreſs, is the duty of every ſettled mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the goſpel. But how can one biſhop perform all this with regard to a whole dioceſs? therefore, it is probable, that dioceſan biſhops were not of divine inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another very ſtrong and preſumptive argument againſt dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan epiſcopacy, is this. That ſeveral biſhops and learned clergymen of the church of England, have themſelves diſavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the divine inſtitution of it. In the year 1537 or 1538, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Cromwell, vicar general, the two arch-biſhops, eleven biſhops, and many other doctors and civilians, ſubſcribed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, which cloſes with theſe remarkable words. That <q>though the fathers of the church had inſtituted other inferior orders and degrees, as Janitors, Lectors, &amp;c. yet the truth is, that in the New Teſtament there is no mention made of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or diſtinction in orders, but only of deacons or miniſters, and of prieſts or biſhops.</q> 
                  <hi>Arch-biſhop Whitgift</hi> thought no particular form of church government of divine right. Biſhop Morton in his Catholic apology, tells the papiſts, that the power of order and juriſdiction which they aſcribed to biſhops, doth <hi>de jure divino</hi> belong to all other preſbyters, and particularly that to ordain is their ancient right. Biſhop Jewel, in a certain paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage does not merely cenſure one Harding for condemning the
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:010857_0153_0F851E329C024DA8"/>doctrine of the parity of biſhops and preſbyters as heretical, but plainly ſuppoſes that opinion, to be both agreeable to ſcripture and to the doctrine of St. Jerom, St. Auſtin, and St. Ambroſe; and he cites with approbation, theſe known and remarkable words of Jerom, 'let biſhops know that they are in authority over prieſts, more by cuſtom than by order of God's truth.' In the reign of Henry VIII. we are told by Dr. Stillingfleet, in his Irinecum, part 2. chap. viii. p. 386. There was a ſelect aſſembly called by the king's ſpecial order, at Windfor caſtle, where met theſe following perſons: Thomas, arch-biſhop of Canterbury, Edward, arch-biſhop of York, the biſhop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, Edmund, biſhop of London, Robert, biſhop of Carliſle, Dr. George Day, Thomas Robertſon, Dr. Redmain, Dr. Edward Leighton, Dr. Simon Mathew, Dr. William Treſham, Dr. Rie Cozen, Dr. Edgworth, Dr. Owen Oglethorp and Dr. Thyrlby; and among other queſtions propoſed to them, to which they ſeverally gave in their anſwers; the tenth queſtion was, whether biſhops or prieſts were firſt? And if the prieſts were firſt, then the prieſt made the biſhop? To this queſtion arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Cranmer's anſwer was in theſe words: The biſhops and prieſts were at one time, and were not two things, but one office in the beginning of Chriſt's religion. And we are told by the ſame author, that the biſhop of St. Aſaph, Thyrlby and Cox, were all of the ſame opinion with the arch-biſhop, that at firſt biſhops and prieſts were the ſame. Thus, ſaith he, we ſee by the teſtimony chiefly of him who was inſtrumental in our reformation, that he owned not opiſcopacy as a diſtinct order from preſbytery of divine right, but only as a prudent conſtitution of the civil magiſtrate for the better governing in the church. I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce paſſages to the ſame purpoſe, out of Dr. Reignolds, Dr. Hammond and others, but the limits preſcrib'd by the printer, would not admit of ſuch an enlargement. I ſhall conclude this argument with obſerving, according to Dr. Stillingfleet, that King James, Dr. Coſins, Dr. Low, Biſhop Bridges, Dr. Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tcliff and Dr. Crackanthorp, were of opinion, that no form of church government is by the ſcriptures preſcribed to, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the church of God. Upon a review of all the above arguments, and a conſideration of their united force; I think every rational, unprejudiced man, will be ready to conclude, that it is not, upon the whole probable that dioceſan epiſcopacy was of divine original, or that it was inſtituted by Chriſt or his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. And now, having premiſed theſe preſumptive arguments, I will boldly defy all the divines and learned men in the world, to produce a ſingle, poſitive or probable argument to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from any part of the Bible, the only religion of proteſtants (as Mr. Chillingworth juſtly obſerves.)</p>

               <p>MY title now firſt appears inadequate, for the 7th No. of the Whip; the former part of it, eſpecially, is ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly malicious, that the writer certainly deſerves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a Kick; the reader will therefore excuſe, me, if on this occaſion, I act for once a little out of character, in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeriouſly one, who perhaps has it in his power to do miſchief, as a perſon (for that reaſon only) of ſome importance. Barely to laugh at a felon, wou'd be highly incongruous, and only to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule as a ſimpleton, a man who ought to be ſtigmatiz'd as a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, wou'd be inexcuſably criminal.</p>
               <p>As Squire T. begs all candid readers 'to reflect, whether ſuch publications as the Whig's 5th No. have not a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to raiſe ſuſpicions and jealouſies in the mother country, againſt the colonies,' I beg leave to appeal to the ſame impartial judges, whether ſuch publications as his 7th No. have not a ſtill more direct tendency, to increaſe and confirm ſuch ſuſpicions and jealouſies? If the Whig has been imprudent, is not the Whipper evidently malevolent? If the Whig has driven a nail, has not Squire T. done all he cou'd to clench it? If the Whig has inadvertently kindled a fire, has not his flagellator induſtriouſly blown the coals? If the Whig has merited a Whip, does not the Whipper himſelf richly deſerve a ſcorpion? Nay, did he not write No. 7.

If any one doubts, let him but impartially read over the five firſt paragraphs, and he muſt needs be convinced, and give his opinion in my favour. What but the rage of conſcious guilt, and conſequent malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to its detectors, cou'd have inſtigated Squire T. to accuſe the ſaction (as he affects to call them) of hopes and deſigns ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conceiv'd;—principles, moſt maliciously repreſented as diſloyal and deſtructive, both to the being and authority of Kings, but never 'til of late conſider'd as ſuch by any but Jacobites, ſince the reign of William the third.—Endeavours to taint the minds of the people, and debauch their affections to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Strange! that a writer, who ſo ſeverely condemns the Whig, ſhou'd be ſo much more guilty himſelf, and, after whipping others for their dirtineſs, like Smedley in the Dunciad, dive ſo much deeper than the reſt in the mud!—Strange did I ſay? No; <hi>per fas et neſas</hi> is his motto, and as he has darling purpoſes to anſwer, <hi>recte ſi poſſis, ſi non, quocunque modo rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacias</hi> will ſufficiently account for his conduct. The faction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are neither aſham'd or afraid to profeſs principles, partly at leaſt republican (having the happineſs of being ſubjects, not of an abſolute but mixed monarchy) as in ſo doing they are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd and ſecur'd by his Majeſty's example; and there's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, none but ſuch as are of the ſame ſentiments, are real friends to the eſtabliſhment in the preſent reigning family; let them boaſt as much as they will, of their attachment to the preſent happy conſtitution. The advocates for paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance (which Whippers and Hang men are accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to) are not apt to be fond of a limited monarchy, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfriendly to their own ambitious aims and deſpotic princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>Having with all the virulence of malice, thunder'd out many bitter invectives againſt the Whig, &amp;c. in his five firſt para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, in the 6th Squire T. trumpets his own praiſes moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully: I, is the little hero of the tale.

I dare not make any remarks on par. 7th, 8th and 9th, for fear of making the reader ſp—. If he needs a vomit, par. 9th, tho' a ſmall, is, however, a ſufficient doſe.</p>

               <p>AS I dare ſay the author of the American Whig, will never vouchafe to anſwer ſuch a writer as the reverend Doctor Hierocles, I beg leave to preſent him with the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and queries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he cannot expect to be taken for a peace maker, till he has convinced the world, that he can write at leaſt ſix lines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abuſing the Preſbyterians, who have given him no provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his virulence; nor are greater enemies to his darling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than every non-epiſcopal denomination among us; it being univerſally deteſted and abhorred by them all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he cannot expect any reaſonable man to confide in his declarations, that he wants no modern, but only primitive, biſhops; after admitting that we were not to be blamed for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alarmed about our religious liberties; that his bare word is to be deemed ſufficient ſecurity, in a matter of this importance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What ſecurity can be given, by a ſet of dependants, for for their daily bread on charitable contributions from England, and great part of them from people of the ſame denomination, with thoſe whom they are here daily abuſing and inſulting?</p>
               <p n="4">4. What reaſon can he aſſign, that the controverſy, ought to ceaſe before the ſecurity is given; and whether it is not more prudent to diſtruſt the words of thoſe, who never kept a promiſe; except when they had threatned to perſecute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Whigs?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether he believes in his conſcience, what he has ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in print, that the author of the American Whig is really a Tory? Let him declare this in the preſence of God if he dare.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether he has not greater reaſon to think, that a certain champion, for an American Epiſcopate, is a Tory; not only from the rampant high flying principles in his appeal, but his contemptible drolling on Whiggiſm, by his ill timed ridicule of, —<hi>for America has Whigs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Whether any but Whigs are to be found in America, ſave only among the convention and the Papiſts in Maryland?</p>

            <head>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL. July 14 The CENTINEL. [No. XVII.]</head>
            <p>DR. Chandler, in the name of his brethren, adduces the wretched condition of the epiſcopal church in the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for want of regular government and diſcipline without biſhops, as an argument for their introduction. He eſteems it a great grievance, and unparrelled hardſhip, and a diſadvantage of greater conſequence than the want of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; although he imagines that by that rite, the gracious aſſiſtances of the holy Spirit are communicated.</p>
            <p>Wretched indeed is the condition of that church, which is deſtitute of regular diſcipline: But there is ground to ſuſpect that the epiſcopal miſſionaries in America are no more affected with this conſideration, than their brethren on the other ſide of the atlantic, who are in the ſame wretched condition, yet make no attempts to get the grievance redreſſed.</p>
            <p>The reformation of their church in this article, is not among the happy conſequences, which they can expect from the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of biſhops in this country. The argument is only thrown out to work on the ignorant, and to excite compaſſion among well minded perſons, for their ſuffering, perſecuted church; which their apologiſt, Dr. Chandler, artfully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents as 'periſhing for want of neceſſaries' The miſſionaries muſt allow, there is no neceſſary connection between the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of dioceſan biſhops in a church, and the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Godly diſcipline: That there may be diſcipline in a church, where there are no prelates: And that there may be biſhops in a communion, deſtitute even of the ſhadow of regular diſcipline. With reſpect to the firſt of theſe, they ſee other churches around them without biſhops, exerciſing diſcipline over their own members; and they know that the church of England in the midſt of all their uncharitable pretenſions to be the only true apoſtolic church, the propagators of the true religion, the beſt reformed church in the world, the preſervers of the true Chriſtian faith, worſhip, and diſcipline, is ſolemnly confeſſing to God from year to year, that they are deſtitute of a godly diſcipline,<note n="*" place="bottom">Commination before Lent.</note> although they are aided by a civil eſtabliſhment, and ſupported by the authority, grandeur and opulence of prelates and other dignitaries.</p>

That this is truly the ſituation of the church of England, has been often acknowledged by her moſt judicious and candid members. They ingenuouſly confeſs, that there is a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of diſcipline in their church: That it is ruined among them:—That the diſtemper of the times is evidently too hard for it:—That the diſcipline of the church has not been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to any degree of perfection; and now lies under a general relaxation:—That their people are often indulged in all their unreaſonable demands, and diſorderly ways, to prevent their executing their threats of going to the meeting —That they have only the form and ſhadow of diſcipline, but truſt in God, that 'theſe dry bones will one day live.'<note n="†" place="bottom">

               </note>—And Dr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler himſelf gives a like mournful account of its diſcipline. 'Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,' ſays he, 'the utmoſt effect of the church's power in this world, however it was dreaded in the pureſt ages of Chriſtianity, has loſt much of its force in this, wherein altars are ſet up againſt altars, and churches againſt churches, and thoſe who are rejected by one may be received by another. A diſpoſition to ſlight the higheſt puniſhment which the church can inflict has become general, and there appears no remedy, but in the uſe of reaſon and perſuaſion. But we live in an age in which reaſon will not be heard, nor the ſtrength of arguments regarded, although ſupported by the declarations of Heaven, on the ſubject of church diſcipline.'<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Appeal,</hi> 31.</note> The Doctor and his brethren know that the teſt has broken down all the incloſures of the church of England, and has laid open her moſt holy things to the moſt abandoned and profane. Rakes, debauchees, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers of God, infidels and ſcoffers at all religion, are often ſeen on their knees at her communion tables, eating her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's bread to qualify them for a poſt: And dare the clergy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them? No; they dare not refuſe the moſt impious blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the three kingdoms afford, when he comes to demand the Lord's Supper, as a qualification for a poſt in the fleet or army.</p>
            <p>It is alſo notorious that the Engliſh biſhop himſelf is excluded from having any power even in his own court; where a chancellor, generally a lay-man, ſits ſupreme and uncontrouled by the biſhop, and finally determines who ſhall be excommunicated from, or received into Chriſtian fellowſhip. If there be any thing, ſays a great prelate of the church of England, in the office of a biſhop to be challenged peculiar to themſelves, certainly it ſhould be this; yet it is in a manner quite relinquiſhed to their chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:010857_0156_0F851E3B5AA5B378"/>Laymen, who have no more capacity to ſentence or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve a ſinner, than to diſſolve the Heavens or the Earth. And this pretended power is ſometimes purchaſed with money. Their money periſh with them! good God! What an horrid abuſe is this of the divine authority. But this notorious trangreſſion is excuſed, as they think, becauſe a miniſter calle the biſhop's Surrogate, but is indeed the Chancellor's ſervant, choſen, called and placed there by him, to be his cryer in the court, no better, when he has heard, examined and ſentenced the cauſe, then this miniſter forſooth pronounces the ſentence.

            <p>Such is the melancholy ſituation of the church of England with reſpect to her diſcipline, even in full poſſeſſion of an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment by law, and ſupported by all the ſplendor and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of lordly prelates and dignified prieſts. Yet it is ſaid the epiſcopal church in the colonies ſuffers unparallelled hardſhips, for want of regular diſcipline, becauſe ſhe is deſtitute of biſhops. But can the miſſionaries ſeriouſly believe this grievance would be removed by the introduction of biſhops? No ſuch matter. They declare, by Dr. Chandler, that no reformation in this reſpect will be attempted: that the diſcipline of the church, as far as it relates to the private members, will be left it is, under the propoſed epiſcopate.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Appeal,</hi> 26, 31, 95.</note> Diſcipline was not the thing they had in view, when they petitioned for biſhops to be ſet over them. They are meerly to unite, govern, ſupport and defend the clergy. More ſolicitous for the honour of an uſeleſs eccleſiaſtical ſuperior to cut a figure at their head, than to edify their people by reſtoring the primitive diſcipline of the church; they propoſe a mutilated prelate, ſuch as never yet appeared in the churches of Chriſt. It would ſeem that when theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men took a trip to England in their youth for orders, they were captivated with the magnificence of the epiſcopal palaces, the
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:010857_0157_0F851E3B71A22570"/>glare of the biſhop's equipage, and the ſplendor of their reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and have never been able to get over this youthful preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: But are always dreaming of lawn ſleeves, the ſquare cup and mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re; and luſting after the leeks and onions of Egypt, even in this land of freedom and liberty.</p>
            <p>Why then are theſe pitiful lamentations made over the want of diſcipline in the epiſcopal church in America, and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions drawn from it to induce their ſuperiors at home to ſend over biſhops, to reſcue their ſinking church from inevitable perdition. Let us ſee how prettily the argument will conclude, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a logical form. The church in America, without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent biſhops, is neceſſarily deſtitute of a regular diſcipline and government: 'But the diſcipline of the church, as far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to private members will be left as it is, and no attempts of this nature will be made under the propoſed American epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate.' Therefore an American epiſcopate is neceſſary for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of primitive diſcipline of the church. One not ſo well acquainted with the rules of logic, as Dr. C. is, would have been apt to ſuſpect that the concluſion ſhould have been, that it was by no means neceſſary for the regular government of the church, as it would contribute nothing to the redreſs of this 'intolerable and unprecedented hardſhip.' Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obſtinacy of the premiſes, the doctor it ſeems was not willing to loſe the wiſhed for concluſion, nor the opportunity of diſplaying his talents in painting his church in ſuch doleful co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. In making ſuch bitter lamentations over her want of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, he ſeems to have conſulted poorly for her reputation, and as wretchedly for the credit of her clergy, in avowing to the world, that no amendment is propoſed in point of diſcipline, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as to the clergy, the laity being profeſſedly left out of the plan.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Appeal,</hi> 97.</note> This being the caſe, it is expected that Dr. Chandler, or the next apologiſt for his church, will ſoften theſe mournful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and for their own ſakes prepare a more favourable account of the ſtate of diſcipline in their congregations, and of the diſpoſition of the clergy to reform it: Otherwiſe the world will ſcarce believe their church to be the beſt reformed church in the world; the pureſt church under Heaven; the bulwark of the reformation; the pure apoſtolic church; and the <hi>church,</hi> by way of eminence and excluſion, as if there was no other in the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>By this time, it muſt appear pretty plain, that the argument taken from the proſtration of diſcipline in the epiſcopal churches in America, is meerly a deluſive piece of declamation, no ways connected with the ſcheme of an American epiſcopate. Nay,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:010857_0157_0F851E3B71A22570"/>biſhops would rather tye up the hands of the clergy, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any thing being done of this ſort, if we may judge from what paſſes in England. Had it not been for civil eſtabliſhments, what could have prevented the reformation of many abuſes in the church of England, which every good member ſees with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret? Dr. Chandler, imputes it to the want of good ſenſe and candour enough in the body of the nation.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Appeal,</hi> 96.</note> But in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened age, eſpecially as the things which call for amendment have been held up to public view, for more than a century paſt, by ſome of the greateſt men of the eſtabliſhed church, as well as others, in a very ſtriking point of light; this cannot be the caſe. The root of the evil lies deeper, and muſt be ſought for in the civil eſtabliſhment; by which even the moſt diſtant hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in any thing material, are cut off. eſtabliſhments in religion may make hypocrites and occaſional conformiſts, when their ſeculiar intereſts lead them that way; but never do great ſervice to true Chriſtianity. This needs not the chains of earthly grandeur, nor the force of civil power to ſpread and eſtabliſh it. High dignities and preferments; mitres and thrones; lordſhips and princely revenues have ever been injurious to its intereſts; and inſtead of improving, have dreadfully corrupted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved the religion of Jeſus, and robb'd it of its native glory and ſtrength. Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory in all ages lamentably bears witneſs to the juſtneſs of theſe remarks; yet the want of theſe things is now made an excuſe for ſuffering diſcipline in the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal church to remain relaxed and proſtrate.</p>
            <p>What can the epiſcopal miniſters in the colonies have to ſay in excuſe for themſelves, if they criminally neglect reſtoring primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſcipline? Dr. C. confeſſes that preſbyters may have a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate power to govern the church, and enjoy a right to exclude from the Sacraments all publickly vicious members. In this country they are un-reſtrained by the difficulties which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs the conſcientious pariſh miniſters in England, their enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are not laid open by a political teſt; and they enjoy every power which other churches in the colonies have. Why then ſhould they deſpair of accompliſhing what is daily done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? They profeſs to wiſh for it; why do they not attempt it by reaſon and perſuaſion, the only rational way in which it can be brought about? no diſcipline was more ſevere than that of the primitive church; yet it was all voluntary, and received no countenance from civil power.</p>
            <p>But in truth, theſe people are, themſelves, little affected with the pathetic complaints, they make for want of a regular diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:010857_0158_0F851E3C43220080"/>Theſe are thrown out meerly to excite the public pity, and to ſkroen themſelves from the charge of ſupine negligence, in not attempting to reſtore it; under an idle pretence that they want biſhops to effect it for them. Yet at the ſame time they are ſo weak and inconſiſtent, as to declare that no attempts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore diſcipline, will be made under the propoſed epiſcopate.</p>

               <p>HITHERTO I have advanced only preſumptive arguments, I ſhall now produce poſitive proofs from the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt dioceſan epiſcopacy, or the doctrine of the ſuperiority of biſhops to preſbyters, with regard to ordination, confirmation and eccleſiaſtical government. If there had been one inſtance in the ſacred ſcripture of a miniſter of the goſpel, ordained to his office, by the impoſition of a biſhop; how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would the epiſcopalians have triumphed in ſuch a caſe? I think therefore, as there is an inſtance of a proper ordination to the miniſterial office, recorded in the New-Teſtament, which is ſaid to have been done by the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery, the point ought to be given up; and it ought to be candidly acknowledged that dioceſan epiſcopacy is not of divine original; and that notwithſtanding ſuch a glaring evidence, which ought to put an end to the diſpute, any learned and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible man ſhould perſiſt in the contrary ſentiment, is as ſtrong and as melancholly a proof of the force of prejudice, and the unwillingneſs of mankind, to give up old opinions, as can well be imagined.</p>
               <p>Timothy was ordained by the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery. This is evident from St. Paul's firſt epiſtle to him. See the 4th chapter 14 verſe. <hi>Neglect not the gift which is in thee, which was given thee by propheſy, with the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery.</hi> As this text is ſo ſtrongly in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of preſbyterian, and ſo contrary to epiſcopal ordination, the patrons of the latter have exerciſed their utmoſt ability to evade the argument that ariſes from it. I will mention, and reply to all the evaſions that have been invented by ingenious men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and invalidate our argument from this paſſage of ſacred
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:010857_0158_0F851E3C43220080"/>writ; and I doubt not but I ſhall make it ſufficiently appear, that this text, notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is a full demonſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </p>
               <p>The firſt evaſion I ſhall mention, is this; the epiſcopalians pretend that the word <hi>gift</hi> ought to be connected with the words, <hi>of the preſbytery,</hi> and then they would read the verſe thus, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect not the gift of preſbytery, &amp;c. It is juſtly objected to this arrangement of the words, that it is evidently contrary to the rules of Grammer, as may be ſeen by looking on the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the original words. Beſides the original word preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, here rendered preſbytery, occurs but in two more paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the New-Teſtament; namely, Luke xxii. 66. and Acts v. 22. and in both theſe paſſages it ſignifies an aſſembly of elders, and not the miniſterial office. I ſhall take no farther notice of this evaſion, as it muſt be evident to any perſon acquainted with the Greek language, that there is not the leaſt foundation for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another evaſion of the epiſcopalians, is this; they ſay, by the preſbytery we muſt underſtand the apoſtles. If this ſhould be admitted, it would not prove that the right of ordination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a dioceſan biſhop, becauſe if an apoſtle has this right, it is no proof that a biſhop, not endowed with extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and miraculous endowments, is poſſeſſed of it, much leſs can it be argued that a ſingle biſhop may ordain becauſe a number of apoſtles did. If all the apoſtle, joined together in ordaining Timothy, their example would be more conformable to the preſbyterian method of ordination than the epiſcopal. However, I abſolutely deny that preſbytery means the college of apoſtles. I think it would not be much more abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the apoſtles were the ſanhedrim, than to ſuppoſe them the preſbytery here ſpoken of; the apoſtles are no where called in the New-Teſtament the preſbytery. They are ſtiled the Eleven, the Twelve, the Apoſtles, &amp;c. as may be ſeen in many paſſages. Compare John xxi. 1. and xx. 18. with acts i. 2.15. and acts vi. 2, 26. In the two laſt paſſages we read, that the apoſtles choſe by lot a ſucceſſor in the room of Judas, and of their lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands on the ſeven deacons; and undoubtedly if they had laid their hands on Timothy at his ordination. Paul would have mentioned it, and ſaid, with the laying on of the hands of the apoſtles, and not the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another evaſion, is this; that though the preſbytery laid
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:010857_0159_0F851E3CE334A260"/>hands upon Timothy at his ordination, yet what conſtituted the walidity of it, was the laying on of Paul's hands: This is Dr. Chandler's plea. To this it is anſwered, that the text ſpeaks of the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery, and not the laying on of Paul's hands. If Paul had laid his hands on Timothy, at his ordination here referred to, it is probable he would have ſaid, with the laying on of my hands and the hands of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery; but as there is no mention made of the impoſition of Paul's hands in this text, it is certain it cannot be inſerred from it. However, if Paul ſhould have joined with the preſbytery in ſetting Timothy apart to the miniſtry, and this paſſage ſhould be allowed to refer to that matter, it would only follow, that he acted in this affair ſo far as is related ſimply to the ordination, as a fellow preſbyter, and not as an apoſtle.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another, and the moſt material evaſion, is this; That the gift here referred to, is not the office of the miniſtry, but the gift of the Holy-Ghoſt. This is urged by biſhop Hoadly, who alledges, that it is very ſtrange that the office of the miniſtry ſhould be called a gift. But how ſurpriſingly weak and mean is ſuch a ſubterfuge in ſo great a maſter of reaſoning, and a man of ſuch candor as this eminent biſhop undoubtedly was? It proves that this text hangs like a heavy millſtone about the neck of epiſcopal ordination, ſince ſuch abſurd methods are uſed to get rid of it; and if ſuch a champion as biſhop Hoadly could not remove it, we may preſume that no other patron of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy ever will. We no where read in ſcripture that the Holy-Ghoſt was confered by the impoſition of the hands of the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; I mean, a company of ordinary preſbyters; and no one would have dreamt of ſuch a thing, if it had not been to ſerve the ends of a proud and lucrative hierachy: Beſides, there was no need for the preſbytery to lay hands on Timothy to confer the Holy-Ghoſt, the apoſtle could do it alone; nay, aſſerts he had done it. 2 Timothy i. 6. In as much then, as the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery laid their hands on Timothy, and as they did not do it to confer the Holy-Ghoſt, which Paul could do; nay, declares he had done, we ſhall make bold to conclude it was to ordain him to the miniſtry, except our opponents are capable of aſſigning a better reaſon for this ceremony.</p>
               <p>To affirm that St. Paul laid his haads on Timothy on the occaſion referred to in the text, is to build without a foundation; the apoſtle declaring no ſuch thing in this paſſage, and it being utterly impoſſible that this paſſage, and 2 Timothy i. 6. relate to the ſame thing, for the following reaſons; If they did, the manner of expreſſion in both, would not be ſo different as it is. Moreover the context in the 1 Tim. iv. 14. ſuits beſt with the
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:010857_0159_0F851E3CE334A260"/>opinion of Timothy's ordination to the miniſterial office, as any one will be ſenſible of, if he reads it with impartiallity. Beſides, if b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> apoſtle is guilty of tautology, which is unlikely. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is reaſonable to think, that ſo great a maſter of addreſs as the Apoſtle Paul, in an epiſtle to a young miniſter, wherein he expreſly exhorts him to a faithful diſcharge of the miniſterial office, would enforce his exhortation by reminding that miniſter of the ſolemn occaſion, when he was ſet apart for that office, and entered into the ſtricteſt engagements duly to perform it; but if it is not done here, it is done no where elſe in the epiſtles. At leaſt if Paul ſpeaks twice of a gift given to Timothy, it is very reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that in one caſe he refers to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial office; and ſince it is acknowledged on all hands, that the preſbytery laid hands on candidates to ordain them to the miniſtry, and the apoſtles after laid their hands on perſons to confer the Holy-Ghoſt; and ſince there is not one plain inſtance in ſcripture of common preſbyters conjointly conferring the Holy-Ghoſt by the impoſition of hands, or any other way, it undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follows, that Timothy was ordained by the preſbytery.</p>
               <p>I am ſurpriſed, that a man of biſhop Hoadly's learning ſhould pretend, that the apoſtle did not deſign the miniſterial office in the above paſſages, becauſe he calls it a gift. Did he not know that offices were gifts, that the Greek word <hi>chariſma,</hi> munus, ſignifies an office; Did he not recollect ſcripture inſtances where the miniſterial office is repreſented as a gift? Did he not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Epheſ. iv. 11. where the apoſtle tells us, that Chriſt gave ſome apoſtles, and ſome prophets, and ſome evangeliſts, and ſome paſtors and teachers? Did he not remember Rom. xii. 6, 7, 8. Having then gifts <hi>chariſmata,</hi> offices differing according to the grace that is is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophecy, according to the proportion of ſaith; or miniſtry, let us wait on our miniſtry, &amp;c. did he not know? Did he not recollect theſe particulars? Undoubtedly he did. But what could he do? He had undertaken the defence of epiſcopal ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this text was directly contrary to it. He was therefore obliged to wreſt the ſcriptures. In ſhort, his gloſſes on this text to evade the evidence ariſing from it in favour of preſbyterian ordination, have convinced me more fully, that it is a deciſive argument, with regard to the point in debate. Before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my obſervations on this text, I ſhall take notice of another objection, which biſhop Hoadly urges againſt the uſe we make of it; he ſays, <q>if this text proves any thing in favour of ſuch a right. <hi>i. e.</hi> the right of preſbyters to ordain.</q> It equally proves that preſbyters had a right to ſet apart, not only preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:010857_0160_0F851E3DA163BAC0"/>to their office, but even evangeliſts, or church officers as Timothy was, to their office, which is abſurd, But it is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity for a number of inferiors to ſet apart others to a ſuperior office: It is what is done continually, and church hiſtory fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us with inſtances of this nature, directly to the purpoſe; which the biſhop was well acquainted with: But to ſay, that an evangeliſt, or that Timothy, was an officer ſuperior to a preſbyter, is begging the queſtion. Every evangeliſt is a preſbyter, and every presbyter is an evangeliſt; and if evangeliſts are itinerant miniſters, ordained to preach the goſpel among heathens and infidels, this is nothing but what presbyters may do, or have done; and if the being an evangeliſt in this ſenſe, would prove a man to be ſuperior to a presbyter, it will prove alſo, that a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter is ſuperior to a biſhop, as presbyters have been employed in that buſineſs, when biſhops have thought it beneath their epiſcopal dignity.</p>
               <p>It is aſſerted by biſhop Hoadly, that Timothy was biſhop of Epheſus, and Titus biſhop of Crete. But this I deny, and let thoſe who aſſert it, prove that they were; I mean dioceſan biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops. That Timothy was biſhop of Epheſus, and titus of Crete, becauſe the apoſtle directs the former to lay hands ſuddenly on no man; and the latter, that he left him in Crete to ſet in order the things that were wanting, and to ordain elders in every place, is a very weak argument; ſeeing that parrallel directions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations have frequently been given by presbyters to preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. The apoſtle's direction to Timothy, to lay hands ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly on no man, no more proves his excluſive right to ordain, than the Apoſtle's direction to the ſame Timothy, to drink a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wine, proves that his reverend brethren the presbyters, were not intitled to the ſame privilege; and yet upon ſo frivolous and weak a deduction, which by no means neceſſarily follows from the premiſes, is the mighty ſtructure of dioceſan epiſcopacy founded, ſo far as it relates to ſcripture teſtimony. If Timothy had been biſhop of Epheſus, it is probable that Paul would have mentioned him under that character in the inſcription at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the epiſtle to the Epheſians, or in the ſalutations at the end of it; but not a word of Timothy in either.</p>
               <p>If Timothy had been biſhop of Epheſus, it is probable that Paul would have recognized him as ſuch, in the addreſs he made to the Epheſian elders at Miletus, and eſpecially as he was taking his laſt leave of them; yet he mentions not a word of Timothy; nay, inſtead of enjoining theſe elders to yield obedience to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, or any one elſe as their biſhop, he ſays unto them, take heed to yourſelves, and to all the flock over which the Holy-Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Greek epiſcopous, in
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:010857_0160_0F851E3DA163BAC0"/>Engliſh, biſhops. Thus then theſe elders were ſtiled biſhops by the Apoſtle, and therefore this paſſage, as alſo Phil. i. 1. Tit. i. 5, 7.1. Pet. v. 1, 2. prove that the names, biſhop and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, were indiſcriminately given to the ſame officers, and all the world may be challenged to give any poſitive proof from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that biſhops were an order diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, presbyters.</p>
               <p>It doth not appear from any of the epiſtles written to any of the churches, that they had dioceſan biſhops; the Apoſtle in the inſcription of thoſe epiſtles, makes not the leaſt mention of them, which is a ſtrong argument that there were none.</p>
               <p>The epiſtle to the Philippians is inſcribed to all the ſaints at philippi, with the biſhops and deacons. Obſerve reader, the word is biſhops, that is congregational ones, and not biſhop, that is a dioceſan one; ſurely this text favours not the epiſcopal dignity; for no man of ſenſe will pretend that there were more than one dioceſan biſhop in a city. 'As the Apoſtle therefore ſpeaks of biſhops at Philippi in the plural number, it is evident he means presbyters by that word, that the church there was governed by fellow presbyters.</p>
               <p>Paul in his Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians exhorts them to know them which laboured amongſt them, which were over them in the Lord; and admoniſhed them, to eſteem them very highly in love for their work's ſake; here again he ſpeaks of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but not one word of the biſhop.</p>
               <p>Although the church of Chriſt was ſo highly celebrated, yet the Apoſtle no where intimates that it had a dioceſan biſhop, When Paul wrote his Epiſtle to the Corinthians, he particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned to heal the unhappy diviſions that had riſen amongſt them; if there had been a biſhop at Corinth at that time, the Apoſtle would undoubtedly have referred the corinthians to him, as a peace maker and healer of breaches; but as he has not done it, we may conclude that the Corinthians had no biſhop.</p>
               <p>In the Epiſtle to the Romans there is not any mention made of a dioceſan biſhop. The Papiſts pretend that Peter was biſhop of Rome, but perhaps there is as little reaſon to ſuppoſe that Peter was biſhop of Rome, as that Timothy was biſhop of Epheſus, or Titus biſhop of Crete.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle to the Hebrews exhorts them, to remember thoſe who had the rule over them, who had ſpoken unto them the word of God; here again the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the plural number, thereby intimating that theſe Hebrews were under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of elders or presbyters, and not a dioceſan biſhop.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle Peter, writing to the elders, 1, Pet. i, 5. ſays, the elders which are among you I exhort, who am alſo an elder,
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:010857_0161_0F851E3E670DC5B0"/>in Greek <hi>ſunpreſbeteros;</hi> ſeed the flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight of them; in Greek <hi>epiſcopountes i. e.</hi> exerciſing the office of biſhops over them. By this paſſage we not only ſee that biſhops and presbyters were the ſame thing, but that the Apoſtle Peter himſelf looked upon the presbyters as his fellows.</p>
               <p>John the beloved apoſtle, 3 Epheſians 1 verſe, ſtiles himſelf an elder; and inſtead of aſpiring at a ſuperiority over his brethren, for which he had once been blamed by his maſter, he complains of Diotrephes, who loved the preheminence. The ſhort limits of a News Paper will not permit me to enlarge upon the ſeveral arguments I have mentioned; I ſhall therefore conclude for the preſent with a few obſervations.</p>
               <p>The word of God in defining the eſſential marks of a miniſter of Chriſt, confines itſelf entirely to one order of the clergy, without ſpeaking a ſyllable of any other; ſurely if there had been any ſuch perſon as a dioceſan biſhop eſtabliſhed, or to be eſtabliſhed in the Chriſtian church, he would have been deſcribed in the New-Teſtament; and eſpecially in the epiſtle to Timothy and Titus, wherein St. Paul treats profeſſedly on the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of eccleſiaſtical officers. If there had been different orders of goſpel preachers, he would, probably, have taken notice of them in thoſe epiſtles; and ſhewed what different gifts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ſeverally requiſite, to fit them for their reſpective offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But we read only of one order of the clergy in the apoſtle's writings; which make no mention of biſhops, as diſtinct from elders.</p>
               <p>St. Paul no where informs us, what character a dioceſan biſhop ſhould have. He tells you what an elder, who doth not labour in the word, ſhould be: He tells you what a deacon, who ſerves tables and takes care of the poor, ſhould be, and what a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elder ſhould be; but takes no notice of a dioceſan biſhop. Surely if any ſuch perſon had exiſted in, or been intended for, the church of Chriſt, and if he had been of ſo much importance to its adminiſtration, as Dr. Chandler pretends, the apoſtle would have mentioned him; and eſpecially when he had ſo good an opportunity of doing it in the epiſtles to Timothy and Titus. Is it not ſtrange that in theſe epiſtles, Paul ſhould deſcribe the neceſſary qualifications of the loweſt officer, in the church of Chriſt, and not mention the higheſt?</p>
               <p>I intend to take a more particular notice of Dr. Chandler's appeal, in ſome future papers, in which (I doubt not) I ſhall fully anſwer Chillingworth's demonſtration of epiſcopacy; and abundantly prove the futility and nonſenſe of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion. I think what I have ſaid already is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the impartial reader, that dioceſan epiſcopacy, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by a biſhop, are not of divine inſtitution.</p>

               <p>HAVING in my laſt gently cudgell'd the Whipper for the impudent malice of his 7th, I ſhall now proceed to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert upon the miſcellaneous <hi>ſcribble ſcrabble</hi> of his 8th No. for the future, however, reſerving to myſelf the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary power of treating him as a fool or a knave, and uſing my heel or my cane as I think proper.</p>
               <p>As Squire T. (par. 1ſt) aſſures us, it is a very eaſy matter for a writer to make, and implicity acknowledges the Whig has made a ſpecious appearance in a periodical paper; it ſhou'd ſeem ſtrange he himſelf has not ſucceeded, who ſo evidently 'aims at carrying his point by clamour, and raiſing an odium againſt—(I muſt not ſay his antagoniſts, for he has none; I Sir Iſaac Foot having, as yet, the honour to be no more than an epagoniſt—but) the non-epiſcopal faction, which he is feebly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to laſh in the perſon of the Whig. If a bluſtering writer, under all the advantages he could wiſh, egregiouſly fails in a very eaſy matter, what muſt the world think of him?</p>
               <p>The Whig's malice, it ſeems, renders him inconſiſtent. As how? Why, in finding fault with Dr. Chandler, for falling into oppoſite extremes. Pray, Mr. Whipper, is it impoſſible for a D. D. to ſpeak ſometimes too plain, and ſometimes not plain enough?—one while to reaſon, ſo that the unavoidable conſequence is the invalidity of non epiſcopal ordination, and afterwards for certain reaſons, to ſoften <hi>invalid</hi> down into <hi>at leaſt irregular and defective?</hi>—Has not Dr. Ch—r (as well as Squire T.) often inadvertently expreſs'd even ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory ſentiments, and who pray, is moſt juſtly chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with inconſiſtencies, He who writes them, or he who, when written, <hi>holds them forth</hi> to public view?—<hi>public view!</hi> ay, there's the malice of it. So unguarded, and yet ſo averſe to detection, is guilty artifice!</p>
               <p>Squire T. it ſeems, can't find Dr. Ch—r guilty of (what is viſible to half an eye) an univerſal denial of the validity of non-epiſcopal ordination. Any one, at leaſt who attentively reads ſect. 1. par. 3d. of the Appeal, is (I affirm) as blind as a bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le, if he don't find Dr. Ch—r repreſenting all the angels in Heaven, as well as all the men on earth, without an uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſucceſſion of biſhops, as inſignificant to the validity of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:010857_0162_0F851E3F24749888"/>as Dr. Tickle himſelf—poh! I mean, Squire Tickle —(par. 8th) makes all the preſbyters on the continent, to the fabrication of 'a ſingle Chriſtian prieſt.' And if the evident real ſentiments of both are juſt, the Lord have mercy on all non-epiſcopal churches, and that of Holland among the reſt! Squire T. indeed, even while (conſcience bound no doubt) he admits 'the church of Holland is not ſo exactly epiſcopal, as that of England,' wou'd fain be underſtood to admit alſo the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of Dutch ordinations; but alas (ſuch dirty artifices are uſed in eccleſiaſtical politics!) all this and much more (par. 3d and 4th) is but time-ſerving complaiſance, deſign'd to ſecure the neutrality or engage the intereſt of the Dutch churches, while conſecrated fetters are preparing for them, as well as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſchimatical congregations.' But is Squire T. indeed, ſtupid enough to hope to make dupes of the Dutch churches, who very well know the church of Holland, as to conſtitution, differs more from the church of England, than this laſt from the church of Rome, and that it is in every reſpect non-epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, as much as if it were ſtrictly and properly Presbyterian? If ſo, fie upon thee Squire T!</p>
               <p>Par. 5th is of the ſame complexion with the greateſt part of No. VII. containing a moſt villainous accuſation of the faction as having long aimed to ſeize the revenues of the Dutch church in New-York, which I never dreamt, heard, or read of, till the 23d of May laſt, and perhaps no mortal elſe, but Squire T. and I candidly believe, that if this virulent charge did not originate in his own head or heart, it was ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by one of God's creatures of ſuperior abilities, but of a ſtill more perverſe diſpoſition. In this par, he again mixes bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſweet calumny, and what he doubtleſs ſuppoſes to be wit; but who, beſides Squire T. ever thought of 'incopora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a thing called a meeting-houſe by charter, any more than of 'anihilating exiſtence by diviſions? tho' every one knows iron, wood, ſtone, &amp;c. may be eaſily incorporated into a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous conſecrated idoliz'd thing, call'd a <hi>church,</hi> which, in ſpite of its ſteeple, the faction is wicked enough to believe has, when the aſſembly is abſent, no more inherent ſanctity than the moſt humble profane deſpicable ſtructure on the face of the globe.</p>
               <p>Par. 6th 7th and 8th, Squire T. boggles miſerably at the Whigs queſtion (No. V. par. 6th and 7th) one leg, tho' bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt the ſtumbling block, he has indeed brought over, but the other he has been oblig'd to leave behind; ſo that there he ſtands yet, like a witch beſtriding the threſhold of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted door. To put a good face on the matter, he makes a flouriſh indeed about Monſieur Houdin; but not a ſyllable drops from his pen concerning Mr. Monroe. Why this difference as
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:010857_0162_0F851E3F24749888"/>to mentioning, as well as ordaining, theſe two gentlemen, Squire T.? alas! 'tis ſubterfuge all, every one ſees it; and yet I'll make you the beſt excuſe I can—'Twas of Dr. Chandler, and not Dr. Tickle, the Whig challenged a categorical reply to his queſtion; however I can't help ſaying, that, when the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was pleas'd to appear as a <hi>catechumen,</hi> if he thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be ſilent about Mr Monroe, it had been much more ſo to have ſaid nothing at all about Monſ. Houdin.</p>
               <p>Par. 9th. he labours hard to be at a loſs about the ſenſe of the word match, and at laſt removes his ſelf caus'd perplexity, by a moſt ſulphureouſly humourous ſolution; and in par. 10th brings a ſcrap of Hudibraſs to knock down the Whig, who had been ſo unlucky as to expoſe himſelf to the blow. However violent a Tory the author might be, the moſt rigid Whigs acknowledge the merits of Hudibraſs as a piece of humour; but wit is not argument, and, by the way, Tickle is not Butler.</p>
               <p>Par. 11th Squire T. finds fault with the Whig, for taking for granted, 'that it is impoſſible, as the law now ſtands, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a biſhop into America, who will not have authority, the inſtant he arrives, to ſet up an eccleſiaſtical court. The force of this kind of reaſoning (which, by the way, is no reaſoning at all) is not, it ſeems, evident; but I fancy this kind of propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will, 'ere long, be ſufficiently evident to many beſide thoſe Squire T. himſelf rages, foams, ſwells, bluſters, threatens, and propheſies, to convince, frighten, or diſcourage. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not more diverting, to hear a W—give lectures on female virtue, than to read what this huſſar in controverſy, this buſh-fighter, has ſo gravely written, about ſober argument, and candid reaſoning. For my part, I make no high pretences to either of the two (if two they are) and yet I flatter myſelf, there is at leaſt as much real argument, coach'd in my hints <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> as in Squire T's round about flagellations. Reader conſider me not as guilty of vanity, for while you juſtify my ſentiments, in this reſpect (as I'm ſure you muſt, if before judgment you will but compare Whig, Whip, and Kick together) you are hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome to think as meanly of me as you pleaſe.

            <head>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL. July 21. The CENTINEL. [No. XVIII.]</head>
            <p>WHEN deſigning men have any ſchemes to execute, which may be prejudicial to the rights and privileges of others, reaſons, different from thoſe which really influence them, are contrived and thrown out to amuſe the populace, and to divert their attention from the conſequences, that may follow from the execution of their ſchemes. This ſeems to be the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the epiſcopal miſſionaries, in their attempts to introduce biſhops into the American colonies.</p>
            <p>In our laſt Centinel, we conſidered their idle pretence of the want of diſcipline, as it is urged by Dr. C. as an argument in favour of the propoſed epiſcopate, We will now conſider ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther artifice to gild the diſagreeable pill that it may be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed without ſuſpicion, namely, that theſe new biſhops are to have no power over the laity.</p>
            <p>It is well known, there are among the laity, many moderate members of the epiſcopal communion, who deteſt ſpiritual do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, as much as others, and who are as tenacious of their civil and religious liberties, as the members of any other church, and therefore likely to be alarmed at this dangerous innovation. Leſt theſe ſhould proceed on the ſuppoſition, that to prevent the yoke from being fixed upon them, it was the ſafeſt way to oppoſe the ſcheme, of introducing theſe new maſters into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, they are firſt deprived of their natural right of being conſulted on the important article, and then they are amuſed with the falſe and inconſiſtent hopes of being entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the juriſdiction of the American biſhops. We call it an in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onſiſtent hope, as it is contradictory not only to the known ſentiments of the Engliſh epiſcopal church, but alſo to the ſentiments of every other Chriſtian church in the world. This plan of American biſhops is a mere novel invention, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any parallel in hiſtory either ſacred or profane, ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of a church upon earth; and yet no doubt, ſome zealous clergy will tell us, it is the pure apoſtolic plan. It ſeems ſtrange, indeed, that the clergy of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who are, doubtleſs, Dr. C's ſuperiors at home, who have ſettled this plan, (if indeed they ever ſettled it) ſhould deviate ſo much from the model of their own and of every other Chriſtian church, as well as from the diſcipline preſcribed in the ſcripture. A church, whoſe members are exempt from the government of
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:010857_0163_0F851E3FE0282D80"/>its officers, is what no age can furniſh an example of. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency, therefore, of this plan with the known principles of the church of England, give grounds to ſuſpect that Dr. C. has not given us the plan on which biſhops are to be ſent to America, with that openneſs and candour that might have been expected.</p>
            <p>But this is not the only reaſon we have to ſuſpect, that there is ſomething more at the Bottom, than what Dr. C. ſeems wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to confeſs. Sundry paſſages in the appeal (where Dr. C. was off his Guard and therefore expreſſed the true ſentiments of his heart) ſeem to convince us, that the laity muſt yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the new ſpiritual lords, and ſubject their unpractiſed necks to the eccleſiaſtical yoke preparing for them. We ſhall point out ſome of theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The church, ſays he, conſidered with relation to civil power, being in the very nature of it a voluntary ſociety, it is left to men's conſciences, whether they will become members of it or not. But after they are become members of it, the laws of the church are in force againſt them, and they are ſubject in eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical matters to the authority of thoſe who govern it. What the juſt penalties of diſobedience are, we may learn from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the church itſelf. The utmoſt effect of its power in this world is the cutting off and rejecting ſuch members, as are incureably and dangerouſly corrupted.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">App. p. <hi>30.</hi>
               </note> Let the world, to which the doctor appeals, judge how conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent this is with the declaration, <q>That the American biſhops are to have no authority, nor indeed to exerciſe any diſcipline over their own people, the clergy excepted.</q>

            </p>
            <p>Again Dr. C. tells us, <q>When biſhops were firſt propoſed or requeſted for this country, they were mentioned under the title of ſuffragans. This is no ambiguous term, it has a fixed and determinate meaning in the Laws of England, and cannot be miſtaken.

Is it not an office merely epiſcopal to take notice of and to puniſh the irregular and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous behaviour of the members of the church, to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of ſcandal and cauſes matrimonial? If theſe ſuffragan biſhops muſt hold their commiſſions from the biſhop of London, or any other biſhop in England, and diſcharge all parts of the epiſcopal office in the colonies, as being remote parts of his lordſhip's dioceſe, and if his power is fixed and determined by the laws of England, it is plain beyond contradiction, that the deſire of the miſſionaries is to have ſuch ſuffragan biſhops import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into America, as ſhall have authority to exerciſe all the powers given them by the laws of England, although D. C. is obliged to confeſs that ſome of theſe eccleſiaſtical laws bear hard upon Britiſh liberty and need an amendment.<note n="†" place="bottom">

In vain therefore, will the laity expect (if they diſoblige the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy) to eſcape the <q>utmoſt effects of the church's power in this world;</q> happy for them, ſhould their poverty hinder them to commute and purchaſe a pardon, if they eſcape her power in world to come; and if her excommunicated members are not made to feel, after death, or on the other world, the due effects of her ſore diſpleaſure. 'excommunication,' it is true, has, among proteſtants, loſt much of the dreadful force' it once had in the Romiſh church, but Dr. C. it would ſeem by his modeſt hint, is not without hopes or at leaſt without deſire of 'reſtoring' it in America. Happy will it be for Americans if 'this power of the church' be confined to thoſe who willingly 'become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it.' There is reaſon to fear, that the members of every other communion will feel the effects of it, in this remote part of
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:010857_0164_0F851E409F99DBE8"/>his lordſhip's dioceſe, when his ſuffragan biſhops come over here <q>with as full and complete authority over the clergy as the laws and canons direct.</q> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 31.</note> For although it may appear miraculous, that a church ſhould excommunicate or caſt out thoſe that never did belong to her; yet we know that the church of England daily works ſuch miracles; and we have no reaſon to doubt, that the ſuffragan who is 'to diſcharge all epiſcopal offices' will exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in America the ſame evidences of his apoſtolic deſcent.</p>
            <p>But leſt there ſhould remain any doubt about the power of this American ſuffragan, or the plan, upon which he was firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted for the benefit of the colonies, the whole affair is ſettled with ſufficient preciſion, in the words of the ſupplicants, as Dr. C. has recorded them.<note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See notes in p.</hi> 49, 50, 51, 52.</note> Their requeſt was 'that ſuch gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors in the church ſhould be conſtituted' in America. '1ſt. to rule and govern well the people, who are deſirous to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, without which (they are the very words of the ſupplicants) no wonder if ſome members grow remiſs in their duty, if many fall into ſcandalous practices; and if atheiſm, deiſm, &amp;c. prevail over more,' '2dly, protect and defend both laity and clergy.' Their power and buſineſs as ſet forth in the abſtract quoted p, 52 is to 'govern both prieſts and people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the model of the Engliſh church.' This was the plan, upon which ſuffragan biſhops were firſt requeſted and to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in America; and Dr. C. ſays, 'he knows not of a ſingle inſtance, wherein reaſon has been given to ſuſpect that a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure from the ſame general plan has been aimed at or deſired.'<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 80.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The power then of theſe ſuffragans is to rule and govern both prieſts and people, according to the model of the Engliſh church; to govern well the people, who are members of their church and put under their care; to correct remiſſneſs in duty, ſcandalous practices, atheiſm, deiſm, &amp;c. and yet if we believe Dr. C. 'their authority ſhall operate only upon the clergy and not up-the laity, or diſſenters of any denomination.'</p>
            <p>Another thing I would juſt remark. It is agreed on all hands, that the American biſhop is to govern the clergy. Dr. C. tells us 'his power over them ſhall be as full and as complete as the laws and canons of the church directs,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 31.</note> and yet that 'ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual courts will never be eſtabliſhed here.'<note n="‖" place="bottom">96.</note> What is this but to ſay, that an arbitrary ſpiritual juriſdiction, unknown in the Britiſh conſtitution, and abhorrent to the rights of freemen is aſked and about to be eſtabliſhed in America. Alas for the poor clergy; if, when their characters and livings are in queſtion, they muſt hear from the mouth of a proud eccleſiaſtic, <hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo, ſtat pro ratione voluntas.</hi>

               <head>A WHIP FOR THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. XVI.]</head>
               <byline>BY TIMOTHY TICKLE, <abbr>ESQR</abbr>
               </byline>
               <epigraph>
                  <q>
                     <p>Here march my Grammarians, ſkilled to torture words; there my Sons of ſophiſtry, ever ready to wreſt a meaning,</p>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>PARNELL.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>A Perſon once aſked a ſcholar what was the meaning of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ff, which ſtands for the digeſts or pandects; and was hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourouſly anſwered that it ſignified <hi>Farrago ſarraginum;</hi> as much as to ſay—'an heap of miſerable ſtuff.' Or if a more literal tranſlation pleaſe thine ear, reader, the meaning is—'an hodge-podge of hodge-podges.'</p>
               <p>How juſtly deſcriptive of No. XII. of the American-Whig, is this anſwer! If thou wilt caſt thine eye upon it, indignant reader, thou wilt find it to be an heap, hoard or congeries, of miſerable ſtuff; an hodge-podge of hodge-podges. It conſiſts of three detached pieces—all worthy of the Whig and his aſſociates; but utterly impertinent to the diſpute now debating before the reſpectable tribunal of the public; and unworthy of its notice. And I ſhall ſo far imitate the Whig, as to depart from order—he is a diſorderly man,—depart, I ſay, from the order in which theſe pieces are placed, and begin with the laſt of them, and ſo proceed, as it were, by a retrograde motion.</p>
               <p>A gentle laſh will be ſufficient for each of theſe flimſy, ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs things. Now, the laſt is a letter to the Whig, from one of his under ſpur-leathers; filled with wrath againſt Dr. Chandler and his brethren, becauſe they ſometimes call the church of England, the church; altho' this is no other than the language which has been uſed by Engliſh writers ſince the reformation—diſſenters as well as churchmen. Calling meeting houſes by the name of churches, or independents, members of the church, is a very late refinement, and unknown to our forefathers. My eldeſt ſon, who is but twelve years old, can remember the firſt of this cuſtom. If any perſon however on reading that letter, can perceive one grain of ſenſe, or candour in it, he is welcome to it for his Pains.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of this multifarious Whig is another letter, ſigned Obadiah Wheeler, and written in the Weſt country dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; which is here palmed upon the public as an original, but
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:010857_0165_0F851E4169400F00"/>in reality is pilfered from an old magazine, and republiſhed with a very few alterations. Our plagiary talks away about <q>kowz, zowz and goozy chikz</q>—his fellow creatures; about giving a bribe to the American Whig, <q>to put in a cavie againſt a biz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hup.</q> Now, however unable the public may be to ſee the pertinency of this letter to the caſe of American biſhops; I am pretty confident they will be able to ſee an apparent connection between a bribe and the American Whig. The aſſociation of theſe in our ideas, is very natural; and ſo much for Mr. Wheeler.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That is to ſay, meaning and referring to part the firſt of this <hi>farrago farraginum,</hi> in which the American Whig himſelf makes his perſonal and corporal appearance—It ſpeaks its origin plain enough. The author of it makes mention of 'the wiſdom of politicians—of wiſe and able ſtateſmen'—words, which come from his mouth, with equal propriety and grace as the words chaſtity and virtue from the mouth of a proſtitute. The burden and deſign of his production is to ſhew— <q>That the ſpirit of high churchmen is abſolutely incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with that of our excellent conſtitution; and was their power equal to their wiſhes, they would neither eat nor ſleep, before they had turned a limitted monarchy into an abſolute one—that when they talk of moderation, they mean want of power—that ſhould a future miniſtry be weak enough ****** to gratify the inſatiate ambition of ſome of our rampant, high church clergy, the colonies will be debauched from their loyalty—that an American epiſcopate would cut aſunder the cord which ties them to the mother country—for let them have but funds of their own by the management of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual father the biſhop—then adieu for ever to their political mother, old England.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And this zealous friend to our conſtitution and to old England, expreſſes his ardent love to both. But it unfortunately happens, <q>that he ſo unnaturally counterfeits the voice of a ſheep, that no reader upon earth can diſcriminate it from that of a wolf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is hard to ſay which is moſt to be admired, or which predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates moſt in this repreſentation—falſhood or malice.—This writer not only inſults truth, but the underſtanding of every reader. Altho' he ſingles out High churchmen, it is beyond any doubt, that by thoſe he means, all who have any degree of zeal for the intereſt of the church of England, or that would thwart his pernicious deſigns, and intolerant principles. What warm friends the clergy of the church of England, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly biſhops, have been to our conſtitution and liberties, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry page almoſt of the hiſtory of England fully evinces. And
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:010857_0166_0F851E4229C92C90"/>every page almoſt of that hiſtory refutes this infamous calumny, which is thrown out, to blind and debauch the multitude, by a faction whoſe principles, whoſe writings, whoſe conduct, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate them to be republicans, and enemies to our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—even to a limited monarchy.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here mention one memorable paſſage in our hiſtory, which will ſhew what warm friends to our conſtitution and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties thoſe were, whom our Whig calls high churchmen. James ii. was a weak, miſled prince—a dupe to popery and prieſts. He manifeſtly deſigned to introduce popery and arbitrary power in England, and overturn the reformation. One of the firſt and chief engines he employed for this purpoſe, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with thoſe laws, which exclude papiſts from places of power and truſt. At Oxford and Cambridge, if I remember right, the firſt attempts to exerciſe this diſpenſing power, were tried; where it met with all the oppoſition that the members of thoſe two illuſtrious univerſities could give it. Soon after this, the king ordered 'a declaration of liberty of conſcience' to be read in all churches thro' England; which was done only to pave the way for popery. With this the archbiſhop of Canterbury, and ſix biſhops who then happened to be preſent, refuſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; and preſented a petition to the king, remonſtrating againſt it; knowing that it had a direct tendency to let in popery, and deſtroy the liberties of the nation. And for this refuſal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, thoſe ſeven biſhops were clapt into the tower, and there held in durance. There was no event which contributed more to rouſe the ſpirit of the nation, point out its danger, and bring about the revolution, than this. Never was a nobler ſtand made for liberty than this was; yet theſe biſhops were ſuch as our Whig would call <hi>high churchmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very remarkable, that whilſt the church clergy oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe arbitrary meaſures, and refuſed to comply with king James's injunctions, diſſenters preſented ſeveral addreſſes of thanks to him on the occaſion. Even from New-England ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes were tranſmitted to king James, for granting a general liberty of conſcience. I will not anticipate the reader's reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on this occaſion; nor pretend to determine whether thoſe addreſſes originated from a deſire to ſee the church of England cruſhed; which muſt have fallen the firſt victim, being the ſtrongeſt barrier againſt popery and arbitrary power; or whether diſſenters were not impoſed on by ſpecious pretences and promiſes, and ſo lulled to ſleep by the king's emiſſaries.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add further at preſent, that when theſe particulars, and many more which the world ere long ſhall be informed of, are conſidered, our Whig, even in point of prudence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:010857_0166_0F851E4229C92C90"/>to his cauſe, were truth and juſtice entirely thrown aſide ought to be more cautious in aſſerting what none will believe, viz. that churchmen are enemies to the Britiſh conſtitution—<hi>parcius iſta nobis tamen objicienda memento</hi>—i. e. <q>Mr. Whig, remember you are the laſt perſon that ſhould upbraid us with ſuch things.</q>

               <p>JOY, joy, joy, my good friend Tickle. With all my heart I give you joy. I thought your victory complete when Sir <hi>Iſaac Foot</hi> (and a ſooty fellow he is) attacked you; but <hi>pro patria</hi> has put the matter out of a poſſibility of diſpute. I always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you as a man of conſiderable merit; but I can aſſure you that your reputation has gained much by the little, low, dirty tricks, that your adverſaries, eſpecially the worthies above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, have thought proper (if ever they thought at all) to have recourſe to. Strange it is, that ſome people will pretend to write before they have learned to read! I thought the knight the moſt illetirate and inſignificant of all the race of Adam; but <hi>pro patria</hi> has convinced me of my error. I am therefore ſo far indebted to him. Nor am I the only perſon whom he has laid under obligations. You yourſelf, Mr. Tickle, are much beholden to him. He has laid hands upon you, Mr. Tickle; he has ordained my friend the ſquire. Well; may I periſh, but he is a good-natured ſoul! He has ſaved you the trouble of a couple of 3000 miles voyages, and the expence of many a thirty ſhilling bill. If you are not the moſt ungrateful of Men, as he is the moſt contemptible, you cannot but thank him.—But perhaps you do not allow the validity of preſbyterian ordination? Mr. Tickle, Mr. Tickle, you are utterly miſtaken, Mr. Tickle. Not only <hi>pro patria,</hi> but all the other Independents in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſay the ſame. What they think is a different matter. But ſo many of them, from time to time, having been re-ordained by biſhops, is no good argument in their favour. Nay, I am convinced, and ſo are they too (and, <hi>hinc illae lacrymae</hi>) that if epiſcopal ordination could be had upon as eaſy terms as preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, four fifths of the whole clan would be happy in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. This their followers know, and therefore are ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly bitter againſt the introduction of a biſhop to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. They would ſink into their primeval nonentity. And as for the threats againſt the perſon of a biſhop, they know in their hearts that they durſt not touch a hair of his head. However, it ſerves to ſhew their ſpirit of perſecution, for which they have ever been infamous, and which I am perſuaded they will always exert, when ever they have the power to do ſo. But it ſeems,
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:010857_0167_0F851E434542FC20"/>Mr Tickle, that you have ſaid the Whig is written by a faction. Is this excuſable? Is this, my reverend friend, (I aſk pardon for not giving you the title ſooner) is this language for a Chriſtian man,—for a Chriſtian miniſter? Truth is not to be ſpoken at all times; and this, quoth <hi>pro patria,</hi> is not the proper time. And <hi>pro patria</hi> ſaith well. He took his cue from his beloved Whigs; and as they have not thought expedient to ſpeak it, pray why ſhould you? <hi>pro patria</hi> is a wight of much diſcernment. <hi>Pro patria</hi> knows the faction. <hi>Pro patria</hi> follows their example. <hi>Pro patria,</hi> If I am not much miſtaken, was employed by the faction to do their dirty work; and I am ſure that <hi>pro patria</hi> is a very proper inſtrument. In time, both he, and his friend Sir <hi>Iſaac,</hi> may be equal to their maſters. <hi>Par nobile Fratrum;</hi> if peradventure they be two.

               <p>I Should now purſue my confutation of the divine right of dioceſan epiſcopacy (a doctrine which Dr. Chandler has very unneceſſarily obtruded on the public, and which I am therefore compelled to conſider, in order to give a complete an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the appeal) but having promiſed, in my firſt number, not to fatigue the reader with the dry cruſt of unſavoury con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, I ſhall endeavour to relieve his ſpirits with a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſcene. As to the ſubject now ſuſpended, I ſhall ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, and hope ſo effectually to expoſe the abſurdity of that pretence, as well as thoſe two other pretty prieſtly conceits,— <hi>confirmation,</hi> and the <hi>uninterrupted ſucceſſion,</hi> as to prevent the
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:010857_0167_0F851E434542FC20"/>moſt bigotted conventioner, from ever re-introducing them into the company of Chriſtians or gentlemen.</p>
               <p>In a letter of biſhop Kennet, printed in the hiſtory of his life, that excellent prelate has theſe memorable words: <q>He was</q> (ſays he, ſpeaking of the great and good Dr. <hi>Teniſon,</hi> then late arch-biſhop of Canterbury) <q>truly ſenſible, that at home and abroad we were in great danger of loſing Chriſtianity, in the name of the church. The two great difficulties that lie hard upon our ſociety, for propagation of the goſpel, are, (1) The want of ſober and religious miſſionaries; few offering themſelves to that ſervice, for the glory of God, and the good of ſouls; but chiefly to find a refuge from poverty and ſcandal. —(2) Such men, when they come to the places allotted them, forget their miſſion; and, inſtead of propagating Chriſtianity, are only contending for rites and ceremonies, or for powers and privileges, &amp;c.</q>—What particular conduct of the miſſionaries that venerable prelate then reſented, with ſo much Chriſtian zeal and impartiality, I cannot determine. But that many of them have, for ſome years paſt, made a practice of giving themſelves an air of importance, in their letters to the ſociety, at the expence of truth, will appear evident to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who will be at the pains of peruſing the fulſome extracts annexed to the anniverſary ſermons preached before that board. —That they have lately entered into a combination to aſperſe the American colonies, in which they reſide, in order to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their darling project of an American biſhop, repreſenting his majeſty's ſubjects, of every denomination, differing from their own, as entertaining principles, unfriendly to our excellent conſtitution; (for which they know in their conſciences, there is not the leaſt colour of pretence) is abundantly apparent from the following letter. On this notable epiſtle, I ſhall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent make no other obſervation, but that the public may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on it to be genuine, and that I have no other reaſon for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the author's name, than my diſinclination to expoſe him to the righteous indignation of his injured country; but that if either of the two weekly ſcribblers for the convention, will inſiſt on his being made a ſacrifice to the popular reſentment, for his ſcandalous miſrepreſentations of the moſt loyal people in the world, rather than loſe the pleaſure of charging me with a faſhood; they may make their challenge with their uſual friendſhip for truth and decency, and they ſhall be gratified. I have only to add, that I have printed a few lines in Italic, for the reader's preſent meditation; intending hereafter to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remarks on thoſe extraordinary paſſages.</p>

               <p>THE cauſe of the church in America is ſo ſacred and intereſting a point, that every faithful friend to it, who even ventures to wiſh himſelf able to contribute the leaſt in its favour, diſcovers a well affected zeal to expreſs his affection, and intreat the promotion of it. This indeed more evidently appears in the clergy, where it ought to appear; having the concurrence of all, from whom the beſt wiſhes, and their religious needs in the preſent imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate which they enjoy, the church can only be expected to ſtrengthen and enforce the common plea; and alſo the adjuvant agency of others, that are conſpicuous enough to afford ſome encouragement from their endeavours, ſpirited by that ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for the church, which the faith of the invaluable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhe contains in her divine apoſtolic authority and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the wholeſome doctrines ſhe diſpences in the ſcriptures, animates. The clergy of ſeveral of the provinces have reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively tranſmitted addreſſes to the throne, and ſome of the chief dignitaries of the church, and the incorporated ſociety, for an American epiſcopate, to engage as extenſive an intereſt in the affair as might be practicable; <hi>particulars have thought it expedient, and have applied to ſuch perſons as might, and from whom they had good grounds to hope, would be uſeful in a caſe ſo greatly beneficial to us,</hi> and the act ſo highly charitable to them; ſolicitous to bear a part in every effort of this kind, joint as well as ſeparate, I take the freedom to propoſe the ſubject to you, as what I am perſuaded muſt be eſteemed by you, ſufficient to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit your cloſeſt attention; the cauſe is ſacred to the honour of God, and the ſouls of men: We alſo apprehend it ſo to the health of the conſtitution; a conſideration proper to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, in theſe diſtant parts of his majeſty's dominions; and what is conceived may be advantageouſly improved, as the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in favour of it, may be more pointedly urged and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced upon the minds of different perſons, as they ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to regard the church, in a religious or civil view; or both together. Your connections with ſome of the nobility, and with his majeſty's chaplains, is apprehended to place you in a ſituation kind to this purpoſe; and this cheriſhes hopes of your readineſs and ability, to be uſeful among thoſe in this particular buſineſs. If the important affairs of the eſtabliſhed church, could be properly laid before, and ſubmitted to, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the duke of Chandois, and the earl of Carnarvon, in a

Should you think proper to do this, it is moſt earneſtly to be wiſhed, you would alſo uſe your endeavours, to influence the reſt of his majeſty's chaplains, to beſtir themſelves, among the circle of their reſpective acquaintance, to render the cauſe diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; and ſpirit as many as may be, ſeriouſly and conſcientiouſly to weigh the ſacred ſuffering cauſe of the church of God, which even a curſory reflection will openly ſhew, how it needs muſt do here; while we are in a ſtate imperfect and deſtitute, in a great meaſure, of that office and adminiſtrations, which our Lord has appointed in his church. It muſt be ſuppoſed that they, agreeable to the divine commiſſion they have received in our excellent church, were led to do holy ſervice at her altar, from the dictates and perſuaſives of a well directed conſcience: How then, with deference I obſerve, can they, in the faith of Chriſt's authority, adminiſter in her appointments as faithful ſtewards, unleſs they extend their attention and ſervice to her general intereſt, where ſhe is propagated, under the protection of his majeſty's government? As the faith is founded on the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian conſtitution, and the cauſe is common, not confined to this or that particular place or congregation, the miniſters of our common Lord owe a great reſpect to accommodate all, however diſpoſed for the advancement of that religion, in the orders that ſupport it, which they think expedient for themſelves to embrace.</p>

               <p>THE ſpleen and malignity, ſo remarkable in the American Whig, againſt the eſtabliſhed church, has, I dare ſay, rous'd the reſentment of every true ſon of that apoſtolic commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. However, as to myſelf, I, who have the honour to be a member of the ſame, have ſound no ſmall alleviation (under the arguments and inſults utter'd againſt it) from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all the logic, or ſatire, of him and the faction, will not be of the leaſt avail, either to himſelf or them: Nay, they will only augment their infamy and reproach, as I ſhall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate anon. Is it not ridiculous for a man to ſquabble with a kitchen maid, in the face of the public?—Would any but fools contend, when ſure of being foiled, and expoſing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:010857_0169_0F851E448F437498"/>and rancour, the view of the world? This is the caſe of the ſchiſmatics and Whig; they worry and vex themſelves in vain; being ignorant of the very ſcheme, by which our pious deſigns are conducted. At once to terminate their cavils, I ſhall diſcloſe the plan of our future proceedings, againſt thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p>The venerable ſociety (amidſt perſecutions and oppreſſions) have zealouſly proſecuted the pious deſign of chriſtianizing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters in America, and transforming them into members of the national church. The devout labours of their miſſionaries, have been rewarded with a plentiful harveſt. Numbers have been perſuaded to abandon the ſchiſmatical conventicles, which (as that venerable ſaint Mr, Checkly, avers) have neither a valid miniſtry or ordinances; and join'd the communion of our church: Religion, according to the liturgy, flouriſh'd. Ample account of theſe converts were tranſmitted to the venerable ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety at home, whoſe pious ſouls exulted at the ſucceſs, and were almoſt raviſh'd at the proſpect of epiſcopizing America. Theſe devout emotions, received, nevertheleſs, a mortifying check, by the moſt wicked reproaches of the faction. They had the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontery to traduce the characters of the godly miſſionaries, and of the ſociety itſelf. The latter they accus'd of perverting the end of their inſtitution; and that inſtead of employing their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and care, in converting the aboriginal pagans, to the Chriſtian faith, and knowledge of a Saviour; they wantonly laviſh'd their money, in perverting diſſenters; ſquandering large ſums in opulent towns, which were amply ſupplied with preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of irreproachable characters; while the indigent, and thoſe who were unable to ſupport the miniſtry, were neglected. The miſſionaries were repreſented as expending that charitable boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not in the leaſt in advancing Chriſtianity; but in ſeducing diſſenters, from the pure and unadulterated goſpel of Jeſus, to a perverted goſpel, and in teaching for doctrines the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men. Such were the malicious ſlanders, uttered by the faction, and dilently propagated by their abettors. Hereby the animating expectations of the venerable ſociety were blaſted, their perſons traduced, and many charitable donations reſtrain'd. Notwithſtanding, our dignitaries judging it neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſectaries, that they might not obſtruct their ſucceſs among the heathen, they vigorouſly proſecuted their beneficient plan, and their ſucceſs was adequate to their zeal. Many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted their former puritanical dogmas, and became zealous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors of epiſcopal faith. Pompous accounts of proſelytes were ſtranſmitted to that reverend body, which were confirmed by their lordſhips, and uſher'd into the world, with triumph and
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:010857_0170_0F851E45237875A8"/>joy. Thus the venerable board, continued to exert themſelves with unremitting ardour, amidſt the clamours of the faction; and, altho' by the animating accounts ſent by the miſſioaries, it was expected that ſchiſm would long 'ere now have been extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, and the whole American continent metamorphoſed into epiſcopalians; yet ſince the pious miſſionaries (as Dr. Chandler obſerves) had no other weapons to avail themſelves withal (while altar was ſet up againſt altar) but the feeble efforts of argument, which were common to the faction themſelves, no wonder their ſucceſs was not proportioned to their devout wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but after about ſixty years aſſiduous labour, the greater part ſtill retained their inveterate prejudices.</p>
               <p>Some of their lordſhips, in their anniverſary ſermons before the venerable ſociety, had laid it down as a maxim, 'that they could not expect to convert the heathens, 'till they had firſt chriſtianiz'd the diſſenters.' This was far from being effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and therefore, on the preſent plan, the heathen muſt be neglected to ſome far diſtant period. This rous'd their zeal to attempt ſome new expedient.—What muſt be done? They muſt rid themſelves of diſſenters, who obſtruct the converſion of pagans, to the religion of the liturgy! To epiſcopize them, is like to be the work of ages! The moſt compendious method imaginable, would be to change the ſpecies of theſe obſtinate hereticks, that they might no longer obſtruct the goſpel among the pagans. Accordingly, on the 20th of February, 1767, my lord of Landaff, in preſence of that venerable ſociety, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed the whole ſchiſmatical herd into <hi>'infidels, with more than brutal manners!'</hi> This rare atchievement was deſervingly approv'd by that reſpectable body, and the operator received their cordial thanks. This was a bold, but effectual 'ſtroke. This craft had been dormant from the venerable Circe, 'till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd by her preſent right r-v—d ſucceſſor; and no author ſince Ovid, has had the honour to record ſuch a mutation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept myſelf. The legends of Rome contain nothing worthy of competition. All obſtacles towards converting the pagans are now vaniſhed. Not a diſſenter remains in America. They are become fellow-infidels with their brethren, the natives.—No more clamour about perverting diſſenters. Good people may now be invited to give, for the ſole purpoſe of converting infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. By this a large field is opened for needy miſſionaries; and gain and godlineſs may go hand and hand. Yet, theſe quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam diſſenters, retain, even ſince their mutation, ſomething of their former rancour; which may be no ſmall exerciſe to our pious miſſionaries. It might (to ſpeak with ſubmiſſion) have been better, if they had been ſetenced ſlaves; for altho' the
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:010857_0170_0F851E45237875A8"/>Whig is an infidel, I doubt not he believes, his lordſhip with equal veracity and eaſe, might have denominated them negroes and ſlaves. Then like the Scythians of old we might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with Whips, and driven them from their poſſeſſions, to our no ſmall emolument. But they have been confirm'd infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and who dares diſpute epiſcopal confirmation? How long they are like to retain their preſent form, depends on their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Should they ſtill prove refractory, they might next be claſſed with the brutes; ſhould they conform to the liturgy, like Lucian's aſs, they might re-aſſume their priſtine form. What ſtrange transformation the obſtinate may ſtill expect, you may learn from example. Cr. <hi>Chauncey</hi> of Boſton, for diſputing the reality of this change, and inſiſting on the identity of former diſſenters, was immediately, by epiſcopalian ſlight, hooted into a ram-chicken, but has not yet been confirm'd in that character by a biſhop's hand. What changes will be inflicted on W. Livingſton, and the Whig, muſt be left to the wiſdom of the convention. They may ſuffer as many metempſycoſes as a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean, or ſhapes as a ſilk-worm. For the preſent it was determined, to laſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

None of the convention, tho' ſufficiently vexed, had courage to accept, They knew he diſavowed paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and ſhould they Whip, he might return the compliment, and repel his aggreſſor. On mature deliberation, Tabitha Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was unanimouſly choſen for this arduous office. She had been cook to the rev Mr. Diotrephes, and brought up in his kitchen and principles. She had the honour to belong to the church by law eſtabliſhed, and read exactly the prayers, and leſſons, of each day (without daring to exceed) in obedience to authority. Her favourite books were Checkly, Hudibraſs, and the ſervice book; all of which ſhe read with equal devotion. Her eſteem for miſſionaries aroſe almoſt to adoration—and her abhorrence of diſſenters to deteſtation. In her diſputes, ſhe was furious and loud; and when clamour could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, the broomſtick and ladle were call'd to aſſiſt. This hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine received a miſſion, to pelt and ſcold at the Whig<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But on her inveſtiture with ſo important an office, it was reſolved to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſe her ſex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dignify her with a maſculine name, as near as may be, ſimilar to her former. Accordingly, inſtead of <hi>Tibitha Kettle,</hi> ſhe aſſumed the name and title of <hi>Timothy Tickle,</hi>

                     <hi>Eſq</hi>
                  </abbr> Thus being maſculated, ſhe accepted her poſt; and having Hudibraſs in her pocket, to furniſh her with proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and arm'd with her uſual weapons, the broomſtick
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:010857_0171_0F851E45E3F39918"/>and ladle, ſhe march'd forth to begin the fray, on the 4th day of April, A. D. 1768.—Her ſucceſs muſt be defer'd to another time.</p>

            <p>IN clearing up difficulties and in adjuſting differences that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in any ſociety, it is the ſureſt way to look back to the original principles on which the founders proceeded; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine how they and their immediate ſucceſſors underſtood, and how they acted upon theſe inſtitutes. This has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be a regular procedure in civil policy, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding human laws: It ſeems ſtill more proper in revealed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whoſe author is infallible.

               </gap> writings and practice of his apoſtles: If they had always made the Bible their directory in faith and diſcipline; and determined to call no man on earth maſter, abundance of miſguided zeal, angry contention and cruel perſecution might have been avoided; much corruption in doctrine and diſcipline prevented; and the primitive ſimplicity of the goſpel better maintained.</p>
            <p>Moſt denominations of Chriſtians are indeed ready enough to appeal to ſcripture, and to be determined by it, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they think it favours their peculiarities. Nay they will
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:010857_0171_0F851E45E3F39918"/>torture it by forced conſtructions to ſpeak favourably of their diſtinguiſhing tenets, even where it would ſeem to expreſs a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary meaning. But the human inventions and corruptions of ſome churches are ſo plainly againſt ſcripture, or unwarranted by it, that this method of defence will not always anſwer. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is then had to tradition, pretended apoſtolic uſage, the ſuppoſed right of the church to decree rites and ceremonies, and to inſtitute new modes of diſcipline. (if not to add new articles of faith) for the ſupport of theſe innovations: A method by which almoſt any abſurdity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>error or uſurpation might be vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, and the Chriſtian faith intirely thruſt aſide, to make room for the weak or wicked devices of men.</p>
            <p>In the matter I have now in view, Dr. Chandler appeals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſcripture; though many will think, without good ground. However he cannot be charged with wire-drawing its meaning, as he adduces no particular proofs of what he never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs roundly aſſerts. The paſſage of his memorable appeal to which I refer is this; 'if we carefully examine the writings of the apoſtles, theſe things will evidently appear, that our bleſſed Saviour before his aſcenſion, committed the government of the church entirely to them;—that this government was exerciſed by them;—that they conveyed this power to others, to be communicated ſucceſſively to others to the lateſt poſterity;— particularly that theſe their ſucceſſors, were an order diſtinct from, and ſuperior to thoſe now called preſbyters; and that none who were not of this order, had the powers of ordination and government committed to them.' But although he does not ſtay to offer proof, yet he mentions for inſtances, <hi>James</hi> as dioceſan of <hi>Jeruſalem; Timothy of Epheſus; Titus</hi> of <hi>Crete;</hi> and the angels of the ſeven churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would have been ſatisfactory to many of his readers, if the doctor had pointed out the paſſages in the New-Teſtament, which ſo clearly prove, that the great head of the church has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the government of it entirely to dioceſan biſhops, as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the apoſtles; becauſe ſo important a claim ought to be ſubſtantially ſupported. To inſtruct mankind in the doctrines of the goſpel, we indeed find a charge given, accompanied with a promiſe of power from on high to aſſiſt them in doing it. But even ſuppoſing this commiſſion and promiſe limited to the twelve, what do they make for the ſole authority of modern prelates? The apoſtles were an extraordinary ſett of men; they had no ſucceſſors circumſtanced as they were: Nor after the choice of <hi>Matthias</hi> in the room of <hi>Judas;</hi> and the divine appointment of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> do we read of any new elections. As they were to

               </note> it was not poſſible they could long continue a diſtinct order: Their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and name accordingly died with the generation in which they lived.</p>
            <p>In ordinary matters, the apoſtles, however, exerciſed no ſuck ſole juriſdiction. They preached and delivered the Chriſtian doctrines as of divine authority, and they proved their miſſion by works of an extraordinary nature; ſuch as the death of <hi>Ananias and Saphira,</hi> the blindneſs of <hi>Elymas,</hi> and the like. But in thoſe matters in which only their conduct can be exemplary, they did every thing with the common voice of the church. Thus were the deacons choſen. In this manner did they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in giving their judgment upon the controverſy at <hi>Antioch</hi> referred to the church at Jeruſalem, concerning the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Moſaic law over the gentile converts to Chriſtianity. St. <hi>Paul</hi> upbraiding the Corinthians for remiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſcipline in a caſe of inceſt, tells them <q>that when they were gathered together,</q> they ought, 'with the power of Chriſt,' to excommunicate the guilty perſon. And in his 2d epiſtle, ſpeaking of the ſame affair, he ſays, 'ſufficient to the man was the puniſhment, or cenſure, which was inflicted by many.' What became of the ſole authority of the biſhop in theſe caſes? How came the 'multitude,'<note n="†" place="bottom">

Nay', how durſt any teachers at <hi>Antioch</hi> to diſſent from, and diſpute with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabus,</hi> one, if not both of them, of the ſuperior order, to whom the government of the church. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dr. C. had been entirely committed? And whatever blame they incurred for error in doctrine, how happened it, that they eſcaped without cenſure for want of due ſubmiſſion to an apoſtle? The great Lord chancellor Bacon, who ſpeaks the general ſenſe of the doctor's church from the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till his time, differs widely from him. His words are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; I ſhall give them at large, He ſays, 'on reading the Scriptures, I never could find, but that God had left the like liberty to church government as to civil government, to be varied according to time, place and accidents: Which nevertheleſs his high and divine providence orders and diſpoſes. For all civil governments are reſtrained from God to the general grounds of juſtice and manners; but their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and forms are left free, ſo that monarchies, ſenates, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular ſtates, are lawful, and where they are planted ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:010857_0172_0F851E478E278518"/>inviolate. So in the church, the ſubſtance of the doctrine is immutable; but for rites and ceremonies, particular hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchies, policies and diſciplines of churches, they are left at large. It is proper therefore to return to the ancient degrees of unity in the church of God, which were one faith, one baptiſm; not one hierachy, one diſcipline.' This penetrating genius was ſo far from ſupporting the hierarchy of the church of England, (of which he was a zealous defender) even from primitive prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that he ſubjoins, 'the times of perſecution were excellent times for doctrine and manners; <hi>but are improper and unſuitable examples of external government.'</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the apoſtles conveyed this ſole power, which Dr. C. aſcribes to them, to others, to be handed down in ſucceſſion, is equally deſtitute of proof. If they aſſumed no ſuch power them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; if in the ordinary affairs of the church, they and the evangeliſts and elders, mentioned in Scripture, exerciſed none, how could they convey it over to ſucceſſors.<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Paul, who was an inſpired writer, in giving his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters to which his divine direction did not reach, could ſay, 'I ſpeak this by permiſſion, and not of commandment.' <hi>1. Epiſ. Corinth. vii. 6.</hi>
               </note> The paſtors and miniſters of the church, called by the people and ſolemnly ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by the apoſtles and evangeliſts, had the power of preaching the goſpel; and ſays a great writer, 'there is an empire in preaching:<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Jer. Taylor.</note> But the ſupreme direction of the affairs of the churches, as aſſumed by modern prelates, was exerciſed by none. The people jointly with their elders judged, even in excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. This paſſage of the doctor's implies the neceſſity of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion which he had juſt before aſſerted very explicitly; notwithſtanding the abſurdity of ſuch a notion, and the many inconveniencies attending it, have been often expoſed. Mr. Locke's argument againſt it is invincible. If, ſays he, a ſociety enjoys the benefit of the preſence of Chriſt, according to his promiſe, that 'where <hi>two or three</hi> are gathered together in his name, he will be in the midſt of them,' they want neither biſhops by unbroken ſucceſſion, nor any thing elſe neceſſary to the ſalvation of ſouls.<note n="‡" place="bottom">See the biſhop <hi>Stillingfleet's</hi> Iren. Cap. <hi>viii.</hi>
               </note> Is the Chriſtian miniſtry ſo eſſential to the being of a church, that it could not exiſt without it? By no means, ſay very able divines; arch-biſhop Crammer had this queſtion put to him; whether if all biſhops and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="344" facs="unknown:010857_0173_0F851E486D3B9AE8"/>of like nature is this, 'it is not againſt God's law, but on the contrary they ought indeed ſo to do.'<note n="§" place="bottom">Letter 1ſt, on toleration.</note> The truth is, the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt, as all other ſocieties, have the principle of all power and privilege reſiding in the body, not in the officers: And are competent to all neceſſary points. As in civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where a failure of the royal family, or other defect in the adminiſtration is made good by the inherent power of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; ſo in eccleſiaſtical, the church may interpoſe and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply every deficiency. All pretenſions then of the officers of the ſtate or church to indefeaſible hereditary right, are only derived from ambition and uſurpation, and can ſerve only to ſet them above controul. If the claim of a divine right in kings 'to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern wrong' be inconſiſtent with civil liberty and public happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the opinion that all authority and privilege in the church, reſides in the clergy, and is to be conveyed through an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſſion of biſhops, as ſucceſſors of the apoſtles, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Chriſtian liberty, and ſets the bleſſings of the goſpel on a moſt precarious footing.</p>
            <p>That biſhop and preſbyter are the ſame in Scripture, has been ſhewn in a former paper; and further, that many great men of the church of England have thought ſo. The inſtances of dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan epiſcopacy given by Dr. C. have no countenance from the New-Teſtament; for the notes ſubjoined to the epiſtles to Timothy and Titus, in the opinion of the learned, were added 500 years after theſe epiſtles were written. Titus was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind at Crete to ordain elders or biſhops (as they are alſo called) in every city, which would rather prove that he was an arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop. But it is evident Timothy and Titus were evangeliſts, employed in ſpreading the glad tidings of ſalvation to infidel nations; conſequently they had no ſettled charge. The prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Peter at Rome, and the prelacy of James at Jeruſalem ſeem much of equal ſolidity; and reſt equally on tradition. The angels of the ſeven churches in the prophetical language of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> are evidently put for the churches themſelves. But the prelatical cauſe labours much, when recourſe is had to ſuch precarious and ſlender proofs; which would not be offered if bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be had.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Am a member of the church of England, and zealouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to its doctrines and diſcipline.—For many years I have been retired from buſineſs, and ſpend the evening of my days on a pleaſant rural receſs, far removed from the noiſe and buſtle incident to cities and larger towns. My farm affords me all the neceſſaries and ſome of the conveniencies of life. As I am not engaged in the purſuit of riches or power, much of my time is devoted to the contemplation of <hi>heavenly things;</hi> ſome to a few favourite authors; and I, <hi>now and then,</hi> amuſe myſelf by reading the public papers, whilſt curling eddies of ſmoke wafted from the cheerful pipe, diffuſe a grateful odour thro' my little habitation.</p>
               <p>But with the utmoſt grief and indignation, I have obſerved of late, that a <hi>rude and virulent attack</hi> has been made upon the church, in ſeveral parts of the continent; and proſecuted in ſuch a manner, that, decency and candour have been ſacrificed, by writers 'hackney'd in the ways of men,' to the accurſed ſpirit of party and diſſention.</p>
               <p>What could have been the motive of theſe writers for ſuch a procedure, muſt be left to the ſearcher of all hearts: Sure I am, however, that it is contrary to the principles of Chriſtian charity;—that it can never ſerve the cauſe of truth and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; —that it breaths a ſpirit of bigotry and malevolence;— that it is inconſiſtent with the character of <hi>meek</hi> but <hi>firm</hi> aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the rights of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Whether it flows therefore, from minds imbitter'd by any <hi>diſappointment,</hi> or is the pure effect of zeal without knowledge;
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:010857_0174_0F851E49173302B8"/>in either caſe I condemn it; ſince we are taught by the oracles of divine wiſdom, not only to be <hi>wiſe as ſerpents, but alſo harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as doves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Virulence and rancour, with ſarcaſtic and illiberal reflections, can never properly ſerve a cauſe: They irritate, but do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, —they rankle in the boſoms of thoſe at whom they are aimed, widen thoſe breaches which for the honour of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to be cloſed up; and deſtroy that brotherly love which our Saviour ſo ſtrongly recommended to all his diſciples. To the eye of impartial reaſon, the authors of <hi>calumny</hi> ſuffer moſt by it; for they forfeit the heart-felt ſatisfaction, ariſing from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of innocence and integrity.</p>
               <p>Miſrepreſentation indeed, may prevail for a time: But it will not bear examination before which it flies, like the early miſt before the morning ſun.</p>
               <p>I have already ſaid, SIR, that I am a churchman by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion —As ſuch I pray for the <hi>whole Catholic church;</hi> and not for that alone, but for <hi>Jews, Turks and, infidels;</hi> for all the race of Adam, whether within the verge of Chriſtianity, or as yet miſerably enveloped in <hi>darkneſs and the ſhadow of death</hi>— Tho' I eſteem the <hi>doctrines</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi> of my own church to be the moſt pure, and conformable to the will of God: Yet in purſuance of the golden rule of "doing as I would be done by." I would have every one enjoy liberty of conſcience in the moſt extenſive manner.—This liberty muſt conſiſt, not in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately entertaining any ſet of religious opinions; becauſe at that rate there could hardly be any ſuch thing as perſecution; the ſecrets of the heart being un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>earchable to any but the Almighty —But it muſt conſiſt in the free, open, and undiſturbed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our ſaith; the being allowed publickly to worſhip God in that mode we eſteem moſt agreeable to him; a moral ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we ſhall not be hereafter prevented from thus acting; and an exemption from any peculiar and grievous hardſhips on a religious account.</p>
               <p>No ſect can be properly ſaid to enjoy liberty of conſcience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it has within itſelf the means of continuing its faith and worſhip. If the Preſbyterians were prevented from ordaining their paſtors in the accuſtomable manner, and among themſelves, I verily believe they would complain, that they did not enjoy liberty of conſcience in its reaſonable extent, ſince their religion could only be of ſhort duration.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I grant that every other denomination, not danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the ſtate, ſhould have liberty of conſcience, I think I may boldly challenge the ſame indulgence for the church in as full a manner at leaſt.—It has been alledged indeed, that the
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:010857_0174_0F851E49173302B8"/>church laboured under no hardſhips; and that on the contrary, there was danger leſt it ſhould become a church <hi>rampant and gubernant.</hi>—Let any one but reflect on a voyage acroſs a wide and boiſterous ocean; the many perils and dangers it preſents to our eyes;—the lives that are loſt thereby;—and the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious expence attendant on it:—Let him alſo reflect that the orders of the <hi>church of England</hi> can be obtained on no other, but on theſe diſcouraging terms; and then let him candidly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve me, whether this is a hardſhip or not?</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid to be a maxim in law, that equity is equality. <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas eſt quaſi Equalitas.</hi> If the church of England is not eſtabliſhed in <hi>America;</hi> yet I conceive, by the rules of equity, it ought to be upon an equal footing with other ſects of Chriſtians. Whilſt they can receive ordination in their native land and at a ſmall expence; why ſhould the members of the church be obliged to ſeek it at ſuch a diſtance, ſo monſtrous an expence, and imminent hazard of their lives?</p>
               <p>But we have been told, in one number of the Whig, that <hi>America</hi> will, in a courſe of years, be the happy <hi>Aſylum</hi> to which Britain muſt betake herſelf; when that iſland, at preſent the ſeat of empire, will become a province to ſome haughty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental power. As I quote entirely from memory, I muſt be excuſed, Sir, if I have not given the Whig's own words; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I believe his ſentiment is farthfully preſerved—Allowing that Great-Britain muſt betake herſelf to <hi>America,</hi> where ſhall the church betake herſelf for orders; ſince tis plain, the Whig does not intend to admit biſhops, with, or without a cargoe of carnalities, to accompany the other parts of the conſtitution into <hi>America?</hi> Nay, he tells us in another number, upon what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority I know not, that the introduction of a biſhop, however reaſonable, upon the plan propoſed, would produce a ſcene of diſorder, ſimilar to what we have experienced upon a late occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When this dreadful period therefore ſhall arrive, the church, ſo far from being <hi>rampant and gubernant,</hi> can be no more: Her ſons muſt, in direct oppoſition to their principles, go into the arms of independency, and ſee their religion (redeemed from the errors of Popery, by the blood of ſo many martyrs) give place to one, they eſteem far leſs pure, and leſs perfect.</p>

               <p>Another writer indeed, has attempted to cut the gordian knot which he could not untie.—The centinel propoſes that the convention ſhould aſſemble together; chooſe one of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:010857_0175_0F851E49A181AAD0"/>biſhop; and ſubmit to his authority. That writer ſhould have conſidered, however he plumes himſelf upon his invention, that the conſtitution of the church of England does not admit of <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> biſhops; and, that he might as well propoſe no expedient, as one that cannot be conſcientiouſly uſed.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Parmenio</hi> told <hi>Alexander,</hi> that were he in his place, he would accept a peace which that monarch thought diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: He made this noble anſwer, "that ſo would he, were he <hi>Parmenio.</hi>" The members of the convention, may in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, anſwer the Centinel, that they will elect ſuch a biſhop as he mentions, when they become Centinels; when they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the doctrines and diſcipline of the church of England, and can conſcientiouſly acquieſce in a form of church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, outwardly reſembling the epiſcopal, but actuated by Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent principles.</p>
               <p>I fear, Sir, that I have already exceeded the limits of your paper, and therefore ſhall only add, that tho' a novice in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, yet if you think this letter worthy of your notice, I ſhall take the liberty of writing my ſentiments to you hereafter, as occaſion preſents.</p>

                  <hi>The</hi> AMERICAN WHIG. [Numb. XXI.]</head>
               <p>HOW highly ſoever the reverend members of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may value their own rights and privileges, they certainly ought not to deſire any new immunities, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly tending to the abolition or infringement of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted rights of others. Did they really deſire, or was there the leaſt probability of obtaining ſuch an ideal biſhop, as they hold up to public view, in order to lull us into ſecurity, while themſelves are proſecuting their ſcheme, for procuring a true modern prelate, no other denomination ought in juſtice to give them any oppoſition. Thus far we are perfectly agreed. But the matter of difference between us is, that as the law ſtands they cannot have, nor indeed do they deſire, ſuch a biſhop as they would perſuade the world they are ſoliciting for. With reſpect to the impracticability of that project, it has already been conſidered; and may perhaps hereafter be more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ully diſcuſſed. I ſhall now endeavour to convince the impartial reader, that they do not deſire ſuch a biſhop; but that this pretence, like a ſyren ſong, is only intended to delude us to ruin. I am told the author of the appeal complains of it, as ill-uſage to be diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his proteſtations on this head. But whatever may be his character, as a man of veracity (as indeed in no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhould I diſcredit his word) he cannot require impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and I flatter myſelf to be able to convince any reaſonable man, that to believe his declarations on the ſubject matter now before us, is abſolutely impoſſible. For beſides the extreme ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of confiding in the promiſes of this ſort of gentry, when a darling project is to be carried, any longer than they labour under an incapacity of breaking them, it having been their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice to violate thoſe kind of engagements, whenever their deſigns were ſufficiently matured to defy oppoſition (as ſhall hereafter be abundantly ſhewn from hiſtory) it is evident from their preſent conduct, that a primitive biſhop is as far from their thoughts, as primitive Chriſtianity. And can they deſire us to take the word of their champion in ſo momentous a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it is ſo plainly contradicted by the proceedings of the convention? Have they in their petitions, have they in their letters, for a biſhop, ſaid a ſingle ſyllable about a primitive one? Have they not prayed for one, without mentioning any limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reſtriction? Is not the ſettlement the Dr. talks about,
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:010857_0177_0F851E4F53194070"/>a meer non-entity? and their refuſal to publiſh their petitions, an unanſwerable argument, that they will not, that they dare not, diſcloſe their real intentions? Nay it appears by the appeal itſelf, that were ſuch a biſhop really to come, he is to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into a down-right pontifical ſovereign, as ſoon as ever the epiſcopalians have ſufficient power, to ride the other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous denominations. We have therefore other reaſons for diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their ſpecious pretences beſides what may be drawn from that inſatiable thirſt of power, of which they betray ſuch violent ſymptoms. Our ſuſpicions are not barely grounded on their panting after deanaries and prebendaries, as the hart pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the water brooks: We have the declaration of their own advocate, that they are determined to enſlave us as ſoon as they can. For only attend to the gradual evolutions of his ſcheme; mark the progreſs of his reaſoning, to convince the world, of his deſiring only a harmleſs biſhop; and you will find how widely the doctor differs from—the doctor. The biſhops, ſays he, to be ſent to America (page 79) <hi>ſhall not interfere with the properties or privileges, whether civil or religious, of churchmen or diſſenters.</hi> No places of civil power are to be ſought for, nor accepted of. No taxes to be impoſed.—All this is plauſible enough; and had he ſtopped here, our faith had not perhaps been totally non-plus'd; tho' the bare conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the quarter it came from, had been ſufficient to give it a little daſh of incredulity. But in page 111, we ſtumble upon a very different ſtory. Here the maſque is dropped; and the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto diſguiſed humble petitioner, for a plain primitive apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic innoxious biſhop, appears an open ſturdy arrogant claimant for civil power, and worldly riches. So arrogant that whoever is oppoſed to his claim, that is to ſay, whoever wants to hold him to his own word, before plighted with great ſolemnity, and without reſerve, is to be conſidered as a bad ſubject. <hi>If biſhops,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhould be inveſted with a proportionable degree of civil</hi> authority, neither would there be any reaſon for complaint. But is not their interfering with civil authority, a manifeſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with our civil privileges, contrary to the word of God, as well as to the doctor's prior profeſſion, and moſt explicit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? Yet this is no cauſe for complaint. He has indeed good reaſon to wiſh it ſhould not be complained of, ſince a more dreadful evil is ſo cloſe at its heels. For it ſeems the depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our civil privileges, is to be attended with the emptying of our purſes. His lordſhip's inveſtiture, with civil authority, will not ſatisfy the whole of this gentleman's demand. For what prelate would be content with power, without riches? We are therefore to be taxed for ſupporting him, in all the pomp
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:010857_0177_0F851E4F53194070"/>and ſplendor of an American Viceroy. But ſee in what a ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mealy-mouthed, half-choak'd heſitating, claiming, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, denying, avowing, bungling, manner, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband commodity is ſmuggled into port. <hi>Shall we not be taxed</hi> (page 107) <hi>for the ſupport of biſhops? I anſwer not at all. But ſhould a general tax be laid upon the country, and thereby a ſum be laid ſufficient for the purpoſe, yet I believe ſuch a tax would not amount to more than four pence in £</hi> 100, <hi>and this would be no mighty hardſhip on the country. He that would think much of giving the ſix-hundredth part of his income, to any uſe the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the country, ſhould aſſign, deſerves not to be conſidered in the light of a good ſubject.</hi> I can ſeriouſly ſay, I never met with any book in my life, that contain'd ſo much tergiverſation and hypocriſy, in ſo ſhort a compaſs. Pray, what does the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mean by a ſum ſufficient for the purpoſe? What purpoſe is it that any ſum is wanted for? Cannot a primitive biſhop go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the clergy, ordain and confirm, without four-pence in the £ 100 of our eſtates? It is therefore beyond all queſtion, whatever airs the gentlemen of the convention may give themſelves, on our not believing things incredible, that it is really (notwithſtanding all proteſtations to the contrary) the <hi>modern, ſplendid, opulent, court-ſavoured, law dignified, ſuperb, magnificent, powerful, prelate, on which their hearts are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;</hi> and of what would be deemed ſufficient for his purpoſe, I ſhall before I conclude this paper, give the reader a ſpecimen. I aſk further what does he mean, by telling the world that four-pence in the £ 100, would be ſufficient? Is not this repreſenting us as immenſely rich? And are not our enemies at home keenly enough bent on loading us with taxes, without having their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs ſtimulated by this gentleman's reſounding our imaginary affluence? For how many millions muſt we not be ſuppoſed to be poſſeſſed of, if four-pence in £ 100 would produce ſuch a ſum as I ſhall preſently ſhew, would be thought but barely <hi>ſufficient for the purpoſe?</hi> Has not his trumpeting our riches, for which there is no more foundation than for his impeaching our loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and equally ridiculous with his pretenſions of hearing the ſound of a trumpet that never ſounded, a natural tendency to whet the appetite of thoſe, who, like ſo many harpies, are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for our ſubſtance? Does not the Dr. know, that we groan under diſtreſſes unſpeakable? That we are involved in debts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable? That with reſpect to trade, to caſh, to buſineſs of every kind, the colonies were never in a more deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How unfriendly then to his native country, to inſtil ſuch falſe notions of our wealth, into thoſe who will probably turn them to our undoing?—And what does he mean by its being
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:010857_0178_0F851E4FD6B245B0"/>
                  <hi>no mighty hardſhip?</hi> Pray why ſhould the people, to gratify his pride and ambition, be laid under any hardſhip? king David ſcorned to build an altar on the threſhing floor of Ornan, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying him the full price, 'tho the generous man offered it to him gratis. He wanted not other people to pay for his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; nor to ſerve God at the proper coſts and charges of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters. Again, who can tell how great the hardſhip muſt be, before the gracious and candid Dr. Chandler will allow it to be a mighty one? Would not he think it a hardſhip, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one too, to be obliged to pay one farthing in a hundred pounds, to the ſupport of any other religious denomination in the world? And is this doing to others, as he would that they ſhould do unto him? However compliant this gentleman may imagine himſelf to be, before the experiment has been tried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, to unconſtitutional and partial impoſitions under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of law, others do not always meaſure the mightineſs of a hardſhip by the quantum, but by the partiality and injuſtice of the tax; and its being made a precedent for greater impoſitions. On theſe principles it was, that the late ſtamp-act was ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly oppoſed; and on theſe principles it is, that the tax levied on the non-epiſcopalians, for the epiſcopal churches in ſeveral of the counties in this province, has always been complained of as a hardſhip; and that by people who deſerve as much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the light of good ſubjects, as the doctor, or any of his fraternity. And who told him that the legiſlature of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or of any kingdom, is ſo unaccountable and omnipotent, as that every ſubject, who approves not of every act they paſs, deſerves, on that account, the cenſure he has been pleaſed to beſtow? Does he not know, that in all free ſtates, that part of the legiſlature eſpecially, which is compoſed of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people, is entruſted by the people for certain purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and that ſhould they violate their truſt, they would deſerve blame; and that conſequently no ſubject for blaming them, would himſelf deſerve to be blamed? Are his notions of paſſive-obedience and none-reſiſtance ſo ſublimated as to think, that if a future legiſlature of the colony in which he reſides, ſhould eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh popery, he would forfeit the character of a good ſubject, for thinking much of paying four-pence in £ 100 to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Romiſh religion? But as he is preparing the way for the proceedings of ſome future aſſembly, under epiſcopal influence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are anathematized by way of anticipation, ſhould we ſo much as liſp our diſcontent againſt a tax bill, of the nature of what follows.</p>

               <p>The afore-mentioned ſeveral articles and ſalaries are, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as moderate as would be thought ſufficient for the purpoſe; and at this rate, in order to raiſe the annual ſum expended on the hierachy (after having paid the two hundred and ninety-three thouſand, nine hundred and eighty pounds, for accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating his lordſhip with his domeſtic appendages) the province muſt be ſuppoſed to be worth one hundred and thirty millions, four hundred and forty thouſand pounds. A pretty piece of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence truly to tranſmit to old England! But it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to raiſe the ſum required at the rate of 4 <abbr>d.</abbr> in the 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> the Dr.'s epiſcopal legiſlature will be obliged to make a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent calculation; and as the preciſe value of the eſtates real and perſonal of the good people of this colony is, at preſent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, it will be neceſſary for his lordſhip, after the ancient
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:010857_0179_0F851E510C4A1E40"/>and laudable example (and which in all probability they will chriſten, as they now do confirmation, by the name of a divine ordinance) of William the conqueror, to introduce a dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day book of all our eſtates and effects, and who can tell but, according to that ſurvey, inſtead of four-pence in the £ 100, we may be ſaddled with £ 5 in the £ 100, to raiſe the above primitive and apoſtolic ſtipends. And is this the boaſted mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the convention? And do theſe people pretend to be the diſciples of that Jeſus, who had not where to lay his head; or the ſucceſſors of thoſe apoſtles, who travelled without ſcrip or purſe? Good God! what an impoſition on the reaſon of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind! what a ſhocking abuſe of the divine name and authority! By all that is dear and valuable, my friends and countrymen, I entreat and implore you not to ſuffer yourſelves to be deceived, by the idle pretence of a primitive biſhop; when they, maugre all their refinements in artifice, ſo plainly diſcover their real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Of all bondage, ſpiritual bondage is the worſt. But we are to be involved in bondage, both civil and eccleſiaſtic. Pray gentlemen, ponder this momentous matter.—If you do not conſider, poſterity will feel. Firſt or laſt it will be known who are friends to the liberty of the country; the convention who thirſt for an hierachy, that would end in our utter deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the author of the American Whig, who is labouring to avert it. In ſo glorious a cauſe I deſpiſe their weekly calumnies, and that matchleſs abuſe and virulence, with which the tories (for ſuch we have lately diſcovered among us) have ever perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted all who ſtand in their way.</p>
               <p>In the above calculation, I have only taken notice of the field officers in the ſable regiment.—I have made no allowance for Subalterns (whom a man may number, that can count the ſtars of Heaven.) For as ſoon as the biſhops arrive, we muſt expect, as indiſpenſable concomitants, a great number of Vicars, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, &amp;c. Theſe are to be ſettled up and down, thro' every town and country in the province, which has but three or four families, that for their unhypocritical behaviour, have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled church-communion with the preciſe ones; and having manfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>BEING no lawyer, I ſhall not attempt a formal rejoinder to, but beg leave, as an ordinary by-ſtander during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proceſs in chancery, to make a few very obvious remarks on, <hi>Richard Pleadwell's</hi> (for I can't conſider it as the <hi>appellant's</hi>) labour'd replication.</p>
               <p>Par. 1ſt. He <hi>proteſts</hi> "that the matters and things in the anſwer of the appellees contain'd, are inſufficient to be replied unto," and that, it ſeems, becauſe they are (as he is pleaſed to call them) <hi>untrue.</hi> Now to ſuch an ignorant fellow as I am, nothing ſeems, at leaſt ſo well to admit of a reply as an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth;</hi> but Mr. P. ſcorning ſuch ordinary buſineſs, appears ambitious of the honour of replying to real truths, and deſirous of trying his abilities at defending the contrary. He in effect ſays, "the appeal was not proſecuted merely <hi>for the aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and exaltation of the epiſcopal churches on the ruin of all other Chriſtian denominations in his Majeſty's American domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>" In which, by inſerting the word merely, he at once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures the <hi>Whig</hi>'s correſpondent, and betrays himſelf and his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:010857_0180_0F851E51B2DA91E8"/>for the word merely is not us'd by <hi>William Peer Williams,</hi> and as us'd by Mr. P. amounts to an acknowledgment, that ſaid <hi>aggrandizement</hi> on ſaid ruin, was at leaſt partly aim'd at by the appeal. If by the <hi>good will, liking</hi> and <hi>approbation</hi> of the epiſcopal churches in general, with which he <hi>avers</hi> and <hi>inſiſts</hi> the appeal was inſtituted &amp;c. he means their <hi>formal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence,</hi> I beg leave to doubt of the truth of his aſſertion;— if thereby he means their <hi>ſilence,</hi> ſuppos'd expreſſive of aſſent, I ſhall not diſpute the point with him; <hi>ſilent</hi> they doubtleſs were, knowing perhaps as little of the <hi>appeal</hi> or its ſubject matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its publication, as the non-epiſcopalians themſelves; of which laſt I never yet heard a ſingle perſon ſay he thought it <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>reaſonable,</hi> or that he had no objection to make to the propos'd introduction of a biſhop.</p>
               <p>Par. 2d. 3d. 4th and 5th. Our repliant (whoever he be) not only ſpeaks of ſeveral things as manifeſt, which are by no means ſo, but pretends to know ſo well the conſciences and hearts of Dr. <hi>Ch—r</hi> and the convention, that I am autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd to conclude, that the council for the appellant is either the convention, the individual appellant himſelf, or ſome ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple mortal, who out of the folly of his own heart, has without any conſcience at all, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>en it into his head to patronize the cauſe. That it is the convention in a body, I'm not inclin'd to believe; for it were a ſad caſe indeed, if no one in ſo reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body as between 20 and 30 miſſionaries met in order to write againſt Whigs, cou'd excogitate ſomething new, without tiring the court with nauſeous repetitions. The appellant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is ſurely a man of too much ſenſe to chew ſuch an inſipid cud over and over again, or to make ſuch poſitive declarations as to what had or had not enter'd into the hearts of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Nor would he certainly have retain'd as council ſuch a ſimpleton as <hi>Richard Pleadwell.</hi> It is therefore manifeſt, that he is ſome ſtupid pettifogger, the fire of whoſe zeal has expos'd him to his own charge (par. 6th) of having ſurreptitiouſly, wilfully and corruptly, contrary to law, taken upon himſelf to appear as council for the appellant, and made him as liable as he ſuppoſes the council for the appellees to be, to a writ of maintenance.</p>
               <p>On par. 6th and 7th I have to obſerve, that with regard to the point in queſtion, it matters not whether the American epiſcopal clergy be rich or poor, reaſonable or exorbitant in their claims, potent or impotent, whether there be a dean and chapter or not, and whether the king's Conge d'elire can or cannot obtain in America; whether there is or is not a manifeſt propriety and fittneſs in point of policy, that the king ſhou'd be the
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:010857_0181_0F851E51F4BFA1B0"/>head of the church, where-ever it is eſtabliſhed by law; whether the church of England is or is not eſtabliſh'd in the colonies; or even whether the Doge of Venice, is or is not Mayor of the city of New-York.—However I ſay theſe things may be, the concluſion drawn from the ſtatutes produe'd, remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtible, and is confirm'd (if that can be any confirmation) by even the oaths of the ſubſcribing Engliſh clergy, in ſpite of all Mr. <hi>P.</hi> has ſaid, who wou'd fain mince down an abſolute dependance upon, into a derivation of certain powers from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laws. Thoſe ſtatutes were not as (Mr. <hi>P.</hi> miſtakenly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes) advanc'd to prove "that there can be no right of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy excluſive and independant of human laws;" but that there actually is no ſuch right within the realm of England. And ſince <hi>non dat quod non habet,</hi> ſince all the prelates of Great-Britain can by conſecration confer no diviner right than they have themſelves, it is manifeſt, that the right of epiſcopacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from England, in whatever manner biſhops may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, can never become more divine in America. So that on the whole Mr. <hi>Pleadwell</hi> pleads very ill; and his two para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs under conſideration, as well as the divine right of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy evidently are equally nugatory with the divine right of geography. Were we to reaſon in Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s way, we might ſay, "one might as well ridicule the divine right of ordination as the divine right of popery," this laſt being indeed an higher degree of epiſcopacy; but the truth is, with regard to divine right, epiſcopacy differs as much from ordination as in practice epiſcopacy does from preaching; which difference is evident from the pious examples of moſt of the biſhops in Great Britain.</p>
               <p>In replying to the ſecond cauſe of demurrer, reſpecting tithes, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> alledges, that a biſhop's title to them cannot be try'd by an ejectment at law (as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> for his client had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted) but (o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The true meaning of the word <hi>profert</hi> in law I know not; but this I am clear in, that if all Dr. <hi>Ch</hi>—r<hi>'s</hi> repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are juſt (however inſenſible, repugnant and contradictory the terms may be) the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> negroes, tho' infidels, muſt needs be virtual church-men.</p>
               <p>For over-ruling the 4th cauſe of demurrer, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> comical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eno'conceives it "ſufficient to find that an harmleſs biſhop is known in the goſpel", but alas! reaſoning from <hi>the goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>the laws of</hi> Great-Britain, will never anſwer. <hi>Harmleſs biſhops,</hi> in the true ſenſe of the word, there have been, and I doubt not are; but ſuch I aver are not as ſuch, known in the law.</p>

Mr. <hi>P.</hi> it ſeems, proteſts againſt the ſentence given by the appellees as premature, on pretence that the iſſue between the parties was not duly joined. What was wanting to a right iſſue, I wiſh this juriſprudent gentleman wou'd inform the public.</p>
               <p>Par. 8th, No. X. Mr. P. in circumlocutary phraſes tells us, "that from time immemorial it hath been manifeſt, that ſome perſons <hi>ever will</hi> diſapprove &amp;c." He muſt needs be a long-headed fellow, to diſcover the connection between time paſt immemorial and time future indefinite, and from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Mr. <hi>P.</hi> it ſeems, deſpiſes the <hi>diſapprobation</hi> of the appellees Dr. <hi>C.</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to.—What! ſlight the opinion of the court, and charge its deciſion as <hi>impertinent</hi> and <hi>immaterial!</hi> What a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen fac'd fellow!

               <p>As to the <hi>conventional petitions,</hi> if they are indeed ſo unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable as is pretended, 'tis mighty ſtrange we can't ſee them produc'd in court; for I dare ſay, the bare word of no partizan, whatſoever will be taken on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>That the appellees or their anceſtors in America, (it matters not which, it ſeems) have ever perſecuted the <hi>church,</hi> i. e. to be ſure, the <hi>church of England,</hi> is by no means certain; and indeed to endeavour to make her a <hi>church-militant,</hi> had been a ſilly attempt in any, for ſuch ſhe always has been in America, and that not a church militant <hi>defenſive,</hi> but a church militant <hi>offenſive;</hi> having always very characteriſtically promoted her own intereſt at the expence of other churches, and ſhe is now evidently <hi>militating,</hi> as ſhe has lately been <hi>ſtratagematizing</hi> to become a church, <hi>triumphant, rampant</hi> and <hi>gubernant.</hi>

               <p>IN the XIIIth Num. of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> the <hi>American Churchman</hi> again makes his appearance. Concerning this writer, I have now two or three conjectures to make, which ſeem to me to affect the merits of his paper; and I think there is conſiderable <hi>preſumptive evidence</hi> to ſupport them. My firſt conjecture (which has been before hinted at in my VIth Numb.) is, that this <hi>American churchman</hi> is only the <hi>American Whig,</hi> who has put on the <hi>appearance</hi> of a churchman, that he may the more effectually <hi>deceive</hi> and <hi>deſtroy.</hi> The hints for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, he might poſſibly borrow from an ancient adept in this ſame <hi>trade of deceiving,</hi> who we are aſſured by good authority, can, when occaſion requires, <hi>transform himſelf into an angel of light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My ſecond conjecture is, that he is ſome <hi>paltry retainer to the law,</hi> or has got ſome pitiful poſt; and that he is afraid of having his conſequence, or, what may be of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to <hi>him,</hi> his <hi>fees,</hi> leſſened by the arrival of a <hi>biſhop:</hi> This may be the reaſon why he is ſo violently "oppoſed" to biſhops and ſpiritual courts.</p>
               <p>My third conjecture is, that this <hi>American churchman</hi> is ſome <hi>delinquent,</hi> who having ſuffered on the other ſide of the <hi>atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> according to his demerits, in a ſpiritual court, thinks he may ſafely vent his ſpleen and malice at the diſtance of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand leagues.</p>
               <p>Theſe conjectures appear probable to me; I may however be miſtaken; I pretend not to <hi>infability: That</hi> I leave to their <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> the <hi>pope,</hi> and the <hi>American Whig.</hi> Which of <hi>them</hi> has the beſt right to it, they may at their leiſure determine between themſelves. But that the <hi>American Whig</hi> has very high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to <hi>infallibility:</hi> and that he never will ſuffer the <hi>pope</hi> to ingroſs it all to himſelf, may be made very evident by a few queries, <hi>viz.</hi> What evidence has the <hi>American Whig,</hi> that the clergy want not ſuch a <hi>primitive biſhop,</hi> as is ſpecified in the
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:010857_0182_0F851E52AC52AE00"/>
                  <hi>appeal;</hi> but on the contrary, a <hi>modern, ſplendid, opulent, court-favoured, law-dignified, ſuperb, magnificent, powerful, bloody-minded, Sin promoting, conſcience-killing, ſoul-deſtroying, hell-deſerving</hi> prelate?—<hi>Anſ.</hi> His own <hi>infallibility.</hi>—What evidence has he, that in the ſeven abominable petitions, which he ſays were ſent to <hi>England</hi> by the convention, the loyalty of the <hi>diſſenters</hi> was impeached?—<hi>Anſ.</hi> His own <hi>infallibility.</hi> What proof has he, that theſe petitions were <q>hatched by a few warm miſſionaries in the provinces of <hi>New-York, New-Jerſey,</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi>
                  </q> and that the church people in general, nay, almoſt univerſally, are <hi>oppoſed</hi> to the introduction of biſhops into <hi>America? Anſ.</hi> His own <hi>infallibility.</hi>—The reader may purſue this hint at his leiſure: I have a few words more to ſay, concerning courts.</p>
               <p>No perſon that I have heard of, ever propoſed the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpiritual courts in <hi>America:</hi> It is a meer bugbear, with which the <hi>American Whig,</hi> and his <hi>underſtrappers,</hi> endeavour to frighten the good people of theſe colonies. And if the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual courts in <hi>England,</hi> deſerve all the ſevere things that he has ſaid of them, I fancy it is owing, neither to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe courts, nor to the judges, but to the lawyers. If any one doubts, whether the common law courts even in this province, are in ſome degree of bad eſtimation, let him aſk the people,—To what is this owing?—To the judges?—By no means. They are all of them men of excellent characters, and do honour to the poſts they fill. Is it owing to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the courts? That cannot be imagined. Is it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore owing to the evil practice of <hi>ſome of the lawyers,</hi> that our courts are ſunk in the opinion of the people? <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>avarice,</hi> will, I preſume, produce much the ſame effects in a <hi>lawyer,</hi> that they do in a <hi>clergyman.</hi> Let thoſe among the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers whoſe abilities. integrity, love of juſtice, and contempt of riches, exempt them from the above accuſation,—let them I ſay, expoſe the unworthy members of their profeſſion, who, by perplexing the plaineſt caſes, by artificial delays, and exorbitant demands, have ſunk an honourable and uſeful profeſſion into ſuch a degree of contempt, that in the judgment of the majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people of ſeveral counties in a late election, a lawyer was deemed unworthy of a ſeat in our aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>American churchman</hi> affirms that, <q>It was the violence of a few bigots, that obliged the government to ſhut up the convocation;</q>—at the ſame time he allows the meeting in convocation, or ſynods, to be <q>a privilege or right, perhaps eſſential to the well-being of the church of Chriſt.</q> This is ſuch a reflection upon the juſtice of the government, as none but
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:010857_0183_0F851E536BA94AB8"/>a <hi>madman</hi> or a <hi>Whig</hi> would have made.—There were a <hi>few bigots</hi> in the convocation, therefore the government,—the <hi>kings of the houſe of Hanover,</hi> ſays the <hi>American Whig,</hi> I think, in one of his papers,—have deprived the <hi>church of England</hi> of <hi>a right eſſential to the well-being of the church of Chriſt.</hi>—Can this be true? Would a <hi>Chriſtian government,</hi> or a <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> for the fault of a <hi>few men,</hi> deprive <hi>a national church</hi> of <hi>a right eſſential to the church of Chriſt?</hi> Verily, Mr. <hi>American church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> I have more reaſon than ever to fear, that your <hi>manners are corrupted by evil communications;</hi> and that your new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, the <hi>American Whig,</hi> has taught you the <q>
                     <hi>ſcurvy trick of lying for,</hi>
                  </q>—what you may poſſibly think,— <q>
                     <hi>the truth.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>American churchman</hi> cenſures the conduct of the clergy, for preſuming to addreſs or petition the king upon the ſubject of <hi>American biſhops,</hi> without aſking leave of the governors of the provinces, of the biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and ſome of the laity.—ſuch I ſuppoſe, as himſelf and the <hi>American Whig.</hi>—Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this precaution was wholly omitted, or how far it was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, ſome people may hereafter be informed, to their no ſmall aſtoniſhment. But I have always underſtood, that ſubjects of the <hi>crown of England,</hi> have a conſtitutional right to petition the king for the redreſs of their grievances, without aſking leave of any perſon on earth. Why then may not the clergy exerciſe this conſtitutional right, as well as other ſubjects? If it is ſaid that they are not aggrieved; I reply, that they are as capable of knowing when they are aggrieved, as other people are.—Is it no grievance to be obliged, at a very conſiderable riſk and expence, to croſs the atlantic for orders? Is it no grievance, when a church becomes vacant, to be obliged to wait a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be ſupplied; oftentimes two or three years, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eight or ten? Is it no grievance, in caſe a clergyman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves diſorderly, to have no ſuperiour to call him to account, nearer than 3000 miles? Is it no grievance, to be deprived of what we really believe to be an apoſtolica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> rite?—Theſe, we think, are grievances, altho' the <hi>American Whig,</hi> and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings, affect to treat them as trifles. And for the redreſs of theſe grievances, we think we have a right to petition the king; as good a right as any other ſubjects have to petition for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of ſuch grievances as they find themſelves ſuffering under.</p>
               <p>The <hi>American Whig,</hi> and the <hi>American churchman,</hi> have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently affirmed, that a vaſt majority of people of all denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, are violently <hi>oppoſed</hi> to an <hi>American</hi> epiſcopate;—that a majority of the church people are as much againſt it as
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:010857_0183_0F851E536BA94AB8"/>others.—This I will not believe, even tho' his Holineſs the <hi>American Whig</hi> ſhould pawn his infallibility for the truth of it.—I remember in a late election, the cry of, no biſhop in <hi>New-York,</hi> did <hi>no good</hi> to thoſe who maliciouſly bellowed it forth. And in a <hi>neighbouring</hi> county, where the ſame faction ſet up an <hi>eccleſiaſtical weathercock</hi> for a candidate; after all his <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>praying,</hi> the cry of <hi>no biſhop,</hi> had juſt the ſame effect as it had in <hi>New-York;</hi>—nobody minded it.—Beſides, other people can judge, as well as <hi>American Whigs;</hi> and I have the greateſt reaſon to believe, there are ten people of other denominations, who are willing and deſirous of having biſhops in <hi>America,</hi> for one <hi>churchman</hi> that is againſt it.</p>
               <p>There are many other things in this XIIIth num. of the <hi>Whig,</hi> that are very exceptionable, which I have not room to take notice of. In ſhort, I doubt whether there is a paper in the nation (obſerve, I include <hi>all the colonies</hi>) of the ſize of it, that <hi>contains ſo many aberrations from the truth,</hi> and from ſound reaſoning—ten thouſand pardons of the courteous Mr. <hi>Wm. Livingſton,</hi> for encroaching ſo much upon his property, as to make uſe of one of his rhetorical flouriſhes.</p>
               <p>To the honour of the <hi>univerſity</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which this writer ſo foully aſperſes, it ought to be remembered, (and therefore I repeat it) that the firſt public oppoſition to the arbitrary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>king James</hi> the ſecond, began there; even at the time when he was complimented and flattered by the diſſenters; who in their fulſome addreſſes to the king, on account of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional ſuſpenſion of the penal laws, ſtiled the <hi>Roman catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> their good brethren. An addreſs of this kind was ſent from the independent teachers of the <hi>town</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> in New-England.—In ſhort, at this period, the diſſenters did every Thing in their power to rivet thoſe fetters, that the king was forging for the nation, until they found the oppoſition againſt him was likely to ſucceed; and then they ſhifted about, not chooſing to be of the loſing ſide; <q>for the children of this world are wiſer in their generation than the children of light.</q>

                  <hi>The</hi> AMERICAN WHIG. [Numb. XXII.]</head>
               <p>THE American Whig aſſerts in his firſt number, that Dr. Chandler, and the <hi>convention,</hi> do not want a <hi>primitive Chriſtian Biſhop.</hi> Upon this Mr. Seabury has been pleaſed to ſay, that "the Doctor and the convention (gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at leaſt at reſpectable as himſelf) meaning the author of the Whig, <q>are in fact accuſed of the groſſeſt falſhood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, pretending to aſk for a biſhop only upon the plan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the appeal, while it is not the primitive Chriſtian biſhop they want; <hi>which he,</hi> Mr. Seabury, calls a piece of effrontery and malice.</q> This gentleman, as reſpectable as he is, appears to be ſo tranſported with paſſion, that leſs regard is to be paid to his aſſertions, ſince ſuch intemperate heat often hurries men into expreſſions, which, when compoſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruffled, they cannot but condemn. But in the ſame miſtake per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the moderate and candid Dr. Chandler, in the concluſion of his celebrated tory—advertiſement. And <hi>Hierocles,</hi> who writes with ſingular ſeriouſneſs and ſolemnity, repeatedly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> biſhop.</hi> Thus if ſtrong reiterated, and ſerious aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will prove it, they are in a fair way of gaining their point. And ſince they ſo ſtrenuouſly inſiſt on the ſincerity of their profeſſions, which is undoubtedly, in the preſent controverſy, of the laſt importance: I ſhall, in this paper, endeavour to ſhew, by pointing out ſundry material differences between the primitive biſhop and the biſhop mentioned by Dr. Chandler, that they cannot expect to ſecure the public credit, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſolemnity of their proteſtations.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The primitive biſhop was choſen by the people, over whom he was to preſide: It was by the popular ſuffrage, that this or that man was appointed to this or that cure; as appears abundantly from the writings of the fathers. And the canons of the primitive church fully recognized this right of the people, to chooſe their own biſhop; and declared, that without ſuch election, they ſhould not be conſidered as biſhops. But the biſhop deſcribed by Doctor Chandler in his appeal, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be choſen by the people, over whom he is to preſide, but is an officer, for whom <q>application has lately been made
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:010857_0185_0F851E54E09D0790"/>to our ſuperiors by the clergy of ſeveral of the colonies.</q> He is one for whom addreſſes have been made to the throne, and earneſt ſolicitations to the ſovereign from time to time, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him. Page 50.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. There was one or more primitive biſhop or biſhops in every city, or town, where Chriſtianity was profeſſed. The apoſtle Paul appointed, that there ſhould be elders or biſhops ordained in every city, or town, of the <hi>iſland of Crete.</hi> And tho' <hi>Crete</hi> was but an iſland, yet being very fruitful, it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported many inhabitants; and is celebrated for its hundred ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thus, according to the apoſtle's direction, there were to be in this one iſland many biſhops. Nor was there any thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar in the circumſtances of thoſe iſlanders, that rendered it neceſſary to have more biſhops there than elſewhere. It was the common practice of the primitive church to have biſhops thus numerous, and thick ſettled, as appears from the moſt antient eccleſiaſtical records: The fathers often mentioning ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, on various occaſions, convening together, in different countries. But the Doctor's biſhop is to preſide over not only a great number of towns, but of colonies and provinces. He frankly acknowledges, that <hi>three biſhops on the continent are the moſt that have been mentioned.</hi> 107. Thus every town was, in the primitive times, to have a biſhop or biſhops; but three biſhops can now preſide over a vaſt tract of country of near 2000 miles in extent, from <hi>Newfoundland</hi> to <hi>Georgia.</hi> The primitive biſhops were <hi>to feed the flock which was among them.</hi> But this gentleman's biſhop is to feed thoſe who are diſtant from him, fifty, a hundred, or a thouſand miles; or rather not to feed them at all. For,</p>
               <p n="3">3d. According to primitive inſtitution, Biſhops were to be apt to teach, and to take heed to all the flock—to feed the church of God. But Doctor Chandler's biſhop is not to be a conſtant preacher; nor, as far as I can learn from him, to preach the goſpel at all. How then ſhould he feed the flock? And, if he ſhould even preach, how can he feed flocks ſo numerous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote? —But his buſineſs is not with the flock, but chiefly with the clergy, as if they were ſuch a diſorderly ſet of men, as peculiarly to require a biſhop to keep them in tolerable regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if this be true, how does it agree with the ſociety's abſtract, 1765. p. 58, in which they inform us, <q>Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> miſſionary, at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> takes occaſion, from ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections caſt on the miſſionaries, to bear the ſtrongeſt teſtimony to their unblameable conduct; of whom he thinks he may with truth ſay, that he does not know of any one miſſionary in New-England, who does not behave with miniſterial pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;

It is only with regard to the clergy that it is propoſed, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a ſtrict diſcipline. Page 31.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. The biſhop whom our author mentions, and whom he profeſſes that he and the convention deſire, is a gentleman whoſe coming he repreſents to have been hindered by the changes of gov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rnment—the revolutions of power—the oppoſition of contending parties at home—the intrigues of foreign courts—and the attacks of neighbouring kingdoms and ſtates, &amp;c. But ſuch occurrences were no obſtacles to the ſettlement of primitive biſhops in the apoſtles' time. We hear of no ſuch complaints in the new teſtament. The oppoſition of contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties in the Roman empire, &amp;c. did not prevent the apoſtles from appointing Chriſtian biſhops.</p>
               <p n="6">6th. The biſhop of the appeal is to be a grand perſonage, for whoſe ſupport and dignity, great preparations have been made, and are ſtill making; and after all, the Doctor is not certain they will be ſufficient, without <hi>a general tax of four-pence in the</hi> £ 100. P. 107. He ſhews that a committee has been extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily appointed, to find out ways and means for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſupport of biſhops in <hi>America.</hi>—That eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty-ſix pounds, ſeven ſhillings and five pence ſterl. hath been expended in purchaſing and repairing a ſeat for the reſidence of his <hi>American</hi> lordſhip—that it has been propoſed that the revenues of certain lands in St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this purpoſe, viz. the maintenance of two biſhops— that a fund has been appropriated for this end, which already conſiſts of ſeveral thouſand pounds ſterling (probably not leſs than ten)—And that as many have given liberally, on the
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:010857_0186_0F851E55A4DB1EA0"/>diſtant proſpect of its being wanted, it is not to be doubted but, if a biſhop or two were once fixed in America, others would make ſtill larger donations. Theſe, in all probability, will make a very conſiderable revenue. And yet the Doctor ſeems to think, all this may not be ſufficient; and therefore grants there may be a <hi>four penny tax</hi> laid on all the inhabitants; and certainly he was not diſpoſed to cede any thing, to the diſadvantage of his cauſe, unleſs he has great reaſons to force him to believe it was intended to be taken into the ſcheme of the epiſcopate. Now this <hi>four penny tax</hi> on all the inhabitants, as trifling as he is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it, would make a prodigious ſum. But were there any ſuch preparations made, and funds provided for the maintenance of the primitive Chriſtian biſhops? Was it by any divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appointed, that biſhops muſt be thus rich and magnificent? Are great wealth and ſuperb palaces neceſſary prerequiſites to a primitive biſhop? Where is the divine command, or primitive example, of ſo grand a prelate? What example could ſuch a biſhop ſet his poor flock, ſave that of pride, ambition, the love of the world, and temporal pomp and grandeur?</p>
               <p>Let the impartial reader duly conſider the preceding remarks, and then ſay, whether there be not an evident and eſſential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, between a truly primitive Chriſtian biſhop, and the lordly eccleſiaſtic deſcribed by our candid appellant? Is there no difference between one who is voluntarily choſen by the people, whoſe capacity and fidelity they have tried, and can confide in, and one impoſed on them by the ſtate, of whom they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Is there no difference between liberty and ſlavery? Is it not a privilege for the people to chooſe their own biſhops? Why then did Chriſt, the great king and head of the church, confer it upon them; Why did the primitive Chriſtians ſo highly prize it? Why ſo earneſtly contend for it?—Is there no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between having a biſhop or biſhops in every town, and but one or two on this vaſtly—extended continent? Is there no difference between a biſhop who feeds the flock, and takes heed to them all, and one who does not feed them, nor take any care of them, being wholly employed about the clergy? Is there no difference between one who faithfully adminiſters the deſcipline appointed in the goſpel, to all the proper ſubjects of it, and one who will not ſo much as attempt to diſcipline any of the people, be their offences what they will? Is there no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a perſonage of ſuch immenſe wealth, of ſuch dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and grandeur, as to eclipſe the governors of provinces, and ſtrike the populace wherever he approaches, with greater dread and reverence than the ſupreme magiſtrate; and the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:010857_0186_0F851E55A4DB1EA0"/>and lowly biſhop of the primitive church? If a man can ſee no difference between them, he muſt labour under a tory-jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or be totally blind.</p>
               <p>The coloniſts have not as yet, that I know of, made any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the epiſcopalians' having primitive biſhops. Such I believe would give no umbrage to perſons of other denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Moravians</hi> have their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No. And the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians may have, I doubt not, a thouſand primitive biſhops, without any moleſtation. They may make every miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a biſhop, without giving any ſort of uneaſineſs to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, provided they adhere to the primitive pattern.</p>
               <p>Hence it is evident, that Dr. Chandler and Mr. Seabury, <hi>Ariſtocles</hi> and <hi>Hierocles,</hi> have not the leaſt reaſon to make ſuch clamour about conſcience. For what is it that they plead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in this affair? Is it for a primitive biſhop in every town, to preach to his people, and feed his flock with the ſincere milk of the word, and diſcipline diſorderly members? Who has ever oppoſed this? Will they ſolemnly declare, that they are conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious in deſiring a biſhop of ſuch immenſe wealth, power and grandeur, as to be able to protect and defend them? Let them produce the divine rule that lays any obligation on-their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to requeſt ſuch an unſcriptural officer as this grand, opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, powerful, ſpiritual lord, and we cordially acquieſce. Nor have they hitherto given any ſecurity, that this ſame ſtate-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated political biſhop ſhall not aſpire even after greater dignity and dominion than the Doctor has been pleaſed to aſſign him at his firſt arrival. Will they promiſe he ſhall not? But who is authorized to oblige either him or them to perform thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? This ſame order of men have promiſed, as fair as poſſible, at two memorable periods,—the reſtoration and revolution. But as ſoon as they got into power, they affected to forget all their engagements, and utterly refuſed to fulfil them. Let them remember this, and learn from their former conduct, what little regard is to be paid to their moſt ſolemn proteſtations. R.</p>

               <p>SOME weeks ago Squire <hi>T.</hi> warn'd us of a new, and it ſeems very <hi>ſenſible,</hi> correſpondent; and now (No. XI.) behold the man himſelf!—<hi>Enter Agricola.</hi>—Well! if Squire <hi>T.</hi> meant either <hi>ſubjectively ſenſible,</hi> as a <hi>waſp,</hi> or <hi>objectively ſenſible,</hi> as a <hi>Billingſgate</hi> fiſh-woman, <hi>Agricola</hi> is a <hi>ſenſible</hi> fellow indeed. But to ſpeak ſeriouſly, he ſeems to have only gnaw'd over again bones of contention; twenty times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drivel'd before, or (like a true clown as he ſeems to be) to have <hi>rak'd</hi> together all the chaff, ſtraw, and rubbiſh of calumny, ſcatter'd by others, in order to make an eccleſiaſtico-political bonfire. I at firſt deſign'd to have anſwer'd him, with all the dignity of ſilence; but leſt the propriety of contempt, ſhou'd be conſtrued into the convenience of neglect, I ſhall make a few remarks on what, for that reaſon only, deſerves notice.</p>
               <p>This pragmatical peaſant, in the cloſe of his piece, affects the air of an original writer, pretends to have "expos'd the deſigns, &amp;c. of the Independents," and plumes himſelf on the occaſion, as tho' he himſelf had been the firſt, nay ſingle, diſcoverer of
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:010857_0187_0F851E566A7DC6F0"/>the gunpowder plot; and yet has, in fact, only aped his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors in the art of ſcandal, and, like a parrot, tortur'd our ears by chattering over all the foul language of every paſſenger. But what merit, but that of telling falſehoods, with a better grace than his predeceſſors, cou'd this miſerable mortal (in his great vanity) hope to exhibit, in collecting all the <hi>fiddle faddle</hi> of the preſent day, by different hands, glean'd from the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant unbridled preſs-ſcandal of 1753; and murdering the poor lies by mere dint of <hi>repetition?</hi> Nay, who, but <hi>leſs than the leaſt</hi> of all partizans, wou'd not have foreſeen, that ſuch ſtale groundleſs allegations as his, by putting the public again in mind of paſt tranſactions, cou'd ſcarce fail of injuring, inſtead of promoting the cauſe of the party he flings dirt for? What a deſpicable figure muſt ſuch a ſcribbler make in the eyes of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, who conſiders what epiſcopal zealots almoſt four ſcore years ago, and on every convenient occaſion ſince, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted! Every non epiſcopalian, on hearing <hi>Agricola</hi> again talk of the ambitious ſchemes of the <hi>inſidious</hi> faction, their engines of malice, miſrepreſentations, falſe ſuggeſtions, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrital pretences" charge them with "miſchief-making in the Dutch church," fret at the <hi>Independent Reflector</hi> and <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> and boaſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But what <hi>Agricola</hi> chiefly bawls about, is the perſecution of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in N.

                  <pb n="374" facs="unknown:010857_0188_0F851E5751B24DD0"/>and I dare challenge the moſt cenſorious of all the hot-headed miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries, to lay his hand on his heart and declare, that he in his conſcience believes, the preſent <hi>Independents,</hi> or <hi>Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> have the leaſt deſign or deſire to perſecute ſo harmleſs a people as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or even that he cares a ruſh (if the <hi>church</hi> can but riſe ſuperior to all kinds of <hi>meeting-houſes</hi>) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have or not. However I muſt not forget to put <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> in mind of the perſecutions in <hi>England,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. during which, for about 20 years, the poor Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ſuffer'd <hi>fines, confiſcations, perſonal abuſes</hi> and <hi>impriſonment,</hi> by which many died, <hi>tranſportation, baniſhment,</hi> &amp;c. and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every thing ſhort of <hi>hanging,</hi> and aſk him who were the actors in thoſe ſcenes of cruelty! And I <hi>appeal</hi> to the world to determine, whether <hi>churchmen</hi> have not always been as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as <hi>Independents,</hi> for perſecuting <hi>practices,</hi> as well as <hi>principles,</hi> and indeed whether thoſe <hi>principles</hi> are not too evident in <hi>America,</hi> tho' want of ſufficient <hi>power,</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, prevents their reduction to <hi>practice.</hi>

The members of the church of England in America, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves (as loyal ſubjects of the crown of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>) juſtly entitled to the liberties and privileges which are granted to every other denomination, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe privileges which are eſſential to her well-being, and without which ſhe conſiders her government as lax, irregular, and defective; humbly ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their ſuperiors that theſe inconveniencies might be removed, and their church thereby be ſupply'd without difficulty, with clergymen ordained after that mode which they eſteem pureſt; and their youth enjoy the apoſtolical rite of confirmation. Theſe advantages, (as conſequences of obtaining an epiſcopate ſo circumſcribed in it's powers as to be incapable of injuring others) they ſtill entertain reaſonable expectations of receiving, both from the favourable reception of their petitions,— from the juſtneſs of the requeſt, and the prior movements of their governors to the ſame end.</p>
               <p>Tho' they flatter'd themſelves, their countrymen could have no objections to ſo reaſonable a demand—a demand founded on liberty of conſcience, and thoſe rights which are bequeathed them by magna charta, the richeſt donation of their forefathers! the firſt article of which declares— <q>The church of England ſhall be free, and have her rights entire, and her liberties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infringed;</q>—Yet that their countrymen might not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the leaſt diſcontent or ſuſpicion, they explain'd the plan with the moſt ſtudied openneſs—avoided every appearance of harſhneſs, and conſider'd the objections that had been offer'd, with the greateſt mildneſs and temper; and propoſed examining any others that ſhould ariſe, with decency and charity.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you to reflect, like men conſcious of the advantage of Chriſtian unanimity, what have been the conſequences of theſe candid proceedings.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Chandler,</hi> and the convention, were accuſed of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood—of not deſiring a biſhop under the reſtrictions they declared.—What proof was alledg'd in confirmation of ſo blackening, ſo weighty a charge? Not one! indeed I would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the leaſt diſcerning of my fellow citizens, whether men, in their ſituation, would thus convict themſelves of ſo apparent a falſehood, by publickly profeſſing they deſir'd biſhops ſo limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and petitioning for them in the full enjoyment of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.—Such an allegation brands them at once with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the greateſt villains, and ſimpleſt fools.</p>
               <p>Your attention has alſo been pall'd with ſophiſtical and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural interpretations of ſentences—by words tortured into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful meanings, and then chaſtiz'd for being ſo. And a certain gentleman, once deemed peerleſs in erudition, (has, to the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:010857_0189_0F851E57E301EA00"/>of his friends, the aſtoniſhment of his enemies, and the great diverſion of you, the public) employed that time which might have been better ſpent in the ſervice of his country, in elaborately ſpinning from his almoſt exhauſted brain, well wrought exhibitions of cobweb-wit.—But unfortunately! they have been ſo delicately thin and tender, that they have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to pieces at the leaſt touch of examination, and been ſadly diſorder'd and diſcompos'd by the rude breath of enquiry.</p>
               <p>In order to raiſe your reſentment againſt the clergy of the church, they have endeavoured to make Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> accuſe other denominations of diſaffection to the crown of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> To effect this, they quote a ſentence from a paragraph of his appeal, where, inveſtigating the cauſes which might poſſibly be ſuppos'd to operate, againſt the appointment of an American epiſcopate, the Doctor ſaith as follows; <q>Our condition ſeems to imply, and ſtrangers may conclude from it, that there has been ſomething groſsly amiſs, and unprecedented in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, which has brought down upon us the diſpleaſure of our ſuperiors, from whom we might otherwiſe expect, at leaſt, that common protection and indulgence, which is ſo generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly afforded to all others. But while we thus ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, we are not apprehenſive that it can be owing to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of our ſuperiors, as we are conſcious of no crimes, with regard to the ſtate. On the other hand, we claim a right to be conſider'd as equal with the foremoſt in every due expreſſion of fidelity and loyalty.—No trumpet of Sedition was ever heard to ſound from our pulpits.—No ſeeds of diſaffection have been ſuffered more privately to be ſown in our houſes.</q> The laſt ſentence of this paragraph has been ſtretch'd to anſwer their purpoſe; but I am confident that none who confiders the whole tenor and intent of it, can be thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on: However, let me illuſtrate the innocency of it by a familiar inſtance. Should a number of men be allow'd the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of certain privileges, on condition they were obedient to a law enjoin'd, and a part of them, by ſome means or other, remain unpoſſeſs'd of thoſe privileges,—and they, in order to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate any ſurmiſes of their ſufferings being occaſioned by a breach of the condition ſtipulated, ſhould (endeavouring to vindicate their innocency to the world) aſſert <q>They were equal in fidelity to the foremoſt of their neighbours,—That they had never publickly or privately tranſgreſs'd the law in queſtion;</q> could ſuch aſſertions be ever interpreted as injurious to their neighbours? No! common ſenſe, in ſpite of the ſophiſtry of miſrepreſentation, muſt determine, they are conſentaneous with their duty to their neighbours and themſelves. But the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:010857_0190_0F851E59748ED580"/>of the doctor needed not this vindication; for any man who takes a curſory view of the appeal, will find a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of all the invidious inferences which malice might be inclin'd to draw from it, in a note at the bottom of the page,— wherein he ſays, <q>This declaration is not intended to imply any accuſation of others.—His majeſty's American ſubjects of all denominations, belonging to the old colonies, have always profeſs'd ſentiments of loyalty; and the author be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves they have generally been ſincere in thoſe profeſſions.</q> Nothing certainly could have been more honourable and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than this declaration: It might (one would have imagin'd) have ſilenced their cenſure, tho' it were ineffectual to conciliate their gratitude.—But remember, ſerpents will turn the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fruits into poiſon.</p>
               <p>Another method which theſe enemies of peace, have taken to raiſe an odium againſt the church and her clergy is, to diſgorge their invectives of "perſecution,"—of the <q>Terrors of excommunication,</q>—and the power of a biſhop's <q>paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtaff.</q> &amp;c. When I dare affirm, and they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced themſelves, that they can produce no recent inſtances of the ſeverity they inſinuate. Like envy, they obſcure the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and magnify the diſagreeable ſide of characters. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim on obſolete laws, enacted in times when univerſal bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prevail'd; forgetting the moderation which now diffuſes it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and drawing the picture of the preſent church after the image of it in the days of popery. The Engliſh biſhops have, for a long courſe of years, behav'd in the exerciſe of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with ſuch mildneſs and complacency, as to extract praiſe even from the diſſenters themſelves. Doctor George Benſen, an eminent diſſenter, makes this open acknowledgment.— <q>The church of England with its preſent candour, ſpirit of toleration and charity, appears to me, to be the beſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the face of the earth.</q>

                  </note> There was no neceſſity however, of appealing to theſe teſtimonies; for let the charity and benevolence of the Engliſh clergy, ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly diſplay'd in encouraging, and. aſſiſting every deſign either for the promotion of literature, the relief of the diſtreſſed, or the propagation of Chriſtianity, redden (it poſſible) the cheeks of theſe partial inveighers, with a bluſh of remorſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion!</p>

               <p>They have likewiſe objected that the Dr. mentions the plan on which biſhops are to be ſent <q>in a mincing, mumbling, &amp;c. manner;</q> for an anſwer to which I imagine the following extract will be (at preſent) ſufficient. <q>It has long been ſettled by our friends and ſuperiors at home, and the clergy of this country have often teſtify'd their entire approbation and acquieſcence therein,—That the biſhops to be ſent to America, ſhall have no authority, but purely of a ſpiritual nature, ſuch as is derived altogether from the church, and not from the ſtate. That this authority ſhall operate only upon the clergy of the church, and not upon the laity nor
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:010857_0191_0F851E5A5C383288"/>diſſenters of any denomination. That the biſhops ſhall not interfere with the property or privileges of churchmen or diſſenters.—That in particular they ſhall have no concern with the probate of wills, letters of guardianſhip and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, or marriage licences, nor be judges of any caſe relating thereto; but that they ſhall only exerciſe the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal powers of their Office as before ſtated, <hi>i. e.</hi> ordain and govern the clergy, and adminiſter confirmation to thoſe who ſhall deſire it.—This, without any reſervation or equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is the exact plan of an American epiſcopate which has been ſettled at home, and it is the only one on which biſhops have been requeſted in our general or more particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes.</q> 
                  <hi>Chand.</hi> App. p. 79.</p>
               <p>Another project they have made uſe of, to excite a diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the ſcheme propos'd, is malevolently to ſuggeſt that the Dr. and convention, were the firſt and only authors of it. But can theſe men be ignorant (or do they imagine your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance equal to their preſumption) that for almoſt a century back, renewed inſtances have been made from governors of Provinces, miniſters, veſtries, and private perſons, for ſettling biſhops in America?—That the plan of ſending them, with thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgements of their powers propoſed, has been long conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. —That a committee extraordinary has been appointed to find out Ways and means for the maintenance of Biſhops in America.—That they have already obtained a fund ſufficient. —Whoever would be more certified of this truth, will find it clearly ſtated in the abſtract of the ſociety's proceedings in 1713, 1714,—in an anſwer to Dr. Mayhew's obſervations,— and in Doctor Chandler's appeal.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why the ſcheme has not before this been carried into execution, may poſſibly be aſcrib'd to the commotions that immediately after diſturb'd the nation,—the weighty buſineſs which engroſs'd the attention of our ſuperiors;—but more probably to the neglect of the miſſionaries in not making repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed urgent addreſſes:—For by the earneſtneſs and zeal of their petitions, the government we may ſuppoſe would, in a great meaſure, judge of the neceſſity and urgency of the caſe.—</p>
               <p>—Silence in ſuch a ſtate would be moſt criminal!</p>
               <p>From theſe, and other inſtances (which I ſhall hereafter fully conſider) you may determine the candour, and honour of theſe boaſted defenders of your religious liberties. <hi>Latent angues in herba—ſuge! longe ſage!</hi> The man who errs thro' ignorance is to be pitied; but no character is more to be deteſted than his, who knowingly errs, and willingly leads others into error.</p>

               <p>DR. Chandler tells us in his advertiſement, <q>that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal was written with real and great ſeriouſneſs— that he neither knows, nor believes, nor ſuſpects, that he has miſrepreſented a ſingle fact.</q> It is extremely diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to me to diſcredit the word of any gentlemen, where it can poſſibly be avoided. But I cannot compliment away my reaſon and conſcience to pleaſe any man. I therefore freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that I believe he has miſrepreſented many facts; and am willing to lay before the tribunal of the public, ſome of the reaſons of this my belief. In the 30th and 31ſt pages of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal he writes thus, <q>The power of the church is of a ſpiritual nature, and the utmoſt effect of it in this world is the cutting off, and rejecting, thoſe members, which are incurably and dangerouſly corrupted. This puniſhment, which has been commonly known by the name of <hi>excommunication,</hi> however it was dreaded in the pureſt ages of Chriſtianity has loſt much of its force in this; wherein altars are ſet up againſt altars, and churches againſt churches, and thoſe who are rejected by one, may be received by another.—The charge of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, ſo long hackney'd by infidels and libertines, would be ſure to fall upon the clergy, ſhould they have courage to ſpeak up in defence of it. In this ſtate of things, the reſtoration of the primitive diſcipline ſeems to be a matter rather to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, than ſeriouſly attempted, by thoſe in authority. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly no attempts of this nature will be made, under an American epiſcopate; the diſcipline of the church, ſo far as it relates to the private members, will be left as it is, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther will be done, than refuſing the communion to diſorderly and ſcandalous perſons, which every clergyman may now refuſe, and ought to refuſe according to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks.</q> This whole account I take to be a very great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation of the matter, notwithſtanding the real and great ſeriouſneſs with which, the Dr. aſſures us, it was written, and that for the following reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Excommunication in the church of England, expoſes
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:010857_0192_0F851E5B07E312D0"/>thoſe who are the unhappy ſubjects of it, to many and great temporal inconveniencies, and grievous hardſhips. They are not allowed to commence an action at law; nor to be a witneſs, advocate, or juror; nor to make a will; nor be an executor; nor to receive Chriſtian burial. Is it not then a miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this matter to aſſert, <q>that the power of the church is of a ſpiritual nature; and that the utmoſt effect of it in this world is the cutting off, and rejecting, thoſe members, which are incurably and dangerouſly corrupted?</q> This may be true of the church of Chriſt, according to her primitive conſtitution. But who can believe it is true of the church of England? does he mean to adopt the diſtinction that has ſometimes been made, between the church of England and the church of Chriſt? Or does he think that all ſuch perſons ſhould be literally cut off, deſtroyed, and murdered?</p>
               <p n="2">2d. The reaſon he aſſigns why church diſcipline and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication has loſt much of its force, in the preſent age, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <q>altars are ſet up againſt altars, and churches againſt churches;</q> that is, becauſe there are many who do not join in communion with the church of England. But this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the account which other writers, of his own church, give of this matter, who are at leaſt as learned and honeſt, and <hi>ſerious,</hi> as himſelf. The true cauſe of the great want of goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel diſcipline in the church of England, and why it has loſt much of its force, we may learn from biſhop Burnet. Hiſt. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. part iii. p. 330. <q>The proviſo that had paſſed in K. Henry the eighth's time, that continued the canon-law then received in England, till a code of eccleſiaſtical laws was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared (which, tho' attempted and well prepared, was never ſettled) has fixed among us many groſs abuſes, beſides the dilatory forms of thoſe courts, which make all proceedings in them both ſlow and chargeable. This has, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, enervated all church diſcipline." "Diſcipline, <hi>ſays another,</hi> is loſt, and will not be permitted by the ſtate, which by virtue of <hi>conge d'elire's, quare impedits, prohibitions,</hi> &amp;c. have made themſelves the ſole and ultimate judges, not only of all biſhops and churches, but of their excommunications, and every exerciſe of their ſpiritual juriſdiction.</q> 
                  <hi>Caſe of the regal. and pontif.</hi> p. 166. Muſt it not then be a very groſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation of this fact, and an unjuſt aſperſion on other proteſtant churches, to lay at their door the weakneſs, or rather the want, of diſcipline in the church of England; when it is thus ingenuouſly confeſſed by biſhops themſelves, to proceed from her preſent conſtitution, and cloſe alliance with the ſtate?
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:010857_0192_0F851E5B07E312D0"/>Or is a falſhood the better for being written with great ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſeriouſneſs?</p>
               <p n="3">3d. Another thing which has greatly weakened diſcipline in the church of England, is the Sacramental teſt, by which all the officers in the army and navy, &amp;c. are obliged to receive the ſacrament, let their lives and practices be ever ſo debauched. Indeed Dr. Chandler ſays, that, <q>every clergyman may now refuſe, and ought to refuſe, the communion to diſorderly and ſcandalous perſons, according to the <hi>rubricks.</hi>
                  </q> But then he ſhould have added, if he would give a full repreſentation of the matter, that <q>an action lies againſt the miniſter who ſhall refuſe it to them, tho' he knows, ſees, and hears them to be never ſo unqualified.</q> 
                  <hi>Caſe of the regal, and pontif.</hi> p. 179. The ſacramental teſt, which enjoins it ſo ſtrictly on all officers to receive, ſuppoſes that the miniſters are obliged to grant them the ſacrament; and if any miniſter ſhould dare to refuſe it, the officers know where they can have their remedy, in ſpite of Dr. Chandler and his rubricks. I leave it then to any candid perſon, whether he has given a fair repreſentation of the diſcipline of the church of England, in his appeal; tho' it was written with real and great ſeriouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. Other proteſtant churches do not take it upon them to diſcipline thoſe who do not profeſs to belong to them; ſo that men's withdrawing from one denomination, and joining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to another, frees them from that church to which they formerly adhered. And Dr. Chandler, ſeems to repreſent this to be the caſe with the church of England, when he aſſigns this as the cauſe, why excommunication has loſt much of its force, that <q>churches are ſet up againſt churches, and thoſe who are rejected by one may be received by another.</q> But it is well known, that where the church of England is eſtabliſhed, ſhe conſiders all that are born and live within her precincts as ſubjects of her diſcipline. And the more that any diſſent from her worſhip and communion, with the more ſeverity they may expect to be diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined. Suppoſe for inſtance, that a Preſbyterian in England or Ireland commits an offence worthy of eccleſiaſtical cenſure, and makes proper Chriſtian ſatisfaction, to the acceptance of the Preſbyterian church, to which he belongs, yet he may depend upon being cited to the biſhop's court, and forced to pay them their fees, and ſatisfy their exorbitant demands. And thus, as one expreſſes it, <q>after the Preſbyterian church has purged them of their ſcandal, the epiſcopal church purges them of their money.</q>—And that the epiſcopal miſſionaries in the colonies, have ſome imagination of their being inveſted wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> power and authority, over all other denominations, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:010857_0193_0F851E5BA1028FC0"/>Why elſe did Dr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> the great advocate of their church, addreſs letter after letter to his diſſenting pariſhioners? For if they were Diſſenters from his church, how came they to be his pariſhioners?—Now ſince the rulers of the church of England, have not been inclined to be more merciful, but rather more ſevere to proteſtant Diſſenters, and to chaſtiſe them with rigour for their ſcandals and refractorineſs, how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Dr. Chandler's account ſhould be true, that their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and erecting other churches, has weakened their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline? And when the epiſcopalians have ſcourged proteſtant. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, with ſuch unmerciful ſeverity, and continue to haraſs them in their ſpiritual courts at home, is there not ſomething very queer in charging them with weakening their diſcipline? Ought he not with real and great ſeriouſneſs to review this ſtriking miſrepreſentation?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Dr. ſays that <q>the diſcipline of the church, ſo far as relates to private members, will be leſt as it is,</q> &amp;c. Would not any impartial reader take it from this repreſentation, that the church of England had ſome proper diſcipline, where ſhe is eſtabliſhed; and that ſhe had ſome kind of diſcipline, tho' of a leſs perfect kind, in the colonies? Muſt it not therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſurpriſing, to hear that the church of England herſelf confeſſes ſhe has no godly diſcipline, for perſons guilty of noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſins? Thus, <q>Brethren, in the primitive church there was a godly diſcipline, that at the beginning of lent ſuch perſons as ſtood convicted of notorious ſins, were put to open penance, and puniſhed in this world, that their ſouls might be ſaved in the day of the lord; and that others puniſhed by this example, might be more afraid to offend. Inſtead whereof, until ſaid diſcipline be reſtored again, which is much to be wiſhed for, it is thought good,</q> &amp;c. Agreeable to this, Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> takes notice, that <q>the church of England obſerves no church diſcipline, and the liturgy itſelf teaches them once a year, to wiſh the godly diſcipline of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive church reſtored.</q> However they have ſubſtituted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in its ſtead. And whether the proſecutions of their ſpiritual courts, and the oppreſſions and harraſſings of thoſe, who have had the unhappineſs to taſte of their mercy, &amp;c. which has prevailed in the mean time, has not been a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſort of diſcipline, is no great difficulty to determine.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But, it may perhaps be ſaid, we have never known any ſuch terrible doings in this country.</q> True; and we have never had any biſhops here. The miſſionaries are only ſimple preſbyters, who, according to the Doctor's ſcheme, have no right to meddle with the keys of diſcipline. <q>The exemptions,
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:010857_0193_0F851E5BA1028FC0"/>biſhop Burnet, ſettled by papal authority, do put many parts of this church in a very disjointed ſtate; while in ſome places the laity, and in others preſbyters, exerciſe epiſcopal juriſdiction independant of their biſhops; in contradiction to their own principles, while they aſſert a divine right for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling the government of biſhops,</q> &amp;c. The famous <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> was impriſoned two years by Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgiſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that being only a preſbyter, he had appointed a form of public penance, or ſatisfaction, for a perſon who had been guilty of fornication. I never underſtood that the miſſionaries ſhewed any great diſpoſition to offend their ſuperiors, by attempting to meddle with diſcipline. What idea then could the Dr. intend to convey, by ſaying that the diſcipline of the church, ſo far as it relates to private members, will be leſt as it is? Is it this important and momentous idea, that, even after the arrival of a biſhop, nothing will be nothing ſtill? Or does he, by theſe words, mean to aſſure us, that the biſhop will not erect his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual courts, and bring us under the laſh of his ungodly diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which is ſubſtituted by the church of England, inſtead of that which obtained in the primitive church! But what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority has this poor ſimple preſbyter to controul his ſuperiors, and to govern and give law to his biſhop? Muſt not this be looked on as arrogance with a witneſs?</p>
               <p n="6">6th. He ſeems to lament that <q>altars are ſet up againſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and churches againſt churches; and thoſe who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by one, may be received by another.</q> Who would have imagined that a gentleman, who profeſſes ſo much candour and moderation, ſhould be grieved at the toleration, and repine that others are allowed liberty to worſhip God, according to the goſpel and their conſciences? Would he have the penal laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and extended to the colonies, and all the churches of other denominations pulled down, and his dear epiſcopal church erected on their ruins, and all the inhabitants compelled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to her? Will nothing but ſuch power content the epiſcopal miſſionaries? Can they never be eaſy, but when they are haraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their peaceable neighbours? <q>Thoſe who are rejected by one church, may be received by another.</q> One would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally think from this, that when the epiſcopal church among us, was about cenſuring and excommunicating ſcandalous ſinners, other proteſtant churches were ready to receive them, and in fact, took them into their communion, and protected them from her diſcipline. It is truly aſtoniſhing that the Dr. and his brethren could publiſh ſuch an inſinuation as this, in this country, where it is ſo well known, that the epiſcopal churches of the miſſionaries are generally firſt founded by, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="386" facs="unknown:010857_0194_0F851E6182B35C48"/>a great part of their increaſe or additions, from thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who refuſe to make Chriſtian ſatisfaction, for thoſe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous crimes they have committed. This is a common proverb in <hi>New-England,</hi> of any perſon who falls into any open notorious ſin,—<hi>well, he'll make a churchman now.</hi> Who is there that does not know, that the epiſcopal churches are a common <hi>recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle,</hi> or <hi>city of refuge,</hi> for diſorderly and ſcandalous perſons? It is neceſſary to ſpeak thus plain, becauſe the Dr. appears to affect ignorance or forgetfulneſs in this matter.</p>
               <p>He ſays, <q>we live in an age when the voice of reaſon will not be heard, nor the ſtrength of arguments regarded, altho' ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the declarations of Heaven, on the ſubject of church diſcipline—the charge of <hi>prieſt-craft,</hi> ſo long hackneyed by infidels and libertines, would be ſure to fall upon the clergy, ſhould they have courage to ſpeak in defence of it. In this ſtate of things, the reſtoration of the primitive diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ſeems to be a matter rather to be wiſhed for, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, than rationally attempted by thoſe in authority. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly no attempts of this nature will be made, under an American epiſcopate.</q> This is a very extraordinary paſſage, upon which I propoſe the following queries.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1ſt. Does it not appear from this paſſage, that the epiſcopal clergy in general, and the miſſionaries in particular, have not courage to ſpeak in defence of the primitive diſcipline, tho' they are fully convinced it is ſupported by the declarations of Heaven? And that we are not to expect any thing better from the biſhop, whom the Dr. and the convention pretend to deſire, for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry purpoſe of this reſtoration? Is not this to hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs, and baſely to betray the cauſe of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this plain and honeſt confeſſion which is here made? Can ſuch a biſhop be a primitive biſhop? Were they intimidated by libertines and infidels?</item>
                  <item>2d. Whether men, who have ſo little fidelity and courage to defend, what they profeſs to be ſupported by the declarations of Heaven, as the Dr. repreſents, be worthy the name and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the miniſters of Chriſt? Infidels and libertines do not pretend to believe the goſpel, but to conſider it as an impoſture. No wonder they diſregard its ſolemn declarations; this is but acting agreeable to their character. But what ſhall we think of Chriſtians, who profeſs to believe it, and yet pay no ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to it? What ſhall we think of thoſe, who aſſume the high character of Chriſtian teachers, and yet avow that they will not ſpeak up in defence of the expreſs declarations of Heaven? Do ſuch miniſters and biſhops remember, that they are ſet for the defence of the goſpel? And that when they thus cowardly
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:010857_0194_0F851E6182B35C48"/>deſert their poſt, they yield up the Chriſtian cauſe into the hands of its enemies? Can we rationally expect any benefit from ſuch miſſionaries, and ſuch biſhops?</item>
                  <item>3d. Does Dr. Chandler think, that there are more Libertines and Infidels now, in proportion to the Chriſtians in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> or the <hi>colonies,</hi> than there were in the time of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive church? If there are not, why ſhould this be alledged as a reaſon to neglect church diſcipline? Would not this have been a reaſon, equally cogent againſt its firſt inſtitution? If it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rationally attempted now, how was it actually effected then? Does not this language of Dr. Chandler, ſuppoſe there is ſomething in the goſpel very abſurd, fooliſh and unreaſonable, ſince it <hi>cannot be rationally attempted by thoſe in authority?</hi> Or will be ſay the primitive diſcipline was not of divine inſtitution? —And if it was not, why is it to be wiſhed for and deſired? Or is it the recalling of the toleration, and the revival of the penal laws, which he and his brethren wiſh and deſire?</item>
                  <item>4th. Can it be ſuppoſed that the miſſionaries are very ſincere, in wiſhing and deſiring the reſtoration of the primitive diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, when they are ſo ready to receive into their churches, all thoſe who refuſe to ſubmit to it in the churches where it is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed? and when their increaſe ſo greatly depends upon their want of it? Do not actions ſpeak louder than words?—</item>

                  <hi>AGRICOLA</hi> having made his <hi>exit,</hi> Squire <hi>T.</hi> re-enters, (No. XII) without one conſcious bluſh, exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>repetition,</hi> for which he and his correſpondents are ſo notoriouſly remarkable.</p>
               <p>According to him the Whig's account of the origin of Engliſh Diſſenters is fictitious;—I ſhall not make it my buſineſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce authorities in its vindication, but adduce the teſtimony of Squire <hi>T.</hi> himſelf to prove, that <hi>his own</hi> is inconſiſtent and therefore erroneous: I will not be confident that it was his own invention; for he had probably ſome inviſible aſſiſtance. Par. 2d. He plainly gives us to underſtand, that the firſt puritans were
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:010857_0195_0F851E62306FF2B8"/>and learned clergyman, who fled to <hi>Geneva</hi> from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and there "contracted a <hi>love and eſteem</hi> for the <hi>Genevan</hi> diſcipline, &amp;c." — that returning to England in the reign of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and becoming diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contended, becauſe they were diſappointed of a reſtoration to the pariſhes they had deſerted, they (tho' <q>too pious to ſeparate from the <hi>Church</hi>
                  </q>) out of reſentment <q>began to ſet up for a more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>thorough</hi> reformation.</q> And par. 3d. he tells us (as <hi>Probus</hi> had told him) that <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, "firſt broach'd the novel ſcheme of a parity of miniſters," and metamorphos'd the <hi>Puritans</hi> into <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> Now what a jumble, what an <hi>ff,</hi> what a <hi>fiddle faddle,</hi> what a <hi>farrago farra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginum</hi> is here! Squire T's allowing that the firſt <hi>Puritans</hi> were men of <hi>piety and learning,</hi> who <hi>lov'd</hi> and <hi>eſteem'd</hi> the <hi>Genevan</hi> diſcipline, amounts to at leaſt an <hi>implicit</hi> acknowledgment, that conviction of conſcience was the true ſource of <hi>Puritaniſm;</hi> and yet he afterwards <hi>inſinuates,</hi> (if he does not more than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate) that they <q>ſet up for a more pure and thorough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</q> out of pure ſpite, ariſing from diſappointment. The reformation he owns, was "far from complete," at the death of <hi>Edward</hi> VI; and yet he calls the Puritans <hi>troubleſome,</hi> becauſe they endeavoured to complete it.—Alas! I beg Squire T's pardon, for I juſt now recollect, that the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was previouſly completed by the parliament and convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the former having already paſs'd the <hi>act of uniformity,</hi> and the latter eſtabliſh'd the 39 <hi>articles.</hi> The <hi>Puritans</hi> had at <hi>Geneva taſted,</hi> and "contracted a <hi>love and eſteem</hi> for," the ſcheme for a parity of miniſters," and (to go no higher) King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. himſelf, Arch-biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> and others had handed it about long before, as what they thought had a primitive and evangelical taſte; but according to Squire <hi>T.</hi> it was a novel ſcheme and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were the firſt that <hi>broached</hi> it; in order to <hi>foment the diſcontent</hi> of the <hi>Puritans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Par. 4th He ſeems to be nettled at the Whig's hint concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>making prieſts of the meaneſt of the people,</hi> and in revenge ſuggeſts a ſuppos'd parallel between "ſome in theſe days" and <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> A ſly ſtroke that! however I can't help ſaying, that (as <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> was a <hi>political ſchiſm,</hi> and as there is a great <hi>diſparity</hi> between parity of <hi>families</hi> and parity of <hi>miniſters</hi>) it ſeems as though Squire <hi>T.</hi> wou'd fain have <hi>betray'd</hi> his readers into an opinion, that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was a <hi>Preſbyterian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Par. 5th We have a pretended typical analogy between the <hi>high prieſts, prieſts,</hi> and-<hi>Levites</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and the <hi>biſhops, preſbyters</hi> and <hi>deacons</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> church; from which Squire <hi>T.</hi> ſeems fond of inferring the divine inſtitution of the
<pb n="389" facs="unknown:010857_0195_0F851E62306FF2B8"/>latter. But, unleſs he ſuppoſes, that an <hi>Arch</hi>-Biſhop is no more than <hi>primus inter pares,</hi> his analogy is incomplete, and there is no ground to infer the divine inſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> any more than that of the <hi>pagan</hi> or <hi>popiſh,</hi> from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; or to ſuppoſe that a <hi>Britiſh Metropolitan</hi> has in reality a divine commiſſion any more than a <hi>pope</hi> or <hi>cardinal,</hi> or even an ancient Roman <hi>pontiſex maximus.</hi> Of this, Squire <hi>T.</hi> ſeems half ſenſible himſelf, for he durſt ſay no more than, "<hi>poſſibly</hi> no great abſurdity will follow from ſuppoſing. that God has done the ſame in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> (as he did in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>) church," and yet he ſays, "if the Whig and his aſſociates are ſo wilfully blind, that they will not ſee this"—(this what? why this) <hi>poſſibility,</hi>—he <hi>can</hi> pray for them, that they may have eyes that <hi>can</hi> ſee" it, &amp;c. tho' he cou'd find a prayer in the <hi>liturgy</hi> for his purpoſe, and ſhould be able to <hi>read</hi> it, I'm apt to believe it wou'd never be anſwer'd; for I fancy both the Whig and his aſſociates will always ſee, that very probably this very great abſurdity will follow from his typical analogy, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>hand,</hi> the <hi>ſurplice,</hi> the <hi>caſſock,</hi> the <hi>ſaſh,</hi> &amp;c. being as much typify'd by the breaſt-plate, the <hi>ephod,</hi> the <hi>robe,</hi> the <hi>girdle,</hi> &amp;c. are as much of divine inſtitution, as are (according to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy) the offices of thoſe that wear them. While reading in the <hi>Whip</hi> about <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Clergy, I can't help fancying I ſee the <hi>Right Reverend Father</hi> Aaron, completely equipp'd in <hi>Britiſh</hi> Canonicals.</p>
               <p>Par. 7th. Squire <hi>T.</hi> pretends, the <hi>Whig</hi> "can't poſſibly have any juſt ground of quarrel with the church of England, for preferring the epiſcopal, any more than with that of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, for preferring the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> form" of church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſince he ſuppoſes the ſupreme head of the church eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd no particular form whatſoever. But here he has not only miſrepreſented the Whig's expreſſions concerning <hi>models,</hi> by ſubſtituting, "ſuch as they <hi>thought</hi> moſt <hi>convenient</hi> for them; inſtead of <hi>ſuch as beſt anſwer'd the ends,</hi> &amp;c of church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but has either careleſly or deſigedly overlook'd his excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <q>a few general canons—inculcated by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a preſervative againſt that execrable ſpirit of pride, which by his omniſcience he foreſaw wou'd ſoon ariſe in the churches.</q> Theſe general canons, which Squire <hi>T.</hi> I dare ſay, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unacquainted with, will ſufficiently juſtify the <hi>Whig</hi>'s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt <hi>epiſcopacy,</hi> and clear him of the charge of (what is, in the <hi>Chandlerian</hi> cant of the times, call'd) <q>real and direct perſecution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Par. 8th. Squire <hi>T.</hi> (Quixot-like) combats a phantom of his own creative imagination, or (to ſpeak of him more characte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="390" facs="unknown:010857_0196_0F851E648594A660"/>forces the <hi>Whig</hi> into an attitude he had never aſſum'd, in order to thraſh him the more conveniently; i. e. <hi>for argument's ſake,</hi> be ſuppoſe it to be the <hi>Whig's</hi> opinion, "that the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> form was inſtituted by the apoſtles," and then moſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully knocks him down with his own conceſſions, which it ſeems are not the truth however, becauſe (according to Squire <hi>T.</hi>) they are not the <hi>whole truth.</hi> So have I ſeen a child, who had juſt been <hi>engaging in crambo and puſh-pin,</hi> build with cards what an ant wou'd have thought a lofty ſtructure, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, with <hi>Herculean</hi> or <hi>Sampſonical</hi> vigour, and intrepidity, demoliſh it to its foundation in an inſtant. However after all, it is evident the <hi>Whig</hi> ſuppoſes neither <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> nor <hi>preſbyteria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> (ſtrictly ſpeaking) are of either divine or apoſtolical inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore Squire <hi>T.</hi> might have ſpar'd himſelf the trouble of quoting his conceſſions, in which I ſuſpect he meant to act the angler, who gives the poor ſtupid fiſh line, to ſee how prettily he will play with it. Dr. <hi>Ram-chicken</hi> and others, who are no ſportſmen, make no ſuch conceſſions; or if they did, it were no matter, nor ſhou'd we be oblig'd to clear away all Squire <hi>T's</hi> interrogatory dirt; ſince thoſe who can drink out of a fountain, may juſtly ſcorn to ſip at a ſtream that runs thro' a <hi>Puddle.</hi> Perhaps it may be ſcarcely worth while to take notice of that great divine Squire <hi>T's</hi> expreſſions, ſuch as <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the apoſtles, apoſtolical inſtitution,</hi> &amp;c. however I can't but think, they muſt needs ſound oddly to all but ſuch as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a mortal, a <hi>mere man,</hi> as the head of the Church.</p>

And I doubt not but the public will be the more ready to pardon me, when I aſſure them it is not out of choice that the following piece has a place in the <hi>Whip;</hi> but merely to gratify a worthy correſpondent, and manifeſt my reſpect for him. The ingenious author diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a generous, tender regard for the reputation of his friend, who had been attacked,—very feebly attacked by this knight of a ſorrowful figure. Mr. <hi>Pleadwell</hi>'s good ſenſe, wit and humour, place him beyond the reach of ſuch weak, malevolent calumniators. However, his friend ſhews the goodneſs of his own heart, in thus interpoſing in his behalf.

His abilities would triumph over a much more reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adverſary.

               <p>I Fear it may be thought too low a ſtoop for me, even to take notice of the much neglected Sir <hi>Iſaac Foot;</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his unparralled inſolence and effrontery has hitherto paſs'd unmoleſted, thro' a ſucceſſion of weekly papers. I once
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:010857_0197_0F851E64CF657B88"/>heard it ſaid, that he diſcovered himſelf to be a man of ſenſe, but that he wrote like a fool. Both parts of the aſſertion may poſſibly be true, tho' I confeſs the character of the fool is ſo ſtriking in his compoſitions, that the man of ſenſe is loſt under its glare. His performances might however all have been buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in eternal oblivion, and have periſhed with the name of their doughty author, had he not made a perſonal attack upon my friend <hi>Richard Pleadwell;</hi> he it ſeems, in aſſuming the honour of contending with Mr. <hi>Peere Williams,</hi> his brother lawyer, has expoſed himſelf to to the virulence and rudeneſs of Sir <hi>Iſaac Foot;</hi> who in point of politeneſs and good breeding, is not leſs defective, than he is in the knowledge of the ſubjects upon which he preſumes to write.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> (under the feigned character of <hi>Obadiah Liſten</hi>) profeſſing himſelf to be no lawyer (as I verily believe he is not) and apoligizing at the ſame time for his ignorance, wonders that Mr. <hi>Pleadwell</hi> ſhould decline replying to an <hi>untruth,</hi> and be ambitious of entering upon the defence of the contrary. In behalf of my friend <hi>Pleadwell,</hi> it might be ſufficient to remark, in anſwer to this ſagacious ſentiment of Sir <hi>Iſaac;</hi> that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers in their pleadings are not bound down to ſuch nice rules of compoſition, as will bear the piercing eye of ſo great a critic as he is, who paſſes over no imperfection in his adverſary's ſtyle. Perhaps this aſſuming knight imagines it to be his prerogative to <hi>Kick</hi> every man he meets with in the road to literary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame at which he is aſpiring; and it was indeed, Mr. <hi>Pleadwell</hi>'s miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to fall in the way of ſuch a <hi>light footed</hi> antagoniſt, in the little excurſion he had made towards Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s imperial ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe he were to be told that lawyers, by a kind of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty impoſed upon them, are much ſhackled with forms in their pleadings. That tho' it be true, that theſe forms are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways much to the purpoſe, at leaſt for matter of real ſubſtance, yet while the lawyer in the courſe of his profeſſion is obliged to ſubmit to them, Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> may glory in the high privilege and honour of inventing modes of compoſition that are equally life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unſubſtantial. The lawyer pleads preſcription an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Uſage as his apology; Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> has none but his ignorance. Thus much may ſuffice to ſhew, that he has gained nothing by this ſhrewd remark upon Mr. <hi>Pleadwell</hi>'s introduction to the replication.</p>
               <p>Our valiant knight firſt levels the full weight of his g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal artillery, againſt an unlucky word that drop'd from Mr. <hi>Pleadwell</hi>'s pen. What was it? Why he aſſerted that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal was not inſtituted <hi>merely</hi> for the aggrandizement of the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:010857_0197_0F851E64CF657B88"/>churches on the ruin of all other Chriſtian denominations. What a pity was it, that this word <hi>merely,</hi> ſhould have been thrown out thus to expoſe Mr. <hi>Pleadwell</hi>'s cauſe; for does it not turn his argument directly againſt himſelf? Whatever is not done <hi>merely</hi> for any purpoſe, is certainly done in <hi>part</hi> for that purpoſe; but the appeal was not inſtituted <hi>merely</hi> to aggrandize the church on the ruin of others, therefore it was deſigned in <hi>part</hi> to promote ſuch aggrandizement. Fie upon it, my friend <hi>Pleadwell,</hi> how came you to reaſon ſo unguardedly? Had you teſted your remark by a Syllogiſm, the ſelf-condemning conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would have ſtared you in the face, You have given up the point in one ſingle expreſſion; for do you imagine that other Chriſtian denominations ought to ſuffer the church of England to grow, if ſhe ſtands but one hair's breadth in their way?— That if diſſenters think it inconvenient that ſhe ſhould riſe in plenitude of her ſtrength, they ought not by all means to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her? That if they deſire to grow up, be ſtrong and flouriſh themſelves, they muſt not be glad to ſee the epiſcopal churches weak, maimed and impotent? That a biſhop if he does no other harm, than that of rendering the terms of admiſſion of the clergy into the church, as eaſy as thoſe of other denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will not by this means in part aggrandize the church upon the ruin of others?—For ſhould the clergy of the church of England increaſe in numbers as the diſſenting clergy do, might there not ſoon be as many churchmen as diſſenters in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and would not this weaken and almoſt ruin the diſſenting intereſt? Should we not ſee the plain and humble meeting-houſes, commonly ſo called (I mean it not by way of deriſion, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction) ſhrink beneath the ſuperb and towering ſpires of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal churches? Where can all this end, but partly in the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizement of thoſe churches upon the ruin of all others?</p>
               <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Pleadwell</hi> may ſee the full force of his own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pointed againſt himſelf. It is not eaſy however to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that if ſuch an accidential aggrandizement of the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal churches as this is, ſhould take place in conſequence of a biſhop's arrival among us, it would be at the expence of one right taken from any other denomination. For is it not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that the church of England: conſidered merely as a ſociety of Chriſtians, ſhould be cheriſhed with the natural and internal ſuccours of her own ſtrength as derived from her frame and conſtitution?—That what is very neceſſary to her very being and exiſtence, ſhould at leaſt be eaſily attainable? The enjoyment of theſe, is and muſt be a perfect right which every church may claim, and is entitled to. All diſſenters have and exerciſe this right within themſelves, which they are enabled to
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:010857_0198_0F851E656591B8B8"/>do from their mode of ordination and form of church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Were it poſſible to turn the tables upon them, and for the church (having the full powers of ordination here) to ſay, that the diſſenters ſhould not have a ſingle clergyman ordained, except he went to England; and that they ſhould forever be obliged to go there, notwithſtanding the means of ordination might eaſily be brought nearer home, would they not complain that we were building up our churches upon the ruin of theirs? And if ſo, have we not juſt right to make the ſame complaint?</p>
               <p>Counſellor <hi>Pleadwell</hi> doubtleſs muſt have a high ſenſe of ſir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s politeneſs, in the ſeveral epithets beſtowed upon him: namely; that of "<hi>Simpleton, ſtupid pettyſogger,</hi> and <hi>fiery zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot;</hi>" and in charging the replication with being full of <q>
                     <hi>nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repetitions,</hi>
                  </q> and comparing it to an <q>
                     <hi>inſipid Cud ekewed ovr and over again.</hi>
                  </q> Such reflections as theſe, to a man of Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s refined taſte, muſt doubtleſs have appeared extremely delicate. I confeſs myſelf unequal in this department to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him, and muſt therefore leave him in poſſeſſion of this mean and glorious triumph over his antagoniſt.</p>
               <p>Having made this diſcharge from the ebullition of his ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he now condeſcends to attack Mr. <hi>Pleadwell</hi>'s argument; and this he does in effect, by ſaying that it matters not whether the church and clergy in their preſent ſtate in <hi>America,</hi> are the proper objects of the ſtatutes refered to by Mr. <hi>Peere Williams;</hi> nor whether the church of <hi>England</hi> is eſtabliſhed in the colonies, or not: For that, be this at it will, the concluſion drawn from theſe ſtatutes remains inconteſtible, to wit, <q>
                     <hi>That there actually is no right of epiſcopacy within the realm of England, except what is derived from human laws.</hi>
                  </q> The Biſhops in <hi>England, ſays he,</hi> can confer no other right than they have themſelves, therefore any ſuch right derived from <hi>England,</hi> cannot be more <hi>divine</hi> in <hi>America</hi> than it is there. That is, in other words, it muſt be juſt ſuch a right as the biſhops have in England, viz, a right merely derived from human laws, with every power that there belongs to the office.—This to be ſure will at once bring the law dignified prelate into our land, and eſtabliſh ſpiritual courts among us,—The biſhop will ſpin all the officers of this court out of his very bowels; create a dean and chapter by the breath of his mouth, rear the church hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy out of nothing, and hold his ſeat in the American houſe of lords. For all theſe are appendages that belong to the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Britiſh biſhop.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s miſtake lies in confounding things that are in their nature entirely diſtinct. The biſhop's right as to his powers of ordination is no more derived from the laws of England, than the apoſtle's commiſſion to <hi>Timothy</hi> to go and preach the goſpel,
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:010857_0198_0F851E656591B8B8"/>was—There are indeed ſuperadded powers which they claim, founded in the connection which the law has formed between their offices and the ſtate. But this is adapted to the peculiar policy of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> where the church of England makes a branch of the conſtitution, and perfects the political ſyſtem. Not ſo here; For where is the theatre upon which their ſpiritual lordſhips can exhibit this grand machinery of political power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> —But eſpecially if the church of England is not eſtabliſhed in the colonies, upon what foundation is the biſhop to build the vaſt ſtructure of legal eccleſiaſtical dominion, which at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes ſuch eſtabliſhment? Muſt he not in ſuch caſe, rather of neceſſity be like a primitive biſhop in a ſtrange land unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the ſecular arm? Upon this principle the requiſite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. XXIV.]</head>
               <p>DR. Chandler laments the deplorable ſituation of the church of England in America, and repreſents, in dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful accents, her preſent ſtate of grievous oppreſſion; from diſſenters I preſume he muſt mean, ſince he will not ſay, her oppreſſion is owing to the diſcountenance of his Majeſty, the parliament, or the Biſhops of England. I confeſs it is the firſt inſinuation of the kind, that ever I heard; and am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Dr. would find it very difficult to ſupport his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint by a ſingle inſtance: Nor is it poſſible to conceive how this can be the caſe, as the epiſcopal church is the peculiar ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of protection, in every government where his majeſty hath the appointment of the commander in chief; there not being one king's government on this continent, whoſe governor is not a member of her communion. On the other hand, that the diſſenters have been oppreſſed by the church of England in America, abundant proof may be adduced; and leſt this ſhould be thought a groundleſs aſſertion, it may not be amiſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a few inſtances. The firſt Engliſh preſbyterian miniſter that over apply'd for a licenſe, to preach in New-Yor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily refuſed permiſſion; and afterwards underwent the hardſhip of a ſevere impriſonment, for no other crime than that of preaching the goſpel in a private houſe, to a few people of his own perſuaſion.—The aſſembly of that province, at a time when the church of England had no exiſtence in it, and when more than nine tenths of the members were diſſenters, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a proviſion, for the ſupport of a proteſtant miniſtry, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the counties; plainly deſigning it for any proteſtant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. Of this proviſion, the church of England very ſoon
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:010857_0199_0F851E662D98CE48"/>artfully avail'd herſelf, and has ever ſince appropriated the ſame, to the excluſive maintenance of her own clergy, tho' nine tenths at leaſt of the money raiſed by the act iſſues from the eſtates of people of other denominations. A ſtriking proofs, truly of the boaſted equity and juſtice of that church, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from diſſenters a ſupport of a religious conſtitution which they conſcientiouſly diſapprove and renounce!—In this province alſo, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout forty years ago, the epiſcopalians, with open violence, ſeized upon a preſbyterian church and parſonage, of which they kept ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal poſſeſſion for the ſpace of twenty years. Theſe are a few of the many inſtances of oppreſſion, which diſſenters have experienced in this province. In Virginia, where the church hath a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral provincial eſtabliſhment, loud have been the complaints of perſecution, which the epiſcopalians have exerciſed towards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant diſſenters, whoſe miniſters, for the attrocious crime of preaching the goſpel, have there been frequently harraſſed, and cited before courts and magiſtrates, and refuſed even the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the toleration-act. Tho' this may ſeem a digreſſion from the ſubject of an American Biſhop, it appeared neceſſary to vindicate diſſenters, from the unjuſt inſinuations contained in Dr. Chandler's pamphlet; and to ſhew from what quarter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious oppreſſions, in theſe colonies, have heretofore ariſen.</p>
               <p>The Dr. urges the neceſſity and utility of an American epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate, to raiſe the church of England from that ſtate of deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable oppreſſion, under which ſhe hath ſo long groaned, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her dignity, and advance her growth in the American co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies. But I am ſurpriſed, that any man, who has reſided but a few years in this country, and eſpecially a native, who cannot but be thoroughly acquainted with the genius and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of its inhabitants towards an eccleſiaſtical hierarchy, ſhould ſeriouſly ſet himſelf to urge a meaſure, that hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt a tendency to interrupt the peace, impede the population, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Were it even poſſible to procure a dignitary of the church of England, clothed with thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive epiſcopal powers only, with which the Dr. tells us he is to come inveſted; and were he to make his firſt appearance in the garb of the inoffenſive ſheep; it would be impoſſible to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:010857_0200_0F851E66EA281958"/>Americans, whoſe anceſtors have felt and fled from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of thoſe holy men, from the apprehenſion of their ſoon becoming devouring wolves. But how artfully would theſe gentlemen impoſe upon the credulity of the people, by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing a Biſhop of the church of England, will be ſent to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca thus deplumed of the neceſſary and inſeparable appendages, annexed to the epiſcopal office in the Engliſh hierarchy, by the common and ſtatute law, from the origin of its conſtitution. The king and parliament, under whoſe forming hand that church roſe into exiſtence, muſt entirely new-frame and model her conſtitution, before a biſhop, of the antient primitive Chriſtian ſtamp, can emerge from her boſom. But ſuppoſing the Britiſh parliament (whoſe wiſdom we preſume will ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from proſecuting a meaſure, that appears to have ſo unfriendly an aſpect upon his Majeſty's intereſt in the colonies) ſhould conſtitute and American epiſcopate, and, in an eſpecial manner, ſhould preclude his lordſhip from <hi>tythes,</hi> from holding eccleſiaſtical courts, and the exerciſe of any ſpiritual power but that of ordination, confirmation, and government of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy—yet will not this primitive, this inoffenſive ecoleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic, be conſtituted a member of his Majeſty's council, where he ſhall happen to be reſident? And who, not wilfully blind, does not ſee what an influence this would give him, when ſtrengthened with an intereſt in the whole bench of the ſpiritual lords?

How unfriendly then are the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for the meaſure, to the tranquility of this country, who deſire (and they cannot but deſire it, as they muſt be convinced it would be the unavoidable conſequence) to ſee the confuſions and diſorders of the year 1765
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:010857_0200_0F851E66EA281958"/>repeated; for I am confident the generality of the people would more quietly ſubmit to three ſtamp-acts, than to the exertion of the Engliſh eccleſiaſtical hierarchy, in theſe regions of unſhack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led religious liberty. To avoid the oppreſſive rigours of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal dominion, their pious anceſtors came over to theſe then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable ſhores.

No wonder averſe to an order of men, whoſe aſpiring genius and ſervent zeal for eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical diſcipline, they have reaſon to apprehend would continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prompt them, to draw or force men from the religion of their forefathers; of the ſcriptural purity of which they have too high a conviction, ever to abandon; nay, would riſque their all in defence of, rather than ſacrifice at the empty ſhrine of epiſcopacy. The candour, lenity, ſpirit of toleration, and charity, which it is now ſaid, is ſo conſpicuous in the church of England, is moſt ſoothingly urged as an argument to conciliate the acquieſcence of diſſenters, of all denominations, in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite plan of an American epiſcopate. <q>With ſo much mildneſs, tenderneſs and moderation (ſays Dr. Chandler) have the Engliſh Biſhops, for a long courſe of years exerciſed their authority, as ſcarcely to have afforded an inſtance of reaſonable complaint, eſpecially to diſſenters.</q> But pray let me aſk the Dr.—Did this boaſted mildneſs, tenderneſs and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſhine out with ſo clear a luſtre, when very lately at their council-board, their lordſhips of Canterbury and London pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely appeared, to oppoſe ſo inconſiderable a requeſt, as that of a charter of incorporation to the preſbyterian church in New-York, even after the lords of trade, to whoſe conſideration the petition was referred, had reported, that they ſaw no reaſon to refute the prayer of the petitioners. And that ſo trifling a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, hath been frequently refuſed to both Engliſh and Dutch preſbyterians in this province, is a matter of general notoriety. Theſe are illuſtrious inſtances, ſurely, of the friendly diſpoſition of the church of England, and her benevolent prelates, towards their proteſtant fellow Chriſtians in America!—We glory in being ſubject to a prince, the maxims of whoſe government in theſe regions, ſacred to freedom, have always been equally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to Proteſtants, of every Chriſtian denomination, and reſtrictive of eccleſiaſtical domination, from every quarter. And I am ſo far from thinking with Dr. C—, that there are "peculiar reaſons of policy" to induce his majeſty, to adopt his favourite plan of an American epiſcopate, that I am clearly
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:010857_0201_0F851D8A73552CA0"/>of opinion, there are peculiar reaſons of policy, which totally and abſolutely oppoſe it. And this I doubt not ſtill more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly to evince, in the courſe of theſe papers.</p>

               <p>FOR our next entertainment, Squire <hi>T.</hi> very genteelly ſets before us the relicks of ſeveral former meals, not <hi>furniſh'd</hi> but <hi>haſh'd up</hi> by one of his <hi>under-cooks,</hi> the marrow and gravy, any the very guts, of which, is the old tale about Jeſuits; they ſeem to give him great ſatisfaction; but we beg to be excuſed ſwallowing, tho' ſtale as they are, we ſhall venture to taſte ſome of the diſhes.</p>
               <p>The firſt courſe is dreſt in a particular manner by the <hi>ſcullion,</hi> acknowledg'd to be his own invention, in which we have <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, ſpawn, foam, venom, ſtings, Egyptian onions, wine of fornication, &amp;c.</hi> The two laſt ingredients indeed he ſpeaks of as exotics; however his maſter has probably more than enough of the laſt, ſtor'd in his cellar; and of the firſt, growing rampant in his garden. But, for the preſent to lay aſide allegory, the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of <hi>T. P</hi>'s letter ſeems to be contain'd in that notable paſſage, in which he calls us of the faction, <q>the real ſpawn of that invenom'd brood who burſt the bonds of gratitude, juſtice and, religion and in a torrent (<hi>a torrent of brood!</hi>) overturn'd altars, levell'd churches, and laid waſte principalities and and powers.</q> This really ſeems to be ſomewhat too high a charge; but however truth requires that we ſhou'd do juſtice to the character of the church, by frankly, freely and ſincerely, confeſſing, that we, as well as our fathers have at leaſt wreſtled with "principalities and powers," <hi>with the rulers of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world,</hi>—and even with the <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond courſe, which Squire <hi>T.</hi> calls an extract, is ſuch a <hi>mingle-mangle,</hi> ſuch an <hi>hodge-podge,</hi> ſuch an <hi>olla podrida,</hi> that I dare ſay, very few of the gueſts will be able to reliſh it. Squire <hi>T.</hi> ſays "it <hi>breathes ſuch an air of truth,</hi> that he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd it wou'd be injuſtice" not to order it to the table; but for
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:010857_0201_0F851D8A73552CA0"/>my part I affirm, <hi>it blows ſuch a blaſt of nonſenſe,</hi> that I am almoſt poiſon'd with the bare ſmell. In plain Engliſh, it is one of the moſt ſtupid pieces I ever ſaw in a periodical paper, and tho' I were aſſur'd that it was written by my <hi>great-grandfather</hi> (for it pretends to <hi>antiquity</hi>) I wou'd frankly acknowledge my ſelf <hi>great-grandſon</hi> to—a <hi>dunce.</hi> Reader, give me leave to point out to you ſome of the beauties of this piece.</p>
               <p>In the beginning we are told, that the Engliſh nation has been ſo <hi>unhappy</hi> as to ſuffer the moſt <hi>terrible convulſions,</hi> and to <hi>lie,</hi> and that <hi>conſtantly,</hi> in a <hi>fatal poſture</hi> of <hi>confuſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order</hi> upon the account of <hi>religion;</hi> and yet, it ſeems, it has had an <hi>eſtabliſhment,</hi> and an <hi>happy</hi> one too, <hi>ever ſince</hi> the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Afterwards we read of the <hi>ſinking of papal obedience in opinion;</hi> the <hi>realms of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>bearing a figure;</hi> of <hi>proteſtantiſm,</hi> as a <hi>revolt from the faith;</hi> of a <hi>fortification,</hi> having <hi>one baſtion only,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But the flower of all the beautiful nonſenſe, the reader may ſee, in the cloſe of the 2d paragraph, in which we are given to underſtand, that the <hi>church of England</hi> has an <hi>enemy;</hi>—that enemy is <hi>St. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's ſword;</hi>—that ſword is capable of the paſſion <hi>hope;</hi>— the object of that hope is <hi>univerſal monarchy.</hi>—that monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy cannot be obtain'd without <hi>undermining</hi> not <hi>one only,</hi> but <hi>each of the foundations,</hi> of no leſs then <hi>all</hi> the <hi>conſtitutionS</hi> of the church;—this undermining is a <hi>glorious deſign;</hi>—and, in order to accompliſh it, the <hi>ſword inſpires itſelf,</hi> and all its <hi>engines,</hi> with—(with what?—courage? no!) with <hi>application and diligence.</hi> Now who but the moſt conſummate block-head wou'd ever have thought, that the church's grand enemy was a <hi>ſword; that a ſword</hi> cou'd hope any more than a <hi>bayonet,</hi> or be a <hi>king,</hi> any more than a pike-ſtaff;—that a <hi>ſword</hi> wou'd think it <hi>glorious</hi> (for what can hope can think) dig under ſtone walls like a <hi>mattock;</hi> or that it ſhou'd be able to inſpire itſelf, or even its engines (whatever they may be) with <hi>application,</hi> any more than that Squire <hi>T.</hi> ſhould inſpire <hi>T. P.</hi> with <hi>correſpondence,</hi> or himſelf with <hi>flagellation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, criticiſm apart, this is but the third time we have already had the tale of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="402" facs="unknown:010857_0202_0F851D8B270574C8"/>eſtabliſhment</q> of the church of England, the <hi>laſt</hi> are no leſs ſo to debauch the Non-Conformiſts of <hi>America,</hi> and indeed they are much more <hi>artful</hi> in making Proſelytes; for knowing that <hi>a kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand;</hi> they are too wiſe to <hi>revile</hi> (what thoſe they mean to enſnare have already but an indifferent opinion of) the Britiſh hierarchy.</p>
               <p>The company being pretty thoroughly diſguſted, with what they have taſted of Squire <hi>T</hi>'s entertainment, ſeem not fond of regaling themſelves with his <hi>deſert,</hi> his pretended plate of <hi>Italian</hi> fruit; and therefore—here, boy, take away theſe <hi>crab-apples.</hi>

               <p>FOR ſome time paſt I have obſerv'd a controverſy in ſome of our colonies reſpecting the introduction of Engliſh Biſhops among us.—Dr. Chandler appealed to the public, to know if they had any objection, why one or more biſhops ſhou'd not be ſent to America:—and laid before them, the reſtrictions with which they were deſired,—viz.— <q>That the biſhops to be ſent to America, ſhall have no authority, but purely of a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and eccleſiaſtical nature, ſuch as is derived altogether from the church, and not from the ſtate. That his authority ſhall operate only upon the clergy of the church, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the laity, or diſſenters of any denomination. That the biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops ſhall not interfere with the property or privileges, whether civil or religions, of churchmen or diſſenters. That in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, they ſhall have no concern with the probate of wills, letters of guardianſhip, and adminiſtration, or marriage li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences, nor be judges of any caſes relating thereto. But that they ſhall only exerciſe the original powers of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, namely, <hi>ordain</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> the clergy, and adminiſter <hi>confirmation</hi> to thoſe who ſhall deſire it.</q> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Appeal to the public, p. <hi>79.</hi>
                  </note> Several objectors have appeared. A periodical paper, publiſhed in New-York, intituled the <hi>American Whig,</hi>—the <hi>Centinel,</hi> in Philadelphia, &amp;c. Tho' the former, it ſeems, does not object againſt biſhops with the above reſtriction: <q>The Appeal ſays he, aſks nothing but what is highly reaſonable.</q>

<pb n="403" facs="unknown:010857_0202_0F851D8B270574C8"/>Much has been written pro and con—and perhaps a great deal foreign to the purpoſe, and unbecoming the profeſſors of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. As the cauſe is debating before the tribunal of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, I wou'd beg leave to give the ſketch of a plan, whereby they may be better enabled to form a right judgment.—Suppoſe ſome judicious, impartial perſon, ſhou'd collect all the pieces that are, and ſhall be, publiſhed on the ſubject;—and exhibit weekly, or monthly, in our public prints, the ſubſtance of all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made uſe of, attending only to the merits of the cauſe. —This might be done by way of <hi>dialogue,</hi> in a ſhort, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive manner.—But I foreſee an objection that will ariſe. Where ſhall we find the judicious, impartial perſon? It muſt be confeſs'd the objection is weighty; and 'tis to be lamented, that there are ſuch animoſities and diviſions between thoſe, who enrol their name among the followers of the <hi>prince of peace,</hi> —But as there are many perſons in our colonies of good abilities, natural and acquired, it wou'd be uncharitable not to believe that <hi>ſome</hi> of them, have ſo great a ſenſe of the <hi>Deity</hi> —ſo zealous for the glory of God, and the good of mankind —ſo far from being bigoted to this, or that, particular party, that they wou'd diſdain to blow up the ſparks of party ſpirit, or to tranſgreſs the laws of truth and decency. Shou'd ſuch a perſon put in execution the plan propos'd, or ſomething of the like nature, and endeavour to ſow the ſeeds of peace and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among his fellow-creatures (ſo neceſſary at this juncture, for our political intereſt) I doubt not but the ſincere Chriſtian will thank him for his <hi>labour of love;</hi> and that he will ſee the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that promiſe, made us by our Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer—<hi>Bleſſed are the peace-makers, for they ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the children of God.</hi>

               <p>UNHAPPY it is for man, that ſome of his ſpecies enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſavage deſire of gorging their animoſity by giving pain to others. Reſtleſs and diſcompos'd in themſelves, they love to ſee all things ruffled and diſorder'd around them.

They delight in diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dark ſide of ſubjects; in clouding beauties, and pointing out deformities. Such (I am ſorry to ſay) appear the men on whoſe meaſures I have undertaken to animadvert. A ſincere love to <hi>religion</hi> and my <hi>country,</hi> has only engaged me in this taſk. The Chriſtain, that truly eſteems the <hi>former,</hi> cannot but endeavour to promote every undertaking that may advance its intereſt, and oppoſe every procedure that has a manifeſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to diſſerve it; and the honeſt man, who ſincerely loves the <hi>latter,</hi> will find it his duty to detect and reſiſt every iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous attempt, to diſturb the happineſs of ſociety, and endanger the welfare of his country, by ſowing the ſeeds of jealouſy, or kindling the fires of party ſpirit.</p>

It has ever been the practice of thoſe, who were endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſubvert any conſtitution, whether of church or ſtate, (with deſign to raiſe another more agreeable to their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) aſſiduouſly to harangue the populace on its defects, to enumerate and magnify every ſtain, but to overlook every beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or advantage; and to exaggerate and cenſure thoſe deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which neceſſarily attend every government, as if only to be found in, and peculiar to the <hi>one</hi> they diſlike—This ſcheme (however unjuſt) is craftily political, and too ſeldom fails of ſucceſs. For as the generality of men have neither leiſure nor abilities to enter into an exact examination, they depend on the opinions of thoſe who they imagine have the opportunities and wiſdom neceſſary. The love of liberty, the enmity to corruption, and aſſiduous regard theſe politicians profeſs, conciliate their eſteem. The frightful picture of magnified blemiſhes they hold up, together with a deſire of novelty, moſt natural to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, inflame the paſſions of the populace, and ſo root their prejudice, that they become, in a great meaſure, invincible. They are led by degrees to be at laſt guilty of crimes, they would at firſt have thought of with horror. This was the eaſe ſoon after the reformation in <hi>Germany;</hi> as in avoiding one extreme, men moſt commonly are precipitated into the oppoſite (and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more dangerous) one. A ſect was raiſed under pretence at <hi>firſt,</hi> of only reforming ſome of thoſe things, which they imagined not yet ſufficiently <hi>pure.</hi> The founders began to preach up a greater perfection in morals; from hence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to reprove all who were any way obſervers of civility and decency; to pronounce it ſinful to poſſeſs the conveniencies of life: And determining that all other books were pernicious, they met, and burnt all they could <hi>obtain,</hi> but the Bible. When they had got to this eminence, their maſk began to tremble and fall off. They term'd all miniſters but their own, "wicked idolaters of antichriſt's ſynagogue." They ſaid that all kingdoms ſhould be deſtroy'd to make room for the kingdom of Chriſt, and labour'd in aboliſhing the execution of juſtice, becauſe Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>"reſiſt not evil,"</hi> and in bringing on a community of goods, becauſe Chriſt and his apoſtles were an example. Their teachers ſtood up as advocates for "abſolute liberty, free and impartial liberty," preaching againſt magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, and that all men ſhould be on a level. Such doctrine of <hi>re-reformation</hi> were ſure to be eagerly ſwallowed by a licen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tious rabble. Accordingly when their numbers had great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> increaſed, they pretended the earth was given them by the Lord, and form'd themſelves into aſſociations to take poſſeſſion They laid aſide all diſguiſe; And theſe preachers of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:010857_0204_0F851D8D1DC70048"/>thought it lawful to take ſix or ſeven wives apiece. <hi>They,</hi> who at firſt affirm'd juſtice and judgment to be mercileſs cruelty, now accounted their hands ſanctify'd by being inbrued in Chriſtian blood. They who at their emerſion, forbad their followers poſſeſſing the conveniencies of life, and ſuing for their right, thought at laſt it was agreeable to God to turn their adverſaries out of their houſes, and to enrich themſelves with the pillage of their goods—which being laid to their charge, their anſwer was, "the time is come, according to our Saviour's promiſe, <hi>that the meek ſhall inherit the earth."</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Parallel to this was the behaviour of thoſe men, who in the reign of Charles I. ſet out with a pretence of obtaining liberty of conſcience, and afterwards, as they increaſed in power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in the inſolence of their demands; and not content with a free toleration, would force all denominations to fall down and worſhip the brazen Idol of <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> which <hi>they</hi> had ſet up.

If there be a church, which (in the opinion of the wiſeſt legiſlatures) is beſt ſuited, from its principles and government, to the conſtitution of the late, and is accordingly ſo interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with it, that the one muſt be rent and torn to pieces with the other;—And another, whoſe ſpirit is directly oppoſite, whoſe profeſſed principles, and conſtant practiſes are, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the deſtruction of all other denominations—whoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, altho' they do not <hi>ex hypotheſi</hi> condemn the doctrines of the church of England, will, nevertheleſs, in the opinion even of one of their friends (<hi>Rapin,</hi> in his diſſertation on <hi>Whigs</hi> and <hi>Tories,</hi>) never be contented till they have entirely deſtroyed it, and have given evidence of their intention in their <hi>ſolemn league and covenant,</hi> &amp;c. every wiſe people will ſupport the <hi>one,</hi> and the cautious of the <hi>other.</hi> A change in government muſt ever in the event be precarious; and no friend to his country would wiſh any in our happy one.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>TO believe that among the Chriſtian clergy, there is an order called biſhops <hi>jure divino</hi> ſuperior to the reſt, is to be an epiſcopalian. But to wiſh to ſee theſe biſhops clothed with worldly honours, wealth, and power, and turned into lords, is papiſtical, repugnant to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, and utterly inconſiſtent with the principles of ſound policy. Every proteſtant churchman will therefore, while he approves the humole apoſtolic ſhepherd, deteſt the proud prelatic Pontiff, as a dangerous character, that ſprang up in the churches, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of anti-chriſt. Such being the vaſt difference between a Biſhop and a Prelate, what wonder that a country, not yet duped by the clergy, ſhould eye the project of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing an epiſcopate, with all that jealouſy which an attachment to liberty neceſſarily inſpires; eſpecially when, in ſpite of all the addreſs of the partizans of the ſcheme to conceal their true aim, they have given ſo many proofs, that Prelates, and not Biſhops, are the characters they wiſh to ſee eſtabliſhed among us.</p>
               <p>Whether this is ſufficiently proved, muſt be left to the public to determine. If the introduction of prelacy, to ſubjugate the colonies to the tyranny of prieſts, is the object of Dr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and the convention, it becomes every true ſon of the church —every friend to Chriſtianity, and lover of this country, to
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:010857_0206_0F851D8E41DB20D0"/>riſe up and ſet his face like a flint againſt a ſcheme of ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a tendency. The temporal powers of the Biſhops in England, were popiſh inveſtitures, and there are not wanting inſtances of pious Biſhops, in every age ſince the reformation, who have lamented theſe annexations as expoſing them to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and cares, foreign to the original deſign of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual offices, unfriendly to religion, and impediments to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of primitive purity.</p>
               <p>Having the honour to agree with theſe worthies of our church, and conceiving that if the eſtabliſhment of an epiſcopate in America, was left to the ſole management of the clergy here, and the bench of Biſhops in England, it would participate large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a prelatical mixture; and that it was indeed impoſſible to be otherwiſe, without an alteration of the law, I thought it my duty, tho' a churchman, to aſſiſt in awakening the public to a ſalutary vigilance, to convict the miſſionaries of their inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent neglect of the government, the laity, and the Biſhop of London their ſuperior, and to vindicate our church in general from the odium of a meaſure, contrived by a few meddling prieſts, to advance their own intereſt, and naturally productive (unleſs certain preliminary ſecurities are given) of the moſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical conſequences, to theſe weak and expoſed diſperſions of the empire.—With theſe views, I ſhall continue my correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with you, and truſt my letters to your candour, provided my ſentiments are not changed.—Concerning the ſtyle I am not ſolicitous; and it is therefore ſubmitted to your correction.</p>
               <p>That the majority of the epiſcopalians are not chargeable with this peſtilent enterpriſe, ſhall be the ſcope of this letter, in order to remove any ſuſpicions to the contrary, which the guilty contrivers of the plot are falſely and wickedly endeavouring to propagate. This may be argued from the character and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the American churchmen; the conduct of the petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for an epiſcopate, and the nature and method of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, againſt the attacks they have received.</p>
               <p>As to our character, it is notorious to all the world; and nothing but malice itſelf, can prompt any man to deny, that in principle we are as diſtant from the tories, as any Whigs or low churchmen in England. Few, very few Americans, avow the abſurd and ſlaviſh doctrines of paſſive obedience and non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; nor can any perſuaſion claim the honour of a more zealous attachment to revolution principles, or a ſincerer, more fervent and ſteady affection to the proteſtant ſucceſſion, and the preſent reigning family. As aſſerters of liberty, who excelled us in the late memorable oppoſition to the ſtamp-act? Nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to mention it with triumph, that the Virginians are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="411" facs="unknown:010857_0206_0F851D8E41DB20D0"/>univerſally churchmen; and tho' their anceſtors, as cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, were obliged to fly to theſe diſtant regions, for their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the cauſe of that unfortunate prince king Charles the firſt, and it might thence have been ſuppoſed, that non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſting principles were deeply ſown in the minds of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, yet this was the people who firſt publickly and boldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to vindicate the liberties of the continent, and dared to deny, that the commons of America owed allegiance to their fellow ſubjects of Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>The Americans are plain in their manners, virtuouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; neither puffed up by a love of pomp and luxury on the one hand, nor diſpirited by poverty on the other.—Long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to freedom, jealous of their rights, and watchful of the undue extent of the prerogative. Hence it is, that in all their public expences in government, they are the moſt frugal oeconomiſts in the world. This is the known character of all the provinces. Epiſcopal and non-epiſcopal.—And if none will dare to aſſert, and I am ſure none can with truth and juſtice aſſert the contrary, how improbable that a people ſo principled, ſhould be ſolicitous for domineering maſters of any kind, or in the leaſt diſpoſed to countenance a meaſure which, conſidering the infant and feeble ſtate of the colonies, will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably expoſe them to the dominion of the clergy. To this very day the epiſcopalians of Virginia, where there are no diſſenters to check their power, are ſo far from a blind devotion to the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, that the public proviſion for them extends only to two churches in a county, with an allowance to each incumbent, of a little more than £ 200, per annum. A ſum ſcarce ſufficient for their decent ſupport.</p>
               <p>And that this is the general ſpirit of the continent, the whole prieſthood, ſuperior and inferior, on both ſides of the water, muſt long have been ſenſible.—The chief end of erecting the ſociety for the propagating the goſpel, according to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Biſhop of Landaff, was the eſtabliſhment of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal authority in this country; and yet we have ſeen more than half a century roll away, without accompliſhing a deſign eaſily effected, could the Americans have been prevailed upon to open their purſe ſtrings.—ever ſuſpicious, that under the cloak of epiſcopacy, prelacy might ſteal in, and eſteeming ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual courts a hardſhip, infinitely greater than a Biſhop's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, we have hitherto reſiſted the ſolicitations of the lower clergy, and the influence of the right reverend bench, from the reign of king William to the preſent day; and ſince the ſouthern colonies might, if they pleaſed, have eaſily given their lordſhips a ſafe port to land in, and the political objections, now ſtarted
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:010857_0207_0F851D8EE27E3B10"/>on the part of the government againſt the ſcheme, had no weight in queen Ann's time, the concluſion is irreſiſtable, that all the provinces owe their exemption from prelatic power, in, a very eminent degree, to the diſcountenances that an epiſcopate hath ſteadily received, from the epiſcopalians themſelves.</p>
               <p>The conduct of the conſpirators of this plot, is a further proof, that they are a contemptible miniority.—Had the project been deviſed or avowed by our communion in general, a due reſpect would have been ſhewn to government, and to the Biſhop of London, in the means of giving it ſucceſs. Such marks of wiſdom, prudence, and temper, would have appeared in every ſtep taken, as became a denomination ſo numerous, loyal, and wiſe. How obvious was the plan, which even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe ſeemed to dictate.—In the ſouthern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, where the epiſcopalians have the power in their own hands, what more is requiſite than a joint petition of governor, council, and aſſembly, to the throne, for his majeſty's appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a law, for the eſtabliſhment of an epiſcopate, in the colony requeſting it. And if nothing more was aimed at than primitive epiſcopacy, what colony ſo poor as not to be able to ſupport a hundred Biſhops of apoſtolical grandeur—This, when effected in any province, would, in all, remove the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſing from the danger, and expence of a voyage to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope for ordination; and in the colonies, where the legiſlative power is divided among proteſtants, of different denominations, if the miſconduct of the clergy, and the want of confirmation, rendered our people uneaſy, we might urge the legiſlature to favour the extent of the other epiſcopates, or the introduction of Biſhops of our own, and if that failed, the acceſs to the crown, for its influence was open; and thus the ſcheme would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, in proportion to the benefits experienced, and the ſecurity we could gradually obtain againſt the pride of prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo deſervedly dreaded by the whole continent, and ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be apprehended from a precipitate introduction of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, archieved by clergymen alone.</p>
               <p>In this way, no umbrage would be given to the government, nor could the Biſhop of London have complained of a contempt of the authority he claims, under the countenance of the royal inſtructions, long uſage, and our own voluntary concurrence.—Meaſures of this kind could have given no juſt offence, and meaſures leſs prudent and temperate, the whole church would never have approved—But fully ſenſible, that our denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was generally diſaffected to the leaſt mixture of prelacy, and therefore would either not concur in the project of an epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate, at a juncture ſo unſeaſonable as the preſent; or proceed
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:010857_0207_0F851D8EE27E3B10"/>in it with a wiſe deliberation, diſguſtful to prieſt-craft, recourſe was had to art.—The enterpriſe was concealed from the laity.—Leſs than twenty dependant clergymen arrogantly preſume to repreſent all the churchmen, in America, and in our names, complain even to the king himſelf of diſtreſſes never felt, and to aſk as a boon, what (until ſecurity, ten thouſand times beyond the value of all they are worth in the world, is given to us) would be eſteemed by every ſenſible churchman in America one of the moſt fruitful ſources of miſchief and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I mean an increaſe of the power of the clergy. It is not long ſince we were told in a pamphlet aſcribed to one of the greateſt dignitaries of the church of England, that Biſhops would be ſent to America, as ſoon as the people were diſpoſed to receive them. His Grace is, perhaps, by this time convinced, that he preſumed too far upon his own influence in the cabinet; but it is not improbable that this hint inflamed the zealots, who tranſmitted the ſeven petitions, which have given ſo much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,—Fortunately to us, ſo ſlender a ſubſcription was leſs evidence of the popularity of the cauſe, than the author of the pamphlet expected, and hence they were laid under an inevitable neceſſity, of divulging the ſecret to the laity. That all ranks might be drawn into an approbation, of what the clergy had contrived, Mr. Chandler was dubbed Doctor, and employed like a wild Iriſh mourner, to utter ſighs, groans, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for hardſhips—hardſhips unparallel'd, hardſhips, which, till this memorable appeal appeared in print, were never thought of, unleſs by a few high-flying neceſſitous zealots of the gown.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, is a ſhort but true hiſtory of the late attempt to introduce prelacy,—The clergy, and but a few of theſe, are the authors; and 'tis to facilitate that deſign, that we lately hear of their frequent aſſemblies under the name of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—A practice unknown to the eccleſiaſtical conſtitution of England, and to which his lordſhip, the Biſhop of London, will doubtleſs very ſoon, in juſtice to his character, apply a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able remedy.</p>
               <p>Our general diſcountenance of the petitioners is the laſt proof I ſhall advance, of our abhorrence of their ſcheme. Prelacy, odious as it is, has had apologiſts of abilities, and their deſences have been artful and ſpecious; but was ever a ſett of projectors at a more ridiculous plunge, than the preſent pretended deſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our church!—Judging from their weekly produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 'tis cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> that not a man of learning or genius amongſt us will come out to their aid.—Such we have, and they are as willing to vindicate the rights of the church, as they lately proved themſelves able to maintain the civil liberties of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:010857_0208_0F851D918CE8A060"/>But appriſed that an epiſcopate will introduce the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of prieſts, and the inquiſitorial oppreſſion of ſpiritual courts, not a man of ſenſe will take up his pen in ſo pernicious and diſreputable a cauſe.—Hence the diſtreſs and extremity of the convention, and the pitiful ſcribblers they have retained in their ſervice.—Wit and ſophiſtry might have concealed the nakedneſs of the cauſe from the vulgar, and a talent for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule could have ſtung an opponent, and diverted the public.—But the projectors are unſupported, abandoned, and unpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied.—The inference is natural, that not a man of abilities in all our churches is on their ſide, and for that reaſon the preſs groans under a weekly medley of repetition, wrath, buffoonery, nonſenſe, and falſhood.—In truth, Mr. Whig, all America (a few Tories excepted) is averſe to clerical domination, and almoſt every epiſcopalian in this country, can ſubſcribe himſelf as I do, a friend to humble primitive Biſhops, but a deteſter of modern, proud prelates, and therefore.</p>

            <p>RELIGION is confeſſedly ſo advantageous to ſociety, that every reaſonable man, muſt endeavour to advance it, even thro' a political view of increaſing the happineſs of that community of which he is a member. The evidence of this truth ſeems almoſt always to have been ſo conſpicuous, that ſince the firſt origin of government, every prudent legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has taken care to eſtabliſh ſome religion, and afforded a competent maintenance to the miniſters of it. The ultimate advantages of honeſly, and obedience to government, were not ſufficiently evident and glaring, to reſtrain the Fallies of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the unreſiſted deſire of unlimitted freedom; the future rewards therefore of virtue, and puniſhments of vice, were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to eſtabliſh that <hi>order</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> ſo requiſite to the juſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſprings of every political ſyſtem. But the duty of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting religion receives ſtronger enforcements, when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the one we are now to promote, is the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; —a ſyſtem which has not only the moſt undoubted evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of truth, but is fram'd by its precepts and ſpirit, more eſpecially to favour the well-being of ſociety,—convinced of this, the government alſo to which we are ſubjects, from a number of denominations profeſſing Chriſtianity, but differing for the moſt part meerly in external modes, has choſen <hi>one</hi> which ſhe thought moſt concording in its polity with the ſtate; moſt agreeable to the major part of the nation; and moſt fitted in its principles and regimen, to promote the happineſs and unity of the kingdom.—As Chriſtians therefore, it is our duty to advance the general intereſt of Chriſtianity.—And as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſociety, particularly to favour that form of church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which tho' it was at firſt indifferent, yet ceaſes to be ſo by the eſtabliſhment of the civil magiſtrate. An eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which has coſt a million of lives; for which our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers willingly ſuffered the ſevereſt deaths! An eſtabliſhment,
<pb n="418" facs="unknown:010857_0210_0F851D932028B250"/>which the wiſeſt politicians, whether native or foreign, account an honour to Britons; the niceſt adapted to monarchical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and beſt conſtituted to preſerve liberty, learning and true religion; and to diffuſe principles of benevolence, patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and concord.—Whoever therefore endeavours to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel it, or prejudice its miniſters, is either an enemy to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or endeavours to ſhew his love in a very dangerous and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiv'd manner. As it is neceſſary to the ſupport of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the <hi>divine author</hi> of it himſelf has appointed, that certain officers ſhould be ſet apart to inculcate its doctrines, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter its Sacraments, and watch that <hi>all things</hi> may <hi>be done to edification;</hi> ſo it is equally neceſſary, in order to their due performance of theſe offices, that the people entertain and eſteem for their function, a reverence and regard to their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and a favourable opinion of their virtue. Where-ever therefore ſentiments contrary to theſe are promoted, religion muſt certainly ſuffer, and our country conſequently ſuffer with it. There is naturally in moſt men a baneful proneneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the diſcovery of blemiſhes and imperfections in thoſe, who by their ſuperiority in ſtation, are ſuppos'd to be poſſeſs'd of ſuperior virtue. It is the fault of weak minds, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour not to raiſe themſelves, but to debaſe others to an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with them. <hi>Vice</hi> delights to ſuppreſs a conſciouſneſs of her own deformity, by partial compariſons of it with aggavated repreſentations of the deformity of others: Hence may proceed that <hi>avarice</hi> of magnifying the defects of clergymen; that eagle-eyed obſervation of their infirmities; and that unſatiated avidity with which the moſt nauſeous tales of calumny (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them) are ſwallow'd down.</p>
            <p>An eſteem and reverence for another, is requiſite to engage us to liſten candidly to, and earneſtly practiſe his advice: The enemies of Chriſtianity and ſociety, conſcious of this, have ever made it their ſtudy to affix the vileſt ſtains on its miniſters, and to debaſe the <hi>order</hi> as low as poſſible; knowing that, according to its ſucceſs or decay, religion would be weakened or proſper. —In this they have been but too ſucceſsful! The Chriſtian prieſthood, inſtead of being held in the moſt honourable light, ſerves as a theme for the puerile ſatire of every dough-ſcull'd top, prating buffoon, or illiterate debauchee; who expiatate o'er their Cups on the luxury, avarice, folly, and intemperance of the <hi>clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not content with this victory, theſe "foes to eccleſiaſtical influence," have march'd farther into their enemies territories, and (conſidering the church-eſtabliſhment as the ſtrongeſt bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, againſt their ſucceſs) have inceſſantly aim'd their fire at
<pb n="419" facs="unknown:010857_0210_0F851D932028B250"/>her clergy,—<hi>tota armenta ſequantur.</hi>—With ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>papiſts</hi> gladly ſupplied them; to their ſtandard have flock'd in greedy troops, ſhoals of thoſe proſtituters of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who live on the imperfections and tumers of the <hi>body politic,</hi> as nauſeous vermin on the ſores and excreſcencies of the <hi>animal</hi> body. From <hi>theſe</hi> the cry of prieſtcraft, perſecution, clerical luxury, and ambition, has been re-echoed, 'till the ſound has grown agreeable and natural to all thoſe, who either know very little of, or care not much, for religion.—But what is more melancholy, theſe attacks are made in ſuch a manner, that no defence can properly or ſufficiently be provided. The vices of any individual (as in all ſocieties there will be ſome faulty) are ſpread over the whole <hi>order.</hi> The ſuſpicions of the people are immediately raiſed,—their reverence for the office diminiſhes, —and an inattention to, and contempt of, inſtruction, follows. Such a flagrant attempt and procedure againſt the epiſcopal clergy, is, my countrymen, confeſſedly <hi>pernicious;</hi> at this ſeaſon, when unanimity and peace are eſſentially neceſſary 'tis <hi>particularly dangerous;</hi> that it ſhould be perform'd by our <hi>countrymen,</hi> and by <hi>thoſe</hi> who profeſs themſelves <hi>lovers</hi> of their country, is almoſt <hi>incredible;</hi> but that it ſhould be done by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and by <hi>thoſe</hi> whoſe particular <hi>duty</hi> it is to extend the influences of <hi>proteſtaniſm,</hi> is the moſt unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled and <hi>nefarious machination!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The clergy of the church of England in America, (<note n="*" place="bottom">This the author can pronounce with the greater confidence, as by his ſtation and experience, he has had greater opportunities of ſcrutinizing their conduct,—and as a layman, can ſpeak with the greater propriety and readineſs.</note> a body of men who have always behaved themſelves ſo as to deſerve the eſteem and regards of their fellow ſubjects) influenc'd by a love to religion, petition'd for the enjoyment of thoſe privileges, without which they ſaw, and ſtill perceive, the church muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly decay, as not being able to ſupply herſelf with miniſters, and being deſtitute of that government and diſcipline which ſhe requires. That no unreaſonable ſuſpicions might be entertained by other denominations, they publiſh'd their plan, and in the moſt mild and Chriſtian manner, appealed to the world for the reaſonableneſs of it.—In return for this candour (bluſh, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity!) their Characters have been loaded with the moſt unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved reproach, deliver'd in the moſt rancorous recriminations of aſperity. 'Twas ſufficiently injurious (a very <hi>heathen</hi> would have imagin'd) to accuſe them of falſehood,—of being
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:010857_0211_0F851D93C32D2BE0"/>ambitious eccleſiaſties,—of repreſenting their countrymen as diſaffected to Great-Britain,—of endeavouring to en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let them then point out to us thoſe perſons whom they have thus accus'd of breaking the moſt ſolemn oath whereby they all have bound themſelves at their ordination, by being diſaffected to the preſent government. Truth, juſtice, religion, and the injur'd characters of men who are zealouſly engag'd in the ſervice of religion and their country, <hi>demand</hi> this!—without doing this, they cannot but be conſider'd, not as thoſe friends to truth and their country they would appear to be, but as ſoment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of diſcord, and enemies to religion and ſociety.—But 'tis the manner of theſe politicians (as it is their intereſt) to wave coming to the point; and like <hi>Proteus,</hi> when baſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>led in one ſhape, to twiſt themſelves immediately into another. Such juggling however will not ſatisfy men of conſideration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting this circumſtance. Inadvertent errors demand a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable forgiveneſs,— but premeditated malice deſerves cenſure and abhorrence.</p>
            <p>In order to raiſe the reſentment of other denominations, it has alſo been aſſerted, that the church of England deems all the foreign Proteſtant churches, no churches. To this objection (altho' it will doubtleſs receive a proper confutation from the clergy) I would juſt anſwer,—that the laws of England re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that every one who officiates in the church, ſhould receive <hi>epiſcopal ordination,</hi> and conſider none but ſuch as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, as <hi>clergymen.</hi> A law framed to prevent confuſion and diſoder. And it is highly reaſonable that none ſhould enjoy the immunities, ſet apart by a ſociety for a particular uſe, without complying with the terms required. A free and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive toleration is allowed them, and even churches have been rais'd for them at the public coſt. The chief dignitaries alſo of the church have ever held them in the higheſt eſtimation,— thought, as their firſt ſounders did, their ordination <hi>excuſable</hi> thro' the neceſſity and urgency of the caſe,—never ſcrupled,
<pb n="421" facs="unknown:010857_0211_0F851D93C32D2BE0"/>when abroad, to receive the Sacrament in their churches,— and continually kept up a friendly interconrſe, correſpondence, and confidence with them. Neither were biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> and others, wanting in their endeavours to promote a cloſer union with them. Even <hi>Laud,</hi> (whoſe unhappy name has been ſo much and ſo injuriouſly ſtigmatiz'd) held a friendly correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the proteſtant churches: See his letter in 1639, to the <hi>Swiſs</hi> divines, in the <hi>Praeſtantium viorum</hi> Epiſtolae, Ep. 552. where they are called by him <hi>Confrates mei Chariſſimi;</hi> and of their letter to him he ſaith, <q>It was agreeable to me on a double account, as it was their's, and exhorting to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an peace. Such men ought they to be, who are members of the ſame body, and who believe and profeſs the communion of Saints.</q> And in 1629, he writes to <hi>Voſſus</hi> with great mildneſs, and concern for the whole reformed church, and for peace among divines, in Ep. 471. And he ſaith to him in 1633, <q>It is a meer invention that the Engliſh biſhops deſired to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their juriſdiction over the foreign Proteſtant churches: A thing which they never ſo much as dreamed of.</q> Ep. 528. The late Doctor <hi>

                  </gap>ake</hi> likewiſe, in his letters to <hi>Le Clere,</hi> and Jablonſki, expreſſes the warmeſt affection for them: And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in a letter to the firſt, dated April, 1715, he declared his abhorrence of the thought conſidering them as no churches, <q>Unionem arctor em inter omnes Reformatos procurare quovis pretio vellem.</q> i. e.

               <argument>
                  <p>A brief view of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, as it is at this Day practiſed in <hi>England:</hi> Addreſſed to Sir <hi>Nathaniel Curzon,</hi> Bart. and the reſt of the Gentlemen of the Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Parliament, for enquiring into the Abuſes and Corruptions of Eccleſiaſtical Courts and Juriſdictions. (Firſt printed in the year 1733.)</p>

                  <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AS the grand inqueſt of the kingdom of Great-Britain, have devolved upon you the truſt of enquiring into the abuſes and corruptions of eccleſiaſtical courts and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, give me leave briefly, and in miniature, to repreſent to your view, a contracted ſcheme of thoſe courts and juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in England; whereby it will appear what an incredible ſum is yearly drained and ſqueezed out of the people's purſes and eſtates by ſuch eccleſiaſtical officers and ſpiritual perſons, who make gain their only godlineſs.</p>
               <p>But as my intent here is not to intermeddle with their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of faith, or practices in religion, I ſhall only at preſent enquire, whether a great cauſe of the impoveriſhing of this
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:010857_0212_0F851D9423AC89B0"/>nation, is not occaſioned by an over-numerous body of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks among us, and by the exactions, extortions, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of what are called ſpiritual courts and juriſdictions.</p>
               <p>In order to this enquiry, I beg leave to recite a maxim or obſervation of the lord Verulam, (which will be found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an eternal truth) viz. <hi>That a ſmaller number who ſpend more and earn leſs, do ſooner wear out an eſtate, than a greater number that live lower</hi> (meaner) <hi>and gather more; ſo it is</hi> (ſays he) <hi>with an overgrown</hi> (i. e. a numerous and luxuriant) <hi>clergy.</hi> For they conſume the labours of <hi>others, but bringing in nothing to the ſtock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the ſtock and produce of the Engliſh nation, is in a great meaſure ſwallowed up and devoured by the numerous body of our eccleſiaſticks, and their juriſdictions, courts, and officers, will I believe evidently appear, if you conſider the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing obſervables, reſpecting thoſe perſons, and their courts and juriſdictions.</p>
               <p n="1">I. We have here in England two provincial Archbiſhops, Canterbury, and York; each of which has his princely retinue for the ſupport of his temporal grandeur, as well as a numerous body of ſpiritual officers, for the exerciſe and execution of his eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction and authority.</p>
               <p>In the number of their temporal retinue, we may reckon their ſtewards and baliffs of lordſhips, manors, lands &amp;c. ſtewards of their houſholds, gentlemen-uſhers, uſhers of their halls, comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers, yeomen of their horſe, ſecretaries, houſe keepers, purveyors, butlers, cooks, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And among the latter, their ſuffragans, vicars-general, guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of ſpiritualities, chancellors, officials, commiſſaries, deans, arch-deacons, regiſters, deputy-regiſters, advocates, apparitors, projectors, <hi>cum multis aliis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the officers and attendants of theſe arch-biſhops are of two kinds, ſo are their courts. viz.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Courts temporal, as courts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>2. Courts ſpiritual, as the courts of arches (to Canterbury) prerogative courts, courts of delegates, conſiſtory courts, or courts of audience, courts of faculties for granting licences and diſpenſations (with divers others.)</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">II. Next, as to biſhops (who in moſt things imitate arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops) we may obſerve,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That within England we have twenty-four dioceſan biſhops.</item>

2. That theſe have alſo their ſeveral trains of domeſtick offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſervants, and attendants, both temporal and ſpiritual.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But as I ſhall not at preſent enter into a diſquiſition of their eſtates in lordſhips, manors, lands, palaces, gardens, &amp;c. ſo I ſhall here wave all enquiry into the ſtate of their temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues; my preſent intention being chiefly to remark on their eccleſiaſtical or ſpiritual courts and juriſdictions.—Wherein I obſerve, that our twenty four biſhops have, to aſſiſt them in the exerciſe and execution of their ſpiritual juriſdiction, the following officers, viz.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>24 Suffragans, if not double the number, with their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</item>
                  <item>26 Chancellors, with their attendants.</item>
                  <item>26 Regiſters, with their attendants:</item>
                  <item>26 Deputy regiſters, with their clerks, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>26 Gentlemen apparitors,</item>
                  <item>52, or more, proctors: and</item>
                  <item>150, or more common apparitors.</item>
               </list>
               <p>With many other officers, notaries, clerks, and attendants.</p>
               <p>Note, <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> as well as <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> have their diſtinct courts, <hi>i. e.</hi> one in each diviſion of thoſe dioceſes.</p>
               <p>There are alſo under theſe archbiſhops and biſhops at leaſt,
<list>
                     <item>60 Arch-deaconries. And to theſe belong,</item>
                     <item>60 Arch-deacons courts; which conſiſt of</item>
                     <item>60 Commiſſaries or judges of thoſe courts; as alſo</item>
                     <item>60 or more ſurrogates, or deputy commiſſaries.</item>
                     <item>60 Regiſters, with their deputies, ſcribes and clerks.</item>
                     <item>120 Proctors (<hi>i. e.</hi> if we allow but two to each court.)</item>
                     <item>200 or more apparitors, with a multitude of promoters and informers; <hi>cum aliis Officiariis.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See of the exerciſe of their juriſdiction hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further, beſides the before-mentioned officers, we may obſerve another, who, in their eccleſiaſtical oeconomy, is called a dean, in latin <hi>Decanus.</hi> For that, 'tis ſaid, in his firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, he was to preſide over ten pariſhes, which was therefore called a deanery.</p>
               <p>But deans are now with us diſtinguiſhed into four or five kinds, viz.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Cathedral deans; theſe, with their reſpective chapters, have in many things a concurrent juriſdiction with the biſhop of the dioceſe: And ſome authorities they have which are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of him. The number of this kind of deans in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Wales is twenty-four: For at St. David's and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff
<pb n="425" facs="unknown:010857_0213_0F851D94EA800910"/>they have no cathedral deans, the office of dean being there exerciſed by the biſhops themſelves.</item>
                  <item>2. Collegiate deans, ſome whereof have all the concomitants and attendants of a cathedral dean, except that of having a biſhop at their head; ſuch a dean is that of Weſtminſter col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>3. Exempt deans, i. e. ſuch as are exempt from epiſcopal juriſdiction, as having an independent eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction within their own particular precincts; ſuch a dean is that of Battle in Suſſex, who is, or may be, inveſted in his deanry by the king's letters patents, and needs no inſtitution or induction by the biſhop or archdeacon. <hi>Quaere,</hi> of the dean or provoſt of Eaton college, if an exempt, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>4. Non-Exempt deans, i. e. ſuch as are not ſo exempt as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid. Theſe are generally donatives in the arch-biſhops, and conſequently have a peculiar juriſdiction derived from them; ſuch are the deans of the arches (and St. Martin le Grand) in London; the dean of Bocking in Eſſex, with ſome others under the archbiſhop of Canterbury: And I have heard of the like under the archbiſhop of York, but can at preſent give no certain account of them.</item>
                  <item>5. Rural deans; theſe originally had no judicial powers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only ſubſtituted by the biſhop to aſſiſt him in granting admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations and probates of wills. But I am informed, that at this day divers of thoſe deans have arrogated to themſelves a ſpecies of juriſdiction. Though 'tis ſaid, their chief buſineſs is only to feaſt the clergy at viſitations, for which they have a licence to raiſe contributions within their deanries.—See <hi>Nelſon</hi>'s <hi>rights of the clergy.</hi> 252, 253, &amp;c.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And ſeeing we have mentioned cathedral deans, I ſhall here beg leave to give a ſpecimen of the ſeveral parts or members whereof the cathedratic choir or body is uſually compoſed; which, taking our pattern from that at St. Paul's, ſtands thus:</p>
               <p>1 Biſhop, 1 dean, 1 ſubdean, 1 praecentor, 1 chancellor, who has under him divers ſcribes, clerks and officers; 1 treaſurer, who has an officer called a ſacriſt or ſacriſtan for a coadjutor, and this ſacriſt has 3 or 4 attendants called viergers. There are alſo 5 archdeacons, 30 prebendaries, 12 petty canons, 6 or 8 vicars choral, and about 24 choriſters and ſinging boys, beſides other officers and attendants: The whole number of officers and attendants in this and other cathedrals amounting to about 150, and in ſome, as I am informed, to near 200.</p>
               <p>And if any perſon is deſirous to know the ſeveral procurations, ſynodals, penſions, payments and perquiſites appropriated to each of the above-mentioned officers within the dioceſe of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="426" facs="unknown:010857_0214_0F851D95A5D2F3F0"/>let him peruſe Mr. <hi>Newcourt</hi>'s <hi>Repertorium Canonicum,</hi> vol. I. fol, 58, 102, &amp;c. And by an account taken from the ſecond volume of that book, I find that, in the ſingle county of Eſſex, there is yearly paid to the biſhop and archdeacons, in procurations, penſions, and ſynodals only, about 500<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum.</p>
               <p>And upon the whole account, which may eaſily be deduced from the foregoing view and ſpecimen, I think it will evidently appear, that the number of ſpiritual officers and attendants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to archbiſhops, biſhops, archdeacons, and cathedral deans only, will amount to more than 20.000 perſons, beſides preaching miniſters. And that theſe receive for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance one with another, at leaſt forty pounds a man yearly, which will amount to at leaſt eight hundred thouſand pounds per annum. A ſurpriſing ſum! And when we conſider that many of thoſe officers, inſtead of forty pounds per annum, do make two, three, or four hundred pounds per annum, by their eccleſiaſtical employments, I conceive the above computation may well be extended to ten hundred thouſand pounds per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. All which is extorted and ſquezed out of the people's purſes, merely to ſupport eccleſiaſtical power and juriſdiction.</p>

               <p>The ſophiſtry of <hi>par.</hi> 6th muſt needs be evident to all who have read whatever has been written during the preſent contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; however I will juſt obſerve that the ſum of the whole is this, <hi>That we are</hi> enemies to liberty <hi>becauſe we can't confent that thoſe who have always</hi> abus'd <hi>it ſhou'd be inveſted with a</hi> liberty <hi>of encroaching upon</hi> our Liberty.</p>
               <p>As to good old Dr. Chauncey, he evidently has <hi>candour</hi> enough, and (in ſpite of his years) <hi>intellectual vigour</hi> more than ſufficient, to ſhew to the world (were he <hi>properly</hi> call'd upon) whether or not he has <hi>wretchedly, wickedly</hi> or <hi>weekly</hi> (<hi>one, all</hi> or <hi>neither</hi>) "impos'd upon the public;" ſo that it were as abſurd in me to ſtand his ſecond againſt this pretended <hi>Independent,</hi> as to undertake to defend a generous <hi>Hercules,</hi> againſt the impotent attacks of an inſignificant <hi>Gnat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the whole, this ſcribbler certainly meant to ape the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican church man</hi> in the <hi>Whig;</hi> but for want of abilities, (poor fellow!) he has, inſtead of an <hi>Adonis,</hi> "chizzel'd out a <hi>Therſites,</hi> and, while his pencil aſpir'd to the pourtrait of a <hi>Venus,</hi> it has only <hi>daub'd out</hi> the frightful figure of— a Witch.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am a <hi>Church of England Man,</hi> but, neither violently prepoſſeſſed in favour of my own principles, nor ſpiteful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who belong to any other denomination. The greater part of my friends and relations are Preſbyterians, or Congregationaliſts; principally the latter. An intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and mutual Interchange of kindneſs betwixt me and them, has made us hearty friends to each other; nor can a thouſand <hi>Whigs</hi> and <hi>Centinels,</hi> perſuade them that I am a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, a Savage, a Jacobite, a Papiſt, an Idiot, or a Heathen: Some of them, I have reaſon to think, ſincerely pity the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions I ſuffer, as well from zealous, reviling pens and tongues, as from want of a miniſter and ſacraments, which my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and reaſon direct me to; the want of confirmation for my children, and a ruler of my church, to whom I might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal upon occaſion.</p>
            <p>Now I think all diſſenters ought to be of the ſame compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate diſpoſition, and as we ought not to envy them the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges they enjoy, ſo ought they to be willing that we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy privileges equal to theirs. Since the church has been ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely indulgent, as to ſuffer them without moleſtation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, to enjoy almoſt the whole power of <hi>America,</hi> they ought to ſhew themſelves worthy of this indulgence, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing the readieſt people in the world to remove the ſhameful oppreſſion which lies upon us: By doing this, they will ſhew a laudable gratitude, will eſtabliſh a permanent unity betwixt
<pb n="430" facs="unknown:010857_0216_0F851D9729506E68"/>themſelves and us, and will induce our ſuperiors in <hi>Europe</hi> to ſecure them a perpetual enjoyment of their preſent advantages; perhaps to extend greater favours to them.</p>
            <p>If ſome late deſigns, which have been ſuggeſted to me, ſhould ſucceed, I am certain that <hi>America</hi> would not be a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py place even for Diſſenters of any denomination whatever: For ſuppoſe that all epiſcopal clergymen ſhould for the future, be prevented from landing in <hi>America,</hi> by threats of aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as it is ſo often boaſted the biſhop is prevented, and if the biſhop can be thus prevented, why not the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy?) would that oblige us to come under an <hi>Anti-epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal American</hi> eſtabliſhment, or into the Preſbyterian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? No, if the church in <hi>Virginia, Maryland, New-York,</hi> or even <hi>Connecticut,</hi> ſhould fall, ſhe will fall like a perſon of ſtrength and courage. However lukewarm and indifferent churchmen may <hi>at preſent</hi> appear, you will find that we have no reliſh for mean Kirk-Slavery, nor any Inclination to be dealt with like the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> in the laſt century. We will ſooner die by their ſwords in war, or flee to <hi>Sweden. Denmark,</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> for protection, than be drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Kirk-Officers to their <hi>Cutty Stool,</hi> or ſee our friends, the peaceable and benevolent <hi>Quarkers,</hi> hang'd or whipt at the cart's tail thro' three towns of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſing every denomination of Diſſenters ſhould concur (as I think they will not) in extirpating the Church; would there not enſue as much jealouſy and ſtrife among different ſects againſt each other, as there now is in ſome ſects againſt the Church? It is well known, that the moſt violent oppoſers of the Church in the middle colonies, defire to introduce an eſtabliſhment of <hi>Preſbyterianiſm:</hi> To the ſucceſs of this plan, they imagine the religious eſtabliſhment of the kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> will greatly contribute; for with regard to religious eſtabliſhment, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> are two diſtinct kingdoms as much as ever they were.</p>
            <p>In all <hi>New-England,</hi> there are but eleven <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; whilſt there are thirty <hi>Quaker</hi> Churches, thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> about 50 Separatiſt Churches, about eighty congregations of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and 586 Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional meetings. Were all the Church people maſſacred, or put to death by perſecuting <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> laws, is it probable that the other 700 religious aſſemblies would peaceably ſubmit their necks to the yokes of <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Tyranny? 'Tis madneſs to ſuppoſe they would; indeed they have on all occaſions peremptorily declared that they would not. Neither can I think the numerous <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> will ever indulge the encroaching, perſecuting ſcheme, of <hi>American</hi> Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<pb n="431" facs="unknown:010857_0216_0F851D9729506E68"/>Whatever the Anabaptiſt or Dutch Calviniſt Churches may do (both which the <hi>Whigs</hi> are by every Stratagem attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring gradually and imperceptibly into the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) it is very unlikely the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches will ever put their neeks into the Synod's yoke.</p>
            <p>The leading men of the <hi>American</hi> Diſſenters plainly appear to have a ſettled deſign of <hi>clearing America from epiſcopal er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> as their phraſe is; the firſt ſtep of which work is, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent by menaces, our having a biſhop to ordain for us; the next ſtep will doubtleſs be to forbid all Church Clergymen landing in <hi>America:</hi> Then perhaps we ſhall be forbid the Uſe of the common prayer, as in <hi>Cromwell's</hi> Time; and at laſt be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on pain of death, like the <hi>Quakers</hi> of <hi>New-England.</hi> And what conſequence can be expected from theſe happy proceedings? What but mutual railings. envy and perſecution among the numerous, zealous and widely differing ſects? Therefore for the benefit of diſſenters as well as Church-men, I pray God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the plots of ſuch cruel <hi>American Whigs</hi> "as turn religion "into rebellion, and ſaith into faction."</p>
