            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The land of Canaan, from Canaan the ſon of Ham, the ſon of Noah, who by his often chaſings, was driven to poſſeſs and inherit the ſame. 2. The land of Promiſe, becauſe God had promiſed it to the patriarchs, Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, and their poſterity. 3. Iſrael, of the Iſraelites, from Jacob, who was ſurnamed Iſrael. 4. Judea, from the Jews, or people of the tribe of Judah. 5. Paleſtin, by Ptolemy and others, or the land of the Philiſtines, a potent nation that peopled part of it. 6. The Holy Land, as the country in which the holy people dwelt, who had the law, the promiſes and the prieſthood, and ſo denominated by the Chriſtians, becauſe herein was wrought the work of our ſalvation by Jeſus Chirſt, our bleſſed Lord and Saviour.</p>

It extends from 31 to 33 degrees; ſo that in length from Dan to Beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba it is not full two hundred miles long, nor doth the breadth exceed fifty (reckoning a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand paces to a mile) and the whole circumference does not exceed four hundred miles. A coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo fruitful, that the ſcripture tells us, it was a land that flowed with milk and honey, and the glory of all lands. The ſalubrity of the air is excellent, the northern mountains keeping the colder blaſts at their due diſtance, and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſea ſending thither its refreſhing breezes. This being that which the ſcripture uſually calls the great ſea, for the Hebrews were little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ocean, and ſo they gave the name of ſea to lakes, or any large conflux of waters. The winter is neither too cold, nor the ſummer too hot. The inner part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is diverſified with beautiful mountains and Hills, advantageous for vines, fruit-trees, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030301_0003_0FE5AB88B53EFB40"/>
ſmall cattle, and the delightful vallies are water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great number of torrents, beſide the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Jordan. The rains fall very ſeldom, and are very regular, coming in the ſpring and autumn, which the ſcripture calls the rains of the morning and evening, conſidering the year as a day. In ſummer the abundant dews ſupply the rarity of the ſhowers. The very rocks produce abundance of fruits and ſweet ſprings. The pleaſant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures feed great numbers of all ſorts of cattle, and the cows give the beſt milk in the world. And all kinds of beaſts and fowl are to be found in abundance.</p>
               <p>And though ſome authors write, that we muſt not judge of the Holy Land by what is ſeen at this day, being now fallen under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Turks and Arabians, who by their continual wars and ravages, have made it almoſt deſolate and a deſert, and like a place forſaken of God. Yet the late travellers aſſert, that we ought not to believe the reports of thoſe pilgrims, who arriving at Joppa, from thence up the hills to Jeruſalem, and then back again to the ſea for fear of the Arabs; whereas others who have been more adventurous, and have had the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to trace through the body of the country, have given far more advantageous accounts of it, than the other who have only footed it over the mountaneous tract of Judea, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reputed famous for beauty or fruitfulneſs. Theſe travellers tell us, that though the face of the land be ſomewhat deformed for want of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation, by the barbarous infidels, and may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly

in part groan under the heavy curſe of God for the ſins of its former inhabitants, yet ſome of the verdure and features of its ancient excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies are ſtill ſcattered here and there, as teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of its former glory; as particularly in the region of Galilee, in the northern parts whereof ſtands a pleaſant range of mountains by the name of Lebanon, containing a valley of fifty miles in length, and twenty-five in breadth, in the midſt whereof is the fair city of Damaſcus, about ſix miles in compaſs, fortified with a wall and double ditches. The country adjacent is ſo exceeding fruitful, that for the deliciouſneſs thereof it is called the Garden of Eden to this day, and the plains thereof are the moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proſpects that any eye can behold upon earth. And Mr. Biddulph, an Engliſh divine, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over a mountain near the ſea of Galilee, found it extreme pleaſant, and ſo beſpangled with a variety of flowers among the green graſs, that they ſeemed as it were to laugh and ſing, as the pſalmiſt expreſſes it. All the way they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled that day, the hills and vallies were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary fertile, according to the deſcription of Moſes, Deut. viii. A land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that ſpring out of vallies and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, &amp;c.

               <p>In Judea, between Rama and Jeruſalem, are exceeding ſat paſtures, about ſix miles in length, and the riſing hills are mixed with fertile vallies. The vallies of Rephaim, Eſhcol, and Jericho, are very pleaſant, except thoſe adjoining to the ſea of Sodom, and the country in general is highly praiſed by thoſe who have travelled moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively in it, and many places deſcribed as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly delightful. And though this bleſſed land lies in a hot climate, equal to ſome parts of burning Barbary, yet by rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

one or two ſtories: As that there was in Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again Rabbi Simeon aſſerts in the Talmud, that he had in his garden a muſtard ſtalk ſo big, that he uſed to climb up as into a fig-tree. Buckorf relating theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, avouches not for the full credit of them, but only ſhews that this plant was of a large growth in theſe parts, and may confirm the letter of our Saviour's parable concerning it. The mountains of Judah and Ephraim were places of great vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and the relation of the ſpies which Moſes ſent, who brought that prodigious cluſter of grapes from Eſhcol, is a ſufficient evidence of their largeneſs, if compared with thoſe of Spain, France, or Italy. Around Jericho there were palm trees of vaſt revenue, through their ſudden ſpringing up after they wore lopped, and it was the only part of the world where true balm was to be found. The mountains likewiſe produce gold, ſilver iron and copper mines. And there ſeemed to be nothing wanting in this Garden of God that was neceſſary either for the uſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of mankind.</p>
               <p>The fruitfulneſs of the country, and the care they took to cultivate it, may make us conceive how that being ſo little, it could nouriſh ſo great a number of men; beſides, the Iſraelites were but little employed in maritime affairs, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

themſelves with foreign wares, which very much confirms the wonderful plenty of this land, and it is a country full of hills, which renders it much larger than a level champain country.</p>
               <p>By the degrees of lattitude, St. Jerom reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that from Dan to Beerſheba it is not two hundred miles, and that the ordinary breadth of the land is about ſixty miles; but to them that travel up and down its hills and dales it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend much farther. Theſe obſervations may ſtrengthen our faith to believe all that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays of this holy land, and its numerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, notwithſtanding it is confined within ſuch ſmall limits as we have mentioned. When the people firſt entered that country under Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, there were above ſix hundred thouſand men bearing arms, from twenty years old to ſixty, and we read in Judges, that in the war of Gibeah the only tribe of Benjamin, the leaſt of all had an army of twenty-ſix thouſand men, and that the reſt of the people amounted to four hundred thouſand: King Saul marched with two hundred and ten thouſand againſt the Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

King David kept continually on foot twelve bodies of twenty-four thouſand a piece, who ſerved by months, which was in all two hundred and four ſcore thauſand men, and in the numbering of the people which brought the anger of God upon him, there were found in this ſmall compaſs of earth, fifteen hundred three ſcore and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men in Iſrael and Judah which drew ſword, and were fit for war, beſides the men of Levi

and Benjamin, and beſides the women, children and aged perſons, and beſides the ſtrangers and heathens, and the remainder of the Philiſtines which were not fully rooted out at David's time, none of which were inſerted in Joab's liſt, 1 Chron. 21.5. Neither was the muſter of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat much diſproportionate, for although he had not much above a third part of David's kingdom, yet he maintained ſeveral bodies of very good troops, which altogether made up eleven hundred and ſixty thouſand men effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without reckoning the garriſons that were in his ſtrong holds, 2 Chron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> xvii.</p>
               <p>However in all this there is nothing incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for beſide the indubitable authority and veracity of ſacred writ, which ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably believed and attended to, we find the like examples in common hiſtory: The great Thebes of Egypt raiſed ſeven hundred thouſand brave ſoldiers of its own inhabitants alone. At Rome, in the firſt year of Severus Tullius, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hundred and eighty-eighth year from its foundation, there were counted four ſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand citizens able to bear arms, and yet all theſe ſubſiſted in the lands adjacent to Rome, and whereof the moſt part is barren and uninhabited; for their dominions extend no further than eight or ten leagues: But herein conſiſted the policy of the ancients, that inſtead of invading and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing their neighbors, they endeavored to people and manure their country, whether little or much. They ſtudied to render marriages happy, and life eaſy, to procure health and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030301_0006_0FE5AB79A6C3DFB8"/>
and to raiſe from their land all that it could produce: They exerciſed their citizens by labor, inſpired them with the love of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of union between themſelves, and ſubmiſſion to the laws: This is what they called policy.</p>
               <p>Theſe maxims perhaps ſome will ſay are very pretty, but let us come to particulars, and ſhew how it was poſſible ſo ſmall a country as Paleſtine ſhould nouriſh ſo great a number of men. An acre of good land bringing forth five quarters, a comb, and a buſhel of wheat, will feed four men for a year, allowing each two pounds and ſix ounces of bread every day, which is about three buſhels a month, and thirty-ſix buſhels a year to each man; but ſince our Iſraelites were great eaters, let us allow them double the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; that is to ſay, four pounds twelve ounces of bread a day: Thus an acre will be ſufficient to feed two men; and by this account we ſhall have land ſtill remaining: For a league ſquare makes five thouſand ſix hundred and twenty-five acres, by reckoning three thouſand geometrical paces in a league, five feet in a pace, twenty feet in a rod, and an hundred rods in an acre. The kingdom of Judea was at leaſt ſixty leagues in length, and about twenty in breadth, counting the length from eaſt to weſt, and might ſupport twenty millions of people: So it was eaſy to levy twelve hundred thouſand ſword men in a country, where all people bore arms, and ſtill to have corn to ſell to ſtrangers towards the purchaſe of cattle; for if the flocks that country
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030301_0007_0FE5ABAE26993DA8"/>
produced did not ſufficiently furniſh them with wool and fleſh, we need not doubt but that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary ſtrangers brought them many cattle. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat, beſides the tribute of money which he exacted from the Philiſtines, received from the Arabians ſeven thouſand five hundred rams, and as many goats, and there are other examples of the like tributes: Add to this, that the Iſraelites lived frugally, and that all the good land they had was carefully manured; ſince there were few woods, they had neither parks for hunting, nor avenues, nor bowling greens, nor graſs plats. We ſee by the canticles of Solomon, their gardens were full of fruit trees, and aromatic plants: and the mildneſs of their climate requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but little trouble to furniſh lodging and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to their ſimple cuſtom. To this we may add, that the Jews in their greateſt glory, under David and Solomon, poſſeſſed countries far more extenſive than Canaan; their dominions extended from the Mediterranean Sea to the river Euphrates, and from the Red Sea, near to the Black Sea; which was the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the promiſe made to the Patriarchs, of giving their feed dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the river to the end of the earth.</p>

and finally wiſhing that the guilt of his innocent blood might fall on them and their children, they brought their government and country to utter ruin and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Iſraelites were ten times led into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, four times by the hands of Sanherib, or Sennacherib, four times by Nebuchadnezzer, once by Titus Veſpaſian, and once by Adrian, Emperor of Rome, as it is recorded in ſcripture, and according to the account of Joſephus, with other hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>The firſt captivity was by Sanherib, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the land, and tranſplanted the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manaſſeh, he took away alſo the golden calf which Jeroboam, the ſon of Nebat had made; he carried the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites into Helan, Habor, to the river Gozan, and to the cities of the Medes. This captivity was in the time of Pelah, the ſon of Remaliah, in the year from the creation of the world 3263.</p>
               <p>The ſecond captivity happened ſoon after, for Hoſhea the ſon of Ela who remained, ſlew Pekah, the ſon of Remaliah, king of Iſrael, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſervant and ſubject of Sanherib ſeven Years; then came Sanherib the ſecond time, and carried away the tribes of Aſher, Iſſachar, Zebulon and Nepthali, of whom he ſet free one out of every eight, he alſo took away another calf that was in Bethel.</p>
               <p>The third captivity was in the reign of Zedeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah the ſon of Ahaz, in the forth year of whoſe reign Sanherib came and intrenched about Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, beſieging it three years, and at length took
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030301_0008_0FE5ABEE19637B30"/>
it, in the ſixth year of the reign of Hezekiah; ſo he led away the Iſraelites that were in Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and the tribe of Ephraim, and the reſt of Manaſſeh.</p>
               <p>The fourth captivity was by Nebuchadnezzer, who having reigned eight years, made war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeruſalem, bringing with him the Clinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hereticks out of Babylon, Ethiopia, Areim, and Sephirvaim. And in Judea he took an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty cities in which ware the two tribes of Judah and Simeon, which he carried with him, and cauſed them forthwith to be ſent into Halan and Habor, until the king of Ethiopia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt him whoſe kingdom was on the Southern part of Egypt. Then taking Simeon and Judah with him, he made war with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian king. So the holy and bleſſed God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in the dark Mountains. Thus in theſe four captivities the ten tribes were carried into baniſhment by Sanherib and Salmanaſſer. There remained yet of Judah an hundred and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and Benjamin an hundred and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in the city of Jeruſalem, over whom reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hezekiah. Moreover Sanherib, or Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib king of Aſſyria came out of Ethiopia a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeruſalem again with an army of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten thouſand men, but the holy God overthrew them, for the angel of the Lord ſmote an hundred eighty and five thouſand in one night. This ſlaughter was in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, in the year of the world 3294. From which overthrow till the time that Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer invaded the Jews, to the reign of Jehoiakim were an hundred and ſeven years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:030301_0009_0FE5ABD636C8BC08"/>The fifth captivity was in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, when Nebuchadnezzer, came the firſt time and carried away 3023 of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and ſeven thouſand of their moſt valient men of the tribes, whom they bound in chains.</p>
               <p>The ſixth captivity was about ſeven years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when Nebuchadnezzer came unto Daphne, a city of Antioch, from whence he carried into bondage four thouſand ſix hundred of the tribe of Judah, of Benjamin fifty thouſand, and of the other tribes ſeven thouſand, and traſmigrated them into Babylon.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh captivity happened about nine years after this; for in the 9th year of the reign of Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzer in the 10th year of his reign came the third time to Jeruſalem, and overcame Zedekiah, he burnt the temple, took away the pillars, the brazen ſea, and the furniture that Solomon had made, and all the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the houſe of the Lord, and the treaſures of the houſe of the king which was in Jeruſalem, and ſent them all to Babylon. He likewiſe ſlew of the Iſraelites nine hundred and one thouſand, beſides them that were ſlain to revenge the blood of Zacharias. The Levites ſtood ſinging a ſong whilſt ſlaughter was made of them, but they were not able to finiſh it before the enemy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the temple, and found them ſtanding in their places with harps in their hands; therefore he carried away in this captivity 600 of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, who were of the ſeed of Aron, whom when the Gentiles had brought to the rivers of

Babylon, they demanded of the Jews, Sing a ſong of Sion. Whereat the prieſts gnawed off the tops of their fingers with their teeth, ſaying, how ſhall we ſing a ſong of the Lord in a ſtrange land? And the bleſſed Lord, ſaith Joſephus, (ſeeing they would not ſing a ſong) enlarged them, and placed them on the further ſide of Samba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. Nebuchadnezzer likewiſe carried away eight hundred and thirty two thouſand, and made Aki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ruler over the reſt, who was after ſlain by Iſhmael the ſon of Nethaniah, whereupon the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites being afraid, fled from their country into Egypt in the year of the world 3416.</p>
               <p>The eighth captivity was in the twenty ſeventh year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzer. He took Egypt and Tyre, drowned the Jews that were therein, and the nations which deſcended of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Moab, and of the land bordering upon Iſrael, and led Jeremy and Baruch, with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egypt, with four thouſand ſix hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more. The Iſraelites that remained alive in Egypt departed to Alexandria, where they ſoon increaſed to many thouſands, having their ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, altar, offrings, incenſes, houſes, ſtudies, ſchools, in great numbers, and in a ſhort time grew very rich and powerful. But wicked Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganus made war upon them, and ſlew very many of them. Theſe are the eight captivities of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages which befel the Jews during the ſtanding of the firſt houſe or temple.

After which, during the reſt of the Perſian monarchy, they lived very peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a kind of republic, governed by the high-prieſts and the council of ſeventy-one elders.</p>
               <p>Alexander, king of Macedon, having deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Perſian monarchy, reigned twelve years, and then dying, four uſurpers ſucceeded him, who afflicted the Iſraelites an hundred fifty-eight years.

               <p>The ninth captivity of the Jews was under the conduct of the Romans. When the Jews having made the full meaſure of their guilt run over, by putting to death the Lord of life, God's judgments, according to their deſerts, and our bleſſed Saviour's prophecy, quickly overtook them. For a mighty army of the Romans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged and plundered the city of Jeruſalem, wherein by fire, famine, ſword, inteſtine diſcord, &amp;c. eleven hundred thouſand people loſt their lives. An incredible number it ſeems to be, but may command our belief if we conſider that the ſiege began at the time of the paſſover, when in a manner all Judea was incloſed in Jeruſalem, all private ſynagogues then doing their duty to the mother temple, ſo that the city had more gueſts than inhabitants. Thus the paſſover firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God in mercy to ſave the Iſraelites from death in Egypt, was now uſed by him in juſtice to haſten their deſtruction, and to gather the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a bundle to be caſt into the fire of his anger.</p>
               <p>Beſides thoſe who were ſlain, ninety-ſeven thouſand were taken captives; and they who had bought our Saviour of Judas for thirty pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſilver, were themſelves ſold thirty for one piece.</p>
               <p>The general of the Romans in this action was
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030301_0011_0FE5ABBDF94AEA78"/>
Titus, ſon to Veſpaſian emperor of Rome. A prince of ſuch an excellent temper that he was ſtiled the darling of mankind; ſo virtuouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that he may be juſtly counted the glory of all heathens, and ſhame of moſt chriſtians, ſo that it was great pity ſo good a branch had not been better grafted. Thus the ancient nation of the Jews, which in former times might have been called the favorites of the Almighty, were utterly deſtroyed, and the famous city of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which had been ſurprized and plundered five times before, was totally demoliſhed.</p>
               <p>The firſt founder of it was one of the princes of the Canaanites, called in his own language the juſt king, and indeed he was ſo, for he was the firſt prieſt that ſacrificed to God, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a temple there called Solyma; but David, king of Iſrael, having driven out the Canaanites, give it to the Jews to be inhabited, and after four hundred and ſixty-four years and three months, it was deſtroyed by the Babylonians, together with the moſt magnificent and beautiful temple of king Solomon, upon which one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand men wrought continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till it was finiſhed; the grandeur and glory whereof you may read in the holy ſcriptures. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem was afterwards taken and plundered by Afocheus king of Egypt, afterwards by Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus and Pompey, and laſtly by the Romans; and from the time it was firſt erected, until it was thus ruined, were two thouſand one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy-ſeven years; yet neither the antiquity, riches, nor fame thereof, nor the glory
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030301_0011_0FE5ABBDF94AEA78"/>
of religion, did any thing avail to hinder this hard diſtiny; ſuch was the end of beſieging Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, when none was left to kill more, nor any thing remaining for the ſoldier to get at, or whereon they might exerciſe their courage, who reſolved to ſpare nothing they could ſpoil.</p>
               <p>Titus labored to the utmoſt to have ſaved the temple, and many therein, but the Jews by their deſperate obſtinacy rendered themſelves uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mercy, ſo that he was at length obliged to deſtroy the city and temple together; and the temple where ſo many burnt ſacrifices had been offered, was now itſelf made a ſacrifice, and burnt to aſhes, and to that ſtately ſtructure, which drew the apoſtles' admiration, not a ſtone was left upon a ſtone, the walls of the city be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſhaken with the ſins of the Jews that defended them, than with the battering rams of the Romans that aſſaulted them, were levelled to the ground, three towers only that were more beautiful than the reſt, namely, Phaſelus, Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picos, and Mariamne, with the wall on the weſt ſide being left ſtanding, deſigned to receive a garriſon, and to remain as monuments of the ſtrength and valour of the Romans, who had overcome a place ſo well fortified; all the reſt being laid ſo flat, that to thoſe who had not ſeen it before there was no appearance that it had ever been inhabited.</p>
               <p>But while this ſtorm fell on the unbelieving Jews, it was a calm among the Chriſtians, who warned by our Saviour's prediction, and many other prodigies, ſled betimes out of Jeruſalem to

               <p>The tenth and laſt captivity of the Jews was in the time of the emperor Aelius Adrianus, about 60 years after, who rebuilt the city of Jeruſalem, changing the ſituation ſomewhat Weſtward, and calling it by his own name Aelius; In deſpite of the Chriſtians he built a temple over our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's grave, with the images of Jupiter and Venus, another at Bethlehem to Adonis her gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant; and to enrage the Jews, he ingraved a ſwine over the gates of Jeruſalem and a Jew under his feet, in token of ſubjection: Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The captives were by Adrian tranſported into Spain, and the holy land laid waſte, parting with her people and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a great meaſure all at once; Such ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers as eſcaped this baniſhment, and remained behind, were forbidden to enter into Jeruſalem, or ſo much as to behold it from any riſe or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

               <p>THE Jewiſh nation being diſperſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of their own land by the ten cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities afore mentioned, the preſent Jews are of opinion that the tribe of Benjamin are thoſe who now are ſettled in Italy, Poland, and Germany, the Turks dominions, and all the Eaſtern parts of the Mediterranean; the tribe of Judah they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are ſettled in Portugal and Barbary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and affirm that ſome thouſand families of that race are there, whom they diſpenſe withal, to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Chriſtianity, as far as to be Romiſh prieſts; and many for fear of the papal inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can join themſelves to a crucifix and roſary, and upon occaſion have again reſumed their own religion in places where they were out of danger; one of them affirming, that his compliance was only the work of his nerves and muſcles, and that his anatomy told him nothing of the heart was therein concerned.

                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:030301_0015_0FE5ABF96AB72A58"/>But to the ten tribes who were led captive by Shalmanezer king of Aſſyria (in the year of the world 3280, and about 720 years before the birth of our Saviour) and were carried beyond the river Euphrates, mentioned 2 kings, ch. 17. The generality of the preſent Jews ſay, they know not what is become of them: yet ſeveral inquiſitive Chriſtians being very deſirous of the converſion of that nation from their obſtinate unbelief, have made divers conjectures of the countries whereunto theſe ten tribes were carried by the Aſſyrians. Among others Dr. Fletcher, who was agent for queen Elizabeth to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Ruſſia, is of opinion they may be found among the Tartars, the Tartar in the Syrian tongue ſignifying remnants or remainders, for which he renders ſeveral reaſons, from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations he made during his reſidence ſome years among the Ruſſians.</p>
               <p>As 1. From the place whither they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, which was into the cities of Media, which is ſituated about the Caſpian ſea, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a very large territory, now poſſeſt by the Tartars, and by the conſent of all hiſtorians that have written of the Aſſyrian and Perſian monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, they have reſided there ever ſince the reign of Cyrus, who after he had obtained the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, did firſt invade theſe Scythian ſhepherds or Tartar people, about two hundred years after the Iſraelites were carried thither, who were grown by that time a great warlike people, and made a general deſertion from the Aſſyrians in the tenth year of Eſarhaddon; and being uited
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030301_0016_0FE5AB64A318D530"/>
in one community, they diſdained to mix with other people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their towns and cities had the ſame or like names with the ancient towns and cities of the Iſraelites; their metropolis, and chief city, though now deformed with many ruins, is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchin, which travellers report hath many Jewiſh monuments, where the great Tamerlane carried about Bajazet, the Turkiſh emperor, in an iron cage. This name differs no more from Samaria (the ſeat and chamber of the kings of Iſrael) than many other cities in the world do, by the ſeveral pronunciations of different nations. They have alſo mount Tabor, a city called Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo, Cornzin, and ſeveral other places men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ſcripture. Theſe Tartar cities are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by ſo many as are ſufficient to defend them from the hoſtility of the Perſians and other borderers, but the greater part who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Scythian ſhephers, ſeldom come into any city or ſtanding houſes but in winter time; abiding in tents or walking houſes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upon wheels like carts or waggons. Theſe in ſummer time when the graſs is grown for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, march with their flocks and herds north and north-eaſt from the ſouth-eaſt parts, where they continue all the ſummer in diſtinct hoords or armies, under the conduct of the princes and vicegerents, conſtituted by the great cham, their emperor, and graze along by the way; thus they go till they arrive at the next ſtage or reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, where they encamp their waggon houſes in the form of a great city with many
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030301_0016_0FE5AB64A318D530"/>
ſtreets and avenues, continuing there till their cattle have eat up all. Thus they proceed by ſhort ſtages till they arrive at the farteſt point towards the north, and then return towards ſouth Tartary another way, where their cattle have freſh paſturage, and ſo returning by eaſy journies, before winter they arrive again in the ſouth countries, near the Caſpian ſea; into a more mild and temperate climate, where they remain all the winter within their cities or car-houſes, ſet together in form of a vaſt town, till the approaching ſpring invites them to go their former progreſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are diſtinguiſhed into ſeveral hoords and tribes, united under one government, and communicate in all things but intermarrying, to avoid confuſion of kindreds, except the public defence or ſafety make it neceſſary for them to join together as one people. And this diviſion of tribes without commixion, which was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no other nation but the Jews, is ſtill moſt religiouſly continued among the Tartars.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The number of their tribes is the ſame, which are ten in all, no more nor leſs than the Iſraelites, from one of which it is ſuppoſed, the Turks have their origin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Tartars have a tradition from their anceſtors that they had their pedigree from the Iſraelites, who were tranſplanted near the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian, or Hircanian ſea, from which tradition it is reported that Tamerlane the great would boaſt himſelf, that he was deſcended from the tribe of Dan.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:030301_0017_0FE5AB8D13CB5E18"/>
               <p n="6">6. Though the Tartar language be yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, becauſe they live as ſavage people, without ſociety or commerce with other nations, ſuffering none to come within them; yet the Ruſſians affirm, that their language hath many Arabic words, and is not much different from the Turkiſh tongue, which many travellers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve has much affinity with the Hebrew.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Tartars are circumciſed, as were the Iſraelites and Jewiſh people. As for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which for their notable infidelity, and contempt of the Son of God, were maſſacred, diſperſed, and captivated by the Romans, it is as well known both where they are, and how they live, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by their tribes, not yet united into one policy or community, but diffuſed in ſmall numbers, and deprived of all, ſave their name, which they retain rather for a reproach than an honor, being thereby noted by other nations to be that people whom God has rejected for their infidelity.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that it is a thing unworthy, and unbeſeeming the great mercy of God to this people, whom he vouchſafed to chooſe out of all the nations of the world, to be His peculiar people, to ſuffer them to degenerate into Tartars, who are the moſt vile and barbarous people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. It may be anſwered, that it may well conſiſt with that moſt holy and perfect juſtice, to abaſe ſo wicked and rebellious a people againſt their God as the Iſraelites were, and to caſt them from the higheſt Heaven, to the loweſt center of diſhonor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:030301_0017_0FE5AB8D13CB5E18"/>Others conjecture that the firſt inhabitants of America were the ten tribes of the Iſraelites, whom the Tartarians conquered and drove away. After which by God's providence they hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves behind the vaſt mountains of Cordillarae. And that as they were not captivated all at once, but in the reigns of ſeveral of their kings, as you have already heard, ſo they were alſo ſcattered into divers provinces, as America, Tartary, China, Media, to the Sabbatical river, and into Ethiopia: of this opinion was Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael, an Hebrew divine and philoſopher, who reſided in England in 1650, and was a chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for admitting the Jews into that nation, to the then governing power. He then publiſhed a book called <hi>The Hope of Iſrael;</hi> wherein he gives many relations to fortify his conjecture, particularly that of Aaron Levi, in 1644.</p>
               <p>This Aaron Levi (ſaith he) gave the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account to me, and other eminent Portugueſe at Amſterdam, at the time aforeſaid, that about two years before, he going from port Honda, in the Spaniſh Weſt-Indies in America, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſome mules of an Indian Caſtellen, into the province of Quito, in company with other Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans among whom one called Francis Cazicus, a great tempeſt happened as they paſſed over the mountain Cordillerae, which threw the laden mules to the ground; the indians complained of their great loſſes by the ſtorm, yet confeſt that they deſerved greater puniſhments then this for their many henious crimes.

               <p>Aaron ſaid, that when he deſigned to be gone on Thurſday evening, they were extream kind, furniſhing him with all neceſſaries for his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney back again, intimating that they were well provided with meat, clothes, cattle, and all oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conveniences.

The Indian replied, I will tell you the truth of what I know, as I have received it from my forefathers, but if you preſs me too earneſtly, you will make me utter lies; attend therefore I pray to what I ſhall ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Thy brethren are the ſons of Iſrael, and were brought hither by the providence of God, who for their ſakes, wrought ſo many miracles that you will ſcarcely believe the account of them that I have learnt from my fathers.

               <p>That the God of the children of Iſrael, whoſe deſtruction they had occaſioned, is the true God, that all that which is engraven upon their ſtone table is true, that about the end of the world they ſhall be lords of the whole earth; that ſome ſhould come who would bring them much good, and after they had enriched the earth with all good things, thoſe children of Iſrael going forth out of their country, ſhould ſubdue all nations under them, as their anceſtors ſubdued their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that they would be happy if they could make a league with them.</p>

The Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an being left behind, he, after having ſaluted Aaron, took his leave alſo, ſaying, farewel my brother, I have other things to do, I go to viſit thy brethren with other Hebrews Cazici, who are ſecure in this country, for we rule all the Indians, and after we have finiſhed our buſineſs with the wicked Spaniards, we will bring you out of your bondage by God's help: not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that he who cannot lie will aſſiſt us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word and promiſe.</p>
               <p>This Aaron Levi, ſaith Rabbi Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael, who gave the preceding relation, being a Jew of our order, born of honeſt parents at Villefleur in Portugal, a man of about forty years old, honeſt, and not ambitious, deſerves to be credited in what he ſays above many others: He went to the Indies, where he was put into the inquiſition, as a ſucceſſor of a Jew in Portugal whom Don Manual, the king, forced without law or religion to turn Chriſtian, who yet to this day privately practiſes their religion, being freed out of the inquiſition, he diligently inquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe things, and was not quiet till he came to Amſterdam to tell us the good news, I myſelf was well acquainted with him for ſix months that he dwelt here, and I ſometimes made him take
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030301_0022_0FE5990850581118"/>
an oath in the preſence of honeſt men, that what he told was true, and two years after he took the ſame oath on his death bed.</p>
               <p>The ſame author adds ſeveral other relations to prove the probability of the Jews being the firſt inhabitants of America, being driven thith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the fury of their enemies.</p>
               <p>Eſdras ſays, that the ten tribes which Salmana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar carried captive, in the reign of Hoſhea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Euphrates, determined to go into countries far remote, in which none dwelt, whereby they might the better obſerve their law; and that as they paſſed over ſome branches of Euphrates, God wrought miracles—ſtopping the courſe of the flood till they had gone over. From whence it may be gathered, that the ten tribes went to New Spain and Peru, and poſſeſſed thoſe two kingdoms, which were then without inhabitants —to which they might arrive by going out of Tartary into Greenland, and from thence, by the ſtreight of Darien, into America, it being not above fifty miles from thence: And La Vega, a famous Spaniſh author, writes, that in Collai, a fine province in the Weſt-Indies, near a lake called by the Spaniards Chuta, among other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities and great buildings there, a ſtately fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric is to be ſeen, which hath a court fifteen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms broad, a wall that compaſſeth it two fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of one ſtone; the three ſides of the wall are an ell thick. The Indians ſay, this houſe is dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Maker of the world, and is judged to have been a ſynagogue built by the Iſraelites, ſince the Indians never knew the uſe of iron, wherewith this building was joined together.— Other Indians being aſked about it, declared that their fathers told them it was erected by a people who were white, and bearded like the Spaniards, that came thither a long while before the Indians, inhabitants there, and continued ſome time after, till they were driven farther north, into this new large world.</p>
               <p>The Indians retain many Hebrew cuſtoms, which it is thought they learnt from the Iſraelites —for, in many places, they circumciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they rend their garments upon ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den misfortune, they kept fire continually burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their altars in their temples dedicated to the ſun, and forbid women to enter into them till they were purified; every fifty years they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated a Jubilee at Mexico, the metropolis of Peru, with great pomp; every ſeventh, or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, all perſons were obliged to be preſent in the temple, to perform their ſacrifices and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; they were divorced from their wives in caſe of incontinency, and they married the widows of their dead brethren; they had alſo ſome knowledge of the creation of the world, and of the univerſal flood: All theſe things ſeem to demonſtrate, that theſe Gentiles had learned thoſe cuſtoms from the Jews, who had formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited there.</p>

And the emperor Charles V. ſending Philipus Utre to diſcover and plant the northern region of America, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned of their neighbors the greatneſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

miles. Peter Oſna, another captain, went with ſome ſoldiers up a great river, in canoes, and at length came to a large plain, where many houſes were built on the water ſide by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; and having ſailed further on, in about forty-eight hours, they ſaw a great number of high white houſes, which they feared to approach, obſerving the inhabitants to be numerous, and hearing the ſound of hammers like that of gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths. Theſe Indians, ſay they, were of a tall ſtature, comely in perſon, with long beards, and appearing as valiant and warlike as the Spaniards.</p>
               <p>Eight other Spaniards, after nine months tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling north-weſtward in America, came to a mountain, to whoſe top they arrived with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, from whence they diſcovered a plain, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with a pleaſant river, on the banks of which dwelt a people who were white, with beards. In the reign of the late king, Philip III. of Spain, five ſhips were ſent from Panama to diſcover ſome unknown lands in America: The captain was ſcarcely entered into the South Sea, when he diſcovered land, which he called the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Solomon and Jeruſalem. In his courſe of ſailing he kept cloſe to the ſhore of theſe iſles where he ſaw and took many of the natives, who were of a brown colour: others, who dwelt in larger and more fruitful iſlands, were white men, and wore long garments of ſilk.

For though on the ſeventh day the river doth reſt, and is quiet, yet it is forbidden to the Jews to take a journey on that day. And for that reaſon they have remained there miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concealed for ſome ages. Neither is this ſtrange, ſince there are many things which we know, and yet can give no account of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: are we not at this day ignorant of the heads of our four capital rivers, Nilus, Ganges, Euphrates and Tyris, and many large countries are yet undiſcovered.

Furthermore as to the Sabbatical river, I heard it from my father (ſaith Manaſſeh Ben Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and fathers do uſe to impoſe upon their ſons) that there was an Arabian at Liſbon in Portugal, who had an hour-glaſs filled with the ſand taken out of the bottom of this river, which run all the week till the ſabbath and then ceaſed, and that every Friday in the evening this Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an would walk through the ſtreets of that city, and ſhew this glaſs to the Jews who counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Chriſtianity, ſaying, ye Jews, ſhut up your ſhops, for now the ſabbath comes. I ſhould not ſpeak of theſe glaſſes, ſaith he, but that the authority of my father has great power over me, and induces me to belive the miracle is from God.</p>
               <p>Let the reader believe what he thinks fit of theſe relations, which I thought, for the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them not unpleaſant to inſert. I ſhall conclude with the conſequences which my Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh author deduces from them, namely, 1. That America, or the Weſt-Indies was anciently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by a part of the ten tribes, which paſſed thither out of Tartary by the ſtreights of Annain, 2.

               <p>AFTER the deſolation of Jeruſalem the Jews were diſperſed throughout the world, and eſpecially in Spain, where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Adrian commanded them to dwell; yet found every where ſo little favour, that having divers times been put to grievous mulcts and ranſoms, they were all at laſt quite thruſt out of Europe.</p>
               <p>The firſt Chriſtian prince that expelled the Jews out of his territories, was that heroick king Edw. I. who was ſuch a fore ſcourge alſo to the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030301_0028_0FE5ABA93657F8D8"/>
Scots; and it is thought divers families of thoſe baniſhed Jews ſled then to Scotland, where they have propagated ſince in great numbers; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the averſion this nation hath above others to hogs fleſh.</p>
               <p>Nor was this their extermination for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but for their notorious crimes; as poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of wells, counterfeiting of coins, falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeals, crucifying of Chriſtian children, with other villanies. This happened in the year 1392. And ſixteen years after France followed our example. It was near two hundred years after that when Ferdinand turned them out of Spain; and five years after him, Emanuel of Portugal did the like.</p>
               <p>But the countries from whence they were laſt expelled were Naples and Sicily, in the year 1539. In other parts of Chriſtendom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide yet in great numbers, as in Germany high and low, Bohemia, Lithuania, Poland and Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia; in Italy alſo they are found, but in no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſubject to the king of Spain.</p>
               <p>They live very quietly at Rome under the Pope's noſe, and St. Mark makes no ſcruple to entertain them at Venice: in ſundry places of the Ottoman Empire they are very numerous: ſo that it is thought Conſtantinople and Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica only have near twenty thouſand.</p>
               <p>Aſia is full of them, as Aleppo, Trippoli, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, Rhodes, and indeed all places of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and traffick; there are numbers alſo in Perſia, Arabia, and all over Cranganor in India.</p>
               <p>In Africa they have their ſynagogues and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030301_0029_0FE5AB68A8F5FE10"/>
Lumbards, as in Alexandria, Grand Cairo, Feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, Tremeſen, and divers places in the kingdom of Morocco. There are about one hundred families left in Jeruſalem, but the place where they are moſt unmingled is Tiberias, which the Turks gave to Mendez the Jew for ſome ſignal ſervices; thither they oft bring or ſend the bones of their dead friends, who have left large legacies, to be there interred from other places.</p>
               <p>The city of Jeruſalem was afterwards re-edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Elius Adrianus, and given to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, from whom it was taken by Coſroes and the Perſians, in the year 615, and from them forcibly wreſted by Hanmer, and the Saracens in 637.

May 14, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Cofferſinue about four in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, paſſing in a good road, and through plains ſowed with wheat: About ſix we paſſſed over ſeveral mountains reſembling marble, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo, from which we had a fine proſpect of the fruitfulneſs of the vallies: between theſe mountains, upon the aſcent of an hill, we came to a fountain, where we breakfaſted; at ſeven we roſe from the fountain, and having paſſed a very dangerous and rugged mountain, about nine we came to Eden, a ſmall village, and very pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly ſeated, being ſurrounded with mulberries, and other ſorts of trees, walnuts eſpecially we found very common in this mount: we went to the hiſhop's houſe, a moſt miſerable ruinated cottage, who coming to bid us welcome, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more like a dunghill-raker than a biſhop.

At this place came to us the captain of a village called Upſhara, an hour's ride from the cedars. In our way as we returned, he invited us to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at his village, which we accepted of, and after dinner made him a preſent. This man is a Maronite and takes caffer or toll of the Turks who paſs that way with their ſheep and oxen; he hath an hundred ſoldiers under his command, who are all chriſtians. About two o'clock we mounted, and after three hour's riding, we came to a mighty deep deſcent, winding in and out, which is the way to the patriarch of the Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite's houſe, called Cannibene; it is a very good convent, and lies under the rock; they have a bell in the church as in Europe, and go to their devotions morning and evening: After we had kiſſed the patriarch's hand, we demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what was to be ſeen, and the drugger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About a league from the convent are two Frenchmen that live a hermit's life, having bread and wine allowed them by the patriarch: Night coming on we went to ſupper with the patriarch, the biſhop Aleppo, and two other biſhops, with what the place afforded; at ſupper they brought out a great glaſs which held near two quarts

Theſe religious people bear little reſpect one to another, ſpeaking very baſely of each other. After our proceſſion, we went to view all the places and churches again; the Greeks have a place in the middle of their church, which they ſay, is the middle of the world. They have another place by the priſon of Chriſt, with two holes to put the feet in; there is alſo a narrow paſſage between two pillars, in imitation of the ſtreightneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In the ſame place is the rent of the rock which begins above, near the place where our Saviour was crucified, and in that rent, they ſay Adam's head was found when our Saviour gave up the ghoſt. Thus having ſeen the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we returned to the convent.</p>

Went out of the city at Damaſcus gate and turning on the right came to one of fiſh ponds of the old city, and a quarter of a mile further to the grot, where Jeremiah lived when he wrote his lamentations; on the left hand in the entrance, is a lodge in the rock, about a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, where they ſay Jeremiah ſlept; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low over againſt the door is a hole intended for his ſepulchre; paſſing through a ruinate door, you come into the yard, where his well is, being a very good ſpring of ſweet water, there you pay one livre; afterwards paſſing a long the ſide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>A mile further is the place where the Angel appeared to the ſhepherds, and cryed, Gloria in excelſis, &amp;c. when our Saviour was born, where there hath been a convent, but now there only remains an arched vault where we paid money to the Arabs, who when, they eſpy any Franks going thither, ride poſt before to take poſſeſſion of the place, and get ſomething from them; a quarter of a mile hence, in the way to Solomon's ciſterns, is the village of the ſhepherds, on the back part whereof is a well, of which they ſay the Virgin Mary deſired to drink; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants denying to draw her any water, it preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently overflowed for her to drink; a little way from this village is Joſeph's houſe, and a while after we came to Solomon's gardens, lying ſhelv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. At the bottom of them is the road from grand Cairo, and round the top paſſes the aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which feeds Jeruſalem with water, from thence we ſaw Tekoa ſtanding on a high hill; the waters come from the fountains which feeds Solomon's ciſterns; paſſing a mile along by the aquaduct, we came to Solomon's ciſterns, which are three; the firſt had no water in it, and about 150 yards long, and ſixty broad, and of a great depth; the ſecond had a little water, ſomething leſs in compaſs; the third was full, and as big as
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030301_0041_0FE5AB9927C4E498"/>
the firſt: they run one into another, and are fed by the ſpring that feeds the city. The fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſay, that they were made to ſwim in, being built with ſteps for a man to go down, but ſeem father intended for a reſerve of water for the city or the gardens, having paſſage to both; near the gardens is an ill contrived caſtle, where a few villains inhabit to whom we paid one livre per man, for leave to go into the grot, where the ſprings are that feed the city, and the ciſterns; it is large, and hath three ſprings, and a large paſſage cut through the rock, toward the ciſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erns, paſſable by a man, but we went not to the end of it.</p>
               <p>We mounted our horſes, leaving the caſtle on the right hand; at a diſtance we ſaw St. George's church, where the fathers ſay the chains remain, wherewith St. George was bound which will preſently cure a mad man, if bound therewith. After an hour and a half's riding we came near to Bethlehem, where paſſing through a narrow lane, the guard conſiſting of four or five muſqueteers, received five livres of every one of us, and our druggerman that went with us received three. And arriving at the convent we paid one for our entrance: after being welcomed by the fathers we took our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe till five in the evening, and then prepared to go in proceſſion to the holy places, in the ſame manner as we did at the temple in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; the places we viſited were theſe.</p>
               <p>1. The place where our Saviour was born. 2. The tomb of St. Joſeph to whom the Virgin
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030301_0041_0FE5AB9927C4E498"/>
Mary was eſpouſed. 3. St. Innocent's tomb. 4. The place where St. Jerom lived, when he tranſlated the Bible into Latin. 5. St. Jerom's praying place. 6. St. Jerom's tomb. 7. St. Paul's tomb. 8. St. Euſtathia's daughters. 9. The ſepulchre of St. Euſebius, Abbot of Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem. 10. We return to the chapel of St. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therina built by St. Paula. Next is the great church without the convent, which hath 48 pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of marble, about three yards long, all in one piece. At evening we went to viſit the place of our Saviour's birth, formerly belonging to the Latins, till the Greeks bought it out of their hands; ſo that now the Latins, when they go their proceſſion pray at that door by which they formerly entered. The precipio has two doors, one over againſt the other, well lined with carved iron, and ſtrengthened with iron ſpikes: we went in bare-foot; on the right hand in the entrance, is the place they ſay where our Saviour was born, which is lined with marble; and in the middle of the room there is a plate covered with ſilver, by which they ſat a diſh to receive your charity: on the left hand is a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger where the Virgin Mary laid our Saviour, lined with marble; which and at the end of the manger on the right hand, is the picture of St. Jerom naturally in the marble, which the fathers eſteem as a miracle; over againſt this manger is the place where the three wiſe men ſtood when they came to worſhip our Saviour. At the end of this place in a corner, is a hole made up with marble wherein they ſay the Virgin Mary put

and hopeful ſign of the Jews converſion, and that will be glad tidings to the church of Chriſt, therefore I yield to ſatisfy their deſires, and thus it was.</p>
               <p>At the place aforeſaid there aſſembled about 300 Rabbies, called Jews, from ſeveral parts of the world, to examine the ſcriptures concerning Chriſt. It ſeems this place was thought moſt convenient for this council, in regard that part of the country is not much inhabited, becauſe of the continual wars between the Turks and the king of Hungary. There they have fought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly two bloody battles. Yet both theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, notwithſtanding their own differences, did give leave to the Jews to hold their council there. The Jews for their own accommodation, made divers tents for their repoſe, and had plenty of proviſions brought them from other parts of the country, during the time of their ſitting. The Jews making, as we ſaid, divers tents, they ſet up one large tent, only for the council to ſit in, being made almoſt four ſquare, the North and South not altogether ſo large as the Eaſt and Weſt part. It had but one door, and that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Eaſt. In the middle of the tent there ſtood a table, and a ſtool for the propounder to ſit on, with his face towards the door of the tent. The propounder was of the tribe of Levi, named Zacharias. And within this tent, round about were placed forms, on which ſtood the reſt of the council. They were incloſed with a rail, at a diſtance from them, to prevent all ſtrangers and all ſuch as could not prove themſelves to be Jews

And again, ſome of theſe Jews have burned the antient record of their tribes and families, that they might not be diſcovered by ſearching, or other ways. And for this defect; that they could not prove their tribes and family they were not permitted to come within the rails in the time of their council, but commanded to remain with the ſtrangers that attended to ſee the event of this aſſembly. We conceive the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people that attended to ſee the iſſue of their preceedings were about three thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The moſt part of them Germans, Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, Dalmatians, with ſome Greeks, and a few Italians, but not one Engliſhman more than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for I was informed that the king of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary not favouring the reformed religion, did give no encouragement to any proteſtant church to ſend a divine thither. But he did allow there ſhould be ſome aſſiſtance ſent from Rome; and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030301_0051_0FE5AC1B2DECA720"/>
their coming hither proved a great unhappineſs to this hopeful aſſembly, or council.</p>
               <p>The firſt day, when the aſſembly firſt met, they ſpent ſome time in mutual ſalutations, and as their manner is, kiſſed one another's cheeks, expreſſing great joy for their happy meeting. And now all things being prepared for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, they conſidered of the Jews that were to be admitted for members of this council, for they only were admitted members, that could by record prove themſelves to be native Jews. And I obſerved, there were about five hundred refuſed, and put by, though doubtleſs they were true Jews, yet they could not by record prove themſelves ſo to be. The number accepted was about three hundred; and thus the buſineſs of the firſt day cloſed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day, the aſſembly being full, the propounder Zacharias, of the tribe of Levi ſtood up, and made a ſpeech concerning the end of their meeting. And this, ſaid he, is to examine the ſcriptures concerning Chriſt, whether he be already come, or whether we are to expect his coming? In examining this queſtion, they ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Old teſtament with great care and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor moſt part of that day, to be reſolved in the truth, having bibles to that end. About which point began a diſpute that laſted many hours, which at last lead to this concluſion, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of this aſſembly were of opinion that Chriſt was not come. But ſome others of the aſſembly having ſtrictly examined the ſcriptures, and finding them ſo plain for his coming, were
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030301_0052_0FE5AC189D6C16D8"/>
inclined to think that Chriſt was come, being the rather ſo moved to think, by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great judgments that have been upon them theſe 1600 years; they imputed the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction and long afflictions of their nation to the wickedneſs they had been guilty of, and one of their greateſt ſins, they ſaid, was the ſpilling the blood of the Prophet ſent from God to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and maſſacring thoſe who believed the doctrines he taught. For, ſaid they, we are no idolaters, and therefore we have not had this heavy judgement upon us for that; but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is for the ſpilling the blood of Jeſus, the prophet ſent from God, and for maſſacring thoſe that loved him. And this was the ſum of what was diſputed the ſecond day of their meeting, and ſo they ceaſed until the next morning.</p>
               <p>The third day, being aſſembled together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the point chiefly agitated was concerning the manner of Chriſt's coming; and that (they ſaid) ſhould be like a mighty prince, in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority of a king; yea, in greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ever any king had, and that he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their nation out of the power of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and reſtore them to their kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and that the nations ſhall be of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whenſoever he cometh; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conclude that Chriſt was not come. For Jeſus, ſaid they, the great prophet, when he came, began to alter our religion, therefore h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Jeſus came, whom ſome call the true Meſſias, he began preſently to pluck down our religion, and
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030301_0052_0FE5AC189D6C16D8"/>
ſet up his own, therefore he was not the true Meſſiah. Thus ſome of them concluded, and ſome did not. But they went from this diſpute to another, concerning his parentage, they did all agree in this, that he ſhall be born of a virgin, according to the predictions of the prophets in the Old Teſtament. And in this alſo, that he ſhould be born of a virgin of mean note and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage among their nation, as was the virgin Mary that bare Jeſus, the great prophet from God. And upon this many of them ſeemed to think that Chriſt was come: but left it to next day, when they ſhould again meet together.</p>
               <p>The fourth day, the aſſembly being met, the propounder demanded what they thought, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt was come, or not ? they ſaid, they thought he was come; but they anſwered this, that if he were come, he was no other than Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as; becauſe Elias was formerly in great power, and with great power he declared it, in ſlaying the prieſts of Baal, and for fulfilling the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he was oppoſed by Ahab and Jezebel. And ſo they eſteemed this man, whom they called Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to be that ſame Elias. Moreover, others ſaid, that they thought he was more than a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man, in that he ſo ſtrangely aſcended up into Heaven, which ſome of our forefathers ſaw; and this was all that was done on the fourth day.</p>
               <p>The fifth day, the aſſembly being met, they went about the ſame queſtion that was contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the day before, and took into examination again, to anſwer them that ſaid Elias was not the Meſſiah. They of the contrary opinion, did
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030301_0053_0FE5AC44E35CA878"/>
argue the love and care of Elias for the good of their nation: that he left them Eliſha his diſciple to teach and inſtruct the people, and this they took to be the care of the Meſſiah. Theſe were their chief arguments to maintain their opinion: the ſame day towards night came into queſtion among them, what then he was that ſaid, he was the ſon of God, and was crucified by their anceſtors; but becauſe this was a great queſtion among them, they deferred the farther coſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof until the next day.</p>
               <p>The ſixth day, there were ſome Phariſees that ſtood up, who were the great enemies of Chriſt and ſaid, they would undertake to anſwer the laſt queſtion; and would by no means yield that he was the Chriſt. And theſe are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they give for their opinion, viz. 1. Becauſe he came into the world like an ordinary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior man; not with his ſcepter and royal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for they affirmed, that the coming of Chriſt would be glorious. 2. They pleaded againſt him, the meanneſs of his birth, in that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a carpenter, and this (they ſaid) was a diſhonour of which, when Chriſt comes he will not be capable. 3. They accuſed him to be a falſe Chriſt, and an enemy to Moſes' law, in doing and ſuffering his diſciples to do unlawful works on the Sabbath day. For they believed (they ſaid) that the true Meſſiah will exactly keep the law of Moſes. Now, though it were replied, that the Goſpel doth teſtify of Chriſt; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> he did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l the law of Moſes, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that anſwer, becauſe they did not believe,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030301_0053_0FE5AC44E35CA878"/>
and own the goſpel. But theſe reaſons did not ſatisfy the council.</p>
               <p>So that, after the Phariſees had done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there ſtood up one Rabbi Abraham, and objected againſt the Phariſees, the myracles that Chriſt wrought while he was on earth, viz. The raiſing of dead to life again; his making the lame to walk; the blind to ſee; the dumb to ſpeak; by what power, I pray you, my breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, did he them? With that the Phariſees aroſe, and deſired to anſwer him; and this is the anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer they returned to the council: Perhaps, ſaid they, this Jeſus was an impoſtor, and magician, and ſo was enabled to do thoſe miracles. And for our parts, we believe, that all the miracles he did were done by magick and charms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were reſtored to their former condition again. But this anſwer gave little ſatisfaction to the council, and eſpecially to Abraham: whereupon Abraham ſtood up, and replied, How could this Chriſt charm the blind, lame, and dumb, &amp;c. when they were ſo born before Jeſus Chriſt himſelf was born, as it appeared ſame of them were? This ſeemed a paradox to the Phariſees. And truly, the proſecuting of this argument almoſt put the Phariſees to a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, but at laſt they began to ſpeak again, and gave this anſwer, though a weak and vile one; Perhaps, ſay they, the ſaid impotent perſons were made ſo by other magicians, and conjured to be lame, blind, and dumb, &amp;c. And though himſelf were not then born when they were born with those evils, yet this Jeſus being a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030301_0054_0FE5AC1ECADF4F58"/>
and more cunning than any magician before him, power was given him by the devil to remove thoſe charms which others had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But there Eas one Phariſee among th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> reſt, named Zebedee, who among all the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees there aſſembled, did more opprobriouſly and blaſphemouſly revile Chriſt, and vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged thoſe things to the council, againſt him; but, I conceive, not to the well liking of any that heard him, even to the members of the council, or of the Phariſees. And as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees played their part againſt Chriſt, ſo did the Saducees likewiſe: for ſome of the council were of that ſect, who did endeavour to render Chriſt vile and odious to the reſt of the Jews.</p>
               <p>I obſerved it to be with the Phariſees and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees as once it was with Herod and Pilate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus ſeeking to diſgrace one another, the pope threatened to excommunicate the authors of all ſuch black libellous books, tending to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the clergy (as he called them) to make them infamous to the world. But theſe things by the way.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh day.

Whereupon ſix of the Roman clergy, who were on purpoſe ſent thither by the pope, to adviſe in the council, (two of which were Jeſuites, and four were Friars, two of the order St. Auguſtine, and two of the order of St. Francis.) being admitted into the council, began to open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Gaza and Jeruſalem; and by the way picked up a Ligorneſs lady, whom he made his third wife, the daughter of ſome Polonian or German, her original and parentage not being very well known—And being now at Jeruſalem, he began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the law of the Jews, and aboliſh the feaſt of Tamuz, which they keep in the month of June, and there meeting with a certain Jew call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nathan, a proper inſtrument to promote his deſign, he communicated to him his condition, and courſe of life, and intentions to proclaim himſelf Meſſiah of the world, ſo long expected and deſired by the Jews.

to death; others buried themſelves in their gardens, covering their naked bodies with earth, their heads only excepted, remaining in their beds of dirt until their bodies were ſtiffened with the cold and moiſture: others would endure to have melted wax dropt upon their ſhoulders, others to roll themſelves in ſnow, and throw their bodies in the coldeſt ſeaſon of winter into the fen, or frozen waters: but the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of mortification was firſt to prick their backs and ſides with thorns, and then to give themſelves a number of laſhes. All buſineſs was laid aſide, none of them opened ſhop, unleſs to clear his warehouſe of merchandize at any price; who had ſuperfluity in houſhold ſtuff ſold it for what he could, but yet not to Jews, for they were interdicted from bargains or ſales, on the pain of excommunication, pecuniary mulcts, or corporal puniſhments; all buſineſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was eſteemed for the teſt and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of their faith. It being the general tenet, that in the days that the Meſſiah appears, the Jews ſhall become maſters of the eſtates and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of infidels, until when they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with matters only neceſſary to maintain and ſupport life, but becauſe every one was not maſter of ſo much fortune and proviſion as to live without daily labour; and therefore to quiet the clamours of the poor, and prevent the enormous lives of ſome, who upon theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions would become vagabonds, and deſert their cities, due order was taken to make collections, which were ſo liberally beſtowed, that in Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanica
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030301_0059_0FE5AC52A004B760"/>
only 400 poor were ſupported by the mere charity of the richer. And as they endeavoured to purge their conſciences of ſin, and to apply themſelves to good works, that the Meſſiah might find the city prepared for his reception, ſo leſt he ſhould accuſe them of any omiſſion in the law, and particularly in their neglect of that antient precept, of increaſe and multiply; they married together children of ten years of age and ſome under, without reſpect to riches or pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, condition or equality, but being promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly joined to the number of ſix or ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred couple, upon better and cooler thoughts, after the deceit of the falſe Meſſiah, was diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, or the expectation of his coming grew colp, were divorced, or by conſent ſeparated from each other.</p>
               <p>In the heat of all this talk and rumour comes Sabatai Sevi to Smyrna, the city of his nativity, infinitely deſired there by the common Jews; but by the chochams, or doctors of their law, who gave little or no credence to what he pretended, was ill received, not knowing what miſchief or ruin this doctrine and prophecy of a new kingdom might produce. Yet Sabatai bringing with him teſtimonials of his ſanctity, holy life, wiſdom, and gift of prophecy, ſo deeply fix'd himſelf in the hearts of the general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; both as being holy and wiſe, and thereupon he took courage and boldneſs to enter into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the grand chocham, (who is the head, and chief expoſitor of the law, and ſupperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of their will and government) between
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030301_0060_0FE5AC40AE001B98"/>
whom the arguments grew ſo high and language ſo hot, that the Jews who favoured the doctrine of Sabatai, and feared the authority of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chams, doubtful what might be the iſſue of the conteſt, appeared in great numbers before the Cadi of Smyrna, in juſtification of the new prophet, before ſo much as any accuſation came againſt him. The Cadi (according to the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Turks) ſwallows money from both ſides, and afterwards remits them to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of their own juſtice. In this manner Sabatai gains ground daily; and the grand cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham with his party, loſing both the affection and obedience of his people, is diſplaced from his office, and another conſtituted, more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionate and agreeable to the new prophet, whoſe power daily increaſed by thoſe confident reports, that his enemies were ſtruck with phrenſies and madneſs, until being reſtored to their former temper and wits by him, they became his friends, admirers, and diſciples.</p>
               <p>And having thus fixed himſelf in the opinion and admiration of the people, he began to take on himſelf the title of Meſſiah, and ſon of God.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the diſciples of Sabatai Sevi were not ſo numerous, but many oppoſed his doctrine, publicly avouching that he was an impoſtor and deceiver of the people, amongſt which was one Samuel Pennia, a man of a good eſtate and reputation in Smyrna, who arguing in the Synagogue, that the preſent ſigns of the coming of the Meſſiah were not apparent, either according to ſcripture, or the doctrine of the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030301_0060_0FE5AC40AE001B98"/>
Rabbins, raiſed ſuch a ſedition and tumult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews, as not only prevailed againſt arguments, but had alſo againſt his life, had he not timely conveyed himſelf out of the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and thereby eſcaped the hands of the multitude, who now could more eaſily endure blaſphemy againſt the law of Moſes, nad the profanation of the ſanctuary, than contradiction or miſbelief of the doctrine of Sabatai. But howſoever it fell out, Pennia, in a ſhort time becomes a convert, and preaches up Sabatai for the ſon of God, and deliverer of the Jews; and not only he, but his whole family: his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters propheſy and fall into ſtrange extaſies; and not only his, but four hundred men and women propheſy of the growing kingdom of Sabatai, and young infants, who could yet ſcarce ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer out a ſyllable to their mothers, repeat and pronounce plainly the name of Sabatai the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah and ſon of God. For thus far had God permitted the Devil to delude this people, that their very children were for a time poſſeſſed, and voices heard to ſound from their ſtomachs and intrails; thoſe of riper years fell firſt into a trance, foamed at the mouth, and recounted the future proſperity and deliverance of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, their viſions of the lyon of Judah, and the triumphs of Sabatai: all which were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the effects of diabolical deluſion, as the Jews themſelves ſince have confeſſed unto me.</p>
               <p>With theſe concomitant accidents and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Sabatai Sevi growing more preſumptious, that he might correſpond with the prophecies of
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030301_0061_0FE5AC34D0251E20"/>
the greatneſs and dominion of the Meſſiah, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to an election of thoſe princes which are to govern the Iſraelites in their march towards the holy land, and to diſpenſe judgment and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice after their reſtoration. The names of them were well known at Smyrna, who never (God knows) had ambition to aſpire to the title of princes, until a ſtrange ſpirit of deceit and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had moved them, not only to hope for it as poſſible, but to expect it as certain.</p>
               <p>In this manner things ran to ſtrange height of madneſs among the Jews ot Smyrna, where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſuch pegeantry of greatneſs, that no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy could equal the mock-ſhews they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and though none durſt openly profeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcruple, or doubt of this common received belief, yet for confirmation of the Jews in their faith, and aſtoniſhment of the Gentiles, it was judged no leſs than neceſſary, that Sabatai ſhould ſhew ſome miracles whereby to convince all the world that he was the true Meſſiah; and as the preſent occaſion ſeemed to require an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence infallible of this truth, ſo it was daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the vulgar, with an impatience ſuitable to humours diſpoſed to novelty; who out of every action of their prophet, began to fancy ſomething extraordinary and ſupernatural. Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai was now horribly puzzled for a miracle, though the imagination of the people was ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated that any legerdemain, or ſlight of hand would have paſſed more eaſy with them for a wonder than Moſes ſtriking the rock for water, or dividing the red ſea; and an occaſion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030301_0061_0FE5AC34D0251E20"/>
that Sabatai was, in behalf of his ſubjects, to appear before the Cadi, or judge of the city, to demand eaſe and relief of ſome oppreſſions which aggrieved them; it was thought neceſſary a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle ſhould be now or never, when Sabatai ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing with a formal and phariſaical gravity which he had ſtarched on, ſome on a ſudden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched to ſee a pillar of fire between him and the Cadi, which report preſently was heard thro' the whole room, filled with Jews that eccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied Sabatai, ſome of whom who ſtrongly fancied it, vowed and ſwore they ſaw it; others in the outward yard, or that could not come near to hear, or ſee, for the crowd, as ſpeedily took the alarm, and the rumour ran and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed belief of the women and childred at home in a moment, ſo that Sabatai Sevi returned to his houſe triumphant, fixed in the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who now needed no farther miracles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in their faith. Sabatai Sevi having thus fully fixed himſelf in Smyrna, and filled other places with rumours of his fame, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was called by God to viſit Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, where the greateſt part of his work was to be accompliſhed. In order, whereunto he privately ſhipped himſelf, with ſome few atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</p>
               <p>The wind proving northerly, as commonly it is in the Helleſpont and Propontus, Sabatai was thirty nine days in his voyage, ſo little pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had this Meſſiah over the ſea and winds; in which time news being come to Conſtantinople that the Jews Meſſiah was near, all that people
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030301_0062_0FE5AC333B5E0F20"/>
prepared to receive him with the ſame joy and impatience as was expreſſed in other parts where he arrived, the grand vizier (then alſo at Conſtantinople, being not yet departed on his expedition for Candia) having heard ſome ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of this man, and the diſorder and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had raiſed among the Jews, ſent two boats, whilſt the Salack was detained by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry winds, with commands to bring him up priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner to the port, where accordingly Sabatai be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, was confined in the moſt loathſome dungeon in the town, there to remain in farther expectation of the vizier's ſentence. The Jews were not at all diſcouraged at this treatment of their prophet, but rather confirmed in their belief of him, as being the accompliſhment of the prophecy of thoſe things which ought to proceed his glory and dominion; which conſideration induced the chiefeſt perſons among the Jews to make their viſits and addreſſes to him, with the ſame ceremony and reſpect in the dungeon, as they would have done had he then ſat exalted on the throne of Iſrael:</p>
               <p>The Jews in Conſtantinople were now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030301_0062_0FE5AC333B5E0F20"/>
upon them the boldneſs to defraud them of their right, and deſired he would ſignify to theſe his ſubjects his pleaſure to have ſatisfaction given: whereupon Sabatai with much affection took pen and paper and wrote to this effect.</p>
               <p>In this manner Sabatai Sevi remained a priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner at Conſtantinople for the ſpace of two months: at the end of which the Vizier having ſignified his expedition for Candia, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rumour and diſturbance the preſence of Sabatai had made already at Conſtantinople, though it not ſecure to ſuffer him to remain in the imperial city, whilſt both the Grand Seignior and himſelf were abſent: and therefore changes his priſon to the Dardanelli. This removal of Sabatai from a worſe priſon to one of a better air, confirmed the Jews with a greater confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his being the Meſſiah, ſuppoſing that had it been in the power of the Vizier to have deſtroyed his perſon, he would never have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to have lived to that time, in regard their maxims enforce them to end all jealouſies and ſuſpicions of ruin to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, by the death of the party feared, which much rather they ought to execute on Sabatai, who had not only declared himſelf the king of Iſrael, but alſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed prophecies fatal to the Grand Seignior and his kingdoms.</p>
               <p>With this conſideration, and others proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Jews flock in great numbers to the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, where he was impriſoned, not only from the neighbouring parts, but alſo from Poland, Germany, Leghorn, Venice, Amſterdam, and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030301_0063_0FE5990187993890"/>
other places where the Jews reſide: on all whom as a reward of the expence and labours of their pilgrimage, Sabatai beſtowed plenty of his ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edictions, promiſing increaſe of their ſtore, and enlargement of their poſſeſſion in the Holy Land. And ſo great was the confluence of the Jews to this place, that the Turks thought it requiſite to make their advantage thereof, and ſo not only raiſed the price of their proviſions, lodgings, and other neceſſaries, but alſo denied to admit any to the preſence of Sabatai, unleſs for money, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the price ſometimes at five, ſometimes at ten dollars more or leſs, according as they gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at their abilities, or zeal for the perſon, by which gain and advantage to the Turks no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints or advices was carried to Adrianople, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the concourſe of people or arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews in that place, but rather all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities and liberty indulged unto them, which ſerved as a farther argument to enſnare this poor people in the belief of their Meſſiah.</p>
               <p>The devotion of the Jews toward this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meſſiah increaſed ſtill more and more, ſo that not only the chief of the city went to attend and proffer their ſervice towards him in the time of his impriſonment, but likewiſe decked their ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agogue with S. S. in letters of gold, making for him on the wall a crown, in the circle of which was wrote the 91ſt Pſalm at length in fair and legible characters; attributing the ſame titles to Sabatai, and expounding the ſcriptures in the ſame manner in favor of his appearance, as we do of our Saviour. However, ſome of the Jews
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030301_0063_0FE5990187993890"/>
remained in their wits all this time, amongſt which was a certain Chocham at Smyrna, one zealous of his law, and of the good and ſafety of his nation, and obſerving in what a wild man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the whole people of the Jews was tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with the groundleſs belief of a Meſſiah, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only their trade, and courſe of living, but publiſhing prophecies of a ſpeedy kingdom, of reſcue from the tyranny of the Turks, and leading the Grand Seignior himſelf captive in chains: matters ſo dangerous and obnoxious to the ſtate wherein they lived, as might juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict them of treaſon and rebellion, and leave them to the mercy of that juſtice, which on the leaſt jealouſy and ſuſpicion of matters of this nature, uſes to extirpate families, and ſubvert the manſion houſes of their own people, much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Jews, on whom the Turks would gladly take occaſion to diſpoil them of their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, and condemn the whole nation to perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſlavery.</p>
               <p>This chocham ſo enraged and ſcandalized the Jews, that they judged no condemnation or puniſhment too ſevere againſt ſuch an offender and blaſphemer of their law, and holineſs of the Meſſiah: and therefore with money and preſents to the Cadi accuſing him as diſobedient in a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal manner to their government, obtained ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt him, to have his beard ſhaved, and to be condemned to the gallies. There wanted nothing now to the appearance of the Meſſiah, and the ſolemnity of his coming, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Elias; whom the Jews began to expect
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030301_0064_0FE5AC3E220A4B60"/>
hourly, and with that intention and earneſtneſs, that every dream or phantaſm to a weak head was judged to be Elias; it being taught and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred, that he was ſeen in divers forms and ſhapes, not to be certainly diſcovered or known before the coming of the Meſſiah; for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition is ſo far fixed amongſt them, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in their families they ſpread a table for Elias the prophet to which they make an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of poor people, leaving the chief place for the Lord Elias, whom they believe to be inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſent at the entertainment, and there to eat and drink without diminution, either of the diſhes or of the cup.</p>
               <p>This being the common opinion among the Jews, and that Sabatai Sevi was the Meſſiah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become an article of faith, it was not hard to perſuade them that Elias was come already, that they met with him in their diſhes, in the dark, in their bed chambers, or any where elſe inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the ſame manner as common people of England believe of hobgoblins and fairies.</p>
               <p>For ſo it was when Solomon Cremona, an inhabitant of Smyrna, making a great feaſt, to which the principal Jews of the city were invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after they had eaten and drank freely, one ſtarts from his ſeat, and avouches that he ſaw Elias upon the wall, and with that bows to him and compliments him with all reverence and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; ſome others having in like manner their fancies prepared to diſtinguiſh ſhadows immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately agreed upon the object, and then there was not one in the company who would ſay he
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030301_0064_0FE5AC3E220A4B60"/>
did not ſee him: at which ſurprize every one was ſtruck with reverence and awe; and the moſt eloquent amongſt them having their tongues looſed with joy and wine, directed orations, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums, and acts of thankfulneſs to Elias, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and complimenting him as diſtracted lovers do the ſuppoſed preſence of their miſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>But to return again to Sabatai Sevi himſelf, we find him ſtill remaning a priſoner in the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Abydos, upon the Helleſpont, admired and adored by his brethren with more honour than before, and viſited by pilgrims from all parts, where the fame of the coming of the Meſſiah had arrived: amongſt which one from Poland, named Nehemiah Cohen, was of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial note and renown learned in the Hebrew, Syriack and Chaldee, and verſed in the doctrine and cavals of the Rabbins, as well as Sabatai himſelf, one (of whom it was ſaid) had not this Sevi anticipated the deſign, eſteemed himſelf a notable fellow, to act the part of a Meſſiah as the other: Howſoever, it being too late to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any ſuch pretence, Sabatai having now ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven points of the law by poſſeſſion of the office, and with that the hearts and belief of the Jews, Nehemiah was contented with ſome ſmall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage, or relation to the Meſſiah; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to lay his deſign the better deſired a private conference with Sabatai; theſe two great Rab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bins being together, a hot diſpute aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; for Cohen alledged, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſcripture, and expoſition of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereupon, there were to be two Meſſiahs,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030301_0065_0FE5AC1CE05B0CF0"/>
one called Ben Ephraim, and the other Ben David; the firſt was to be a preacher of the law, poor, deſpiſed, a ſervant and forerunner to the ſecond, who was to be great and rich, to reſtore the Jews, to ſit upon the throne of David, and to perform all the wonders expected from Sabatai. Nehemiah was contented to be Ephraim, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and poor Meſſiah, and Sabatai was willing he ſhould be ſo; but that Nehemiah accuſed him for being too forward in publiſhing himſelf the former Meſſiah, before Ben Ephraim had firſt been known unto the world. Sabatai took this reprehenſion ſo ill, either out of pride of his own infallibility, or he ſuſpected that Nehemiah being once admitted for Ben Ephraim (being a ſubtle and learned perſon) would perſuade the world that he was Ben David, would by no means admit of this new doctrine; and thereupon the diſpute grew ſo hot, and irreconcileable, as was taken notice of by the Jews, and controverted by them as every one fancied. But Sabatai being of greater authority, his ſentence prevailed, and Nehemiah was rejected as an enemy to the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, which afterwards proved the downfall of this impoſtor. For Nehemiah being thus baffled, and being a perſon of authority, and haughty ſpirit, meditated nothing but revenge; to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute which, he takes a journey to Adrianople, and there informs the chief miniſters of ſtate, who, by reaſon of the gain the Turks made of their priſoner, heard nothing of him, or of the prophecies—and taking likewiſe to his council certain diſcontented and unbelieving chochams,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030301_0065_0FE5AC1CE05B0CF0"/>
who being jealous of the conſequences of this increaſing madneſs, took liberty to inform the chocham who was deputy of the great vizier, that the Jew, priſoner at the caſtle, called Sabatai Sevi, was a lewd perſon, and one who endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to debauch the minds of the Jews, and divert them from their honeſt courſe of livelihood, and obedience to the grand Signior; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was neceſſary to clear the world of ſo fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and dangerous a ſpirit. The chocham being thus informed, could do no leſs than acquaint the grand ſeignior, who inſtantly diſpatched a chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux (meſſenger) to bring up Sabatai to Adrino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The chiaux executed his commiſſion after the Turkiſh faſhion, and without ceremony hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Sabatai to Adrinople, not even affording him time to take a ſolemn farewel of his diſciples, who were now come to the vertical point of all their hopes and expectations.</p>
               <p>The Grand Seignior having received by this time divers informations of the madneſs of the Jews, and the pretence of Sabatai, grew big with deſire and expectation to ſee him: ſo that he no ſooner arrived at Adrinople, but the ſame hour he was brought before the Grand Seignior; Sabatai appeared much dejected, and failing of that courage which he ſhewed in the ſynagogue; and being demanded ſeveral queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the grand ſeignior, he would not truſt ſo far to the virtue of his Meſſiahſhip, as to deliver himſelf in the Turkiſh language, but deſired a doctor of phyſic, who had from a Jew turned Turk, to be his interpreter, which was granted to
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030301_0066_0FE5AC3168E89090"/>
him, but not without reflection of the ſtanders by, that had he been the Meſſiah, his tongue would have flown with a variety, as well as with the perfection of languages. But the grand ſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior would not be put off without a miracle, and it muſt be one of his own choice; which was; that Sabatai ſhould be ſtripped naked, and ſet as a mark to his archers: if the arrows pierced not his body, then he would believe him to be the Meſſiah. But Sabatai not having faith to ſtand ſo ſharp a trial, renounced all his title to kingdoms and governments, alledging that he was but an ordinary chocham, and a poor Jew, as others were, and had nothing of privilege, or virtue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt. But the grand ſeignior not being fully ſatisfied with this plain confeſſion, declared, that having given public ſcandal to the profeſſors of the Mehometan religion, and done diſhonor to his ſovereign authority, by pretending to draw ſuch a conſiderable portion from him as the land of Paleſtine; his treaſon and crime were not to be expatiated but by a converſion to the Meho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan faith, which if he refuſed, the ſtake was ready at the gate of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>raglio to impale him.</p>
               <p>Sabatai being now reduced to extremity, yet not doubtful what to do, for to die for what he knew to be falſe would be the death of a mad man; replied with much chearfulneſs, that he was contented to turn a Turk, and that it was not of force, but of choice, having been a long time deſirous of ſo glorious a profeſſion: he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed himſelf much honored, that he had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to own it firſt in the prefence of the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030301_0066_0FE5AC3168E89090"/>

               <p>During the time of all theſe tranſactions, the Jews of Smyrna, &amp;c. leaving their traffic, filled their letters for Italy, and other parts, with nothing but wonders and miracles wrought by their falſe Meſſiah. As that when the Grand Seignior ſent to take him, he cauſed all the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers immediatly to die, upon which other janizaries being again ſent, they all fell dead with only a word from his mouth; and being deſired to revive them again, he immediately recalled them to life. After this they added, that he went voluntarily to priſon, and though the gates were barred and ſhut with ſtrong locks of iron, yet that Sabatai was ſeen to walk through the ſtreets with a numerous attendance: and when they laid ſhackles on his neck and feet, they not only fell from him, but were converted into gold, with which he gratified his true and faithful believers and diſciples. Some miracles alſo were reported of Nathan, that only at rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the name of any particular man or woman, he would immediately recount the ſtory of his or her life, their ſins or defaults, and accordingly impoſe juſt correction and penance for them.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſtrong reports coming thus confidently into Italy and all parts, the Jews of Caſel in Montſerrato reſolved to ſend three parſons in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of their ſociety, in the nature of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry legates to Smyrna, to make inquiry after the truth of all theſe rumours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:030301_0067_0FE5AC56C163D5C0"/>At length Nathan arrives near Smyrna, on Friday the third of March, towards evening and on Sunday theſe legates made their viſit to him; but Nathan, upon news of the change of his be loved Meſſiah, began to grow ſullen and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſo that the legates could ſcarce procure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to him; all they could do was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him that they had a letter to him from the brotherhood of Italy, and commiſſion to confer with him concerning the foundation and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he had for his prophecies; but Nathan refuſed to take the letter; ſo that the legates returned ill contented, but yet with hope at Nathan's arrival at Smyrna to receive better ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>By theſe means Nathan being diſappointed of his wandering progreſs, and aſhamed of the event of things, contrary to his prophecies, reſolved to return again, and not to enter Smyrna. And thus the embaſſy of theſe legates was concluded, and they returned to the place from whence they came, and the Jews again to their wits, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their trade of merchandize and brokerage as formerly, with more quiet advantage. Theſe matters were tranſacted in the years 1665 and 1666, ſince which Sabatai hath paſſed his time devoutly in the Ottoman court.</p>
               <p>Sabatai Sevi continued in the houſe of the grand ſeignior until the year 1676, and then died.</p>
