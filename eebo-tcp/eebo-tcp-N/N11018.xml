            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOU aſcended the throne of theſe realms with advantages, which, if properly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, would have rendered your reign not only glorious and happy, but have made you the moſt powerful monarch upon earth; you might have kept the world in awe. Yet, oh ſhame to tell, though the times demand it, you ſoon ſacrificed your own peace, the tranquillity, honor and intereſt of this great and mighty king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to the ambitious views, and pernicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, of your infernal minion Lord Bute, and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:013968_0002_0F925B44CABABC10"/>his profligate, abandoned adherents. Your acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the throne filled with joy the breaſt of every Engliſhman; but alas, it was of ſhort du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you ſoon convinced them of their miſtake, and the compliments paid to your underſtanding, the calm hour of reaſon ſoon convinced us were ill founded.</p>
            <p>No ſooner ſeated upon the throne of this vaſt empire, than you, like all other Kings, as well as tyrants, made the people many and fair promiſes. You told your Parliament, that the ſuppreſſion of vice and immorality, the encouragement of trade and commerce, and the preſervation of peace and harmony amongſt your people, ſhould be the rule of your conduct, and your principal ſtudy. How far you have kept your word, the ſacred pen of truth ſhall now declare.</p>
            <p>Scarce ſeated in regal dignity before you drove from your preſence and councils, by the advice of your Scotch favourite, Lord Bute, every man of honor and integrity, who was valued for his love to his country, and affection for your family. You implicitly followed the advice of your Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern minion, and in their room took thoſe only who were the moſt conſpicuous for their vices, and the moſt abandoned in principle; theſe are facts which Sandwich, Bute, Grafton, North, &amp;c. will confirm.</p>
            <p>Theſe men you ſtill continue to countenance, every ſcene of iniquity they have been concerned in, and every act of violence, oppreſſion, and murder they have committed, has been by you tacitly approved, nay applauded. Adultery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, and divorces, are more frequent now than in the corrupt and profligate days of Charles the Second; theſe, Sir, prove inconteſtibly your
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:013968_0003_0F925B46029919A0"/>religious principles, and ſhow how far you have ſuppreſſed vice and immorality.</p>
            <p>It will now be neceſſary to inquire, how far you have encouraged trade and commerce, was it by illegally impoſing a ſtamp duty on the Americans, and taxing thoſe commodities which we ſupplied them with from this country, which has ſtopped for near ſix years a great traffic between this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and the colonies? Was it by ſuffering, with the moſt ſhameful impunity, the Portugueſe to infringe upon the privileges of the Engliſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants at Liſbon, by which many were not only injured, but almoſt totally ruined? Was it by blocking up the port, and deſtroying the trade of the town of Boſton, thereby reducing to a ſtate of miſerable dependance more than thirty thouſand people, and giving a vital ſtab to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of America?</p>
            <p>We will now examine, Sir, how far you have preſerved peace and harmony among your people; was it by providing for all the beggarly relations, and miſerable dependents, of your Scotch minion, in preference to your Engliſh ſubjects, eſpecially thoſe who were the chief inſtruments of placing your family upon the throne? Was it by ordering the late Lord Hallifax to iſſue an illegal warrant for apprehending Mr. Wilkes? Was it by reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that delinquent after he had been found guilty of a breach of the Engliſh laws? Was it by ſcreening your miniſter behind the throne, who violated the rights of the freeholders of England? Was it by rejecting the petitions of your injured ſubjects, and laughing at the remonſtrance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to you from the firſt city in the world, the great capital of the Britiſh empire? Was it by not granting the ſupplications of your people, and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:013968_0004_0F925B4639F0E6A8"/>meanly referring thoſe petitions and remonſtrances to the conſideration of thoſe very men, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct they arraigned, and who were only the ſlaviſh tools of your abandoned miniſters? Was it by ſending troops to Boſton, depriving the people of their conſtitutional rights; and, contrary to all the laws of this free country, enforcing the tyrannical and oppreſſive acts of your abandoned Parliament with the ſword, and laying America under a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary government? Was it by rewarding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate, the corrupt, and the plunderers of their country, with titles and honors? Was it by a tame daſtardly ſubmiſſion to the inſults of the Spaniards, and a ſacrifice of the honor of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nation? Theſe, Sir, are the means you have made uſe of for preſerving peace and harmony among your people. But, Sir, the greateſt piece of miniſterial villany, and diabolical cruelty, is ſtill behind, it is now going through the Houſe of Lords, and you, Sir, will ſoon be called upon to ſign it; it is a bill for reſtraining the American fiſhery, and ſtarving to death, or driving to a ſtate of deſperation, more than 300,000 people; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Sir, the fatal tendency of this bill, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine no longer to be the dupe of an abandoned ſet of men, act from yourſelf, and refuſe to ſign an act of parliament, which muſt involve one part of the empire in a civil war, and reduce thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of your ſubjects to poverty and want. Let no conſideration prevail with you to execute a deed, at the idea of which humanity revolts; conſider, Sir, how much this will raiſe the indignation of your people here, when they find you are deſtitute of the common feelings of humanity, and that you can be ſo eaſily prevailed upon to ſacrifice your ſubjects to the cruel deſigns of your miniſters
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013968_0005_0F925B46F714E038"/>and favourites. Give ſome proof of a determined reſolution no longer to purſue meaſures which muſt end in the deſtruction of your kingdoms, and perhaps in the ruin of your family.</p>
            <p>Conſider, Sir, how deſpiſable you appear in the eyes of the world; who, inſtead of governing, ſuffer yourſelf to be governed; who, inſtead of being a leader, are lead; who, inſtead of being a King, are nothing but a mere cypher of ſtate, while your favourite and miniſters wear all the appendages to ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>It has long ſurprized the kingdom, to think how you could bear ſuch wretches to prey upon you, to think how you could ſuffer them to aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize themſelves and creatures, to poſſeſs the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wealth, and to hold the firſt offices in the kingdom; and all this by impoſing upon you, by making you break your coronation oath; by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you violate every promiſe you made with your people, and by filling your ears with lies, inſtead of truth; how is it poſſible you can bear ſuch uſage, which no ſenſible man in a private capacity can bear? And be the dupe of the vileſt of the creation, is ſo much beneath the dignity of a man who pretends to govern, that it is aſtoniſhing ſuch fiends ſhould prevail as they do; indeed they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could unleſs you, Sir, like them, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to eſtabliſh an arbitrary ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſet up your own will in oppoſition to the laws of the land.</p>
            <p>Let me adviſe you, Sir, as you regard your own proſperity, and the welfare of your kingdom, let me conjure you, as you value your own ſafety, to conſider well the fatal and ruinous meaſures your miniſters are purſuing, and you ſanctifying with the royal authority; conſider the miſerable, the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013968_0006_0F925B47CF251340"/>unfortunate ſituation of this country; think on the dangers which threaten it on every ſide; conſider we are now upon the eye of a civil war with our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; from the preſent face of things, it is ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable; trade and commerce is at a ſtand, and all the horrors of wretchedneſs and want ſtare them in the face; conſider, Sir, the feelings of men reduced in the ſhort ſpace of a few days, through wanton acts of power, from a ſtate of eaſe and plenty to that of miſery and famine; I aſk, is it poſſible for them to ſet bounds to their reſentments; conſider, Sir, the French and Spaniards will not long remain idle ſpectators, when once they ſee us deeply engaged in a war with the colonies. Throw off then your ſupine indolence; awake from your lethargic ſtate; and if you will not be excited by the deſire of doing good, awake at leaſt to a ſenſe of your own danger; think when the general ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity comes on, who will be the objects of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic hatred. Will not the adviſers of theſe deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive meaſures be the firſt ſacrifices to the popular reſentment. When the merchants, traders, and manufactures are ſtarving, when the whole body of the people are in miſery and diſtreſs, what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, Sir, can you expect to find? Where will your miniſters conceal themſelves? They will not be ſafe even within the walls of your palace!</p>
            <p>Let theſe things, Sir, be well weighed, and no longer perſuade yourſelf the people was made for you, and not you for them; no longer believe that you do not govern for them but for yourſelf; that the people live only to increaſe your glory, or to furniſh matter for pleaſure: For once, Sir, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what you may do for them, and not what you may draw from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:013968_0007_0F925B4C634F9CA0"/>
The people, Sir, think it to be a crime of the firſt magnitude to convert that power to their hurt, which was intended for their good; and to obey a King, while he acts in this manner, and tramples under foot all laws, divine and human, argues not only a want of ſenſe in the higheſt degree, but a want of love for our country, and a diſregard for ourſelves and poſterity.</p>
            <p>Your ſubjects, Sir, are under no obligations to you, nor do they owe you any allegiance any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than you continue to protect them, and make their good the chief end of your government. When a Prince aſſumes to himſelf an extravagant, or an unlawful power, then all reſpect ceaſes, and he ceaſes to be a King; whilſt he protects and preſerves his people in their juſt right, and governs them by the laws of the land, all good men will love and eſteem him, and riſk their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in his ſervice; but when he begins to invade their liberties, to ſet up an arbitrary power, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unlawful taxes, raiſe forces, and make war upon his people, and ſuffer foreign ſtates to inſult and injure them, then all virtuous and good men will deteſt and abhor him, and endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from a throne he unworthily fills.</p>
            <p>In ſuch caſes reſiſtance is a virtue, and to ſay that ſome ſhould paſſively ſuffer, leſt by reſiſting they ſhould cauſe the ruin of many, is not a juſt reaſon; becauſe, in all probability, they will be the cauſe that millions unborn ſhall live happy and free, and what can be a more noble, glorious, and pious motive for ſuffering than to tranſmit li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to poſterity: For this our fathers bravely fought, and many of them gloriouſly fell, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves and their deſcendants free, and to deſtroy the tyranny and deſpotiſm of the Stuarts;
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013968_0008_0F925B4E3841FA40"/>and, Sir, let me beg you will remember with gratitude, to place your family upon the throne of the Britiſh Empire.</p>
            <p>The author of this paper is far from adviſing violent meaſures upon every error, or miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a Prince, but reſiſtance becomes a duty, when they attempt the ruin of the ſtate, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of liberty, or overturning the conſtitution of the kingdom. It is notorious to the world, Sir, that your miniſters are guilty of all theſe black, and deadly crimes, and yet you ſcreen and protect them; the concluſions to be drawn from thence are obvious, and you, like CHARLES, may live to ſee your FAVORITES FALL.</p>
