            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HISTORY has been ſo often written and improved, either for party purpoſes, or meer amuſement, that ſome ſerious perſons have been ready to treat it as a thing foreign from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of little ſervice to mankind. Yet the ſame perſons will readily own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that nothing teaches like experience; and what is true hiſtory but the experience of thoſe who have gone before us? of which perhaps none have been more remarkable, ſince the affairs of Canaan, than thoſe of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And as the preſent conteſts about liberty and government are very great, they call loudly for all the right therein that can be gained from every quarter.</p>
            <p>MR. Rollin in his ancient hiſtory ſays, "<hi>The powers that be are ordained of God;</hi> but neither every uſe that is made of this power, nor every means for the attainment of it, are from God, though every power be of him. And when we ſee theſe governments degenerating, ſometimes to violence, factions, deſpotic ſway and tyranny, 'tis wholly to the paſſions of mankind that we muſt aſcribe thoſe irregularities which are directly oppoſite to the primative inſtitution of ſtates; and which a SUPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOR WISDOM afterwards reduces to order, always making them contribute to the execution of HIS de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, full of equity and juſtice. This ſcene highly deſerves our attention and admiration. It is with a view of making the reader attentive to this object, that I think it incumbant on me to add to the account of facts and events what regards
<pb facs="unknown:015240_0007_0FA3717DB54A97E8"/>the manners and cuſtoms of nations; becauſe theſe ſhew their genues and character, which we may call, in ſome meaſure, the ſoul of hiſtory."</p>
            <p>NOW it may well be ſuppoſed, that men who are ſtriving for more power over others than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, will not nor cannot, ſet either their own or their opponants genues and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in their juſt light. And if it ſhould be found, that near all the hiſtories of this country which are much known, have been written by perſons who thought themſelves inveſted with power to act as lawgivers and judges for their neighbours, under the name either of orthodoxy, or of immediate power from heaven, the inference will be ſtrong, that our affairs have never been ſet in ſo clear light as they ought to be; and if this is not indeed the caſe I am greatly miſtaken, of which the following account will enable the reader to judge for himſelf.</p>
            <p>THE greateſt objection that I have heard againſt this deſign is, that we ought not to take up the aſhes of our good fathers, nor to rehearſe thoſe old controverſies, which will tend to increaſe our preſent difficulties. But what is meant by this objection? To reveal ſecrets, or to repeat matters that have been well ſettled, between perſons or parties is forbidden, and its affects are very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; but what is that to a hiſtory of public facts, and an examination of the principles and conduct, both of oppreſſors, and of the oppreſſed?</p>
            <p>MEN who are ſtill fond of arbitary power may make the above objection; but a learned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genous pedobaptiſt that felt the effects of ſuch power, lately ſaid, "The preſbyterians, I confeſs formerly copied too nearly the epiſcopalians. The genuine principles of univerſal and impartial liberty were very little underſtood by any; and all parties
<pb facs="unknown:015240_0008_0FA3717DCEA9F7A0"/>were too much involved in the guilt of intollerance and perſecution. The diſſenters in our times freely acknowledge this, and condemn the narrow prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or many of their predeceſſors; having no objection to tranſmitting down to poſterity, in them true colours, the acts of oppreſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerance of which all ſects have been guilty. Not indeed, as is ſometimes done, with a view of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging ſuch conduct in one party by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others; but of expoſing it alike in all, and preventing it wholly, if poſſible, in time to come."<note n="*" place="bottom">F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For as every one is orthodox to himſelf, they who have oppreſſed others, have always denied it. After our baptiſt fathers in Boſton, had been greatly injured for 15 years, they publiſhed a vindication of their character; but as to their other ſufferings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with ſaying, "Some of us were often-times brought before councils and courts, threatened, fined, our eſtates taken away, impriſoned and baniſhed;" a noted miniſter called their vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, a <hi>fallacious</hi> narrative, and ſaid, "Errors lie in generals, a particular account might have been more ſatisfying."<note n="†" place="bottom">Willard's <hi>Ne ſator.</hi> p. 10.</note> Here therefore are a great number of particulars with good vouches to ſupport them; which ſhew that oppreſſion on religious accounts was not of the firſt principles of New-England, but was an intruder that came in afterward.</p>
            <p>WHEN I was requeſted by ſeveral gentlemen of note and others, to undertake this work, two great objections preſented themſelves to my mind againſt it; namely, my great unfitneſs for it, and the difficulty of obtaining the neceſſary materials. But their importunity prevailed againſt the firſt, and divine providence has removed, the other, by
<pb facs="unknown:015240_0009_0FA3717E89718AA0"/>conveying into my hands a variety of authentic materials, much beyond what I conceived could have now been obtained in the world. Many of them I have taken from the ancient records of the colonies of Plymouth, Maſſachuſetts, Providence and Rhode-Iſland, as well as the records of the united colonies: though I regret the want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquaintance with the two latter, before the firſt two hundred pages of our hiſtory were printed off. Many other records have alſo been ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and I would now retunr my public thanks to the ſeveral gentlemen who are keepers of them, for the candid and kind treatment they have ſhewn on this occaſion. A great variety of other manuſcripts have been ſervicable to me, whereof Mr. Hubbard's hiſtory, and extracts from gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Winthrop's journal are not the leaſt. It is to be noted, that only the word Hubbard in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing quotations refers to that hiſtory, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction from another valuable collection, of which take the following account. Mr. Samuel Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard came over to Salem in 1633, in his youth; joined to Watertown church in 1635; but went the ſame year up to Windfor, where he ſoon married a church-member that removed from Dorcheſter, and they ſettled at Weathersfield; till in May 1639 they removed to Springfield, and he was one of the five men who firſt joined in found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that church. It was conſtituted under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectient government, but falling afterward into the Maſſachuſetts, he removed in 1647 to Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. Though he ſays, "God having enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but moſtly my wife, into his holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of baptizing only viſible believers; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing zealous for it, ſhe was moſtly ſtruck at, and anſwered twice publicly, where I was alſo ſaid to be as bad as ſhe, and threatened with impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="unknown:015240_0010_0FA3717F4B497720"/>to Hartford goal, if we did not renounce it or remove. That ſcripture came into our minds, if they perſecute you in one place, ſlee to another." Whereupon they removed to Newport, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to elder Clarke's church there on Nov. 3. 1648, where they lived to old age; from whence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly viſited his ſuffering brethren at Boſton, and had an extenſive correſpondance both in Europe and America; and he copied ſeveral hundred of his own and other letters into a book, which I am now favoured with; containing a fund of intelligence, from 1641 to 1688. The writings and papers alſo of our elders, Holmes, Comer, Callander and others have been uſeful in this deſign. Though, for want of room I have been forced to leave a great many valuable arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles out of this volume, and to give but a ſketch of things in latter times. However I propoſe by divine leave to preſerve and digeſt them in the beſt manner I can, for the uſe of theſe who may come after us; and ſhould be glad to obtain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the riſe, progreſs and preſent ſtate of all our churches, for the ſame end.</p>
            <p>IN the following work, Plymouth Regiſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends an account of their church from its begining, wrote by our county regiſter, and annexed to Mr. Robbin's ordination ſermon 1760. The hiſtory of Providence means what was publiſhed of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in their Gazette in 1765. Perhaps the reſt of my authorities are ſufficiently deſcribed. So great a part of this hiſtory is given in the words of others, that continued marks of quotation would have been tedious; therefore many paſſages only begin and end therewith. In the excellent letter you have in page 390—395, I have marked the words which were neceſſarily ſupplied to compleat the ſenſe; but though I have as ſtrictly kept to the true ſenſe in

               <head>CHAP.I. The Sentiments and Character of the firſt Planters of this Country, with their Proceedings down to the Year 1634.</head>
               <p>TO obtain clear and juſt ideas of the affairs of the Baptiſts in New-England, it ſeems neceſſary for us to look back to its firſt ſettlement, and carefully to examine what were the ſentiments and character of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal planters. Thoſe that began the firſt colony were called Separatiſts, becauſe of their withdraw from the national church of England; and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parties have accuſed them with <hi>rigidneſs</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but ingenuous minds will not chooſe to be turned off with hard names, without knowing what is meant by them, therefore let us hear thoſe fathers tell their
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:015240_0013_0FA371818A274DE0"/>own ſtory. They ſeparated from the national church near the beginning of th laſt century, and formed ſocieties for worſhip by themſelves; till, after ſuffering much from the ruling party in their native country, they left it, and ſojourned about twelve years in Holland, and then removed to this land.</p>
               <p>ABOUT the time of their ſteeing into Holland, Mr. Richard Bernard, an Epiſcopal miniſter in Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire, out of which many of thoſe fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, publiſhed a book againſt them, which he called <hi>The Separatiſt's Schiſm.</hi> unto which Mr. John Robinſon, the paſtor of the church which afterward began the ſettlement of New-England, publiſhed an anſwer in 1610, intituled, <hi>A Juſtification of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Church of England.</hi> As I am fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with this performance, containing 476 pages in quarto, I ſhall from thence give the reader his own words upon the moſt material points of their controverſy, and the rather, becauſe the writings of that eminent father of our country are very little known at this day among us.</p>
               <p>MR. Bernard began his book with ſome things which he called <hi>Chriſtian Counſels of Peace,</hi> to which Mr. Robinſon anſwers, that, "As God is the God of peace, ſo are not they God's children which deſire it not; yea, even in the midſt of their contentions. But as all vices uſe to cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the habits of virtues, that under their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries they may get countenance, and find the more free paſſage in the world, ſo eſpecially in the church all tyranny and confuſion do preſent themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this colour, taking up the politic pretence of peace, as a weapon of mere advantage, wherewith the ſtronger and greater party uſeth to beat the weaker. The Papiſts preſs the Proteſtants with the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:015240_0014_0FA3718247902070"/>peace fo the church, and for the rent they have made in it, condemn them beyond the heatheniſh ſoldiers, which forbore to divide Chriſt's garments; as deeply do the biſhops charge the miniſters refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conformity and ſubſcription<note n="*" place="bottom">The main of thoſe who afterward ſettled the Maſſachuſetts colony were of this ſort; they refuſed full conformity to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional church, and yet condemned an entire ſeparation from it.</note>, and both of them us. But the godly wiſe muſt not be affrighted either from ſeeking or embracing the truth with ſuch bugs as theſe are, but ſeeing <hi>the wiſdom which is fom above, is firſt pure, then peaceable,</hi> he muſt make it a great part of his Chriſtain wiſdom to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt godly and gracious peace, and that which is either pretended for advantage, or miſtaken by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and ſo labour to hold peace in purity. Let it then be manifeſted unto us, that the communion which the church of England hath with all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the land, without ſeparation, is a pure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; that their ſervice book, deviſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in ſo many words and letters, to be read over and over with all the appurtenances, is a pure worſhip; that their government by national provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and dioceſan biſhops, according to their canons, is a pure government, and then let us be blamed if we hold not peace with them in word and deed; otherwiſe, though they ſpeak unto us never ſo oft, both by meſſengers and mouth of peace, and again of peace, as Jehoram did to Jehu, yet muſt we anſwer them in effect as Jehu did Jehoram, what peace, whilſt the whoredoms of the mother of fornications, the Jezebel of Rome, do remain in ſo great number amongſt them? And I doubt not but Mr. Bernard, and a thouſand more miniſters in the land (were they ſecure of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate's ſword, and might they go on with good
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015240_0015_0FA3718307523CB0"/>licence) would wholly ſhake off their canonical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their ordinaries, and neglect their cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and cenſures, and refuſe to ſue in their counts, for all the peace of the church which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to us for ſo ſacred a thing. Could they but obtain licence from the magiſtrate to uſe the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they are perſuaded Chriſt hath given them, they would ſoon ſhake off the prelates yoke, and draw no longer under the ſame in ſpiritual communion with all the prophane in the land, but would break thoſe bonds of iniquity, as eaſily as Sampſon did the cords wherewith Dalilah tyed him, and give good reaſons alſo from the word of God for their ſo doing." p. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>WHOEVER reads and well obſerves the hiſtory of the Maſſachuſetts colony, I believe, will find that thoſe remarks were neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>thuſiaſtical nor cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, but that they diſcover great knowledge, and a good judgment both in human and divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. Mr. Robinſon proceeds and ſays, "Theſe things I thought good to commend to the reader, that he may be the more cautious of this and the like colourable pretences, wiſhing him alſo well to remember, that peace in diſobedience is that old theme of the falſe prophets, whereby they flattered the mighty, and deceived the ſimple, Jer. vi. 14, and viii. 11.—In the church of England we do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge many excellent truths of doctrine, which we alſo teach without commixture of error, many chriſtian ordinances which we alſo practiſe being purged from the pollution of antichriſt, and for the godly perſons in it (could we poſſibly ſeparate them with both arms; but being taught by the apoſtle, ſpeaking but of one wicked perſon, and of one Jewiſh ordinance, that <hi>a little leaven leaveneth the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015240_0016_0FA37183C7AE81C8"/>whole lump,</hi> 1 Cor. v. 6, Gal. v. 2—9, we cannot be ignorant how ſour the Engliſh aſſemblies muſt needs be: Neither may we juſtly be blamed though we dare not dip in their meal, leſt we be ſoured by their leaven." p. 15, 16. And to Mr. B. who counſels that we ſhould <hi>bear with lighter faults for a time, till fit occaſion be offered to have them amended,</hi> he replies, "1. No ſin is light in itſelf, but being continued in and countenanced, deſtroyeth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Matt. v. 19. 2. It is the property of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and hardened heart evermore to extenuate and leſſen ſins. 3. Though the bearing and forbearing, not only of ſmall but even of great ſins alſo, muſt be for a time, yet it muſt be but for a time, and that is whilſt reformation be orderly ſought and procured, Lev. xix. 17. But what time hath wrought in the church of England, all men ſee growing daily, by the juſt judgment of God, from evil to worſe, and being never aforetime ſo impatient either of reformation or other good as at this day. 4. A man muſt ſo bear evil, as he be no way acceſſory unto it, by forbearing any means appointed by Chriſt for the amending it." p. 16.</p>
               <p>"I SEE not upon what occaſion the author ſhould ſhuffle into this controverſy, which is merely eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, ſuch conſiderations as he doth concerning the frame and alteration of <hi>civil ſtates,</hi> except he would either inſinuate againſt us, that we went about to alter the civil ſtate of the kingdom; or, at leaſt, that the alteration of the ſtate eccleſiaſtical, muſt needs draw with it the alteration of the civil ſtate; with which note the prelates have a long time bleared the eyes of the magiſtrates, but how deceitfully, hath been ſufficiently manifeſted, and offer made further to manifeſt the ſame by ſolemn diſputation. And the truth is, that all ſtates and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015240_0017_0FA3718489595F20"/>policies which are of God, whether monarchical, ariſtocratical or democratical, or how mixed ſoever, are capable of Chriſt's government. Neither doth the nature of the ſtate, but the corruption of the perſons, hinder the ſame in one or other.—And where Mr. Bernard further adviſeth, rather to offend many private perſons than one lawful magiſtrate, I doubt not he gives no worſe counſel than he himſelf follows, who (except I be much deceived in him) had rather offend half the private perſons in the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe, than one archbiſhop, though he be an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful magiſtrate. But let us remember our care be not to offend the Lord, and if with the offence of a private perſon, though never ſo baſe, be joined the offence of the Lord, better offend all, both lawful and unlawful magiſtrates, in the world, than ſuch a <hi>little one,</hi> Matt. xviii. 6." p. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER piece of counſel given by Mr. B. is, <hi>Uſe the preſent good which thou mayeſt enjoy to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and an experienced good, before thou doſt trouble thyſelf to ſeek for a ſuppoſed better good, untried, which thou enjoyeſt not.</hi> To this Mr. R. ſays, "We may not ſtint or circumſcribe either our knowledge, faith, or obedience, within ſtraiter bounds than the whole revealed will of God, in the knowledge and obedience whereof we muſt daily increaſe and edify ourſelves; much leſs muſt we ſuffer ourſelves to be ſtripped of any <hi>liberty</hi> which Chriſt our lord hath purchaſed for us, and given us to uſe for our good, Gal. v. 1. And here, as I take it, comes in the caſe of many hundreds in the church of England, who what good they may enjoy (that is ſafely enjoy, or without any great bodily danger) that they uſe very fully. Where the ways of Chriſt lie open for them, by the authority of men, and where they may walk ſafely with good leave, there they walk
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015240_0018_0FA371854A4D6BB0"/>very uprightly, and that a round pace; but when the commandments of Chriſt are as it were hedged up with thorns, by mens prohibitions, there they foully <hi>ſtep aſide, and pitch their tents by the flocks of his fellows,</hi> Cant. i. 6." p. 23. Again Mr. B. ſays, <hi>Never preſume to reform others, before thou haſt well ordered thyſelf.</hi> To which Mr. Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon anſwers, "True zeal it is certain ever begins at home, and gives more liberty unto other men than it dares aſſume unto itſelf; and there is nothing more true, and neceſſary to be conſidered, than that every man ought to order himſelf in his own ſteps firſt. That is good and the beſt, but not all; for if by God's commandment we ought to <hi>bring back our enemy's ox or aſs that ſtrayeth,</hi> how much more to bring into order our brother's ſoul and body, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in by-paths?" p. 24.</p>
               <p>MR. Bernard went on to lay down a number of things, which he ſuppoſed would render it very unlikely that a ſeparation from them could be right, before he came to the merits of the cauſe; as 1. <hi>The novelty thereof differing from all the beſt reformed churches in Chriſtendom.</hi> To which Mr. Robinſon replies, "It is no novelty to hear men plead cuſtom, when they want truth. So the heathen philoſopher reproached Paul as <hi>a bringer of new doctrine,</hi> Act. xvii. 19. So do the Papiſts diſcountenance the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and profeſſion of the church of England; yea even at this day, very many of the people in the land call Popery the old law, and the profeſſion there made the new law. But for our parts, as we believe, by the word of God, that the things we teach are not new, but old truths renewed; ſo are we no leſs perſuaded, that the church conſtitution, in which we are ſet, is caſt in the apoſtolical and primitive mould, and not one day nor hour younger,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015240_0019_0FA3718607CA4B10"/>in the nature and form of it, than the firſt church of the new teſtament." p. 40. 2. <hi>For that it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo much with the ancient Schiſmatics, condemned in former ages by holy and learned men.</hi> Anſwer, "Can our way both be a novelty, and yet agree ſo well with ancient Schiſmatics? Contraries cannot be both true, but may both be falſe, as theſe are." p. 42. Mr. Robinſon tells us, that another article which Mr. B. alledged againſt them is, <hi>That we have not the approbation of any of the reformed churches for our courſe.</hi> Anſwer, "This is the ſame in ſubſtance with the firſt, and that which followeth in the next place the ſame with them both; and Mr. B. by ſo ordinarily preſſing us with human teſtimonies, ſhews himſelf to be very barren of divine authority. Nature teacheth every creature, in all danger, to fly firſt and ofteneſt to the chief inſtruments either of offence or defence, wherein it truſteth, as the bull to his horn, the boar to his tuſk, and the bird unto her wing; right ſo this man ſhews wherein his ſtrength lies, and wherein he truſts moſt, by ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and uſual ſhaking the horn, and whetting the tuſk, of mortal man's authority againſt us. But for the reformed churches the truth is, they neither do imagine, nor will eaſily be brought to believe, that the frame of the church of England ſtands as it doth. The approbation which they give, is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſuch general truths of doctrine, as wherein we alſo, for the moſt part, acknowledge you; which notwithſtanding you deny in a great meaſure in the particulars and practice. But touching the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and governing of the church, which are the main heads controverted betwixt you and us; they give you not ſo much as the left hand of fellowſhip, but do, on the contrary, turn
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015240_0020_0FA37186C74A39E8"/>their backs upon you." p. 46, 47<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>"The ways of the church of England, wherein we forſake her, do directly and <hi>ex diametro</hi> croſs and thwart the ways of the reformed churches, in theſe three main heads:
<list>
                           <item>"1. Thereformed churches are gathered of a free people, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together by voluntary profeſſion, without compulſion of human laws.

                           <item>"2. The reformed churches do renounce the miniſtry of the church of England, as ſhe doth theirs; not admitting of any by virtue of it to charge of ſouls, as they ſpeak, where, on the contrary, all the maſs-prieſts made in Queen Mary's days, which would ſay their book-ſervice in Engliſh, were continued miniſters by the ſame <hi>ordination</hi> which they received from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh prelates.</hi>

                           <item>"3. The government by Archbiſhops, Lord Biſhops and their ſubſtitutes, in the church of England, is abhorred and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in the reformed churches as antichriſtian; as is, on the contrary, the Preſbyterian government, in uſe there, by the church of England refuſed, as <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> and ſeditious." p. 52.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we may ſee how the very name of Anabaptiſt was uſed as a weapon to fight againſt reformation in Mr. Robinſon's day, and the practice is ſtill followed by many.</p>
                  </note>. Thus much of the learned abroad; in the next place Mr. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard draws us to the learned at home, from whoſe diſlike of us he takes his fifth likelihood, which he thus frameth: <hi>The condemnation of this way by our divines, both living and dead, againſt whom, either for godlineſs of life or truth of doctrine, otherwiſe than for being their oppoſites, they can take no exception.</hi>" To which Mr. Robinſon anſwers, "No marvel: We may not admit of parties for judges: How is it poſſible we ſhould be approved of them in the things wherein we witneſs againſt them? And if this argument be good and likely, then is it likely that neither the Reformiſts have the truth in the church of England, nor the prelates; for there are many of thoſe both godly and learned, which in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015240_0021_0FA3718787D36B00"/>their differences do oppoſe, and that very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, the one the other. Now, as for my own part, I do willingly acknowledge the learning and godlineſs of moſt of the perſons named by Mr. B. and honor the memory of ſome of them; ſo neither do I think them ſo learned, but they might err, nor ſo godly, but in their error they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the truth they ſaw not. I do confeſs to the glory of God, and mine own ſhame, that a long time before I entered this way, I took ſome taſte of the truth in it by ſome treatiſes publiſhed in juſtification of it, which were ſweet as honey unto my mouth; and the principal thing which for the time quenched all further appetite in me, was the over-valuation which I made of the learning and holineſs of theſe and the like perſons, bluſhing in myſelf to have a thought of preſſing one hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth before them in this thing, behind whom I knew myſelf to come ſo many miles in all other things; yea and even of late times, when I had entered into a more ſerious conſideration of theſe things, and, according to the meaſure of grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſearched the ſcriptures, whether they were ſo or no, and by ſearching found much light and truth, yet was the ſame ſo dimmed and overcloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the contradictions of theſe men, and others of the like note, that had not the truth been in my heart as a burning fire ſhut up in my bones, Jer. xx. 9, I had never broken thoſe bonds of fleſh and blood, but had ſuffered the light of God to have been put out in my unthankful heart, by other mens darkneſs.</p>
               <p>"EVERY man ſtands bound to give this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the graces of God in other men, that in his differences with them he be not ſuddenly nor eaſily perſuaded, but that being jealous of his own

But on the other ſide, for a man ſo far to ſuffer his thoughts to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured into the circle of any man or mens judgment, as either to fear to try what is offered to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the balance of the ſanctuary, or finding it to bear weight, to fear to give ſentence on the Lord's ſide, yea though it be againſt the mighty, this is to honor men above God, and to advance a throne above the throne of Chriſt, who is Lord and King for ever. And to ſpeak that in this caſe, which by doleful experience I myſelf have found, many of the moſt forward profeſſors in the kingdom are well nigh as ſuperſtitiouſly addicted to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of their guides and teachers, as the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Papiſts unto theirs; accounting it not only needleſs curioſity, but even intolerable arrogancy, to call in queſtion the things received from them by tradition. But how much better were it for all men to lay aſide theſe and the like prejudices, that ſo they might underſtand the things which concern their peace, and ſeeing with their own eyes, might live by their own faith?</p>
               <p>"AND for theſe famous men named by Mr. B. (with whoſe oppoſitions, as with Zedekiah's horns of iron, he would puſh us here and every where) as we bear their reproofs with patience, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their worth without envy or detraction, ſo do we know they were but men, and through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frailty might be abuſed as well, or rather as ill, to ſupport antichriſt in a meaſure, as others before them have been, though godly and learned as they.

Eſpecially conſidering that as his riſing was not, ſo neither could his fall be perfected at once.

                  </note>? We then being taught, and believing that the word
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015240_0024_0FA37189CC53CEB8"/>of God is a light and lanthorn, not only to our <hi>eyes,</hi> but to our <hi>feet</hi> and <hi>paths,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, Pſal. cxix. 105, cannot poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how we ſhould juſtly be blamed by theſe men for obſerving the ordinances which themſelves not only acknowledged, but contended for, as appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt to be kept inviolable till his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſome of them have expreſly teſtified.</p>

               <p>BY theſe free and plain declarations the reader may be able to judge, whether the reproach of <hi>rigidneſs</hi> properly belongs to Mr. Robinſon, or to his accuſers and perſecutors; yet becauſe he would not ſtay in the church of England, when he was convinced of its being wrong ſo to do, Mr. Bernard accuſes him and his brethren of either <hi>denying their converſion</hi> there, or elſe of accounting it a <hi>falſe one.</hi> To which Mr. R. anſwers, "For our perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in the church of England, we deny it not, but do, and always have done, judge and profeſs it true there; and ſo was Luther's converſion true in the church of Rome, elſe could not his ſeparation

               <p>AND now for <hi>particular</hi> ſentiments about church affairs; Mr. Robinſon's opponent had ſaid, <hi>The word is the conſtitution of the church.</hi> To which he replies, "His meaning is or ſhould be, that the word is the ordinary means for collecting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the church of God. I grant it: But how conſidered? Not the word in mens bibles alone, for then all the heretics in the world were true churches; nor yet the word preached ſimply, for Paul preached the word to the ſcoffing Athenians, and to the blaſphemous Jews, yet I think he will not ſay that either the one or the other were churches truly conſtituted. How then? The word publiſhed, underſtood, believed and obeyed, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly at the leaſt, as the ſpiritual ſword or axe, hewing the ſtones in the rock, and the trees in the foreſt, and preparing them to be Lord's ſpiritual houſe. And thus much the very places produced by Mr. B. do evidently declare.</p>
               <p>"MATT. xxviii. 19, which is the firſt place, ſhews, that ſuch as by preaching of the word were <hi>made diſciples,</hi> for ſo much the word importeth, were to be gathered into the church and baptized. Mark xvi. 15, ſhews the ſame, eſpecially if you add verſe 16, infering that men by preaching muſt believe, and ſo believe, as they have the promiſe of <hi>ſalvation.</hi> 2 Cor. v. 19, and xi. 2, prove that the word of reconciliation and miniſtry of the goſpel, believed and obeyed to the forgiveneſs of ſins, and to the preparation and ſanctification of the church of Chriſt, is the means of gathering and building up the ſame. Acts ii. 14, 37, 38, 41, and xvi. 32—34, are of the ſame nature, and do prove that ſundry of the Jews at Jeruſalem, by Peter's preaching, and that the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015240_0026_0FA3718B49B67B10"/>gaoler's houſhold at Philippi, by Paul's preaching, were brought to repentance, and faith in Chriſt, and ſo added to the church; but what will be the concluſion of all theſe premiſes? the propoſition is this: " The true apoſtolic churches having a true conſtitution, were gathered and conſtituted of ſuch men and women as by the preaching of the goſpel were made diſciples, had faith and repentance wrought in them, to the obtaining of the forgiveneſs of ſins, and promiſe of life eternal, and to ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obedience." p. 89, 90.</p>
               <p>OF <hi>baptiſm</hi> Mr. Robinſon ſays, "The proper ends and uſes of baptiſm are to initiate the parties baptized into the church of Chriſt, and to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate them to his ſervice, and ſo to ſerve for badges of chriſtianity, by which it is diſtinguiſhed from all other profeſſions, Matt. xxviii. 19, 1 Cor. xii. 13." p. 26. "The ſacrament of baptiſm is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered by Chriſt's appointment, and the apoſtles example, only to ſuch as are, externally, and ſo far as men can judge, taught and made diſciples; do receive the word gladly, Acts ii. 41; believe and ſo profeſs, Acts viii. have received the holy ghoſt, Acts x. 47, and to their ſeed, Acts ii. 39, 1 Cor. vii. 14." p. 92. "Baptiſm adminiſtered to any others is ſo far from inveſting them with any ſaintſhip in that eſtate, that it makes guilty both the giver and receiver of ſacrilege, and is the taking of God's name in vain." p. 110.</p>
               <p>OF the <hi>Lord's ſupper</hi> he ſays, "The apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1 Cor. x. 16, that the bread and wine in the ſupper are the communion of the body and blood of Chriſt, that is, effectual pledges of our conjunction and incorporation with Chriſt, and one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And in ver. 17, that all which eat of one bread or one loaf, are one myſtical body. This place
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015240_0027_0FA3718C0BE10FB8"/>alone, if Mr. B. and his fellow miniſters would ſeriouſly conſider, and ſet themſelves faithfully to obſerve, they would rather offer their own bodies to be torn in pieces by wild beaſts, than the holy myſteries of Chriſt's body to be prophaned as they are." p. 92.</p>
               <p>OF the <hi>keys,</hi> Matt. xvi. 18, 19, he ſays, "It is granted by all ſides that Chriſt gave unto Peter the keys of the kingdom, that is, the power to remit and retain ſins declaratively, as they ſpeak, as alſo that in what reſpect this power was given to Peter, in the ſame reſpect it was, and is, given to ſuch as ſucceed Peter; but the queſtion is, in what reſpect or conſideration this power ſpoken of was delegated to him? The Papiſt affirms it was given to Peter as the prince of the apoſtles, and ſo to the Biſhops of Rome, as Peter's ſucceſſors, and thus they ſtabliſh the Pope's primacy. The prelates ſay nay, but unto Peter an apoſtle, that is, a chief officer of the church, and ſo to us, as chief officers ſucceeding him. Others affirm it to belong to Peter here as a miniſter of the word and ſacraments, and the like, and ſo conſequently to all other miniſters of the goſpel equally, which ſucceed Peter in thoſe and the like adminiſtrations. But we, for our parts, do believe and profeſs that this promiſe is not made to Peter in any of theſe reſpects, nor to any office, order, eſtate, dignity or degree in the church or world, but to the confeſſion of faith, which Peter made by way of anſwer to Chriſt's queſtion; <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the ſon of the living God.</hi> To this Chriſt replies, <hi>Bleſſed art thou; thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church; I will give unto thee the keys,</hi> &amp;c. So that the building of the church is upon the rock of Peter's confeſſion, that is, Chriſt whom he confeſſed. This faith is the foundation
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015240_0028_0FA3718CC95991E8"/>of the church; againſt this faith the gates of hell ſhall not prevail; this faith hath the keys of the kingdom of heaven; what this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith ſhall looſe or bind on earth, is bound and looſed in heaven. Thus the Proteſtant divines, when they deal againſt the Pope's ſupremacy, do generally expound this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now it followeth, that whatſoever perſon hath received the ſame <hi>precious faith</hi> with Peter, as all the faithful have, 2 Pet. i. 1, that perſon hath a part in this gift of Chriſt. Whoſoever doth confeſs, publiſh, manifeſt or make known Jeſus to be the Chriſt, the ſon of the living God, and Saviour of the world, that perſon opens heaven's gates, looſeth ſin, and partakes with Peter in the uſe of the keys; and hereupon it followeth neceſſarily, that one faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, yea, or woman either, may as truly and effectually looſe and bind, both in heaven and earth, as all the miniſters in the world." p. 149, 150.</p>
               <p>"BUT here I know the lordly clergy, like the bulls of Baſhan, will roar loud upon me, as ſpeaking things intolerably derogatory to the dignity of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and it may be ſome others alſo, either through ignorance or ſuperſtition, will take offence at this ſpeech, as confounding all things; but there is no ſuch cauſe of exception. For howſoever the keys be one and the ſame in nature and efficacy, in what faithful man or mens hands ſoever, as not depending either upon the number or excellency of any perſons, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt alone; yet is it ever to be remembered, that the order and manner of uſing them is very different.</p>

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>theſe keys to uſe in all churches, yea, in all nations upon earth: Ordinary elders for their particular flocks, Act. xiv. 23, and xx. 28. Laſtly, there is an uſe of the keys publicly to be had, and an uſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately; an uſe of them by one perſon ſeverally, and an uſe of them by the whole church jointly, and together; an uſe of them miniſterially, or in office, and an uſe of them out of office: But the power of the goſpel, which is the keys, is ſtill one and the ſame, notwithſtanding the diverſe manner of uſing it." p. 151.</p>
               <p>"IF the keys of the kingdom of heaven be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated unto the officers, then can there be no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, nor ſalvation, without officers; for there is no entrance into heaven but by the door. Without the key the door cannot be opened: So then belike, if either there be no officers in the church (as it may eaſily come to paſs in ſome extreme plague or perſecution) and muſt needs be in the churches of Chriſt in our days, either in their firſt planting, or firſt calling out of Babylon; for Antichriſt's maſs-prieſthood is not eſſentially Chriſt's true miniſtry, or if the officers <hi>take away the key of knowledge,</hi> as the Scribes and Phariſees did, and will <hi>neither enter themſelves nor ſuffer them that would;</hi> then muſt the miſerable multitude be content to be ſhut out and periſh eternally, for ought is known to the contrary.

Miſerable were the Lord's people,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015240_0030_0FA3718E4A325618"/>if theſe things were ſo; but the truth is, they are miſerable guides that ſo teach.</p>
               <p>"THEY which may forgive ſins and ſinners, ſave ſouls, gain and turn men unto the Lord, to them are the keys of the kingdom given, by which they open the door unto ſuch as they thus forgive, gain and ſave: But all theſe things, ſuch as are not miniſters may do, as theſe ſcriptures, which I intreat the godly reader to conſider, do moſt clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, Matt. xviii. 15.2 Cor. v. 7—10. Act. viii. 1, 4. with xi. 19—21. Jam. v. 19, 20.1 Pet. iii. 1. Jude xxii. 23. Erroneous, therefore, and derogatory is it to the nature of the goſpel, and free donation of Chriſt, thus to impropriate and engroſs the keys, which lie common to all chriſtians in their place and order." p. 152, 153.</p>
               <p>CONCERNING <hi>ordination</hi> Mr. Robinſon obſerves, "That the officers of the church are the <hi>ſervants</hi> of the church; and their <hi>office</hi> a <hi>ſerice of the Lord, and of his church,</hi> Matt. x 25, 26, 27.2 Cor. iv. 5. Rom. xv. 31. Whereupon it followeth neceſſarily, that what power the officers have, the body of the church hath firſt." p. 411. "To theſe things I add, that what power any of the Pope's clergy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him, the ſame he takes from them, and deprives them of, where they withdraw their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or ſeparate from that church. For our better proceeding, I will firſt conſider what ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is; and ſecondly how far the brethren may go by the ſcriptures, and the neceſſary conſequences drawn from them, in this and the like caſes, in the firſt planting of churches, or in reducing of them into order, in or after ſome general confuſion. The prelates, and thoſe which level by their line, highly advance ordination far above the adminiſtration of the word, ſacrament and prayer; making it, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015240_0031_0FA3718F09088FA0"/>the power of excommunication, the two incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable prerogatives of a Biſhop above an ordinary miniſter. But ſurely herein theſe chief miniſters do not ſucceed the chief miniſters, the apoſtles, except as darkneſs ſucceeds light, and Antichriſt's confuſion Chriſt's order. Where the apoſtles were ſent out by Chriſt, there was no mention of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; their charge was, <hi>go teach all nations, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them;</hi> and that the apoſtles accounted preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their principal work, and after it baptiſm and prayer, the ſcriptures manifeſt, Act. vi. 4, 1 Cor. 1.17." p. 412.</p>
               <p>"ORDINATION doth depend upon the people's lawful election, as an effect upon the cauſe, by virtue of which it is juſtly adminiſtred, and may be thus deſcribed, or conſidered of us; as the admiſſion of or putting into poſſeſſion a perſon lawfully elected into a true office of miniſtry.—The right unto their office they have by election, the poſſeſſion by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with the ceremony of impoſition of hands, The apoſtle Peter, advertiſing the <hi>diſciples or bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> that one (fitted as there noted) was in the room of Judas to be made a witneſs, with the eleven apoſtles, of the reſurrection of Chriſt, when two were by <hi>them preſented,</hi> did with the reſt preſent them two and none other <hi>to the Lord,</hi> that he, by the immediate direction of the <hi>lot,</hi> might ſhew whether of them two he had choſen, Act. i.—In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>the twelve</hi> being to inſtitute the office of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conry in the church at Jeruſalem, called the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the diſciples together,</hi> and informed them what manner of perſons they were to chooſe; which choice being made by the brethren accordingly, and they ſo choſen preſented to the apoſtles, they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ordained them, by virtue of the election made by the brethren.

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015240_0032_0FA3718FC8FADBD0"/>Paul and Barnabas (being thereunto called by the holy ghoſt) did paſs from church to church, and from place to place, and in every church where they came did ordain them elders by the <hi>people's election,</hi> ſignified by their <hi>lifting up of hands,</hi> as the word is, and as the uſe was in popular elections, throughout thoſe countries, Act. xiii. 2, and xiv. 23.—The judgment and plea (when they deal with us) of the moſt forward men in the land, in this caſe, I may not omit; which is, that they renounce and diſclaim their ordination by the prelates, and hold their miniſtry by the people's acceptation. Now if the acceptation of a mixt company, under the prelates government (as is the beſt pariſh aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the kingdom) whereof the greateſt part have by the revealed will of God no right to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, miniſtry, or other holy things, be ſufficient to make a miniſter, then much more the acceptation of the people with us, being all of them jointly, and every one of them ſeverally, by the mercy of God, capable of the Lord's ordinances<note n="*" place="bottom">

The officers, being the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the church, are to execute the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the church under the Lord—Ordination is properly the execution of election." p. 413—15.</p>
               <p>"THE apoſtle Paul writes to the churches of Galatia to reject, as <hi>accurſed,</hi> ſuch miniſters whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as ſhould preach otherwiſe than they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>received:</hi> And the ſame apoſtle writes to the church of Coloſſe, to admoniſh Archippus to take heed to his miniſtry.

Now as theſe things did firſt and principally concern the officers, who were in theſe and all other things of the ſame nature to go before and govern the people; ſo are the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in their places intereſted in the ſame buſineſs and charge: Neither could the officers ſin (if they ſhould have been corrupt or negligent) diſcharge the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015240_0034_0FA371914A1256B0"/>people of their duty in the things which concerned them; but they were bound notwithſtanding to ſee the commandments of the apoſtles, and of the Lord Jeſus by them, executed accordingly. And if the people be in caſes, and when their officers fail, thus ſolemnly to examine, admoniſh, ſilence, and ſuppreſs their teachers, being faulty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound; then are they alſo by proportion, where officers fail, to elect, appoint, ſet up and over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch fit perſons as the Lord affordeth them, for their furtherance of faith and ſalvation." p. 417, 418.</p>
               <p>AGAINST this doctrine many objections have been raiſed; the chief of which are about the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's inſtability, and its tendency to confuſion. In anſwer to which, Mr. Robinſon reminds his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that though his ignorant people had readily changed their religion with their Prince, even back to Popery in Mary's days; yet, "The prelates and prieſts were as unſtable as the reſt, yea their ringleaders. But, ſays he, for experience in this our popularity, as you term it, I tell you, that if ever I ſaw the beauty of Sion, and the glory of the Lord filling his tabernacle, it hath been in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the divers graces of God in the church, in that heavenly harmony, and comely order, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the grace of God we are ſet and walk; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if your eyes had but ſeen the brethren's ſober and modeſt carriage one towards another, their humble and willing ſubmiſſion unto their guides in the Lord, their tender compaſſion towards the weak, their fervent zeal againſt ſcandalous offenders, and their long-ſuffering towards all, you would, I am perſuaded, change your mind, and be compelled to take up your <hi>parable,</hi> and <hi>bleſs</hi> where you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>curſe.</hi>" p. 212. "For mine own part, knowing mine own infirmities, and that I am ſubject
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015240_0035_0FA3719209B48EE0"/>to ſin, yea and to frowardneſs in ſin, as much as the brethren are; if by mine office I ſhould be deprived of the remedy which they enjoy, that bleſſed ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the churches cenſures, I ſhould think mine office accurſed, and myſelf by it, as fruſtrating and diſappointing me of that main end for which the ſervants of Chriſt ought to join themſelves unto the church of Chriſt, furniſhed with his power for their reformation. As, on the contrary, God is my record, how, in the very writing of theſe things, my ſoul is filled with ſpiritual joy, that I am under this eaſy yoke of Chriſt, the cenſures of the church, and how much I am comforted in this conſideration, againſt my vile and corrupt nature, which, notwithſtanding, I am perſuaded the Lord will never ſo far ſuffer to rebel, as that it ſhall not be tamed and ſubdued by this ſtrong hand of God, without which it might every day and hour ſo hazard my ſalvation. That doctrine which advanceth an inferior and meaner ſtate in the church, above that which is ſuperior and the chief, that is unſound, and indeed ſerving in a degree for the <hi>exaltation of that man of ſin above all that is called God.</hi> But the doctrine of ſetting the elders without and above the judgments and cenſures of the church, doth advance an inferior above a ſuperior. The point I thus manifeſt:</p>
               <p>"THE order of kings is the higheſt order or eſtate in the church. But the order of <hi>ſaints</hi> is the order of <hi>kings,</hi> and we are kings as we are ſaints, not as we are officers. As the Lord Jeſus did prove againſt the Scribes and Phariſees, that the temple was greater than the gold, becauſe it ſanctified the gold, and that the altar was greater than the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it ſanctified the offering, ſo by propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the condition of a ſaint, which ſanctifieth the condition of an officer, is more excellent than it is,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015240_0036_0FA37192C9A7A630"/>To our ſaintſhip, and as we have faith, is promiſed the forgiveneſs of ſins, the favour of God, and life eternal, but not to our office, or in reſpect of it. The eſtate of a ſaint is moſt happy and bleſſed, though the perſon never ſo much as come near an office; but on the contrary, an officer, if he be not alſo and FIRST a ſaint, is a moſt wretched and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed creature." p. 216, 217.</p>
               <p>THE reader will not wonder that thoſe who were for national churches; and unconverted miniſters, diſcovered a ſtrong prejudice againſt ſuch writings as theſe; but how well do they agree with the apoſtles doctrine? 1 Cor. xii. 31, and xiii. 1—3, Gal. i.</p>
               <p>OF REFORMATION, Mr. Robinſon ſays to his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, "You ſpeak much of the reformation of your church after Popery. There was indeed a great reformation of things in your church; but very little o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the church, to ſpeak truly and properly. The people are the church; and to make a reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed church, there muſt be firſt a reformed people; and ſo they ſhould have been with you, by the <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of repentance from dead works, and faith in Chriſt;</hi> that the people, as the Lord ſhould have vouchſafed grace, being firſt fitted for, and made capable of, the ſacraments, and other ordinances, might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards have communicated in the pure uſe of them; for want of which, inſtead of a pure uſe, there hath been, and is at this day, a moſt prophane abuſe of them, to the great diſhonor of Chriſt and his goſpel, and to the hardening of thouſands in their impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. Others alſo endeavouring yet a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, have ſued and do ſue to Kings, and Queens, and Parliaments, for the rooting out of the prelacy, and with it, of ſuch other evil fruits as grow from that bitter root; and on the contrary, to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015240_0037_0FA3719388AD40A0"/>have the miniſtry, government and diſcipline of Chriſt ſet over the pariſhes as they ſtand; the firſt fruit of which reformation, if it were obtained, would be the prophanation of the more of God's ordinances upon ſuch, as to whom they appertained not; and ſo the further provocation of his Majeſty unto anger againſt all ſuch as ſo practiſed, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereunto. Is it not ſtrange that men, in the reforming of a church, ſhould almoſt, or altogether, forget the church, which is the people, or that they ſhould labour to crown Chriſt a King over a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe prophet he hath not firſt been? Or to ſet him to rule by his laws and officers, over the profeſſed ſubjects of Antichriſt and the devil! Is it poſſible that ever they ſhould ſubmit to the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſt, which have not firſt been prepared, in ſome meaſure, by his holy doctrine, and taught with meekneſs to ſtoop unto his yoke?" p. 300, 301.</p>
               <p>A MAIN plea for ſuch confuſion, both then and now, was and is drawn from the parable of the <hi>tares:</hi> But, ſays Mr. Robinſon, "Since the Lord Jeſus, who beſt knew his own meaning, calls the <hi>field the world,</hi> and makes <hi>the harveſt,</hi> which is the end of the field, the <hi>end of the world,</hi> and not of the church, why ſhould we admit of any other interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Neither is it like that Chriſt would in the expounding of one parable ſpeak another, as he ſhould have done, if, in calling the field the world, he had meant the church. As God then in the beginning made man good, and placed him in the field of the world, there to grow, where by the envy of the ſerpent he was ſoon corrupted, ſo ever ſince hath the ſeed of the ſerpent, ſtirred up by their father the devil, ſnarled at the heal of the woman's ſeed, and like noiſome tares vexed and peſtered
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015240_0038_0FA3719450216CD0"/>the good and holy ſeed; which though the children of God both ſee and feel to their pain, yet muſt they not therefore, forgetting <hi>what ſpirit they are of,</hi> preſently call for <hi>fire from heaven,</hi> nor prevent the Lord's hand, but wait his leiſure, either for the converting of theſe tares into wheat, which in many is daily ſeen, and then how great pity had it been they ſhould ſo untimely have been plucked up? Or for their final perdition in the day of the Lord, when the church ſhall be no more offended by them. And that the Lord Jeſus no way ſpeaks of the toleration of prophane perſons in the church, doth appear by theſe reaſons:
<list>
                     <item>1. BECAUSE he doth not contradict himſelf, by forbidding the uſe of the keys in one place, which in another he hath turned upon impenitent offenders, Matt. xviii.</item>

In the excommunication of ſinners apparently obſtinate, with due circumſpection, and in the ſpirit of wiſdom, meekneſs, and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with ſuch other general chriſtian virtues, as with which all our ſpecial ſacrifices ought to be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, what danger can there be of any ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the plucking up of the wheat with the tares, which the huſbandman feareth?</item>
                     <item>3. The Lord Jeſus ſpeaks of the utter ruinating and deſtruction of the tares—<hi>the plucking them up by the roots:</hi>—But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication rightly adminiſtred is not for the ruin and deſtruction of any, but for the ſalvation of the party thereby humbled, 1 Cor. v. 5.—The Lord's field is ſown only with <hi>good ſeed</hi>—his church <hi>ſaints beloved of God,</hi> all and every one of them, though by the malice of Satan, and negligence of ſuch as ſhould keep this field, vineyard and houſe of God, adulterated ſeed, and abominable perſons, may be foiſted in, yea and ſuffered alſo." p. 119, 120. "I deny not but, as it hath been ſaid of old,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015240_0039_0FA3719507FE5748"/>there are many <hi>ſheep without,</hi> and many <hi>wolves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;</hi> many of the viſible church which are not of the inviſible church, and many of the inviſible church which never come into the viſible church: But this, ſay I, is not according to the revealed will of God in his word; but by men's default and ſin. It is their ſin of ignorance, or infirmity, which, being of the inviſible church, do not, if poſſibly they can, join themſelves unto the viſible church, there to partake in the viſible ordinances. It is their ſin of hypocriſy and preſumption, which not being of the inviſible church, do adjoin themſelves to the viſible church, there to prophane the Lord's covenant and ordinances, to which they have no right. For how can they, being wicked and unholy, challenge the Lord to be their God, that is, all happineſs and goodneſs unto them, which is one part of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; or profeſs themſelves to be his people, which is another part, when the devil and their luſts is their God?" p. 313, 314.</item>

Indeed many of the late Biſhops and their proctors, ſeeing how monſtrous the miniſtration is of DIVINE things, by an <hi>human</hi> authority and calling; and growing bold upon the preſent diſpoſition of the magiſtrate, have diſclaimed that former title, and do profeſſedly hold their eccleſiaſtical power and juriſdiction <hi>de jure divino,</hi> and ſo conſequently by God's word unalterable: Of whom I would demand this one queſtion:</p>
               <p>"WHAT if the King ſhould diſcharge and expel the preſent eccleſiaſtical government, and plant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it the preſbytery or elderſhip, would they ſubmit unto the government of the elders, yea or no?

               </p>
               <p>MR. Bernard charged his opponents with error, in holding that miniſters ought not to live of <hi>tithes,</hi> but of the people's <hi>voluntary contribution;</hi> and ſays, <hi>This is againſt the wiſdom of God, who allowed a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled maintenance under the law; and there is nothing againſt it in the goſpel.</hi> But in reply Mr. Robinſon ſays, "As the Lord appointed under the law a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled maintenance by tithes and offerings, ſo did he a ſettled land of Canaan, which was holy, and a ſacrament; ſo did he alſo appoint that the Levites be maintained there, <hi>ſhould have no part nor inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the reſt of the Iſraelites their brethren.</hi> And hath God's wiſdom ſo appointed now? If it had, I fear many would not reſt in it, ſo wiſe are they for their bellies. And where you add, that there is nothing in the goſpel againſt this ordinance in the law, the author to the Hebrews might have taught you, that the law is aboliſhed by the goſpel, in the ſenſe we ſpeak of; and the old teſtament by the new, in reſpect of ordinances, whereof this was one. If it be ſaid that tithes were in uſe and given by Abraham to Melchizedech, prieſt of the moſt high God, before the law or old teſtament was given

To conclude this point, ſince tithes and offerings were appurtenances unto the prieſthood, and that the <hi>prieſthood,</hi> both of Melchizedech and Levi, are aboliſhed in Chriſt, as the ſhadow in the ſubſtance; and that the <hi>Lord hath ordained that they which preach the goſpel, ſhould live of the goſpel;</hi> we willingly leave unto you both you prieſtly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and maintenance, contenting ourſelves with the people's voluntary contribution, whether it be leſs or more, as the bleſſing of God upon our labour, the fruit of our miniſtry, and declaration of their love and duty." p. 439, 440.</p>

About the time of his publiſhing this book, and ſome following years, <q>many came to his church at Leyden from <g ref="char:startq">“</g>divers parts of England, ſo that they grew a great congregation; even ſo as to have three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <g ref="char:endq">”</g>communicants<note n="*" place="bottom">Prince's Chronology—Plymouth Regiſter</note>.</q> And as the Arminian controverſy cauſed great troubles in Holland, and eſpecially at Leyden, their two divinity profeſſors being divided, Epiſcopius appearing for, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore againſt the Arminian tenets; Mr. Robinſon, though he preached thrice a week, and went through much other labour, yet went conſtantly to hear them both, whereby he got well grounded in the

In December, 1617, Mr. Robinſon and Elder Brewſter wrote to the Council for Virginia, who then had the management of theſe affairs, wherein they ſay, <q>For your encouragement we will not forbear <g ref="char:startq">“</g>to mention theſe inducements.

               <p>HEREIN they were not miſtaken, as will ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for though contentions among the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and other things, obſtructed their proceeding till 1620, and they could not then obtain any royal promiſe of liberty of conſcience in this country,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015240_0046_0FA3719B08234468"/>only that the King would <hi>connive</hi> at them, and not moleſt them if they carried it peaceably, <q>Yet, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <g ref="char:startq">“</g>themſelves on the care of providence, they <g ref="char:endq">”</g>reſolve to venture.</q> But as the could not obtain ſhipping and proviſion enough to carry half their company the firſt year, Mr. Robinſon was obliged to tarry in Holland with the larger part, while Mr. William Brewſter, their ruling elder, came over with the other. Moſt of their brethren came with them from Leyden to Delph-Haven, where they ſpent the night in friendly, entertaining and chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. And July 22, the wind being fair, they go aboard, their friends attending them, when <q>Mr. <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Robinſon falling down on his knees, and they all with him, he with watry cheeks commends them with moſt fervent prayer to God; and then with mutual embraces, and many tears, they take their leaves, and with a proſperous gale come to South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,<g ref="char:endq">”</g>
                  </q> in England. July 27, 1620, Mr. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon wrote a letter, which was received and read to the company at that place<note n="*" place="bottom">Prince, p. 70, 71.</note>; which I think wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a place here.

                     <p>"I DO heartily and in the Lord ſalute you, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe with whom I am preſent in my beſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and moſt earneſt longing after you, though I be conſtrained for a while to be bodily abſent from you: I ſay conſtrained; God knowing how willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and much rather than otherwiſe, I would have born my part with you in the firſt brunt, were I not by ſtrong neceſſity held back for the preſent. Make account of me in the mean time as a man divided in myſelf, with great pain (and as natural bonds ſet aſide) having my better part with you; and although I doubt not, but in your godly wiſdoms you both
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015240_0047_0FA3719BC7A96148"/>foreſee and reſolve upon that which concerneth your preſent ſtate and condition, both ſeverally and jointly, yet have I thought it but my duty to add ſome further ſpur of provocation unto them who run already, if not becauſe you need it, yet becauſe I owe it in love and duty.</p>
                     <p>"AND firſt, as we are daily to renew our repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with our God, eſpecially for our ſins known, and generally for our unknown treſpaſſes; ſo doth the Lord call us in a ſingular manner, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſuch difficulty and danger as lieth upon you, to both a narrow ſearch and careful reformation in his ſight, leſt he calling to remembrance our ſins forgotten by us, or unrepented of, take advantage againſt us, and in judgment leave us to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in one danger or other; whereas, on the contrary, ſin being taken away by earneſt repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the pardon thereof from the Lord ſealed up to a man's conſcience by his ſpirit, great ſhall be his ſecurity and peace in all dangers, ſweet his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in all diſtreſſes, with happy deliverance from all evil, whether in life or death. Now next after this heavenly peace with God and our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, we are carefully to provide for peace with all men, what in us lieth, eſpecially with our aſſociates; and for that, watchfulneſs muſt be had, that we neither at all ourſelves do give, no, nor ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily take offence being given by others. <hi>Wo be to the world for offences,</hi> for although it be neceſſary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the malice of Satan and man's corruption. <hi>that offences come,</hi> yet <hi>wo unto the man,</hi> or woman either, <hi>by whom the offence cometh,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, Matt. xviii. 7. And if offences in the unſeaſonable uſe of things, in themſelves indifferent, be more to be feared than death itſelf, as the apoſtle teacheth, 1 Cor. ix. 15, how much more in things ſimply evil,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015240_0048_0FA3719C8A06DD30"/>in which neither the honor of God nor love of man is thought worthy to be regarded? Neither yet is it ſufficient that we keep ourſelves, by the grace of God, from giving offences, except withal we be armed againſt the taking of them, when they are given by others; for how imperfect and lame is the work of grace in that perſon, who wants charity to <hi>cover a multitude of offences?</hi> as the ſcripture ſpeaks. Neither are you to be exhorted to this grace only upon the common grounds of chriſtianity, which are, that perſons ready to take offence, either want charity to cover offences, or duly to weigh human frailties; or, laſtly, are groſs though cloſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, as Chriſt our Lord teacheth, Matt. vii. 1—3: as indeed, in my own experience, few or none have been found which ſooner give offence, than ſuch as eaſily take it; neither have they ever proved ſound and profitable members in ſocieties, who have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed this <hi>touchy humour.</hi> But beſides theſe, there are divers motives provoking you above others to great care and conſcience this way; as firſt, there are many of you ſtrangers to the perſons, ſo to the infirmities of one another, and ſo ſtand in need of more watchfulneſs this way, leſt when ſuch things fall out in men and women as you expected not, you inordinately affected with them, which doth require at your hands much wiſdom and charity for the covering and preventing of incident offences that way. And laſtly, your intended courſe of civil community will miniſter continual occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<note n="*" place="bottom">For ſeveral years their affairs were managed in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtock, but they afterward found the way of diſtinct proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be much better.</note>, and will be as fuel for that fire, except you diligently watch it with <hi>brotherly forbearance.</hi> And if taking offence cauſeleſsly or eaſily at men's doings
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015240_0049_0FA3719D492B7538"/>be ſo carefully to be avoided; how much more heed is to be taken that we take not offence at God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Which yet we certainly do, ſo oft as we do murmur at his providences in our croſſes, or bear impatiently ſuch afflictions wherewith he is pleaſed to viſit us. Store up therefore patience againſt the evil day; without which we take offence at the Lord himſelf in his juſt works. A fourth thing there is carefully to be provided for, viz that with your common employments, you join common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, truly bent upon the general good, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a deadly plague of <hi>your</hi> both common and ſpecial comforts, all retiredneſs of mind for proper advantage; and all ſingularly affected every manner of way, let every man repreſs in himſelf, and the whole body in each perſon, as ſo many rebels againſt the common good, all <hi>private reſpects of men's ſelves,</hi> not ſorting with the general convenience. And as men are careful not to have a new houſe ſhaken with any violence, before it be well ſettled, and the parts firmly knit; ſo be you, I beſeech you my brethren, much more careful that the houſe of God, which you are and are to be, be ſhaken with unneceſſary no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, or other oppoſitions, at the firſt ſettling thereof.</p>
                     <p>"LASTLY, whereas you are to become a body politic, uſing amongſt yourſelves civil government, and are not furniſhed with ſpecial eminency above the reſt, to be choſen by you into office of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let your wiſdom and godlineſs appear, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in chooſing ſuch perſons as do <hi>entirely</hi> love, and will promote the common good; but alſo in <hi>yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> unto them all due honor and obedience in their lawful adminiſtrations, not beholding in them the ordinarineſs of their perſons, but God's ordinance for <hi>your good;</hi> not being like the fooliſh multitude,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015240_0050_0FA3719E08E2AC68"/>who more honor the <hi>gay coat,</hi> than either the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind of the man, or the glorious ordinance of the Lord; but you know better things, and that the image of the Lord's power and authority, which the magiſtrate beareth, is honorable, in how mean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſoever; and this duty you may the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and ought the more conſcionably to perform, becauſe you are, at leaſt for the preſent, to have them for your ordinary governors, which yourſelves ſhall make choice of for that work. Sundry other things of importance I could put you in mind of, and of thoſe before mentioned, in more words; but I will not ſo far wrong your godly minds, as to think you heedleſs of theſe things, there being alſo divers amongſt you ſo well able both to admoniſh themſelves and others of what concerneth them. Theſe few things therefore, and the ſame in few words, I do earneſtly commend to your care and conſcience, joining therein with my daily inceſſant prayers unto the Lord, that he who has made the heavens and the earth, and ſea, and all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of water, and whoſe providence is over all his works, eſpecially over all his dear children for good, would ſo guide and guard you in your ways, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by his ſpirit, ſo outwardly by the hand of his power, as that both you, and we alſo for and with you, may have after matter of praiſing his name all the days of your and our lives.

               <p>AND now compare this company with that of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadahock. That company, who came upon worldly deſigns, had an hundred men; this religious ſociety conſiſted of but one hundred and one ſouls, men, women, and children; the one arrived at the place deſigned for ſettlement in Auguſt, the other not till winter had ſet in: The worldly company only buried their preſident, and all returned the next year to their native country again; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this religious people, in about five months time, buried their Governor and full half their number, and yet with fortitude and patience they kept their ſtation; yea, though they were afterwards deſerted and abuſed by ſome who had engaged to help them.

               </p>
               <p>THE cauſe why Mr. Robinſon and the remaining part of his church were kept back ſo long, was their inability to tranſport themſelves, and ſeveral mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who had engaged in the affair deſerted them, purſuing ſeparate ſchemes of their own, and ſent over one company of ſixty ſtout men, who began a plantation at Weymouth; but ſoon reduced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuch ſtraits that ſeveral periſhed, and the reſt were forced to be beholden to the charity of Plymouth people, to keep them alive till they could get back whence they came. Another worldly ſcheme was begun at Braintree, which alſo proved abortive, while our chriſtian fathers at Plymouth were enabled to keep their ſtation. And ſome of the adventurers wrote to them on December 18, 1624, and ſaid, <q>We are ſtill perſuaded you are <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the people that muſt make a plantation in thoſe <g ref="char:endq">”</g>remote places, when all others fail<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 155.</note>.</q> They were long deſtitute of a paſtor, and yet conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained divine worſhip among them, of which a noted author gives this account; ſays he,</p>

Upon which we may ſee Mr. Robinſon's words verified; for theſe Puritans, who had blamed him for an entire ſeparation from the national church, yet were no ſooner ſettled on this ſide the Atlantic, than they caſt off the prelates
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015240_0056_0FA371A2927BD790"/>yoke in ſuch a manner, that when John Brown and Samuel Brown, two of the <q>firſt patentees, men of <g ref="char:startq">“</g>

               <p>BY this and many other inſtances we may ſee, that the men who drew off from the national eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, as ſoon as they were convinced that truth called them to it, were not ſo ſevere againſt Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from themſelves, as they were who ſtayed till intereſt and civil power would favour the cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſeparated.</p>
               <p>IN the year 1630, Governor Winthrop with about fifteen hundred people came over, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Charleſtown, Boſton, Dorcheſter, and Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, and ſoon formed churches in each town. Of theſe people Mr. Hubbard ſays, <q>Intending not <g ref="char:startq">“</g>to write an apology, but an hiſtory of their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, nothing ſhall here be interpoſed by way of defence of their way, only to give a clear diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the truth, as to matter of fact, both what it was at firſt, and ſtill continues to be. Thoſe that came over ſoon after Mr. Endicot, namely Mr. Higginſon and Mr. Skelton, Anno. 1629, walked
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015240_0057_0FA371A349323B98"/>ſomething in an untrodden path, therefore it is the leſs to be wondered at, if they went in and out; in ſome things complying too much, in ſome too little, with thoſe of the ſeparation; and it may be in ſome things not ſufficiently attending to the order of the goſpel, as themſelves thought they underſtood afterwards. For in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of things they only accepted of one another according to ſome <hi>general profeſſion</hi> of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the goſpel, and the honeſt and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions they had one towards another, and ſo by ſome kind of covenant ſoon moulded themſelves into a church in every plantation where they took up their abode<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>The covenant of the firſt church in Boſton was in theſe words:

And ſuch was the authority they, eſpecially Mr. Cotton, had in the hearts of the people, that
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:015240_0058_0FA371A486188FE8"/>whatever he delivered in the pulpit was ſoon put into an order of court, if of a civil, or ſet up as a practice in the church, if of an eccleſiaſtical concernment. After that time, the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all eccleſiaſtical matters was tyed up more ſtrictly than before to the rules of that which is ſince owned for the Congregational way.—The principal points wherein they differ from others may be reduced to theſe four heads:
<list>
                        <item>1. THE ſubject matter of the church, ſaints by calling: Such as have not only attained the knowledge of the principles of religion, and free from groſs and open ſcandal, but are willing, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the profeſſion of their repentance and faith in Chriſt, to declare their ſubjection to him in his ordinances, which they account ought to be done publicly before the Lord and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by an open profeſſion of the doctrine of the goſpel, and by a <hi>perſonal relation of their ſpiritual eſtate,</hi> expreſſive of how they were brought to the knowledge of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus; and this is done either with their <hi>viva voce,</hi> or by a rehearſal thereof by the elders in public before the church aſſembly, they having beforehand received private ſatisfaction, the perſons openly teſtifying their aſſents thereunto, provided they do not ſcandalize their profeſſion by an unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian converſation, in which caſe a profeſſion is with them of ſmall account.</item>
                        <item>2. IN the conſtitutive form of a particular viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church, which they account ought to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipulation, or mutual covenanting to walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their chriſtian communion, according to the rules of the goſpel; and this they ſay is beſt to be explicit, although they do not deny but an implicit covenant may ſuffice to the being of a true church.</item>
                        <pb n="48" facs="unknown:015240_0059_0FA371A508BE9A08"/>
                        <item>3. IN the quantity or extenſiveneſs of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church, concerning which they hold that no church ſociety, of goſpel inſtitution, ought to be of larger extent, or greater number, than may ordinarily meet together in one place, for the enjoyment of all the ſame numerical ordinances, and celebrating of all divine worſhip, nor ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fewer than may conveniently carry on church work.</item>
                        <item>4. THAT there is no juriſdiction, to which as ſuch particular churches are or ought to be ſubject, be it placed in claſſes or ſynod, by way of authoritative cenſure, nor any church power, extrinſical to the ſaid church, which they ought to have dependence upon any other ſort of men for the exerciſe of.</item>

               <p>HERE let it be well obſerved and ever remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that theſe were the main points wherein they <hi>differed from others;</hi> and the reader is welcome to ſearch through all their hiſtory from that day to this, and ſee if he can find that theſe principles, in themſelves conſidered, ever produced any evil effects; but this people brought two other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with them from their native country, in which they did <hi>not differ</hi> from others; which are, that <hi>natural</hi> birth, and the doings of men, can bring children into the <hi>covenant of grace;</hi> and, that it is right to enforce and ſupport their own ſentiments about religion with the <hi>magiſtrate's ſword.</hi> And thoſe, let them live in England, Scotland, Rome, or elſewhere, who reproach and condemn New-England for the evils which theſe two principles
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:015240_0060_0FA371A588214C80"/>have produced, while they hold the <hi>ſame things,</hi> ought to conſider that in ſo doing they will be found <hi>inexcuſable</hi> before our GREAT JUDGE.</p>
               <p>THE root of a compulſive uniformity was planted at a General Court in Boſton, May 18, 1631, when it was <q>ordered and agreed, that for the time to <g ref="char:startq">“</g>come, no man ſhall be admitted to the freedom of this <hi>body politic,</hi> but ſuch as are <hi>members</hi> of ſome of the <hi>churches</hi> within the limits of the <g ref="char:endq">”</g>ſame<note n="*" place="bottom">Prince's Annals, p. 28, 29.</note>.</q> This teſt in after times had ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, that he who <q>did not conform, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of <g ref="char:startq">“</g>more civil privileges than a Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt is deprived of by the teſt in England. Both the one and the other muſt have occaſioned much formality and hypocriſy.

               </p>
               <p>IF in any inſtances this people carried their zeal to a greater ſeverity than Epiſcopalians have often done, let it be remembered, that the latter hold a power in their church to <hi>decree rites and ceremonies,</hi> and ſo conſequently a power to abate or alter the ſame as occaſion ſuits; but the fathers of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts held the ſcriptures to be their unalterable rule, and having formed a plan which they thought was truly ſcriptural, Captain Johnſon in 1651 ſaid, <q>To <g ref="char:startq">“</g>them it ſeems unreaſonable, and to ſavour too much of hypocriſy, that any people ſhould pray unto the Lord for the ſpeedy accompliſhment of his word in the overthrow of Antichriſt, and in the mean time become a patron to ſinful opinions and damnable errors that oppoſe the truths of Chriſt, <g ref="char:endq">”</g>admit it be but in the bare permiſſion of them<note n="‡" place="bottom">Johnſon's Hiſtory, p. 206.</note>.</q> Hence it appears, that it was this erroneous notion
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:015240_0061_0FA371A6483CE6E8"/>of uſing carnal weapons againſt what they looked upon falſe opinions, that ought to bear the blame and reproach of thoſe perſecutions, and not their particular religious denomination, nor any of their zeal to promote religion by goſpel means and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</p>
               <p>THAT they were not aware how unſcripturally they had confounded church and ſtate together, appears from many facts. They were ſo much concerned to keep them diſtinct, that in 1632 the church of Boſton wrote to the elders and brethren of the churches of Plymouth, Salem, &amp;c. for their advice in three queſtions;
<list>
                     <item>1. Whether one perſon might be a cavil magiſtrate and a ruling elder at the ſame time?</item>
                     <item>2. If not, then which ſhould they lay down?</item>

On the other hand, Mr. John Doan, having been formerly choſen to the office of deacon in the church of Plymouth, at his and the church's requeſt, he was freed from the office of aſſiſtant in the commonwealth<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 92.</note>.</p>
               <p>AGAIN our late Governor ſays, "I ſuppoſe there had been no inſtance of a marriage lawfully cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by a layman in England, when they left it. I believe there was no inſtance of marriage by a clergyman after they arrived, during their charter; but it was always done by a magiſtrate, or by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſpecially appointed for that purpoſe. It is difficult to aſſign a reaſon for ſo ſudden a change<note n="‡" place="bottom">Maſſachuſetts Hiſtory, vol. 1, p. 144.</note>."
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:015240_0062_0FA371A7076186C0"/>I happened to obſerve a paſſage in Mr. Robinſon which I ſuppoſe gives us the true reaſon of that great change. Mr. Bernard had charged the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts with an error, which he ſaid they had given neither reaſon nor ſcripture for, in holding that <hi>miniſters may not celebrate marriage, nor bury the dead.</hi> To which Mr. Robinſon anſwers,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>IN our third petition to the King, and the fourth branch of the ſixth propoſition, there are almoſt twenty ſeveral ſcriptures, and nine diſtinct reaſons grounded upon them, to prove, that the celebration of marriage, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the dead, are not <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> actions, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the <hi>miniſtry,</hi> but <hi>civil,</hi> and ſo to be performed. The apoſtle teſtifieth that the <hi>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> being divinely inſpired, do make <hi>perfect, and fully furniſhed,</hi> the man of God, or miniſter, to <hi>every good work</hi> of his calling. Now I ſuppoſe Mr. B. will not be ſo ill adviſed, as to go about to prove that the celebration of marriage, and burial of the dead, are duties preſcribed by the Lord Jeſus to be done in the paſtor's office, or that the ſcriptures lay this furniture upon the man of God for the proper works of his office. They are then other ſpiritual lords than the Lord Chriſt, that preſcribe theſe duties to done by their men, furniſhed by other ſcriptures than the divine ſcriptures, the Biſhop's ſcriptures, their canons and conſtitutions; whereby they are furniſhed indeed with ring, ſervice-book, and <g ref="char:endq">”</g>other prieſtly implements for the buſineſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Juſtification of Separation, p. 438.</note>.</q> This I ſuppoſe accounts for that change in our father's conduct then; though it is likely we are agreed in general now, that as it was an error of
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015240_0063_0FA371A7C787B818"/>Popery to call marriage a ſacrament, and to limit its adminiſtration to the clergy; ſo on the other hand that it was a miſtake in thoſe fathers to think that the civil ſtate might not as well appoint mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to celebrate marriages as any other perſons.</p>
               <p>THESE and many other things prove that thoſe fathers were earneſtly concerned to frame their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution both in church and ſtate by divine rule; and as all allow that nothing teaches like experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſurely they who are enabled well to improve the experience of paſt ages, muſt find it eaſier now to diſcover the miſtakes of that day, than it was for them to do it then. Even in 1637, when a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Puritan miniſters in England, and the famous Mr. Dod among them, wrote to the miniſters here, that it was reported that they had embraced certain new opinions, ſuch as "that a ſtinted form of prayer and ſet liturgy is unlawful. That the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of godly and approved chriſtians are not to be baptized, until their parents be ſet members of ſome particular congregation. That the parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though of approved piety, are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to the Lord's ſupper until they be admitted ſet members," &amp;c. Mr. Hooker expreſſed his fears of troubleſome work about anſwering os them<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſachuſetts Hiſtory, vol. 1, p. 81.</note>; though they may appear eaſy to the preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

               <p>As to the cauſes of his ſentence, Mr. Morton has given us five articles, Mr. Hubbard ſix; Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams has reduced them to four, but Mr. Cotton is not willing to let them ſtand as he ſtated them, but tells us that, <q>two things there were, which <g ref="char:startq">“</g>(to my beſt obſervation and remembrance) cauſed the ſentence of his baniſhment; and two others fell in that haſtened it.</q>

               <p>WHAT grounds Mr. Williams and others had for this concern will plainly appear by what follows; for in the ſaid patent from Charles the firſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites that which was given by his father, King James the firſt, dated November 3, 1620, wherein he <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>gave and granted unto the Council eſtabliſhed at Plymouth, in the county of Devon, all that part of America lying and being in breadth from 40 degrees of northerly latitude from the equinoxial line to 48 degrees of the ſaid northerly latitude incluſively, and in length of and within all the breadth aforeſaid throughout the main land from ſea to ſea, together alſo with all the firm lands, ſoils, grounds, havens, ports, rivers, waters, fiſhing, mines and minerals—juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, privileges, franchiſes, and preheminences, both within the ſaid tract of land upon the main, and alſo within the iſlands and ſeas adjoining.

               <p>CAN any man claim a fuller property in any land in the world, than here was aſſumed over this vaſt tract of America! And though the men who had taken this patent baniſhed Mr. Williams out of it, yet before we have done we may ſee this very principle which he abhorred turned back into their own boſoms, and made uſe of by a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical party to give them a ſevere ſcourging, after their patent was vacated.</p>
               <p>THE other foundation cauſe of Mr. Williams's baniſhment Mr. Cotton gives in theſe words:</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>2. THE magiſtrates, and other members of the General Court, upon intelligence of ſome Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and malignant practices againſt the country, made an order of Court to take trial of the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the people, not by impoſing upon them, but by offering to them, an oath of fidelity; that in caſe any ſhould refuſe to take it, they might not betruſt them with place of public charge and command. This oath when it came abroad he vehemently withſtood, and diſſuaded ſundry from it, partly becauſe it was, as he ſaid, Chriſt's prerogative to have his office eſtabliſhed by oath; partly becauſe an oath was part of God's worſhip, and God's worſhip was not to be put upon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perſons, as he conceived many of the people to be. So the Court was forced to deſiſt from <g ref="char:endq">”</g>that proceeding<note n="†" place="bottom">Tenet waſhed, p. 28, 29.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS caſe thus ſtated carries a ſad face with it, but one acquainted with the hiſtory of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would be ready to doubt whether it was truly ſtated or not; for every freeman had taken an oath
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:015240_0072_0FA371AE8D5B8A58"/>of fidelity to the government before that time, and if there was no intent of <hi>impoſing</hi> but only of <hi>offering</hi> this new oath, could they not find men enough for officers that would take it? Indeed when I come to find how the truth of this matter was, by the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny records, and to think that Mr. Cotton had them at his door when he wrote, I am the moſt ſhocked about him by this publication of his againſt Mr. Williams, of any thing I ever met with concerning him. Upon the colony records, when the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly met at Boſton, May 14, 1634, I find thoſe words, viz.</p>
               <p>"It was agreed and ordered, that the former oath of freemen ſhall be revoked, ſo far as it is diſſonant from the oath of freemen here underwritten, and that thoſe that received the former oath ſhall ſtand bound no further thereby to any intent or purpoſe than this new oath tyes thoſe that take the ſame."</p>

               <p>THIS oath was framed and taken before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to election at the time aboveſaid. When the Aſſembly met again at Newtown, now Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, March 4, 1635, they enacted, "that every man of or above the age of ſixteen years, who hath been or ſhall be reſident within this juriſdiction, by the ſpace of ſix months (as well ſervants as others) and not infranchiſed, ſhall take the oath of reſidents, before the Governor, Deputy-Governor, or two of the next Aſſiſtants, who ſhall have power to convent him for that purpoſe, and upon his refuſal to bind him over to the next Court of Aſſiſtants, and upon his refuſal the ſecond time, to be puniſhed at the diſcretion of the Court.</p>
               <p>"IT is ordered, that the freeman's oath ſhall be given to every man of or above the age of ſixteen years, the clauſe for election of magiſtrates only excepted<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſachuſetts Records.</note>."</p>

The Maſſachuſetts Company were limited, in three different paſſages of their patent, not to make any laws contrary to the laws of England; yet one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed deſign of this new oath, was to guard againſt <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> practices, to effect which they left out the clauſe in their former oath, which bound them to ſubmit to <q>all ſuch laws, orders, ſentences and

               <p>UPON this Mr. Williams publicly preached againſt the oath they had framed, of ſubmiſſion to ſuch a power; for which the Governor and Aſſiſtants called him before them, March 30, 1635, when <q>he was <g ref="char:startq">“</g>heard before all the miniſters, and, according to Governor Winthrop's opinion, was clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed<note n="‡" place="bottom">Winthrop's Journal.</note>.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>

The ſaid opinions were adjudged by all the magiſtracy and miniſters (who were deſired to be preſent) to be erroneous, and very dangerous, and the calling of him to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at that time was judged a great contempt of authority. So in fine there was given to him and the church of Salem to conſider of theſe things till the next General Court, and then either to give ſatisfaction to the Court, or elſe to expect the ſentence; it being profeſſedly declared by the miniſters (at the requeſt of the Court to give their advice) that they who ſhould obſtinately maintain ſuch opinions (whereby the church might come into hereſy, apoſtacy or tyranny, and yet the civil magiſtrate could not intermeddle) were to be removed, and that the other churches <g ref="char:endq">”</g>ought to requeſt the magiſtrate ſo to do<note n="*" place="bottom">Governor Winthrop's Journal.</note>.</q>

               <p>THIS is the moſt plain and ingenious account of the real cauſe of Mr. Williams's baniſhment that I have ever met with, from any who were oppoſite to him, and carries the more weight with it, as it was wrote by one of the greateſt gentlemen in the country, in the time of it, and who was perſonally concerned in theſe tranfactions. And by the firſt and laſt of this account it is evident, that the grand difficulty they had with Mr. Williams was, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the civil magiſtrates right to govern in eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical affairs.</p>
               <p>THIS honorable writer informs us, that on Auguſt 15, 1635, <q>Mr. Williams, paſtor of Salem, be-being <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſick, and not able to ſpeak, wrote to his church a proteſtation that he would not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the churches in the Bay, neither would he communicate with them, except they would refuſe communion with the reſt: But the whole <g ref="char:endq">”</g>church was grieved thereby.</q>
               </p>
               <p>SEPTEMBER 1. <q>At this General Court, Mr. <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Endicot made a proteſtation, in juſtification of the letters formerly ſent fom Salem to the other churches againſt the magiſtracy and deputies, for which he was committed; but the ſame day he came and acknowledged his fault, and was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged<note n="†" place="bottom">Winthrop's Journal.—Mr. Endicot afterwards acted at the head of the moſt bloody perſecutions in this country.</note>.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>

               <p>OCTOBER <q>At this General Court Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the teacher of Salem, was again convent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all the miniſters in the Bay being deſired to be preſent, he was charged with his ſaid two letters, that to the churches, complaining of the magiſtrates for injuſtice, &amp;c. and the other to his own church.—He juſtified both,—and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all his opinions; and being offered further
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:015240_0081_0FA372DCCBC2E510"/>conference or diſputation, and another reſpite, he choſe to diſpute preſently; ſo Mr. Hooker was appointed to diſpute with him, but could not reduce him from any of his errors; ſo the next morning the Court ſentenced him to depart out of our juriſdiction, within ſix weeks, all the miniſters approving the ſentence; and his own church had him under queſtion alſo for the ſame caſe, and he at his return home refuſed commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his own church, who openly diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his errors, and wrote an <hi>humble ſubmiſſion</hi> to the magiſtrates, acknowledging their fault in joining with Mr. Williams in that letter to the <g ref="char:endq">”</g>churches againſt them<note n="*" place="bottom">Winthrop's Journal.—The next time the Court met they confirmed their land to them, as before obſerved. The province records agree with this account, only they do not ſet any date after the Court met in September, before Mr. Williams's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; but it might be October before it was paſſed.</note>

               </p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH was baniſhed at the ſame time with Mr. Williams, for his dangerous opinions, but we are not told what they were. It ſeems that the Court after this gave Mr. Williams liberty to ſtay till ſpring, only enjoined it upon him not to go about to draw others to his opinions; but in January, 1636, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Aſſiſtants were informed, that he received and preached to companies in his houſe, <q>even of <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>ſuch points as he had been cenſured for.</q> Upon which they agreed to ſend him into England by a ſhip then ready to depart; <q>the reaſon was, becauſe <g ref="char:startq">“</g>he had drawn about twenty people to his opinions, they were intended to erect a plantation about the Narraganſet bay, from whence infection would eaſily ſpead into theſe churches, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of them much taken with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion <g ref="char:endq">”</g>of his godlineſs.</q> They ſent for him to come to Boſton, but he ſent an excuſe; upon which
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:015240_0082_0FA372DD898E8880"/>they ſent a pinnace, with a commiſſion to Captain Underhill, to apprehend him and carry him on board the ſhip then at Nantaſket; but when they <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>came to his houſe, they found he had been gone <g ref="char:endq">”</g>three days<note n="§" place="bottom">Winthrop's Journal.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS I believe is the exact date of his departure, inſtead of being in 1634, as their hiſtorians have repreſented. Sixteen years after Mr. Williams tells us, he remembered <q>a ſerious queſtion which many <g ref="char:startq">“</g>fearing God have made, to wit, whether the promiſe of God's ſpirit bleſſing conferences, be ſo comfortably to be expected in New-England, becauſe of thoſe many public ſins which moſt of God's people in New-England lie under, and one eſpecially, to wit, the framing a goſpel or Chriſt to themſelves without a <hi>croſs,</hi> not <hi>profeſſing</hi> nor <hi>practiſing</hi> that in Old, which they profeſſedly came over to enjoy with <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> from any <hi>croſs</hi> of Chriſt in New. I know thoſe thoughts have deeply poſſeſſed not a few, conſidering alſo the ſin of the patents, wherein <hi>chriſtian</hi> Kings, ſo called, are inveſted with right, by virtue of their <hi>chriſtianity,</hi> to take and give away the lands and countries of other men; as alſo conſidering the <hi>unchriſtian oaths,</hi> ſwallowed down, at their coming forth from Old-England, eſpecially in ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Laud his time and domineering<note n="*" place="bottom">Reply to Cotton, p. 276. Note, it was not all oaths, but only them that he eſteemed <hi>unchriſtian</hi> ones that he objected againſt.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is evident by the foregoing liſt of errors charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Mr. Williams, that the Maſſachuſetts mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and rulers meant to carry their uniformity ſo far, as to oblige miniſters and chriſtians, throughout their juriſdiction, not only to aſk a bleſſing at the Lord's table and at common meals, but alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:015240_0083_0FA372DE47255498"/>thanks afterward; and it is likely that this ſtraining of that matter beyond ſcripture example, has had not a little influence upon many ſince to carry them to the other extreme. Be that as it may, what human heart can be unaffected with the thought, that a people who had been ſorely perſecuted in their own country, ſo as to flee three thouſand miles into a wilderneſs for religious liberty, yet ſhould have that impoſing temper cleaving ſo faſt to them, as not to be willing to let a godly miniſter, who teſtified againſt it, ſtay even in any neighbouring part of this wilderneſs, but moved them to attempt to take him by force, to ſend him back into the land of their perſecutors! To avoid which he fled to the heathen in the depth of winter, and obtained ſuch favour in their ſight, that Oſamaquin (otherwiſe called Maſaſoit) chief Sachem at Mount Hope, made him a grant of part of that which is ſince called Rehoboth; yet that was ſo far then from anſwering to its preſent name, that a letter and meſſenger was ſent from Plymouth to let him know there was not ROOM for him in that place, becauſe within their patent. <hi>This is a lamentation, and ſhall be for a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MR. Williams's own teſtimony, upon a particular occaſion at Providence twenty-five years after, I think deſerves notice here. Says he,</p>
               <p>"I TESTIFY and declare in the holy preſence of God, that when at my firſt coming into theſe parts I obtained the lands of Secunk of Oſamaquin, the then chief Sachem on that ſide, the Governor of Plymouth, Mr. Winſlow, wrote to me, in the name of their government, their claim of Secunk to be in their juriſdiction, as alſo their advice to remove but over the river unto this ſide, where now by God's merciful providence we are, and then I ſhould be

                     </gap>f. The chief Sachem's names are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently ſpelt in the different writings I have met with.</note>. After I had obtained this place, now called Providence, of Canonicus and Myantinomy, they chief Nanhigganſet Sachems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, Oſamaquin (the Sachem aforeſaid, alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed) laid his claim to this place alſo. This forced me to repair to the Nanhigganſet Sachems aforeſaid, who declared, that Oſamaquin was their ſubject, and had ſolemnly, himſelf in perſon, with ten men, ſubjected himſelf and his lands unto them at the Nanhigganſet, only now he ſeemed to revolt from his loyalty, under the ſhelter of the Engliſh at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth<note n="†" place="bottom">This perfectly agrees with the account we have of Maſaſſoit or Oſamaquin's league he made with Plymouth people the ſpring after their firſt coming, and of the Narraganſet's threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings on that account. <hi>Prince's Chronology,</hi> p. 102, 116.</note>. This I declared from the Nanhigganſet Sachems to Oſamaquin, who without any ſtick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be true, that he had ſo ſubjected as the Nanhigganſet Sachems had affirmed; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al he affirmed that he was not ſubdued by war, which himſelf and his father had maintained againſt the Nanhigganſets; but God, ſaid he, ſubdued us by a plaque, which ſwept away my people, and forced me to yield. This conviction and confeſſion of his, together with gratuities to himſelf, brethren and followers, made him often profeſs, that he was pleaſed that I ſhould here be his neighbour, and the rather becauſe he and I had been great friends at Plymouth; and alſo becauſe his and my friends at Plymouth adviſed him to be at peace and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with me; and he hoped that our children after us would be good friends together. And whereas
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:015240_0085_0FA372DFC8DC9DA0"/>there hath been often ſpeech of Providence falling in Plymouth juriſdiction by virtue of Oſamaquin's claim; I add unto the teſtimonies aboveſaid, that the Governor, Mr. Bradford deceaſed, and other of their magiſtrates, declared unto me, both by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and writing, that they and their government were ſatisfied, and reſolved never to moleſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, nor to claim beyond Secunk, but to continue loving friends and neighbours (among the barbarians) together. This is the true ſum and ſubſtance of many paſſages between our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen of Plymouth and Oſamaquin, and me.</p>

               <p>THE above date of Mr. Williams's removal is confirmed by Mr. Winſlow's being then Governor of Plymouth; for 1636 was the only year that he ſuſtained that office between 1633 and 1644: And as is appeared by Plymouth records that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on his government the firſt of March that year, we may conclude that Mr. Williams fled to Secunk in the depth of winter, and removed with a few friends over the river in the ſpring<note n="†" place="bottom">It is ſaid that he, with Thomas Angell, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

They went round till they got to a pleaſant ſpring above the great bridge, where they landed; and near to which both he and Angell lived to old age.</note>. And here let us admire the wiſdom that governs the world, "As Joſeph was ſold by his envious bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with intent to get him out of their way, yet divine providence over-ruled this cruel action quite otherwiſe than they intended, and made it the means of their future preſervation; ſo the harſh treatment

               <p>JUST at this juncture the Pequods, a powerful Indian tribe, who lived upon the lands where are now the towns of Groton and Stonington, were forming plots againſt the Engliſh colonies, even the very year that thoſe of Connecticut and Providence began, and when Boſton was but ſix years old; and as a veſſel was ſent by the government from thence, under the command of John Oldham, to trade with the natives at Block-Iſland, about fourteen Indians boarded the veſſel, and murdered him; but as John Gallop happened to come upon them, in his return from Connecticut river, they leaped into the ſea, where ſome were drowned, and others reached the ſhore. The firſt news of this ſad event that they received was from Mr. Williams's pen, by two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians who went with Oldham, and one from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanicus, a Narraganſet Sachem, who arrived —at Boſton July 26, 1636. Governor Vane wrote back to Mr. Williams, to let the Narraganſets know that they expected them to ſend home two boys who were with Oldham, and to take revenge upon the iſlanders. Four days after the boys came home with one of Miantinomy's men, with another letter from Mr. Williams, informing that ſaid Sachem had cauſed the Sachem of Niantick to ſend to Block-Iſland for them, and that he had near a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fathom of <hi>peag,</hi> and much other goods of Oldham's, which ſhould be reſerved for them, and that three of the ſeven Indians who were drowned were Sachems<note n="*" place="bottom">Hubbard.</note>.

               <p>SEPT, <q>Canonicus ſent word of ſome Engliſh <g ref="char:startq">“</g>whom the Pequods had killed at Saybrook, and Mr. Williams wrote that the Pequods and Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets were at truce, and that Minatonomoh told him that the Pequods had laboured to perſuade them that the Engliſh were minded to deſtroy all the Indians.

               <p>LET us now review their religious ſtate. In Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, 1635, arrived Mr. Thomas Shepard and Hugh Peters, two miniſters, who were much improved afterward; alſo Mr. afterward Sir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vane, the latter of whom was admitted a member of Boſton church November 1<note n="‖" place="bottom">Winthrop</note>.

               <p>AT the election at Boſton, May 25, Mr. Vane was choſen Governor, and Mr. Winthrop Deputy-Governor; and a ſtanding Council was formed of three men; <q>The reaſon was, for that it was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <g ref="char:startq">“</g>from the word of God, &amp;c. that the principal <g ref="char:endq">”</g>magiſtrates ought to be for life.</q> Mr. Winthrop and Mr. Dudley were choſen for life, and Governor Vane to be their Preſident<note n="†" place="bottom">Winthrop's Journal.

Mr Hooker doth often quote a ſaying out of Mr. Cartwright, that no man faſhioneth his houſe to his hangings, but his hangings to his houſe. It is better that the commonwealth be faſhioned to the ſetting forth of God's houſe, which is his church; than to accommodate the church frame to the civil ſtate.—Nor need we fear, that this courſe will, in time, caſt the commonwealth into diſtractions, and popular confuſions.—Purity preſerved in the church, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well ordered liberty in the people, and both of them <g ref="char:endq">”</g>eſtabliſh well balanced authority in the magiſtrates.</q> Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts Hiſtory, vol. 1. p 497, 500.

               <p>SOON after this came on ſuch diſputes in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about grace and works, that <q>it began to be as <g ref="char:startq">“</g>common there to diſtinguiſh between men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a covenant of works, and a covenant of grace, as in other countries between Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants <g ref="char:endq">”</g>and Papiſts<note n="†" place="bottom">Hubbard. Captain Johnſon ſays, "That you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their way of broaching their abominable errors, it was in dividing thoſe things the Lord hath united in his work of converſion continued, carrying on a ſoul to heaven, in theſe four particulars:
<list>
                           <item>"1. In dividing between the word and the word, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a legal goſpel, perſuading the people their miniſters were legal preachers, teaching them little better than Popery, and unfit for goſpel churches; denying them to be any miniſters of Chriſt, that preach any preparation work, by ſhewing men what the law requires. Here's nothing, ſays one of them, but preaching out of the law and the prophets. Truly, ſays another, I have not heard a pure goſpel ſermon from any of them.</item>
                           <item>"In ſeparating Chriſt and his graces, in manifeſting himſelf to be in the ſoul; and this they ſay makes much for the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of free grace; and indeed they made it ſo free, that the ſoul that receives it ſhall never taſte any of it by their conſent, but remain ſtill a dry branch as before. Theſe legal Phariſees, ſays one of them, tell us of a thing they call inherent grace, and of a man being made a new creature; but I am ſure the beſt of them go on in their legal duties and performances ſtill, ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin, hearing of ſermons, obſerving duty morning and evening, and many ſuch like matters. Tuſh man, ſays another, you ſhall hear more than this; I was diſcourſing with one of their ſcholaſtical preacher's diſciples, a profeſſed convert, and yet when he came to pray, he begged for the forgiveneſs of his ſins; I aſked him why he uſed that vain repetition, ſince he did believe he was juſtified by Chriſt already? He made me an anſwer not worth repeating; but when I told him God could ſee no ſin in his people, no more than I could ſee that which was covered cloſe from my eye-ſight, he told me I ſpake little leſs than blaſphemy. So ignorant are theſe men, and their learned guides alſo; who perſuade them the more they have of the indwelling of the ſpirit of Chriſt, the better they ſhall be enabled to theſe legal duties. Nay, quoth the other, I can tell you more than all this; they make it an evidence of their good eſtate, even their ſanctification, and yet theſe men would make people believe they are againſt Popery.</item>
                           <item>"3. The third dividing tenet, by which theſe perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted their errors, was between the word of God and the ſpirit of God: And here theſe ſectaries had many pretty knacks to delude withal, and eſpecially to pleaſe the female ſex, they told of rare revelations of things to come from the ſpirit, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will bring you to a woman that preaches better goſpel than any of your black coats, that have been at the univerſity; a woman of another kind of ſpirit, who hath had many revelations of things to come, and for my part, ſaith he, I had rather hear ſuch a one that ſpeaks from the meer motion of the ſpirit, without any ſtudy at all, than any of your learned ſcholars, although they may be fuller of ſcripture—and admit they ſpeak by the help of the ſpirit, yet the other goes beyond them.</item>

To divide between Chriſt and his ordinances; and here they played their game to purpoſe, even caſting down all ordinances as carnal, and that becauſe they were polluted by the ordinance of man; as ſome of theſe ſectaries have ſaid to the miniſters of Chriſt, you have caſt off the croſs in baptiſm, but you would do well to caſt off baptiſm itſelf; as alſo for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's ſupper, for to make uſe of bread, or the juice of a ſilly grape, to repreſent the body and blood of Chriſt, they accounted it as bad as necromancy in miniſters of Chriſt to perform it." <hi>Johnſon's Hiſtory,</hi> p. 67—94</item>

               <p>MR. Wheelwright was brother in-law to Mrs. Anne Hutchinſon, who had been a principal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diviſion in the country about grace and works.

               <p>HERE opens ſomething that I never heard of till I found it upon the colony records. It was cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to elect their deputies twice a year, namely, in the ſpring and fall; but to chooſe them twice in one fall was an unprecedented act, of which I believe no parallel can be found from the foundation of the country to this day. It ſeems that a major vote of thoſe deputies, to execute the decrees of the late ſynod, could not be obtained, therefore the houſe was diſſolved, and a new one convened on Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 2, 1637; to whom a remonſtrance againſt thoſe former proceedings was preſented, ſigned by above ſixty men; of whom William Aſpinwall, who drew it, and John Coggſhall were members of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; but for which they were now excluded, and an order was ſent for Boſton to chooſe two other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties. Alſo, "John Oliver, juſtifying the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious libel called a remonſtrance or petition, was diſcharged from being a deputy in this court<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Maſſachuſetts Records—Winthrop. The remaining mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Aſſembly were Governor Winthrop, Deputy-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Dudley, John Endicot, John Humfrey, Richard Belling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Roger Harlakenden, Iſrael Stoughton, Simon Bradſtreet, and Increaſe Howel, Aſſiſtants, and 31 deputies. The houſe that was diſſolved in September had 26 deputies, of whom but IT were in this new houſe. Mr. Atherton Hough was one who was left out, though he was a magiſtrate two years before. John and Iſaac Heath, John Johnſon, Thomas Dynde, Nicholas Danforth, William Spencer, Samuel Appleton, Joſeph Metcalf, John Upham, and Thomas Gardner, were alſo of thoſe they left out.</p>

It appears by John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's hiſtory, p. 20, that he was here in 1628, but not agreeing with Mr. Endicot and others about church affairs, he betook himſelf to agriculture. He had planted himſelf upon the neck of land where Boſton ſtands, which from him was called Blax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's Point, when the Maſſachuſetts company firſt arrived with their charter.

               <p>"WHEREAS the opinions and revelations of Mr. Wheelwright and Mrs. Hutchinſon have ſeduced and led into dangerous errors many of the people of New-England, inſomuch as there is juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion that they, as others in Germany in former times, may upon ſome revelation make ſudden irruption upon thoſe that differ from them in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for prevention whereof it is ordered that all thoſe whoſe names are underwritten (upon warning given at their dwelling-houſes) before the 30th day of this month of November, deliver in at Mr. Keayne's houſe, at Boſton, all ſuch guns, piſtols, ſwords, powder, ſhot and match, as they ſhall be owners of, or have in their cuſtody, upon pain of 10<abbr>l.</abbr> for every default to be made thereof; which arms are to be kept by Mr. Keayne till this court ſhall take further order therein.

               <p>DIRECTLY upon the foregoing act the Aſſembly added the following, viz. "The court being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of great diſorders growing in this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, through the contempts which have been of late put upon the civil authority, and intending to provide remedy for the ſame in tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </q> The effects of theſe proceedings we ſhall ſoon ſee; though by the way it is proper to obſerve, that as Mr. Williams had been inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of procuring the Narraganſets help againſt the Pequods, the ſeveral colonies ſent out their forces againſt them, and Governor Winthrop ſays, May 24, "By letters from Mr. Williams we were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that Capt. Maſon was gone to Saybrook with 80 Engliſh and 100 Indians," &amp;c. ſo that he was conſtantly engaged for their good; the army was ſucceſsful, the Pequods were ſubdued, and I find a propoſal of a day of thankſgiving for the ſoldiers return, at the General Court, Auguſt 1. But at the ſame time they ſay "Mr. John Greene, of New-Providence, having ſpoken againſt the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates contemptuouſly, ſtands bound over in 100 marks to appear at the next quarter court." At that court he was fined 20<abbr>l.</abbr> and committed till it was paid; though upon a ſubmiſſive petition to the General Court, Sept. 26, he was releaſed<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. He with others had reſorted to Mr. Williams's planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which there was a great addition the next ſpring, as well as a new one begun at Rhode-Iſland, of which take the following account:</p>
               <p>MR. John Clarke, a learned phyſician, who I find was admitted a freeman at Boſton May 6, 1635, as his brother Joſeph had been the March before, ſeeing how things were turned at the court in November, 1637, he made a propoſal to his friends, for <hi>peace ſake,</hi> and to enjoy the <hi>freedom of their conſciences,</hi> to remove out of that juriſdiction. The motion was accepted, and he (being then a gentleman in his 29th year) was requeſted with ſome others to look out for a place; they did ſo,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:015240_0100_0FA371B6C939FBF8"/>and by reaſon of the heat of the preceding ſummer, they firſt went northerly into that which is now the province of New-Hampſhire; but the coldneſs of the following winter made them incline to turn the other way. "So having ſought the Lord for direction, they agreed that while their veſſel was paſſing about Cape-Cod they would croſs over by land, having Long-Iſland and Delaware bay in their eye, for the place of their reſidence. At Providence Mr. Williams lovingly entertained them, and being conſulted about their deſign, readily preſented two places before them; Sowams, now called Barrington, and Aquetneck, now Rhode-Iſland. They being determined to go out of the other juriſdictions, Mr. Williams, Mr. Clarke, and two others, went to Plymouth to enquire how the caſe ſtood; who lovingly entertained them, and let them know that they claimed Sowams, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them to ſettle at Aquetneck, and promiſed that they ſhould be looked upon as free, and to be treated and aſſiſted as loving neighbours." Upon their return nineteen men incorporated themſelves into a body politic, and choſe Mr. Coddington to be their Judge or chief magiſtrate.<note n="*" place="bottom">Clarke's Narrative.—Callender's Sermon.</note>."</p>
               <p>Now to take things in their order, it is to be obſerved, that though Mr. Williams and a few of his friends had, with the conſent of the Narraganſet ſachems, been ſettled at Providence near two years, yet the firſt deed of the place that is extant bears date the ſame day with that of Aquetneck; and is as follows:</p>

                           <hi>Hiſtory of Providence.</hi> The Maſſachuſetts were ſo far from favouring this cauſe, that their General Court of March 12, 1638, paſſed this act, viz. "Whereas a letter was ſent unto this court, ſubſcribed by John Greene, dated from New-Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and brought by one of that Company, wherein the court is charged with <hi>uſurping the power of Chriſt over the Churches and mens conſciences,</hi> notwithſtanding he had formerly acknowledged his fault in ſuch ſpeeches by him before uſed; it is now ordered, that the ſaid John Greene ſhall not come into this juriſdiction, upon pain of impriſonment and further cenſure.

                        <p>Lamentable caſe indeed! that no inhabitant of that infant plantation, who were not able to ſend out ſhipping themſelves, might go into the colony, where many of the neceſſaries as well as comforts of life were only to be obtained by them; but they muſt either be expoſed to diſſemble, or to ſuffer impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, if not worſe; for how could they honeſtly declare that the Maſſachuſetts did not uſurp a power over men's conſciences!</p>

               </p>
               <p>NONE might have a voice in government in this new plantation, who would not allow this liberty. Hence about this time I find the following town act, viz. "It was agreed that Joſhua Verin, upon

It appears from Mr. Hubbard, that the way in which he reſtrained that liberty was, in not letting his wife go to Mr. Williams's meeting ſo often as ſhe was called for. Verin ſoon removed to Barbados, and left his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Providence in ſuch a ſtate as has cauſed much trouble ſince.</p>

And why do the people <hi>love to have it ſo?</hi> Certainly the ſupport of good order and government in the church is of greater importance than miniſters maintenance; and to vindicate the methods then taken to ſupport the former of theſe, Mr. Cotton brought that plain text, <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely kill him, becauſe he hath ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God;</hi> and, ſaid he, <q>this reaſon is of moral, that is, of univerſal <g ref="char:startq">“</g>

Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Winthrop informs us, that the next May after the above laws were paſſed, Mr. Cotton, in preaching from Heb. viii. 8, taught <q>that when <g ref="char:startq">“</g>magiſtrates are forced to proceed for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of miniſters, &amp;c. then the churches are in a declining ſtate.

                  </q> But the law to impower their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive court to puniſh excommunicates, for diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the churches authority, was repealed the next

<pb n="101" facs="unknown:015240_0112_0FA371BFCB69C890"/>ſame ſword as they do miniſters maintenance? Is not God's honor of greater concernment than men's livings are! A college was founded this year in Newtown, which for that reaſon was called Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge; and the importance of receiving <hi>learning</hi> at that or like places, to qualify men for the miniſtry, has been much inſiſted upon ever ſince; and thoſe who have not been educated at ſuch places have commonly been called <hi>laymen.</hi> And among the many reflections that have been caſt upon them, one is, that they often beg the queſtion in argument. But who are guilty of this mean ſort of conduct now? The queſtion between us is not, whether it be the duty of thoſe who are taught to communicate unto their teachers or not; but it is, whether that duty ought to be enforced by the ſword, or only by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, perſuaſion and good example?

               <p>We are now come to an event which has made much noiſe in the world, I mean Mr. Williams's baptiſm. The reader may remember that he was charged with advancing principles at Plymouth that tended to Anabaptiſm, and that he filled Salem therewith; and could he have found an agreeable adminiſtrator, it is not likely that he would have neglected the putting of this principle into practice ſo long as he did. At length, being in ſuch a ſtate of exile in a heathen land, it is probable he conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the caſe about baptiſm, which Mr. Robinſon recites, was applicable to theirs, which is in theſe words:</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Williams took ſuch a method, with only this difference, that one of the community was firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to baptize him, and then he baptized the reſt; for Mr. Hubbard, ſays he, <q>was baptized by <g ref="char:startq">“</g>one Holliman, then Mr. Williams rebaptized him, <g ref="char:endq">”</g>and ſome ten more.</q> With this Governor Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp agrees, and ſets the date of it in March, 1639. The Governor called Holliman a poor man, and Hubbard ſtiles him a mean fellow; but after the year 1650 I find him more than once a deputy from the town of Warwick in their General Court. The above gentlemen repreſent that Mrs. Hutchinſon's ſiſter, the wife of one Scott, ſtirred Mr. Williams up to this action; though afterward Mr. Hubbard does not pretend to certainty as to that, and ſays it was difficult for one to give an exact account of their religious affairs in that colony, that did not live among them; and it is certain that he and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor were both miſtaken in calling "thoſe of Providence <hi>all Anabaptiſts.</hi>" For it appears from under Mr. Williams's own hand, ſeventeen years after, that Arnold and Carpenter, two of the firſt twelve, were not ſuch<note n="‡" place="bottom">Maſſachuſetts Hiſtory, vol. 3, p. 277.</note>; neither have I met with any proof that Gorton, Weſton or Waterman, who went to Warwick, were ever of that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation<note n="†" place="bottom">This Baptiſt church at Providence appears to be the ſecond diſtinct ſociety of that denomination in all the Britiſh empire.

               <p>An evident cauſe of Mr. Williams's refraining from a farther proceeding in church ordinances, was an apprehenſion of the neceſſity of a <hi>viſible ſucceſſion</hi> of regular ordinations from the apoſtles, to impower men to it, which ſucceſſion he could not find: Yet how fond are many miniſters in our day of this <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive</hi> notion? A miniſter's preaching upon it was vindicated in the Boſton Evening-Poſt of May 9, 1774, which informs us that the preacher ſaid, <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>God the Father ſent forth the Son; he ſent forth the apoſtles as the Father ſent him; they ſent forth others, with command to <hi>commit</hi> theſe things to <hi>faithful men.</hi> And the preacher ſaid that Chriſt had never committed this power (to put into office)
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:015240_0121_0FA371C6901E4820"/>to any but ſuch as were in office; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <g ref="char:endq">”</g>no other had a power to put out of office.</q> But I am not afraid boldly to aſſert, that I verily believe, according to this doctrine, there is not a miniſter this day under heaven but what muſt ſtop from adminiſtring baptiſm, as Mr. Williams did, if they were as <hi>honeſt</hi> as he was. A miniſter in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut a few years ago publiſhed a pamphlet to ſupport the above opinion; wherein, to get over the difficulty that ariſes for want of any proof of ſuch a lineal ſucceſſion, he obſerved that none under the law were to be prieſts but the lawful poſterity of Aaron; yet ſuppoſing a baſtard ſon of that family ſhould have poſterity, in ſo long a ſucceſſion that the knowledge of his illegitimacy was loſt, he aſſerted that ſuch prieſts might well be admitted into office with others. According to which doctrine, <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> muſt be very detrimental to ſuch prieſts, and <hi>ignorance</hi> muſt be the mother of ſuch devotion. The miniſter who publiſhed ſaid pamphlet is a truſtee of Yale College; and likely he is better acquainted with philoſophy and ſchool divinity than he is with his bible, or elſe he would have known that <hi>Ezra the prieſt, a ſcribe of the law of the God of heaven</hi> (in diſtinction from all <hi>earthly gods</hi>) refuſed to admit or ſuffer men upon <hi>negatives:</hi> And ſuch as <hi>ſought,</hi> but could not <hi>find</hi> THEIR REGISTER, <hi>were, as polluted, put from the prieſthood.</hi> Ezra ii. 62. And if we review the text that is now ſo much harped upon, we ſhall find that the <hi>apoſtolic ſucceſſion</hi> is in the line of <hi>faithful men,</hi> and no others are truly in it, though <hi>falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> have ſometimes <hi>crept in unawares.</hi>

               <p>I would juſt add, that though the expreſs rule to Iſrael was, that every male muſt <hi>needs</hi> be circumciſed at eight days old, or be <hi>cut off</hi> from their people, yet this general rule was ſo far diſpenſed with in a particular caſe, that circumciſion was omitted forty years in the wilderneſs; and multitudes of them ſtood before God, and <hi>entered into</hi> or renewed their father Abraham's covenant in the plains of Moab, who yet were not circumciſed till after they came over Jordan.

               <p>Mr. Pelatiah Maſon, who was born near Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ferry in 1669, told his ſons (three of whom are now public preachers in Swanzey) that he heard from the fathers of that day, that in the trial they then had, they heard that the Queen of Hungary, or ſome in thoſe parts, had a regiſter of a regular ſucceſſion from the apoſtles, and had thoughts of ſending Mr. Thomas Olney (who ſucceeded Mr. Williams as their paſtor) into that country for it; but at length concluded that ſuch a courſe was not expedient, but believing they were now got into the right way, determined to perſevere therein.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hubbard ſpeaking of that colony ſays, "as to matters of religion, it was hard to give an exact account to the world of their proceedings therein, by any who have not been converſant with them from the beginning of their plantations; yet this was commonly ſaid by all that ever had any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be among them, that they always agreed in this principle, <hi>that no man or company of men ought to be moleſted by the civil power upon the account of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or for any opinion received or practiſed in any matter of that nature; accounting it no ſmall part of their happineſs that they may therein be left to their own liberty;</hi> by which means the inhabitants are of many different perſuaſions. But what tendency that liberty had, by ſo long experience, towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the power of godlineſs, and purity of religion, they are beſt able to judge that have had occaſion to be moſt converſant amongſt them."</p>
               <p>By this and many other paſſages, that learned writer, as well as Governor Winthrop, diſcovered more candor of mind toward Mr. Williams and Rhode-Iſland colony, than almoſt any other of the Maſſachuſetts writers have ever done, firſt or laſt.

               <p>Mr. Lenthal went to Rhode-Iſland, was admitted a freeman there on Auguſt 6, 1640; and he kept ſchool and preached there for a while, but before March, 1642, was gone for England.

               <p>At a General Court at Boſton, Oct. 8, 1640, "it is ordered, that the letter lately ſent to the Governor by Mr. Eaton, Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Haynes, Mr. Coddington, and Mr. Brenton, but coming alſo to the General Court, ſhall be thus anſwered by the Governor, that the court doth aſſent to all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions laid down in the aforeſaid letter, but that the anſwer ſhall be directed to Mr. Eaton, Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Haynes only, excluding Mr. Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington

And at an aſſembly in Newport, Sept. 19, 1642, they appointed Meſſrs.

They accordingly ſent over by Mr. Williams, and obtained their requeſt; though in the mean time a moſt dreadful broil broke out, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to a terrible degree among them, of which take the following account.</p>
               <p>Samuel Gorton, a man of learning from London, arrived at Boſton in 1636, and doubtleſs had a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable hand in the myſtical diſputes that then embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. From thence he went to Plymouth, where he treated their paſtor Mr. Smith in ſuch a manner, as cauſed the authority to take him in hand, and required bonds of him for his good behaviour. This occaſioned his departure to Rhode-Iſland, where ſuch a difficulty aroſe, that by Mr. Coddington's order he was impriſoned and whipt. From thence he came to Providence, where he was kindly treated by Mr. Williams and others; and he and his friends
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:015240_0130_0FA371CD5EC77888"/>ſat down at Pawtuxet, now called Cranſton. I find by the records that Mr. Gorton bought half of Robert Cole's intereſt there on Jan. 10, 1641. And as the court at Newport in March following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed Richard Carder, Randal Holden, Sampſon Shatton, and Robert Potter, they and John Wickes. who had followed Gorton from Plymouth, came and formed a conſiderable party at Pawtuxet. And ſuch a contention was raiſed between them and the former inhabitants, <q>as they came armed into the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>field, each againſt other; but Mr. Williams pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified them for the preſent. This cauſed the weaker party to write a letter to the Maſſachuſetts rulers, complaining of the wrong they ſuffered, deſiring aid, or if not, counſel from us. We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, that we could not levy war without a General Court. For counſel we told them, that except they would ſubmit to ſome juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (Plymought, or &amp;c.) we had no calling or warrant to interpoſe in their contentions, but if they would ſubmit to any, then they had a call to <g ref="char:endq">”</g>protect them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Winthrop—Hubbard.</note>
                  </q> How different was the temper here diſcovered, from that of the pious Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams? He was ever ready wherever he came to exert all his influence to make peace ſo far as he could with a good conſcience, but the court at Boſton ſeemed willing to play one party againſt another, till all would ſubmit to their power. Gorton took a like method to defend himſelf againſt them; the conſequence of which was terrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; the true ſtate whereof I ſhall give with all the exactneſs I can.</p>
               <p>William Arnold, Robert Cole, William Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Benedict Arnold, of Pawtuxet, went to the General Aſſembly at Boſton, Sept. 8, 1642, and

Benedict Arnold and Ahauton, the Indian, were to be their guides and interpreters<note n="†" place="bottom">Hubbard—Maſſachuſetts Records.</note>. Then, October 28, a warrant was ſent from Boſton to cite Gorton and his friends to come to their court, to anſwer to the complaints of Arnold's company againſt them, ſigned by the Governor and three aſſiſtants. To this an anſwer was returned on Nov. 20, ſigned by Samuel Gorton, Randal Holden, Robert Potter, John Wickes, John Warner, Richard Waterman, William Woodale, John Greene, Francis Weſton, Richard Carder, Nicholas Power and Sampſon Shatton. It contained a long myſtical paraphraſe upon their warrant, and many provoking ſentences againſt thoſe rulers and their miniſters, and a refuſal to come to them.

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:015240_0132_0FA371CEC83ED318"/>Arnold to ſpeak with Mr. Greene, Warner, and their company. On June 22 through Benedict Arnold's influence and aſſiſtance, Pumham, Sachem of Shawomet, and Sacanocho, Sachem of Pawtuxet, ſigned at Boſton a ſubmiſſion of their perſons and lands to that government; and Arnold was allowed 4 <abbr>l.</abbr> for his pains<note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Maſſachuſetts Records.</hi> The colonies of Maſſachuſetts, Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, Connecticut and New-Haven, by their commiſſioners; ſigned articles of confederation together for mutual aſſiſtance and defence on May 19, 1643, from whence they were called the united colonies.</note>. Governor Winthrop tells us that they had 2 or 300 men under them. The plea for this action was, that Gorton's company and Miantinomu had oppreſſed theſe Sachems, and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of their lands. Pumham ſaid he was forced to ſign the deed, but would take none of the pay. The Governor, with another magiſtrate, wrote to Shawomet people about it; and alſo to Miantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu, and he came down and met ſaid Sachems at Boſton, where they were forced to confeſs that they had ſometimes ſent him preſents, and had aided him in his wars againſt the Pequods; yet they and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold would have it, that they were as free Sachems as he was, becauſe their people paid tribute to them. So the court received them (as is before noted) under their protection. We are told that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, Gorton and his company had ſent a writing of four ſheets, <q>full of reproaches againſt the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>magiſtrates, miniſters and churches, and ſtuffed likewiſe with abſurd familiſtial ſtuff, and wherein they juſtified the purchaſe of the Sachems lands, <g ref="char:endq">”</g>and profeſſed to maintain it to the death<note n="*" place="bottom">Hubbard.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Miantinomu had already ſeen Uncas, a warlike Sachem to the weſt of him, putting himſelf and his people under the protection of the Engliſh; and
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:015240_0133_0FA371CF88CD0188"/>he was accuſed of hiring a young Pequod to murder Uncas, but he brought the young man with him, who told the court that Uncas cut his own arm with a flint, and then charged him to report that Mian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomu had hired him to murder him. But upon private examination, the court were perſuaded the young man was guilty, and adviſed Miantinomu to ſend him to Uncas; but inſtead of doing it, he cut off his head by the way, as he returned home<note n="*" place="bottom">Johnſon, p. 182—184.</note>. What followed till his own death, we have recorded by Governor Winthrop, in a more diſtinct and clear light than has ever been publiſhed, I ſhall therefore give it to the reader in his own words.</p>
               <p>Auguſt. "Onkus being provoked by Sequaſſion, a Sachem of Connecticut (who would not be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the magiſtrates there to a reconciliation) made war upon him, and ſlew divers of his men, and burnt up his wigwams; whereupon Miantinomu, being his kinſman, took offence againſt Onkus, and went with near one thouſand men, and ſet upon Onkus before he could be provided for defence; for he had not then with him above three or four hundred men. But it pleaſed God to give Onkus the victory, after he had killed about thirty of the Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, and wounded many more: And among theſe, two of Canonicus's ſons, and a brother of Mian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomu, who fled; for having on a <hi>coat of mail</hi>

But ſo ſoon as they came to Onkus he ſlew them preſently; and Miantinomu ſtanding mute, he demanded of him, why he would not ſpeak? If you had taken me (ſaith he) I would have beſought
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:015240_0134_0FA371D0485243A8"/>you for my life, &amp;c. The news of Miantinomu's captivity coming to Providence, Gorton and his company wrote a letter to Onkus, willing him to deliver their friend Miantinomu, and threatned him with the power of the Engliſh if he refuſed. Upon this Onkus carries Miantinomu to Hartford to take advice of the magiſtrates there; and, at Miantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu's earneſt entreaty, he left him with them, yet as a priſoner. They kept him under guard, but uſed him very courteouſly. So he continued till the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the united colonies met at Boſton<note n="†" place="bottom">In September.</note>, who taking into ſerious conſideration what was ſafeſt and beſt to be done, were all of opinion that it would not be ſafe to ſet him at liberty; neither had we ſufficient ground for us to put him to death. In this difficulty we called in five of the moſt judicious elders (it being in the time of the general aſſembly of the elders) and propounding the caſe to them, they all agreed that he ought to be put to death. Upon this concurrence we enjoined ſecreſy upon ourſelves and them, leſt if it ſhould come to the notice of the Narraganſets, they might attempt ſomewhat againſt Hartford for this reaſon, or might ſet upon the commiſſioners, &amp;c. upon their return, to take ſome of them to redeem him (as Miantinomu him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had told Mr. Haynes had been in conſultation amongſt them) and agreed that upon the return of the commiſſioners to Hartford, they ſhould ſend for Onkus, and tell him our determination, that Mian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomu ſhould be delivered to him again, and he ſhould put him to death ſo ſoon as he came within his own juriſdiction, and that the Engliſh ſhould go along with him to ſee the execution. And if any Indians ſhould invade him for it, we would ſend men to defend him. If Onkus ſhould refuſe to do it,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:015240_0135_0FA371D10DF06BA0"/>then Miantinomu ſhould be ſent in a pinnace to Boſton, there to be kept until further conſideration.</p>

                     <item>1. It was now clearly diſcovered to us that there was a general conſpiracy among the Indians to cut off the Engliſh, and that Miantinomu was the head and contriver of it.</item>
                     <item>2. He was of a turbulent and proud ſpirit, and would never be at reſt.</item>
                     <item>3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had promiſed us in the open court to ſend the Pequod to Onkus, who had ſhot him in the arm, with intent to have killed him (which was by the procurement of Miantinomu, as did probably appear) yet in his way homeward he killed him.</item>
                     <item>4. He beat one of Pumham's men, and took away his wampam, and then bid him go and complain to the Maſſachuſetts. According to this agreement the commiſſioners, at their return to Connecticut, ſent for Onkus, and acquainted him herewith, who readily undertook the execution; and taking Mian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinoma along with him, in the way between Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and Windſor (where Onkus hath ſome men dwell) Onkus's brother following after Miantinomu, clave his head with an hatcher, ſome Engliſh being preſent.

               <p>Alas! when good men get into an evil path, where will it carry them? The next news we hear is as follows. September 12, the General Court ſent a warrant to require Gorton and his company to come to Boſton, to anſwer the Indians complaints againſt them. To which they ſent a verbal anſwer, that they were out of that juriſdiction, and would own ſubjection to none but the government of Old.

               <p>Hearing of their coming, Gorton's company ſent a letter to meet them, dated September 28, to let them know, that if they came in a way of loving neighbourhood, they were welcome; but if with a band of ſoldiers, they charged them not to ſet foot on their land at their peril. The commiſſioners
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:015240_0137_0FA371D28943D380"/>wrote a reply, ſignifying their great deſire of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converſation with them, with hope of reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from their errors; but if that could not be done, that they ſhould then <q>look upon them as <g ref="char:startq">“</g>men prepared for ſlaughter, and accordingly ſhould addreſs themſelves with all convenient <g ref="char:endq">”</g>ſpeed;</q> which we may well ſuppoſe was very ſurprizing to their wives and children, and it is ſaid it ſcattered and occaſioned ſome of their deaths. Some of the people of Providence went with thoſe commiſſioners and ſoldiers, and procured a parley with Shawoment men, who demanded the reaſon of this proceeding; to which the others anſwered, that they had done wrong to certain of their ſubjects, and alſo held blaſphemous errors. Shawomet men offered to appeal to England, but that was refuſed; then they offered to leave the controverſy to indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent men in this country. This appeared ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that a truce was agreed upon, till they could ſend to Boſton to know the mind of the court upon it. And Chad Brown, Thomas Olney, William Field, and William Wickenden, of Providence, wrote a letter to perſuade the rulers of the Maſſachuſetts to comply with this propoſal. But an anſwer was returned, dated October 3, refuſing any ſuch thing<note n="*" place="bottom">Gorton's Defence.</note>.

               </p>
               <p>This plain account of the reaſons and motives they acted upon, takes off the edge in ſome meaſure of Gorton's keen ſatire upon them, which he wrote from Warwick, Sept. 16, 1656, to the firſt Quakers that were impriſoned in Boſton, ſaying, <q>I marvel <g ref="char:startq">“</g>what manner of God your adverſaries truſt in, who is ſo fearful of being infected with error, or how they think they ſhall eſcape the wiles and power of the devil, when the arm of fleſh fails them, whereby they ſeek to defend themſelves for the preſent; ſure they think their God will be grown to more power and care over them, in and after <g ref="char:endq">”</g>death, or elſe they will be loth to paſs through it.</q>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:015240_0142_0FA371D64CCC1B98"/>Which remark is cutting indeed, if we leave out any conſideration of duty in the caſe; but if that be brought in, then it is preſumption, and not faith, to expect protection and ſupport from God in a way of diſregard of the means of his appointment. Hence, the error of ſuppoſing that God has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the uſe of ſecular force in religious affairs, ought to bear all the blame and ſcandal of thoſe cruel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and inſtead of venting our reſentment againſt our dead fathers, let theſe things rouſe the living to repentance and reformation. Thoſe fathers could find warrant enough in the old teſtament for the uſe of force againſt idolaters and blaſphemers; but the uſe of force to collect the prieſts ſupport was plainly cenſured in thoſe time. With what face then can thoſe who profeſs to be under the <hi>law of liberty,</hi> forcibly take a farthing from any to maintain profeſſed miniſters of HIM who has ſaid, <hi>freely ye have received, freely give;</hi> and who commanded his diſciples to <hi>ſhake off,</hi> and therefore not to carry away, ſo much as <hi>the duſt</hi> of a city or houſe that would not receive them!</p>
               <p>It is likely that the reader would want to know what Gorton's ſentiments really were, which were ſo offenſive. To this I anſwer, that he evidently was a man of ſmart capacity, and of conſiderable learning, and when he pleaſed could expreſs his ideas as plainly as any man; but he uſed ſuch a myſtical method in handling the ſcriptures, and in ſpeaking about religion, that people are not agreed to this day in what his real ſentiments were. It is ſo common for parties to miſrepreſent the opinions of their opponents, that little regard is paid by many to what the Maſſachuſetts have ſaid againſt him. I will therefore give a taſte of what he publiſhed to the world, not in a way of controverſy, but of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:015240_0143_0FA371D70DA30338"/>friendly correſpondence with the aforeſaid priſoners at Boſton. He firſt wrote a letter to them of the date I have given; to which they returned an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; then he made a reply, October 6, 1656, wherein he gives various remarks upon the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments expreſſed in their letter, and ſays,</p>

Beſides their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about goſpel doctrines, they evidently differed in the following points of practice.
<list>
                     <item>1. Mr. Williams uſed great <hi>plainneſs of ſpeech,</hi> ſo that his meaning was obvious to common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; but Mr. Gorton's writings are not ſo.</item>
                     <item>2. Mr. Williams openly ſtood for what he believed to be the truth, in the face of the greateſt danger; but when Mr. Gorton ſaw himſelf greatly expoſed in Boſton, he explained their myſtical writings in ſuch a manner, that Governor Winthrop ſaid, "he could agree with him in his anſwer, though not in their writings<note n="*" place="bottom">Gorton's Defence.</note>."</item>
                     <item>3. Mr. Williams ſet a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of overcoming evil with good; but Mr. Gorton was ſadly enſnared in rendering evil for evil, and railing for railing. Though after he had been to England, and obtained liberty to return to and enjoy the lands they had purchaſed, he and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of his ſuffering companions became very uſeful members of civil ſociety. But as corruption is ever the moſt dangerous when covered with a religious maſk, it is of great importance for us all to learn to diſtinguiſh between that and true religion. Paul ſaid to the contending Corinthians, <hi>are ye not carnal and walk as men?</hi> The ſame query may be made concerning thoſe contentions betwixt Gorton and his opponents.</item>

               <p>The Maſſachuſetts profeſſed a high regard to their charter, when they baniſhed Mr. Williams; but that gave them no right to any land or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, further than three miles ſouth of their bay, and of every part of Charles rives; and that line croſſes the great poſt road near landlord Maxcy's, in Attleborough, from whence to Pawtuxet river is 19 miles, and Shawomet is ſtill further ſouthward; yet we are plainly told that Arnold and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were received <q>partly to draw in the reſt, either <g ref="char:startq">“</g>

                  <hi>Hubbard.</hi> And when Gorton and his friends were got out of Arnold's reach, two petty ſachems were taken in to found a claim upon, though it was known that Miantinomu was ſo much above them, that he ſold Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Pawtuxet over their heads ſome years before, in which was contained the beſt title that Arnold's company had to their lands. What work then did they make, in firſt enticing ſubjects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from their prince, and then in killing him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was uneaſy about it! Had they not been blinded with ſuch a zeal as the diſciples had, when they were for having fire to come down and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Samaritans, ſurely they would not have violated the rules of juſtice and equity as they did. They tried afterwards to vindicate their conduct by the claim of Plymouth to that land, and upon an act of the commiſſioners of the united colonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſachusetts Hiſtory, vol. 1, p. 122.</note> But Plymouth patent extended no father weſtward than Narraganſet river, that is Oſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maquin or Maſaſſoit's territories<note n="†" place="bottom">Prince's Chron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="136" facs="unknown:015240_0147_0FA371DA0BBC8440"/>with Uncas without firſt appealing to the Engliſh, yet had broken that agreement<note n="§" place="bottom">Maſſachuſetts Hiſtory, vol. 3, p. 140.</note>. But a very cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible writer of their own informs us, that Mianti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomu firſt ſent his complaint to Hartford againſt Uncas; and when they refuſed to meddle in Sequaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion's quarrel, he would know whether they would be offended if he ſhould make war upon Uncas? And that they left him to take his courſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Hubbard.</note> ſo that their caſe in truth was, like that of other invaders of their neighbour's rights; they were in danger of being awfully requited, by a man ſo ſenſible and powerful as Miantinomu, if he was not taken out of the way. This evil is greatly to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and ſhould ever ſtand as a ſolemn warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us all, to beware of taking one ſtep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any courſe of injuſtice, deceit, or cruelty; for it will ſurely prove bitterneſs in the latter end.</p>
               <p>Had Gorton been duly aware of this, he would not have armed Miantinomu againſt Uncas, for no better reaſon, that we know of, than becauſe he, being a warlike prince, ſtood in the way of his form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Indian party ſufficient to withſtand or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Maſſachuſetts; which proceeding, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his irritating writings againſt their rulers and miniſters, were the evident cauſe of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried to the dreadful extremity they were. Mr. Williams ever bore as plain and full teſtimony againſt their perſecuting any man for matters of conſcience, as Gorton could; and had a much greater influence over the Indians than he ever had; yet he was ſo far from trying to raiſe a heathen par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt Chriſtians, to correct them for injuries done to himſelf, that he exerted himſelf with great aſſiduity to prevent any thing of that nature; by
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:015240_0148_0FA371DACD0ABAD8"/>which he undoubtedly was the greateſt inſtrument of ſaving New-England of any one man that lived in that day, and for which his <hi>memory</hi> is and will be <hi>bleſſed.</hi>

               <p>Among the reaſoners of our world, ſome will not allow, that men are influenced in all their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary actions by previous cauſes and motives, while others incline ſo much to infidelity as to repreſent, that the very notion of religion, or of perſons think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Deity loves them better than others, tends to make them hate and treat thoſe ill who, as they ſuppoſe, are not thus beloved. But as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing teaches like experience, lot the light which facts give in the caſe be regarded, beyond all the ſuppoſition or wrangles of diſputants. Is is not evident, that thoſe ſeveral contending parties were influenced in all their bad actions by the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ambition, avarice, deceit, and reſentment, that other men are? And is it not as evident, that thoſe actions which were good and praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy flowed from a hearty belief of revealed religion, eſpecially of free ſalvation by Chriſt Jeſus? At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we will take a view of the head men of the three parties of Boſon, Warwick and Providence.</p>
               <p>Governor Winthrop was in ſuch eſteem in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, as to be made a juſtice of peace at the age of eighteen, had an eſtate of ſix or ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds ſterling per annum; yet ſold it, and ſpent the main of it in promoting a religious ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this wilderneſs; where for all his vaſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains, in ſettling and managing the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he for ſome years had no ſtated ſalary, and never had more than one hundred pounds a year; was ſeveral times very ungratefully treated by his own people; and what could carry him
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:015240_0149_0FA371DB89CE77B0"/>through all this, with chearfulneſs to the end, but the power of religion<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>What his religious ſentiments were, the reader may form ſome judgment by the following extracts. In the firſt part of his adminiſtrations as Governor, he ſaid, "in the infancy of plantations, juſtice ſhould be adminiſtred with more lenity than in a ſettled ſtate; becauſe people are more apt then to tranſgreſs; partly out of ignorance of new laws and orders, partly out of oppreſſion of buſineſs and other ſtraits. But when ſome leading and learned men took offence at his conduct in this matter, and upon a conference, gave it as their opinion, that a ſtricter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline was to be uſed in the beginning of a plantation than after its being with more age eſtabliſhed and confirmed, the Governor being readier to ſee his own errors than other men's, profeſſed his purpoſe to endeavour their ſatisfaction with leſs lenity in his adminiſtrations." From whence we may gueſs at the cauſe of the ſeverities we have been treating of.</p>
                     <p>His expences were great, and for two years he had no ſettled ſalary, yet the divine precept againſt taking bribes, had ſuch influence upon his mind, that when he was the third time choſen Governor, May 8, 1632, he told the people publicly, "that he had received gratuities from divers towns, which he received with much comfort and content; he had alſo received many kindneſſes from particular perſons, which he could not refuſe, leſt he ſhould be accounted uncourteous, &amp;c. but he profeſſed he received them with a trembling heart, in regard to <hi>God's rule,</hi> and the conſciouſneſs of his own infirmity, and therefore deſired that hereafter they would not take it ill if he ſhould refuſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from particular perſons, except the aſſiſtance of ſome ſpecial friends. To which to anſwer was made; but he is told after, that many good people were much grieved at it, <hi>for that he never had any allowance toward the charge of his place."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After he had acted in baniſhing Mr. Wheelwright and others, many of their friends in Boſton church, whereof he was a member, were earneſt with the elders to have the church call him forth as an offender, for paſſing that ſentence; which he underſtanding, took occaſion to make a public ſpeech to them upon it, in which he ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"As for myſelf, I did nothing in the cauſes of any of the <hi>brethren,</hi> but by advice of the <hi>elders</hi> of the church. Moreover, in the oath which I have taken there is this clauſe, <hi>in all cauſes wherein you are to give your vote, you ſhall do as in you judgment and conſcience you ſhall ſee to be juſt, and for the public good.</hi> And I am ſatisfied it is moſt for the glory of God, and the public good, that there be ſuch a ſentence paſſed; yea, thoſe brethren are ſo divided from the reſt of the country in their opinions and practices, that it cannot ſtand with the <hi>public peace</hi> for them to continue with us; Abraham ſaw that Hagar and Iſhmael muſt be ſent away."</p>
                     <p>Seven years after, upon a hot debate between the magiſtrates and deputies about who ſhould have the negative vote, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Winthrop wrote his mind upon it, ſome paſſages, whereof gave offence to ſome noted men, which he underſtanding, made the following ſpeech at the next General Court, viz. "As for the <hi>matter</hi> of my writing, I had the concurrence of my brethren; it is a point of <hi>judgment</hi> which is not at my own diſpoſing. I have examined it over and over again, by ſuch <hi>light</hi> as God has given me, from the rules of religion, reaſon and cuſtom; and I ſee no cauſe to retract any thing of it: Wherefore I muſt enjoy my <hi>liberty</hi> in that, as you do yourſelves. But for the <hi>manner,</hi> this, and all that was blame-worthy in it, was wholly <hi>my own;</hi> and whatſoever I might alledge for my own juſtification before <hi>man,</hi> I wave it, as now ſetting myſelf before <hi>another judgment-ſeat.</hi> However, what I wrote was upon great provocation, and to vindicate myſelf and others from great aſperſion; yet that was no ſufficient warrant for me to allow any <hi>diſtemper of ſpirit</hi> in myſelf; and I doubt I have been too prodigal of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren's reputation. I might have maintained my cauſe without caſting any blemiſh upon others. When I made that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>and now let religion and ſound reaſon give judgment in the caſe,</hi> it looked as if I arrogated too much unto myſelf, and too little to others: And when I made that profeſſion, <hi>that I would maintain what I wrote before all the world,</hi> though ſuch words might modeſtly be ſpoken, yet I perceive an unbeſeeming pride of my own heart breathing in them. For theſe failings I aſk pardon both of God and man."</p>
                     <p>Once more; when a great diſturbance had been made in the colony by Dr. Child and others, in 1646, Governor Winthrop was called to an account for his actings againſt them, before a great aſſembly, but he was openly acquitted; upon which he ſaid, "though I am juſtified before men, yet it may be the Lord hath ſeen ſo much amiſs in my adminiſtrations, as calls me to be humbled; and indeed for me to have been thus charged by m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Gorton, as we have ſeen, had a notion that the child was born in him and his followers, who had the <hi>government upon his ſhoulders,</hi> and he concurred
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:015240_0151_0FA371DD0759D9E8"/>with Wheelwright in treating thoſe who oppoſed their religious ſentiments as <hi>enemies to the ſtate;</hi> which principle evidently moved him to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:015240_0152_0FA371DDCC22DB78"/>to raiſe what force he could againſt them, even from among the barbarians; and alſo to treat them with ſuch a temper as he did from time to time. Even ſo late as the year 1676, the very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the book he then publiſhed ſhews the ſpirit of it, which is exactly in theſe words, viz. <q>A <g ref="char:startq">“</g>glaſs for New-England, in which they may ſee themſelves and ſpirits, and if not too late, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turn from their abominable ways and <g ref="char:endq">”</g>curſed contrivances.

                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>I hope none will be ſo blind and ignorant as to ſet their poſts or threſholds to the devil's poſt, and the profeſſors of New-England's poſts, viz. their whipping-poſt or gallows-poſts; no nor yet join their threſhold to their gaol-threſholds, nor their bridewell-threſhold, over which and in which profeſſors and talkers of God and Chriſt do and have hauled over lambs and followers of Chriſt, and in which they crop their ears, and out of which they bring them in their <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>madneſs,</hi> and baniſh, whip and hang them in their <g ref="char:endq">”</g>blind zeal.</q> p. 17, 18. And he annexes to ſaid book a letter to Governor Bellingham, dat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Boſton priſon June 15, 1667, wrote by John Tyſo, a Quaker who ſpeaks of it as a great error in Dr. Increaſe Mather to ſay, <q>there was <g ref="char:startq">“</g>nothing IN him that he hoped to be ſaved by, and that there was none cleanſed from <hi>all ſin</hi> on

                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>brother Wheelwright's doctrine was according to God, in the point controverted, and wholly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together; and nothing did I hear alledged againſt the doctrine proved by the word of God.—But, (ſays G.) that which is moſt to be lamented, is that thoſe which once had a <hi>good teſtimony in their hearts</hi> and mouths for God, and his <hi>light and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual appearance;</hi> and they not being faithful and conſtant to that which is made manifeſt and <hi>committed to them,</hi> it has even happened to them according to the ſaying of the Lord God, by the mouth of his prophet, that <hi>in the day in which a righteous man turns from his righteouſneſs, and doth wickedly, all the righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall be forgotten, and in the ſin which he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <g ref="char:endq">”</g>he ſhall ſurely die the death.</hi>

               <p>Now is it not evident, that the Maſſachuſetts were moved by the ſame unreaſonable principle of graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at power and gain, that belonged not to them, in their dealings with Gorton, as operates in other men, though it went under a cloak of religion? And is it not as evident that he was moved with ſelf-conceit, and carnal wit and reſentment, in his carriage towards them, notwithſtanding all his talk of the child's being born in him, and of a creating power <q>for ever to form all things out of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <g ref="char:startq">“</g>

The occaſion of the war was this: An Indian being drunk, had ſlain an old Dutchman; the Dutch required the murderer, but he could not he had. The people called often upon the Governor to take revenge, but he ſtill put it off, becauſe he thought it not juſt, or not ſafe.

One Marine, a Dutch captain, bearing of it, went to the Governor and obtained a commiſſion to kill as many as he could of them; and accordingly went with a company of armed men, and ſet upon them, when they feared no ſuch thing from the Dutch, and killed 70 or 80 men, women and children. Upon this the Indians burnt divers of their farm houſes, and their cattle in them; and ſlew all they could meet with, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 20 or more, of men, women and children, and purſued hard upon the Dutch, even home to their ſort Aurana (Albany) that they were forced to call in the Engliſh to their aid, and entertained Captain Underhill in their ſervice. Marine was ſo much enraged to ſee Underhill preferred before him, that his Governor was forced at laſt to ſend him home in chains. About this time Captain Patrick, who went from Boſton, was ſhot dead by a Dutchman, upon a Lordſday, at Stamford. Though the people were all for war before, yet now they were ſo much offended with the Governor, that he entertained a guard of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Natural conſcience and the reverence of a Deity, that is deeply engraved on the hearts of all, make men more apt to favour them that ſuffer for religion, true or falſe." A judicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; yet in another inſtance we may ſee how party influence can blind great men. For this author in 1638 tells us of Arnold's oppoſing their cenſuring Verin at Providence, for refuſing to let his wife go to Mr. Williams's meeting ſo often as ſhe was called for, and repreſents that to cenſure Verin therefor, would be a breach of God's ordinance, about the <q>ſubjection <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                        <g ref="char:endq">”</g>of wives to their huſbands.</q> But the ſame author informs us, that in 1644 one Painter, a poor man, was ſuddenly turned Anabaptiſt, <q>and having a child born, would not ſuffer his wife <g ref="char:startq">“</g>to carry it to be baptized. He was complained of for this to the court, and <hi>enjoined</hi> by them to ſuffer his child to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>
                     </q> And becauſe he refuſed to obey them therein, and told them it was an Antichriſtian ordinance, they tyed him up and whipt him; which he bare without flinching, and declared he had divine help to ſupport him; upon which, ſays our author, <q>
                        <g ref="char:startq">“</g>two or three honeſt men that were his neighbours affirmed <g ref="char:endq">”</g>that he was of very looſe behaviour at home,</q> &amp;c. Be it ſo or not, yet we have no better account of Verin's character than of his, yet Verin muſt not be cenſured for withholding his wife from meeting; but it poor Painter will not give up the diſpoſal of his children to his wife, at the court's commandment, he muſt not only be cenſured, but alſo ſuffer corporal puniſhment: Yea, and into the bargain, be publicly reproached for his private failings! Governor Winthrop tells us he belonged to Hingham, and ſays he was whipt "for reproaching the Lord's ordinance." But did not they reproach infant ſprinkling, by taking ſuch methods to ſupport it much more than Painter did?</note>.</p>
               <p>Let it be here noted, that the evident deſign of this law was to guard againſt ſuch as refuſed to countenance infant baptiſm, and the uſe of ſecular force in religious affairs; which the Baptiſts have ever done from that day to this; but the other articles inſerted in this act they have not owned; and the court then had no proof at hand, but were forced to have recourſe to ſurmiſes, diſtant times,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:015240_0163_OFA371E78C3FD958"/>and foreign countries, for them; and a like method of treating the Baptiſts, in courts, from pulpits and from the preſs, has been handed down by <hi>tradition</hi> ever ſince. And can we believe that men ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and virtuous in other reſpects, as many on that ſide have been, would have introduced and continued in a way of treating their neighbours, which is ſo unjuſt and ſcandalous, if they could have found bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter arguments to ſupport that cauſe upon? I have diligently ſearched all the books, records and papers I could come at upon all ſides, and have found a great number of inſtances of Baptiſts ſuffering for the above points that we own; but not one inſtance of the conviction of any member of a Baptiſt church in this country, in any court, of the errors or evils which are inſerted in this law to juſtify their making of it, and to render our denomination odious<note n="*" place="bottom">That is not one inſtance in any government that ſupported Paedobaptiſm by force. But Mr. Williams, when Governor of Providence colony in 1655, acted with the court in puniſhing a man for oppoſing all government, who then was called a Baptiſt, but after turned to the Quakers.</note>. Much has been ſaid to exalt the characters of thoſe good fathers: I have no deſire of detracting from any of their virtues; but the better the men were, the worſe muſt be the principle that could enſnare them in ſuch bad actions.</p>

Upon a new running of the line, the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts had taken Exeter into their colony, which cauſed Mr. Wheelwright to remove to Wells, from whence he wrote to the Governor at Boſton for a reconciliation, Dec. 7, 1643, and ſaid, <q>it is the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>grief of my ſoul that I uſed ſuch vehement cenſorious ſpeeches.

               <p>The reader may remember that Wheelwright, in his ſentence of baniſhment, was charged with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſedition, which he never confeſſed; and that Governor Winthrop declared his opinions to be worſe than Mr. Williams's<note n="‡" place="bottom">

How can we account for this? The beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer I can give is, that Mr. Wheelwright held to infant baptiſm, and to the magiſtrates power to govern in religious affairs, and now yielded to their exerciſe of it; but Mr. Williams denied both, for which he was excommunicated by the church, after the court had ſent him away; Wheelwright was alſo in ſuch favour with Mr. Cotton, that he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed from his church in fellowſhip, after the court had baniſhed him for ſedition; and he now appeared very complaiſant and ſubmiſſive to men in power: But Williams was ſo <q>
                     <hi>ſelf-conceited, turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>and <hi>uncharitable,</hi> as to give public adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements and admonition to all men, whether of meaner or more public note and place, of the corruptions of religion which <hi>himſelf</hi> obſerved, both in their judgments and practices; of which there needs no other evidence, than what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the view of every indifferent reader, in his dealing with that famous and reverend divine Mr. John Cotton, in his book called <hi>The bloody <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Tenet.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words Mr. Hubbard quotes from another, as the received opinion of that day. But who was this reverend divine, and how was he dealt with? Was not Mr. Williams as truly a miniſter of Chriſt as he? Does ſelf-conceit move men to give plain
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:015240_0169_0FA371EC0BE21D40"/>warnings to great men, which have a tendency to expoſe ſelf to heavy ſufferings? And does it move perſons to do every kind office they can from year to year, for thoſe who will not hear reproof, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite evil for good? This is a different ſort of pride than what moſt men are acquainted with. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that the reader may have a fair opportunity of judging for himſelf, I ſhall endeavour plainly to ſtate before him the occaſion and nature of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between Cotton and Williams.</p>
               <p>A priſoner in Newgate wrote ſome arguments againſt perſecution, which were preſented to Mr. Cotton, and he wrote an anſwer to them in a letter to one Mr. Hall, of Roxbury; who not being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therewith, ſent them to Mr. Williams at Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, requeſting him to write upon the ſubject. And as Mr. Cotton cloſed his letter to Mr. Hall with ſaying. <q>I forbear adding reaſons to juſtify <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the truth, becauſe you may find that done to your hand, in a treatiſe ſent to ſome of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <g ref="char:endq">”</g>late of Salem, who dubted as you do:</q> Mr. Williams wrote to Mr. Sharp, elder of Salem church, for it, and obtained it<note n="§" place="bottom">William's Reply to Cotton, p. 290, 291.</note>. He then wrote his ſentiments upon the whole, under the title of <hi>The bloody Tenet of Perſecution for Conſcience Sake;</hi> which I ſuppoſe he now brought with him from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, though I have not been able to obtain it. Mr. Cotton wrote an anſwer to him, which he called <hi>The bloody Tenet waſhed, and made white in the Blood of the Lamb;</hi> that was printed in London in 1647. To this Mr. Williams publiſhed a reply in 1652, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The bloody Tenet yet more bloody, by Mr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's Endeavour to waſh it white.</hi> The two laſt of theſe performances are now before me, and from thence I ſhall give the reader their own words upon the moſt material points of their diſpute.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="unknown:015240_0170_0FA371ECCDAD4FF0"/>
               <p>Firſt. Mr. Cotton's memory failed him ſo much as to repreſent, that what he wrote in anſwer to the priſoner's arguments, was in a private letter to Mr. Williams, and upon that ſaid, "I wrote my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the truth of God according to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; why ſhould he puniſh me with open pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and expoſe me (as much as in him lieth to the world) to open ſhame, as a man of blood, for the liberty of my conſcience? How will it ſtand with his own principles, to plead for liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and yet to puniſh it? Beſides let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, if I did offend him with ſuch an error, it was but a private offence, and the rule of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel required he ſhould firſt have convinced and admoniſhed me privately of it, and ſo have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded upon my contumacy, at length to have told the church, before he had publiſhed it to the world<note n="*" place="bottom">Note, C. and W. in this account ſtand for Cotton and Williams's books aboveſaid; the figures for the pages therein.</note>." C. p. 2.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams in his reply mentions Mr. Cotton's miſtake about who he wrote the letter to, and that he ſuppoſed his anſwer to the priſoner's arguments had been as public as his profeſſion and practice was upon that tenet, and then ſays, "but grant it had been a private letter, and the diſcourſe and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion private; yet why doth he charge the diſcuſſer with breach of rule, in not uſing orderly ways of admoniton, and telling the church, when maſter Cotton in this book blames the diſcuſſer for diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communion with their church, and they alſo (after he was driven by <hi>baniſhment</hi> from civil habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongſt them) had ſent forth a bull of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication againſt him in his abſence! Such practice the Lord Jeſus and his firſt apoſtles or meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:015240_0171_0FA371ED8E118448"/>never taught.—I never heard that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, diſcourſing and examining men's tenets or doctrines by the word of God, was, in proper Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, perſecution for conſcience: Well had it been for New-England, that no ſervant of God, nor wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, could juſtly take up complaint for other kinds of perſecution." W. p. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>The main point of all Mr. Cotton's waſhings is a denial of the charge of perſecuting any for cauſe of conſcience, and he ſays, "I expreſly profeſs, 1, that no man is to be perſecuted at all, much leſs for conſcience ſake. 2, I profeſs further, that none is to be puniſhed for conſcience ſake, though erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, unleſs his errors be fundamental, or ſeditiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and turbulently promoted, and that after due conviction of conſcience; that it may appear, he is not puniſhed for his conſcience, but for ſinning againſt his conſcience.—If this tenet have any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of blood in it, it is becauſe it is waſhed in the blood of the Lamb, and ſealed with his blood. And then though it may ſeem bloody to men of corrupt minds and deſtitute of the truth (as Paul ſeemed to ſuch to be a peſtilent fellow) yet to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and upright ſouls, ſuch things as are waſhed in the blood of the Lamb, are wont to come forth white." C. p. 3.</p>
               <p>In reply to this Mr. Williams ſays, "is not this the guiſe and profeſſion of all that ever perſecuted or hunted men for their religion and conſcience? Are not all hiſtories and experiences full of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical ſpeeches of perſecutors to this purpoſe? You will ſay you are perſecuted for your conſcience, you plead conſcience, thou art a heretic, the devil hath deceived thee, thy conſcience is deluded, &amp;c. —Time hath and will diſcover that ſuch a <hi>blacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> cannot be waſhed in the blood of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:015240_0172_0FA371EE49960290"/>without repentance." And he goes on to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the ſetting up of ſtate religions has been the grand ſource of perſecution in every age. W. p. 6, 7. Againſt which he brought our Lord's para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the <hi>tares of the field.</hi> Upon which Mr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſaid, "it is true, Chriſt expoundeth the field to be the world, but he meant not the world, but (by an uſual trope) the church ſcattered throughout the world." C. p. 41.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams ſays, "it is no wonder to find maſter Cotton ſo entangled, both in his anſwers and replies touching this parable; for men of all ſorts in former ages have been ſo entangled before him. To which purpoſe I will relate a notable paſſage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by that excellent witneſs of God, maſter Fox, in his book of Acts and Monuments; it is this: In the ſtory of Mr. George Wiſehart, in the days of King Henry the eighth, there preached at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigament of ſaid Wiſehart one John Winryme, ſub-prior of the abbey of St. Andrews; he diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the parable of the tares; he interpreted the tares to be heretics; and yet contrary to this very ſcripture (as Mr. Fox obſerveth, though elſewhere himſelf maintains it the duty of the civil magiſtrate to ſuppreſs heretics) I ſay the ſaid Winryme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that heretics ought not to be let alone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the harveſt, but to be ſuppreſſed by the power of the civil magiſtrate. So that both the Popiſh prior and the truly Chriſtian Fox were entangled in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions</hi> to their <hi>own writings</hi> about this heavenly ſcripture."

               <p>To ſupport the notion of calling the <hi>church</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> Mr. Cotton quoted ſome texts wherein the redeemed are ſo called. C. p. 43. In reply Mr. Williams ſays, "grant that it hath pleaſed the Lord in his infinite wiſdom to cauſe the term <hi>world</hi> to be
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:015240_0173_0FA371EF0D2CECC0"/>uſed in various ſignifications; yet let any inſtance be given of any ſcripture, wherein the Lord oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the church and world, wheat and tares doth not diſtinguiſh between the church redeemed out of the world, and the world itſelf, which is ſaid to lie in wickedneſs, and to be ſuch as for which Jeſus would not pray, John xvii." W. p. 56. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argued that ſowing of the ſeed in four ſorts of ground by Chriſt's meſſengers, he called the <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven,</hi> which four ſorts cannot be ſuppoſed to be of the church. Mr. Cotton anſwers, 1, that Chriſt preached himſelf to thoſe four ſorts of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet he was the miniſter of circumciſion, and ſeldom preached to any but members of the church of Iſrael. C. p. 44. Reply, "when they grew incurable, and received not the admonitions of the Lord, by the Lord Jeſus and his ſervants preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them, the Lord caſt them out of his ſight, deſtroyed that <hi>national church,</hi> and eſtabliſhed the <hi>Chriſtian church.</hi>" W. p. 57.</p>
               <p>But Cotton ſays, "2, it is an error to ſay, the church conſiſteth of no more ſorts of hearers but one, the honeſt and good ground; for if the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of church-members be in the church, and of the church, till they give occaſion of rejection, then they growing up to years, become ſome of them like the highway-ſide, others like the ſtony, others like the thorny, as well as others like the honeſt and good ground. C. p. 44." Mr. Williams re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
               <p>"Admit the Chriſtian church were conſtituted of the natural ſeed and offspring (which yet Mr. Cotton knows will never be granted to him, and I believe will never be proved by him) yet he knows, that upon the <hi>diſcovery</hi> of any ſuch portion of ground in the church, the church is bound to admoniſh,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:015240_0174_0FA371EFD0CBA6F0"/>and upon impenitency after admonition, to caſt them into the <hi>world,</hi> the proper place of ſuch kinds of hearers and profeſſors." W. p. 57.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cotton adds, "is it not a main branch of their covenant with God, that as God giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a God to them, and to their ſeed, ſo they ſhould give up themſelves and their ſeed to be his people? Beſides hath not God given paſtors and teachers, as well for the gathering together of the ſaints, as for the edification of the body of Chriſt? And hath he not given the church, and the goſpel preached in the church, to lie like leaven in three pecks of meal till all be leavened?" C. p. 44. Mr. Williams ſays, "I anſwer, the proper work of paſtors and teachers is to feed the ſheep in the flock, and not the herds of wild beaſts in the world. And although it is the duty of parents to bring up their children in the nurture and fear of the Lord; yet what if thoſe children refuſe to frequent the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the church, and what if thoſe three ſorts of ground or hearers will not come within the bounds of the paſtors and teachers feeding; hath not the Lord Jeſus appointed other officers in Eph. iv. for the gathering of the ſaints, that is, ſending out of the church of Chriſt apoſtles or meſſengers, to preach Chriſt to the three ſorts of bad ground, to labour to turn them into good ground? But alas! to ſalve up this, the <hi>civil ſword</hi> is commonly run for, to <hi>force</hi> all ſorts of ground to come to church, inſtead of ſending forth the heavenly ſowers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ordinance of Chriſt." W. p. 38.</p>
               <p>Another argument Mr. Cotton draws from the ſervants wondering to ſee the tares, which would not have been ſtrange in the highway. C. p. 45. In reply to which Mr. Williams ſays, "let the highway, ſtony and thorny ground, be conſidered
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:015240_0175_0FA371F08ED70AB0"/>in their ſeveral qualities of prophaneneſs, ſtoutneſs, and worldlineſs, and all the ſons of men throughout the world naturally are ſuch; and it is no wonder, nor would the ſervants of Chriſt be ſo troubled, as to deſire their plucking up out of the world. But again conſider all theſe ſorts of men as profeſſing the name and anointing of Chriſt Jeſus, in a falſe, counterfeit antichriſtian way, and then it may well be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whence ſuch monſtrous Chriſtians or anointed ones aroſe; and God's people may eaſily be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather to deſire their rooting out of the world, than the rooting out of any ſuch ſorts of ground or men, profeſſing any other religion, Jewiſh, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan or Pagan.—A traitor is worſe than a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fox." W. p. 58, 59.</p>
               <p>Again, while Mr. Cotton pleaded for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the civil power againſt heretics and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians, he ſays, "no ordinance or law of God, nor juſt law of man, commandeth the rooting out of hypocrites, either by civil or church cenſure, though the church be bound to endeavour as much as in them lieth to heal their hypocriſy." C. p. 47. To this Mr. Williams anſwers, "hypocriſy diſcovered in the <hi>fruit</hi> of it, is not to be let alone in the church or ſtate; for neither the church of Chriſt nor civil ſtate can long continue ſafe, if hypocrites or trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (under what pretence ſoever) be permitted to <hi>break forth</hi> in them, without due puniſhment and rooting out; this hypocriſy being eſpecially the great ſin againſt which Chriſt ſo frequently and ſo vehemently inveighed, and againſt which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the ſoreſt plagues and judgments." W. p. 62. He then proceeded to plead, that the civil ſtate ſhould only puniſh civil offences. Upon which Mr. Cotton aſks, "what if their worſhip and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences incite them to civil offences?" C. p. 50.
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:015240_0176_0FA371F14CD5ACD0"/>Mr. Williams ſays, "I anſwer, the conſcience of the civil magiſtrate muſt incite him to civil puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as a Lord Mayor of London once anſwered that he was born to be a judge, to a thief that pleaded he was born to be a thief. If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the worſhippers of the beaſt incite them to prejudice prince or ſtate, although theſe conſciences be not as the conſcience of the thief, commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the evil of his fact, but perſuaded of the lawfulneſs of their actions; yet ſo far as the civil ſtate is endamaged or endangered, I ſay the ſword of God in the hand of civil authority is ſtrong enough to defend itſelf, either by impriſoning or diſarming, or other wholeſome means, while yet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ought to be permitted in what is merely point of worſhip, as prayer and other ſervices and adminiſtrations. Againſt any civil miſchief the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſtate is ſtrongly guarded. Againſt the ſpiritual miſchief, the church or city of Chriſt is guarded with heavenly armies, wherein there hang a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand bucklers, and moſt mighty weapons. Cant. iv. 2 Cor. x." W. p. 66, 67. But as he ſtill plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the civil ſword was never appointed by Chriſt for an antidote or remedy in ſpiritual evils and dangers; Mr. Cotton denies it, and ſays, "it is evident the civil ſword was appointed for remedy in this caſe, Deut. xiii. and appointed it was by that angel of God's preſence, whom God promiſed to ſend with his people. Exod. xxxiii. 2, 3. And that angel was Chriſt, whom they tempted in the wilderneſs. 1 Cor. x. 9. Therefore it cannot tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid, that the Lord Jeſus never appointed the civil ſword for a remedy in ſuch a caſe: For he did expreſly appoint it in the old teſtament; nor did he ever abrogate it in the new. The reaſon of the law (which is the life of the law) is of eternal force
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:015240_0177_0FA371F207EEF5C8"/>and equity in all ages. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely kill him, becauſe he hath ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God;</hi> this reaſon is moral, that is, of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and perpetual equity to put to death any apoſtate ſeducing idolator, or heretic<note n="§" place="bottom">Does not this and ſuch like ſentences make the tenet to appear <hi>yet more bloody!</hi>
                  </note>" C. p. 66, 67.</p>
               <p>In reply Mr. Williams ſays, "how grievous is this language of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, maſter Cotton needs not fly to the <hi>pope's argument</hi> for <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptiſm,</hi> to wit, to ſay Chriſt never abrogated Deut. xiii. therefore, &amp;c for Mr. Cotton knows the profeſſion of the Lord Jeſus, John xviii. that his kingdom was <hi>not earthly,</hi> and therefore his ſword cannot be earthly. Mr. Cotton knows that Jeſus commanded a <hi>ſword</hi> to be put up, when it was drawn in the cauſe of Chriſt, and added a dreadful
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:015240_0178_0FA371F2C78A63B0"/>threatning, that all that take the ſword (that is, the carnal ſword in his cauſe) ſhall periſh by it" W. p. 95, 96.</p>
               <p>The reader may remember, that Mr. Williams was often blamed for holding that the civil magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate's work was confined to the precepts of the ſecond table; his main argument therefor was, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> included in <hi>love to our neighbour.</hi> Mr Cotton grants his premiſes, but not his concluſion, and ſays, "though ſubjection to magiſtrates, and love to all men, be duties which concern the ſecond table, yet the inference will not follow, that therefore magiſtrates have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ing to do to puniſh any violation, no not the weightieſt duties of the firſt table. It is a clear caſe, among the duties of the ſecond table, people may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to honor their miniſters, and children may be exhorted to honor their parents; but will it hence follow, that therefore miniſters have nothing to do with matters of religion in the church, or parents in the family?" C. p. 96.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams anſwers, "if people are bound to yield obedience in civil things to civil officers of the ſtate, Chriſtians are much more bound to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſpiritual officers of Chriſt's kingdom; but how weak is this argument to prove, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore civil officers of the ſtate are conſtituted rulers, preſervers and reformers of the Chriſtian and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate, which differs as much from the civil, as the heavens are out of the reach of the earthly globe?" W. p. 147, 148.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cotton often recurs, through his book, to his notion of not puniſhing men for any matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but only for ſinning againſt their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:015240_0179_0FA371F3929C86C0"/>
                  <hi>after conviction.</hi> One great article of Mr. Williams's ſentence of baniſhment was, his writing letters againſt the rulers and churches before <hi>any conviction.</hi> And Mr. Cotton ſays of miniſters and churches, "none of us had any further influence, than by private and public <hi>conviction</hi> of himſelf, and of the demerit of his way." C. 2d part, p. 12. And when one of the magiſtrates was going to the court that baniſhed Mr. Williams, and aſked Mr. Cotton what he thought of it? his anſwer was, "I pity the man, and have interceded for him, whilſt there was any hope of doing good; but now he having refuſed to hear both his own church and us, and having rejected <hi>us all,</hi> as no churches of Chriſt, before any <hi>conviction,</hi> we have now no more to ſay in his behalf, nor hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for him." C. p. 39.</p>
               <p>This notion of not puniſhing any in matters of religion, till they had firſt convinced their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, runs through Mr. Cotton's whole book, as thoſe who have it may ſee in the quotations below<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 3, 26, 189; ſecond part, p. 12, 17, 32, 37—39.</note>; and he tries to ſupport it by Tit. iii, 11, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers entirely to eccleſiaſtical, and not to civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and there not to every error, but only to groſs hereſy, which was to be judged of by thoſe who were well acquainted with ſpiritual things. But, ſaid Mr. Williams,</p>
               <p>"Every lawful magiſtrate, whether ſucceeding or elected, is not only the miniſter of God, but the miniſter or ſervant of the people alſo (what people or nation ſoever they be, all the world over) and that miniſter or magiſtrate goes beyond his commiſſion, who intermeddles with that which cannot be given him in commiſſion from the people, unleſs maſter

I once knew a ſcholar invite to a diſpute with another man, about ſomething in controverſy in religion; in his own, and in the judgment of all the by ſtanders, the oppoſing perſon was utterly confuted: And yet the ſcholar, within a few months, was taught of God, and clearly convinced, that it was an error which he had maintained, and the truth which he oppoſed; and then, and not till then, did he ceaſe to wonder, that the other perſon was not convinced by his ſtrong arguments, as before he had thought. To ſay a man is convinced, when either for want of ſkill and ability, or the like, he cannot maintain his opinion agaiſt all men, is a meer conceit.—That they are obſtinate and pertinacious is a cheap ſuppoſal, taken up without the price of a proof. As the conviction is impoſed, not owned, ſo is this obſtinacy; if we may be judges of other men's obſtinacy, all will be plain; but if ever they get uppermoſt, they will be judges of ours." <hi>Collection of Owen's ſermons and truths,</hi> 1721, p. 312.</note>. Hence the faithful witneſses of Chriſt, Cranmer, Ridley, Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, had not a word to ſay in the diſputations at Oxford: Hence the Nonconformiſts were cried out as obſtinate men, abundantly convinced by the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Whitgift and others; and ſo in the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before King James at Hampton Court."

               <p>Mr. Williams in diſcuſſing his opponent's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments obſerved, that his opponent had taken many charges and exhortations which Chriſt gave to his miniſters, and directed them to the civil magiſtrate. But Mr. Cotton ſays, "the falſhood of the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in this charge is palpable and notorious." Yet fifty pages forward in the ſame diſcourſe Mr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſays, "the good that is brought to Princes and ſubject by the due puniſhment of apoſtate ſeducers, idolaters and blaſphemers, is manifold. Firſt, it putteth away evil from the people, and cutteth off a gangrene, which would ſpread to further ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Deut, xiii. 5, 2 Tim. ii. 16, 17, 18. Secondly, it driveth away wolves from worrying and ſcattering the ſheep or Chriſt. Falſe teachers be wolves. Matt. vi. 15, Act. xx. 29." C. p. 88, 138. This is a clear proof that great men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go ſtrait in a crooked path.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams had argued that Mr. Cotton's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine tended to the ſetting up of a Spaniſh inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all parts of the world, and to fruſtrate the great deſign of our Saviour's coming. He denies it, and accuſes Mr. Williams of rather promoting
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:015240_0182_0FA371F72307AAA8"/>the principal end of the Spaniſh inquiſition, "by proclaiming impunity to all their whoriſh and wolviſh emiſſaries. Nor is it, ſays he, a fruſtrating of the ſweet end of Chriſt's coming, which was to ſave ſouls, but rather a direct advancing of it, to deſtroy, if need be, the bodies of thoſe wolves, who ſeek to deſtroy the ſouls of theoſe for whom Chriſt died." C. p. 93.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams replies, "I cannot without great horror obſerve, what is this but to give a woful occaſion, at leaſt to all civil powers in the world, to perſecute Chriſt in his poor ſaints and ſervants?

Maſter Cotton hath no reaſon to charge the diſcuſſer with indulgence or partiality toward Romiſh and wolviſh emiſſaries; his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice is known ſo far different, that for departing too far from them (as is pretended) he ſuffers the brands and bears the marks of one of Chriſt's poor perſecuted heretics to this day<note n="†" place="bottom">One of the two points that the Maſſachuſetts began their contention with him upon, was his refuſing to countenance the fellowſhip they had with popiſh corruptions in the church of England.</note>.

               <p>"At a General Court, March, 1645, two peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were preferred, one for ſuſpending (if not aboliſhing) a law made againſt Anabaptiſts the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer year; the other was for eaſing a law of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made in Mrs. Hutchinſon's time, forbidding the entertaining of any ſtrangers, without licence of two magiſtrates; which was not eaſily obtained in thoſe days. Some at this time were much afraid of the increaſe of Anabaptiſm. This was the reaſon why the greater part prevailed for the ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the aforeſaid laws, although paradventure a little moderation as to ſome caſes might have done very well, if not beter.

               <p>Had not the notion of ſecuring religion to their poſterity, by infant baptiſm and the magiſtrates power, ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed their minds, how could they have reſiſted all theſe motives to lenity as they did? That they were under a very ſtrong bias may be ſeen in three pieces which were wrote this year againſt the Baptiſts. One of them was by Mr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who was ſo much afraid of having both ſides of the argument examined, that he gives us neither the names of the authors he wrote againſt
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:015240_0187_0FA37249E89FB438"/>nor the titles of their works; only he owns them to be ſuch as did not <q>deny magiſtrates, nor predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>nor original ſin; nor maintain free will in converſion, nor apoſtacy from grace; but only deny the lawful uſe of baptiſm of children, becauſe it wanteth a word of commandment and example from the ſcripture." And he ſays, "I am bound in Chriſtian love to believe, that they who yield ſo far, do it out of conſcience, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing herein the example of the apoſtle, who profeſſed himſelf, and his followers, <hi>we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the truth, but for the truth.</hi> But yet I believe withal, that it is not out of love to the truth that Satan yielded ſo much to the truth, but rather out of another ground, and for a worſe end. He knoweth the times that how, by the good and ſtrong hand of God, they are ſet upon puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reformation. And now to plead againſt the baptiſm of children upon any of thoſe Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian and popiſh grounds, which be ſo groſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious as thoſe above named, Satan knoweth and ſeeth they would utterly be rejected<note n="‡" place="bottom">Here is an acknowledgment, that the Baptiſts of that day did no hold the errors charged upon them in the aforeſaid law.</note>. He chooſeth therefore rather to play ſmall game, as they ſay, than to loſe all. He now pleadeth no other argument in theſe ſtirring times of reformation than may be urged from a main principle of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and reformation, viz. <hi>that no duty of God's worſhip, nor any ordinance of religion, is to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered in the church, but ſuch as hath juſt warrant from the word of God.</hi> And by urging this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the baptiſm of children, Satan tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth himſelf into an angle of light; and the ſpirit of error and <hi>profaneneſs</hi> into a miniſter of truth and righteousneſs. And ſo he hopeth to
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:015240_0188_0FA3724CA4A103A0"/>prevail, either with thoſe men who do believe the lawful and holy uſe of children's baptiſm to renounce that principle, and ſo to renounce alſo all reformation brought in by it: Or elſe, if they ſtick to that principle, then to renounce the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of children; and ſo the reformation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>About the ſame time a miniſter at Lynn wrote a volume againſt various Baptiſt authors; but before he came to any of their arguments he ſaid, <q>ever <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſince that word of old, <hi>I will put enmity betwixt thee and the woman, and betwixt thy ſeed and her ſeed,</hi> Satan hath had a ſpecial ſpite at the ſeed of the church: Witneſs that act of Cain, who was therein of that evil one, in killing his brother Abel: Whence alſo that project of Satan, all the ways that may be, to lay foundations of corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in time ruining the ſeed of the church by unequal marriages, &amp;c.

Whence alſo that ſatanical practice of ſeeking to cut them off by Pharoah, Exod. i. by Edomires, Pſalm cxxxii. by Babylonians, Jer. ix. Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Dan. viii.

               <p>The queſtion has often been aſked in our day what do you think of our good fathers who held to infant baptiſm? How did they get along? Here you have an anſwer in their own words; and the famous Dr. Thomas Goodwin uſhered theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances into the world with a recommendatory preface to each of them; and the ſentiments and temper of them have evidently been handed down by tradition ever ſince. But I appeal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of every reader, whether he can find three worſe things on earth, in the management of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, than firſt to ſecretly take the point diſputed for truth without any proof: then ſecondly blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that error with known truths, to make artful addreſſes to the affections of paſſions of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to prejudice their minds, before they hear a word that the reſpondent has to ſay. And thirdly, if the reſpondent refuſes to yield to ſuch manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then to call in the ſecular arm to compleat the argument. And were not theſe the methods that were then taken to ſupport Paedobaptiſm? The Proteſtants way of defending their cauſe againſt the Papiſts was, <q>if that ye will prove that your ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies <g ref="char:startq">“</g>proceed from faith, and do pleaſe God, ye muſt prove that God in expreſs words hath commanded them, or elſe ſhall you never prove that they proceed from faith, nor yet that they <g ref="char:endq">”</g>pleaſe God<note n="*" place="bottom">Knox's Hiſtory of the Reformation, p. 104.</note>.</q> But when this argument was urged againſt infant baptiſm, Cotton without any proof aſſerts that <q>Satan transformeth himſelf into <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>an angel of light.</q> And the whole of the above recited addreſſes to men and women's paſſions, are evidently founded upon the ſuppoſition, that infant
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:015240_0191_0FA3724D87F80DE8"/>baptiſm is as infallibly required by God, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from the forbidden fruit was, or Abraham circumciſing his children; and having taken the very point which is diſpured for truth, without any evidence, they blended that with many known facts recorded in ſcripture, and thereupon rank the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polers of that point with the old ſerpent the devil and Satan, and with his inſtruments Cam, Pharoah, Herod, and other murderers; yea with ſuch as ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their children to devils!

When Mr. Cotton came to them, the firſt of them is, that in Chriſt's commiſſion to his miniſters, he ordered them firſt to <hi>teach</hi> or make <hi>diſciples,</hi> and then to <hi>baptize</hi> them; and he ſays two arguments offer themſelves for his way from hence.</p>

And let con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpeak before him who will judged us all; do you who practiſe in this diſputed way, believe when you bring your infants to be ſprinkled that they <hi>have heard and learned of the father,</hi> ſo as to <hi>come unto Chriſt?</hi> And do you bring them becauſe they <hi>be taught of God?</hi> It they are not, they are <hi>not diſciples</hi> according to the known meaning of the word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cotton frames his ſecond argument from Exod. xii. 48, where God required every proſelyte to have all his males circumciſed, before he could come to the paſſover; upon which Cotton ſays, <q>if <g ref="char:startq">“</g>then our Lord's ſupper come in the room of the paſſover, and our baptiſm in the room of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, like as he that had not circumciſed his males, was accounted as one uncircumciſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo to be debarred from the paſſover, ſo he who hath not baptiſed his children, is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God as not baptized himſelf, and ſo to be debarred from the Lord's ſupper. If therefore you forbid baptiſm to children, you evacuate the baptiſm of their parents, and ſo make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, and the commiſſion to the apoſtles, and the baptiſm of believers, of none <g ref="char:endq">”</g>effect<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 11</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the two main arguments for infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to this day; and they both hang upon the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle word IF, which I think is a very ſmall pin to reſt the weight of whole provinces and kingdoms upon: <hi>If</hi> infants are diſciples by virtue of their parents profeſſion, then are they to be baptized; and <hi>if</hi> our baptiſm comes in the place of the circumciſion of Jewiſh proſelytes, then we cannot lawfully omit bringing our infants thereto. But what <hi>if</hi> this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:015240_0193_0FA3724F663933B8"/>ſhould prove to be as contrary to truth as darkneſs is to light, will men perſiſt in that way ſtill? Abraham had no warrant to circumciſe any but ſuch as were either born in his houſe or bought with his money. The firſt order that was given for bringing in others by <hi>houſholds</hi> was <hi>in the day</hi> that Iſrael came out of Egypt. Now as we make no pretence of being Abraham's natural poſterity, nor of being bought with Jewiſh money, the argument all turns upon a ſuppoſal that Gentile believers ought to bring their houſholds with them to baptiſm, as the ſaid proſelytes did theirs to circumciſion. But I know not how words can expreſs the contrary more plainly than God himſelf has done in this caſe; for he ſays, his new convenant is not according to that he made with Iſrael on ſaid day, Heb. viii. 8 —11. Upon this men often aſſert that the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> differ, while the <hi>ſubject,</hi> are the ſame: But the text aſſures us expreſly, that the main difference is in the ſubjects; that the ſubjects of the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>all know God</hi> from the <hi>leaſt</hi> to the <hi>greateſt</hi> When this is mentioned, they would then turn it to the difference betwixt the covenant; but that cannot be here intended, becauſe that diſtinction was as real in Abraham's time as it is now, as the apoſtle ſhews in Rom. iv. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, which text is often brought for a proof that the covenant is the ſame now as with Abraham. It does prove that the internal efficacy of divine inſtitutions was the ſame upon believers then as now; only their faith was fixed on a future Meſſiah, ours on one already come. The difference then betwixt the two covenants we are ſpeaking of, is not internal, but external. By divine inſtitution a whole family and a whole nation were then taken into covenant; now none are <hi>added</hi> to the church

Their being in was owing to mens imperfection, and not to God's inſtitution; yet becauſe the Baptiſts refuſed to yield to a practice they viewed to be not only without, but directly againſt divine inſtitution, they were abuſed in the manner above deſcribed; and Mr. Cobbet concludes his diſcourſe with a few inferences, in which he ſays, <q>ſee the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>danger and deteſtableneſs of Anabaptiſtical te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, giving God and Chriſt (in part) the lie, vailing the glory of his preventing grace of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Numb. xi. 18.—Condemning the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice of former churches, Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

To entreat them <g ref="char:startq">“</g>to conſider, what an high pitch of boldneſs it is, for a man to cut a principal ordinance out of the kingdom of God; if it be but to make a diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſo far diſgoods the ordinance, I fear it altogether unhallows it. To tranſplace or

Chriſt's inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and the apoſtles adminiſtrations of baptiſm, were expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuch as believed, gladly received the word, and ſhould be ſaved; and thoſe who profeſſed ſuch a ſaith, went into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and were buried in baptiſm; and according to this writer's doctrine, how does it deſtroy the ordinance to change it into ſprinkling of infants?</note>. 2. What a cruelty it is, to diveſt children of that only external privilege which their heavenly father hath bequeathed them, to intereſt them viſibly in himſelf, his ſon, his ſpirit, his covenant of peace, and the tender boſom of their careful mother the church. 3. What an inhumanity it is, to deprive parents of that comfort they may take from the baptiſm of their infants dying in their childhood. 4.

               <p>By theſe extracts the reader may ſee the temper and language of Paedobaptiſts in that day; and how much
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:015240_0196_0FA372514D39AE60"/>much of the ſame has there been in later times? Of charging us with cruelty, becauſe we hold that no acts of men can intereſt children in the grace of God, before they are taught and believe his truth; and becauſe we dare not place our hopes of infants ſalvation upon the doings of miniſters and churches, inſtead of the ſovereign mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt, unto whom we would commit them by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving prayer, and if they live, would uſe all goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel methods for their converſion, and obedience to all his commands? How much alſo have we ſeen of their aſſuming God's prerogative, in judging the hearts of ſuch as yield not to their arguments?</p>
               <p>As all the foregoing means were ineffectual, ſome of the miniſters preſented a bill to the General Court this year, for the calling a ſynod to ſettle theſe and other eccleſiaſtical affairs. "The magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates paſſed the bill, but ſome of the deputies queſtioned the power of the Court, to require their churches to ſend their meſſengers to ſuch a conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as not being ſatisfied that any ſuch power was given by Chriſt to the civil magiſtrates over the churches in ſuch caſes." This cauſed a debate, the concluſion of which was, that the enſuing ſynod ſhould be convened by way of motion only to the churches, and not in words of command<note n="§" place="bottom">Hubbard.</note>. The order of it began thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Boſton,</hi> 15th 3d <hi>Month,</hi> 1646.</p>
               <p>"The right form of church government and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline being agreed, part of the kingdom of Chriſt upon earth, therefore the eſtabliſhing and ſettling thereof by the joint and public agreement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of churches, and by the ſanction of civil autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, muſt needs greatly conduce to the honor and glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the ſettling
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:015240_0197_0FA37252086C9208"/>and ſafety of church and commonwealth, where ſuch a duty is diligently attended and performed." Upon which they ſent out their motion for ſaid ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; to enforce which they ſay, "that for want of the thing here ſpoken of, ſome differences of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and practice of one church from another do already appear amongſt us; and others (if not timely prevented) are like ſpeedily to enſue, and this not only in leſſer things, but even in points of no ſmall conſequence and very material; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in no more but thoſe about baptiſm, and the perſons to be received thereto, in which one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular the apprehenſions of many perſons in the country are known not a little to differ; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in moſt churches the miniſters do baptize the children if the grandfather or grandmother be ſet members, though the immediate parents be not, and others, though for avoiding of difference of neighbour churches they do not yet actually ſo practiſe, yet they do much incline thereto. And many perſons living in this country who have been members of the congregations in England, but are no found fit to be received at the Lord's table here, there be notwithſtanding conſiderable perſons in theſe churches who do think that children of theſe alſo, upon ſome conditions and terms, may and ought to be baptized: Likewiſe on the other ſide, there be ſome among us who do think that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the ſtate of the parents, baptiſm ought not to be diſpenſed to any infants whatſoever; which various apprehenſions being ſeconded with practices according thereto, as in part they already are, and are like to be more, muſt needs, if not timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, beget ſuch differences as will be diſpleaſing to the Lord, and offenſive to others, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ourſelves." Theſe were their reſons for
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:015240_0198_0FA37252C86D45B8"/>calling the ſynod, and the work aſſigned for them was to "diſcuſs, diſpute, and clear up by the word of God, ſuch queſtions of church government, and diſcipline, in the things aforementioned, or any other as they ſhall think needful and meet, and to continue ſo doing, till they or the major part of them ſhall have agreed upon <hi>one form of government and diſcipline,</hi> for the main and ſubſtantial parts thereof, as that which <hi>they judge</hi> agreeable to the holy ſcriptures; which when it was finiſhed was to be preſented to the General Court, "to the end that the ſame being found agreeable to the word of God, it may receive from the ſaid General Court ſuch approbation as is meet, that the Lord being thus acknowledged by church and ſtate, to be our judge, our lawgiver and King, he may be graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed ſtill to ſave us, as hitherto he hath done<note n="*" place="bottom">This requeſt was alſo ſent to the churches of Plymouth and Connecticut colonies. <hi>Maſſachuſetts Records.</hi>

               <p>Here we may plainly ſee wherein their great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake lay. They confounded the judgment that they formed upon the ſcripture with the rule itſelf. Alſo the majority aſſumed the power of judging for the whole, and of puniſhing diſſenters from their judgments, as breakers of God's law; a deluſion that the world is not clear of to this day, though light and truth have gained much ſince that time.</p>
               <p>We are told that oppoſition was made in ſome of the churches againſt ſending to that ſynod, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the moderate expreſſions in the Court's <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> for it, and Mr. Hubbard ſays the principal men who raiſed it were "ſome who lately came from England, where ſuch a vaſt liberty was plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, by all that rabble of men that went under the name of Independents, whether Anabaptiſts,

               <p>"This matter was two Lord's-days in agitation with the church in Boſton, before they could be brought to any comfortable concluſion; but on a lecture day intervening, Mr. Norton, teacher of the church at Ipſwich, was procured to ſupply the place at Boſton, where was a great audience; and the ſubject then handled was, Moſes and Aaron kiſſing each other in the mount of God.—On the next Lord's-day, after much debate in Boſton church, it was agreed by the vote of the major part, that the elders and three of the brethren ſhould be ſent to the ſynod<note n="†" place="bottom">Hubbard.</note>."</p>

But as to baptiſm, though the order for calling the ſynod aſſerted that moſt miniſters DO baptize the grandchildren of church members, yet that aſſertion was ſo far from truth, that thoſe who <q>laboured much to have this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <g ref="char:startq">“</g>

               <p>It may be proper now to take a further view of the affairs of Mr. Gorton and his company. Upon their being releaſed and baniſhed, as I have related, they went to Rhode-Iſland, and from thence over to Narraganſet, where, on April 19, 1644, they procured a deed from the ſachems, whereby they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned themſelves, people, lands, rights, inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances and poſſeſſions, over unto the protection and government of King Charles; and appointed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Gorton, and others their agents, to carry the ſame to him. This was ſigned by Paſſicus, Canau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus and Maxan, and witneſſed by two Indians and three Engliſh. The loſs of their great ſachem Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antinomu lay very heavy upon their ſpirits. Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard ſays he <q>was a very goodly perſonage, of tall <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſtature, ſubtile and cunning in his contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>
                  </q> In May came a letter to the rulers at Boſton, ſigned by Canaunicus, "though written by ſome of Gorton's company, to this effect, that they purpoſed to make war upon Uncas, in revenge of the death of Miantinomu and others of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and marvelled that the Engliſh ſhould be againſt it; and that they had put themſelves under the government and protection of the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſo were become their fellow ſubjects, and therefore if any difference ſhould fall between them; it ought to be referred to him; profeſſing withal their willingneſs to continue all friendly correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them. The General Court received another letter from Gorton and his company, to the like effect. "June 23, news came that the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganſets had killed ſix of Uncas's men and five women, and had ſent two hands and a foot to Pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,

Contentions increaſed ſo much the next year that an extraordinary meeting of the Commiſſioners of the United Colonies was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at Boſton, on July 28, 1645, when they ſent three meſſengers to the Narraganſets, who on their return brought a letter from Mr. Williams to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, aſſuring them that "war would preſently break forth, and that the Narraganſet ſachems had lately concluded a neutrality with Providence, and the towns on Aquedneck iſland." Upon which they determined to raiſe an army of 300 men, in the following proportion, viz. 190 out of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, 40 out of Plymouth, 40 out of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, and 30 out of New Haven colonies. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were raiſed immediately, and ſent away under the command of Lieutenant Humphry Atherton, to protect Uncas, till Capt.

After which Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Winthrop informed the Commiſſioners, "that ſince Miantinomu's death the Narraganſet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems by meſſengers ſent him a preſent, expreſſing their deſire to keep peace with the Engliſh, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to make war with Uncas for their ſachem's d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Commiſſioners concluded to take the preſent into their hands, and thereupon ſent Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Harding and Mr. Wilbore to thoſe ſachems, who were to take Benedict Arnold with them, and inform them that their preſent was returned and not accepted, unleſs they would be at peace with Uncas

When the Commiſſioners met at Plimouth the next month, they ordered four men to be ſent to the Narraganſets, "with inſtructions how to treat with them, both concerning their hiring other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians to war upon Uncas, and alſo about the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of wampum that was behind. Captain Ather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Captain Prichard undertook the ſervice, and going to Mr. Williams, they procured the ſachems to be ſent for; but they, hearing that many horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were come to take them, ſhifted for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Paſſicus ſled to Rhode-Iſland; but ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were, by Mr. Williams's means, delivered of their fears, and came to the meſſengers as they were deſired, and denied their hiring the Mohawks to war againſt Uncas, though they owned that they had ſent them a preſent<note n="§" place="bottom">Canaunicus died a very old man, on June 4, 1648. <hi>Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard.</hi>

               <p>Gorton, Holden and Greene, went to England to carry the Narraganſet's ſurrendry of themſelves and lands, as well as their own complaints, to the King; but found him not able to help either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or them.

We ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let you know in the firſt place, that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reſolution is not grounded upon an admittance of the truth of what is charged; we knowing well how much God hath honored your government, and believing that your ſpirit and affairs are acted by principles of juſtice, prudence and zeal to God; and therefore cannot eaſily receive any evil impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning your proceedings. In the next place you may take notice that we found the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners aim and deſire, in the reſult of it, was not ſo much a reparation of what was paſſed, as a ſettling their habitations for the future, under that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by a charter of civil incorporation, which was heretofore granted them by ourſelves. We find withal that the tract of land called the Narraganſet Bay, concerning which the queſtion is ariſen, was divers years ſince inhabited by thoſe of Providence,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:015240_0208_0FA371FE0AEA20E0"/>Portſmouth and Newport, who are intereſted in the complaint; and that the ſame is wholly without the bounds of the Maſſachuſetts patent granted by his Majeſty. We have conſidered that they be Engliſh, that the forcing of them to find out new places of reſidence will be very chargeable, difficult and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and therefore, upon the whole matter, do pray and require you to permit and ſuffer the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, and all the late inhabitants of Narraganſet Bay, with their families, and ſuch as ſhall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter join with them, freely and quietly to live and plant upon the Shawomet, and ſuch other part of the ſaid tract of land, within the bounds mentioned in our ſaid charter, on which they have formerly planted and lived, without extending your juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any part thereof, or otherwiſe diſquieting them in their conſciences or civil peace, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting them in their poſſeſſions, until ſuch time as we ſhall have received your anſwer to their claim in point of title, and you ſhall thereupon have received our further order therein. And in caſe any others, ſince the petitioners addreſs to England, have taken poſſeſſion of any part of the lands heretofore enjoyed by the petitioners, or any their aſſociates, you are to cauſe them that are newly poſſeſſed as aforeſaid to be removed, that this order may be fully performed. And, till our further order, neither the petitioners are to enlarge their plantations, nor are any others to be ſuffered to intrude upon any part of the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet Bay; and if they ſhall be found hereafter to abuſe this favour, by any act tending to diſturb your rights, we ſhall expreſs a due ſenſe thereof, ſo as to teſtify our care of your honorable protection and encouragement. In order to the effecting of this reſolution we do alſo require, that you ſuffer the ſaid Mr. Gorton, Mr. Holden, Mr. Greene, and

               <p>As there was no particular form of government, nor appointment of officers in their charter, it took a length of time to ſettle upon a method that was agreeable to the majority of the inhabitants.

They agreed upon a body of laws, chiefly taken from the laws of England, with the addition of a few ſuited to their particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. They alſo ordered, <q>that foraſmuch <g ref="char:startq">“</g>as Mr. Roger Williams hath taken great pains, and expended much time, in obtaining the charter for this province, of our noble Lords and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, be it enacted and eſtabliſhed, that in regard to his ſo great trouble, charges and good endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, we do freely give and grant unto the ſaid Mr. Roger Williams an hundred pounds, to be levied out of the three towns, viz. fifty pounds out of Newport, thirty pounds out of Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, twenty pounds out of Providence; which rate is to be levied and paid in by the laſt of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>

               <p>The form of government which they came into was thus to elect a Preſident and four Aſſiſtants an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, who had the executive power, were judges in the courts of law, and kept the peace. An Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of ſix Commiſſioners, or Repreſentatives from each town, made laws and ordered their general affairs; but their laws muſt be ſent to every town, to be deliberately conſidered in their town meetings, from whence the clerk was to ſend an account of their votes to the general recorder<note n="§" place="bottom">In May, 1660, they enacted that the return of their votes to the recorder muſt be made in three months.</note>, and if the majority of the towns approved the law, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, if not, it was diſannulled. The Aſſembly choſe yearly a general recorder and general ſerjeant; which are only other names for a ſecretary and ſheriff.

               <p>Perſons of almoſt all ſentiments and tempers had reſorted to this new colony, and various conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and parties had appeared, which were not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſed and reconciled; but toward the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſuch a deſirable end, the following cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was drawn and ſigned at Providence, viz. "conſidering the great mercy afforded unto us, is this liberty thus to meet together, being denied to many of our countrymen in moſt parts, eſpecially in our poor native country, now deploring their diſtreſſed condition in moſt ſad and bloody calamities: That ingratitude and diſacknowledgments for favours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, are juſt cauſes for the deprivation of them, together with home diviſions and home conſpiracies, the ruination of families, towns and countries: Moreover, the many plots and preſent endeavours at home and abroad, not only to diſturb our peace and liberties, but utterly to root up both root and branch of this our being; that government held forth through love, union and order, although by few in number and mean in condition, yet (by experience) hath withſtood and overcome mighty oppoſers; and above all, the ſeveral unexpected deliverances of this poor plantation, by that mighty providence who is ſtill able to deliver us, through love, union and order: Therefore being ſenſible of theſe great and weighty premiſes, and now met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to conſult about our peace and liberty, whereby our families and poſterity may ſtill enjoy theſe favours; and that we may publicly declare unto all the free diſcharge of all our conſciences and duties, whereby it may appear upon record that we are not wilfully oppoſite, nor careleſs and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and thereby the means of our own and others
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:015240_0212_0FA3720107A81928"/>ruin and deſtruction; and eſpecially in teſtimony of our fidelity and cordial affection unto one another here preſent, that ſo there may be a current placable proceeding, we do faithfully and unanimouſly, by this our ſubſcription, promiſe unto each other to keep unto theſe enſuing particulars. Firſt, that the foundation in love may appear among us, what cauſes of difference have heretofore been given, either by word or miſbehaviour, in public or private, concerning particular or general affairs, by any of us here preſent, not to mention or repeat them in the aſſembly, but that love ſhall cover the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of them in the grave of oblivion. Secondly, that union may proceed from love, we do promiſe to keep conſtant unto thoſe ſeveral engagements made by us, both unto our town and colony, and that to the uttermoſt of our powers and abilities to maintain our lawful rights and privileges, and to uphold the government of this plantation. Alſo that love may appear in union, we deſire to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all cauſleſs fears and jealouſies of one another; ſelf-ſeeking and ſtriving one againſt another, only aiming at the general and particular peace and union of this town and colony. Laſtly, for our more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly proceeding in this aſſembly, whereby love and union may appear in order, if in our conſultations differences in judgment ſhall ariſe, then moderately in order, through argumentation, to agitate the ſame; conſidering the cauſe how far it may be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or conducing unto our union, peace and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and accordingly act, not after the will or perſon of any, but unto the juſtice and righteouſneſs of the cauſe. Again, if ſuch cauſe ſhall be preſented wherein ſuch difficulties ſhall appear, that evident arguments cannot be given for preſent ſatisfaction, but that either town or colony or both ſhall ſuffer,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:015240_0213_0FA37201C83568F0"/>then to take into our conſideration a ſpeech of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friend, "better to ſuffer an inconvenience than a miſchief," better to ſuſpend with a loſs which may be inconvenient, than to be totally diſunited and bereaved of all rights and liberties, which will be a miſchief indeed. Moreover that offences and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions may be prevented, that ſo the current of buſineſs may peaceably proceed in this aſſembly, we do faithfully promiſe to carry ourſelves, in words and behaviour, ſo moderately and orderly as the cauſe ſhall permit, and if any of us ſhall fly out in provoking, ſcurrilous, exorbitant ſpeeches, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable behaviour, that he or they ſo doing ſhall be publicly declared, branded and noted upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to be a covenant violator, and diſturber of the union, peace and liberty of this plantation. We do here ſubſcribe without partiality. Dated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, 1647.</p>

               <p>WHILE various parties were exerting themſelves in different ways, Mr. Williams on Auguſt 31, 1648, made the following motion to the town of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, viz.</p>
               <p>"WORTHY friends, that ourſelves and all men are apt and prone to differ, it is no new thing. In all former ages, in all parts of the world, in theſe parts, and in our dear native country and mournful ſtate of England, that either part or party is moſt right in his own eyes, his cauſe right, his carriage right, his arguments right, his anſwers right, is as woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſtantly true as the former. And expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience tells us, that when the God of peace hath taken peace from the earth, one ſpark of action, word or carriage, is too too powerful to kindle ſuch a fire as
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:015240_0216_0FA3720409140920"/>burns up towns, cities, armies, navies, nations and kingdoms. And ſince, dear friends, it is an honor for men to ceaſe from ſtrife; ſince the life of love is ſweet, and union is as ſtrong as ſweet; and ſince you have been lately pleaſed to call me to ſome public ſervice, and my ſoul hath been long muſing how I might bring water to quench, and not oil or fuel to the flame, I am now humbly bold to beſeech you, by all thoſe comforts of earth and heaven which a placable and peaceable ſpirit will bring to you, and by all thoſe dreadful alarms and warnings either amongſt ourſelves, in deaths and ſickneſſes, or abroad in the raging calamities of the ſword, death and peſtilence; I ſay I humbly and earneſtly beſeech you to be willing to be pacifiable, willing to be reconcileable, willing to be ſociable, and to liſten to the (I hope not unreaſonable) motion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: To try out matters by diſputes and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, is ſometimes endleſs; to try out arguments by arms and ſwords, is cruel and mercileſs; to trouble the ſtate and Lords of England, is moſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, moſt chargeable; to trouble our neighbours of other colonies, ſeems neither ſafe nor honorable. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, dear friends, the colony now looks with the torn face of two parties, and that the greater number of Portſmouth, with other loving friends adhering to them, appear as one grieved party; the other three towns, or greater part of them, appear to be another: Let each party chooſe and nominate three; Portſmouth and friends adhering three, the other party three, one out of each town: Let au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority be given to them to examine every public difference, grievance and obſtuction of juſtice, peace and common ſafety: Let them, by one final ſentence of all or the greater part of them, end all, and ſet the whole into an unanimous poſture and order, and
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:015240_0217_0FA372058517F480"/>let them ſet a cenſure upon any that ſhall oppoſe their ſentence. One log, without your gentle help, I cannot ſtir; it is this: How ſhall the minds of the towns be known? How ſhall the perſons choſen be called? Time and place appointed in any expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For myſelf I can thankfully embrace the help of Mr. Coddington or Mr. Clarke, joined or apart, but how many are there who will attend (as our diſtempers are) to neither? It is, gentlemen, in the power of the body to require the help of any of her members, and both King and Parliament plead, that in extraordinary caſes they have been forced to extraordinary ways for common ſafety. Let me be friendly conſtrued, if (for expedition) I am bold to be too too forward in this ſervice, and to ſay, that if within twenty days of the date hereof, you pleaſe to ſend to my houſe, at Providence, the name of him whom you pleaſe to nominate, at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I will acquaint all the perſons choſen with place and time, unto which in your name I ſhall deſire their meeting within ten days, or thereabouts, after the receipt of your letter.

<pb n="207" facs="unknown:015240_0218_0FA37205B7E62670"/>Aſſiſtant refuſed, five pounds. Alſo "ordered that a meſſenger be ſent to Pumham and the other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, to require them to come to this Court; and that letters be ſent to Benedict Arnold and his father, and the reſt of Pawtuxet, about their ſubjecting to this colony." Mr. Dyre again preſented his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt Mr. Coddington, but they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
               <p>AT the Aſſembly at Newport, May 23, 1650, a freſh order was ſent to the towns, to collect and pay what they owed to Mr. Williams for the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, within twenty days. William Arnold and William Carpenter, inſtead of ſubmitting to the government of their own colony, went again and entered complaints againſt ſome of their neighbours to the Maſſachuſetts rulers, and they ſent a citation to them to come and anſwer the ſame in their courts, dated from Boſton, June 20, 1650, ſigned by Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rawſon, ſecretary<note n="†" place="bottom">Providence Records.</note>. Such obſtructors of good government were they who have made a great noiſe in the world about the diſorders of Rhode-Iſland colony!

               <head>CHAP. IV. An Account of Mr. Clarke and Mr. Holmes, and of their Sufferings at Boſton in 1651.</head>
               <p>IT has already been ſeen that Mr. John Clarke was a principal inſtrument in procuring Rhode-Iſland for a people who were perſecuted elſewhere, and that
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:015240_0219_0FA372068C22B080"/>he was the firſt religious miniſter on the iſland, and ſerviceable alſo in their civil government; yet all this did not prevent his being moſt abuſively treated this year in Boſton, with two other members of his church.</p>
               <p>THE beſt account of Mr. Obadiah Holmes that I have ſeen, is in a manuſcript which he left to his children, that a gentleman of his poſterity has fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured me with; an extract of which I will give in his own words. Says he,</p>
               <p>"FIRST, I muſt remember my honored parents, who were faithful in their generation, and of good report among men, and brought up their children tenderly and honorably. Three ſons they brought up at the univerſity in Oxford; but the moſt of their care was to inform and inſtruct them in the fear of the Lord; and to that end gave them much good counſel, carrying them often before the Lord by earneſt prayer; but I, the moſt rebellious of all, did neither hearken to counſel nor any inſtruction, for from a child I minded nothing but folly and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and as years did grow on, and wiſdom ſhould have taken place, then the wiſdom I had was wiſe to do evil, but to do well had no knowledge.—As days and ſtrength increaſed, even ſo did my tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſo that I became hardened in ſin, not only to be drawn into it by others, but was as forward to draw others into evil as my fellows—being come to that height of wickedneſs that I did think it beſt when I could do the moſt wickedneſs, and began to think that it was but a fooliſh thing to talk of God, that ſhould bring man to judgment—Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a courſe for four or five years, and then began to bethink what counſel my dear parents had given me, many a time with tears and prayers; my rebellion to my honored parents then looked me in
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:015240_0220_0FA37207092B0FA8"/>open face, and my dear mother being ſick, it ſtruck to me my diſobedient acts, which forced me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ſame to her. After this I began to go to hear the word preached, but every word was againſt me, and left me without hope of mercy; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times paſſing over a field called the Twenty Acres, ſtood ſtill and ſaid, oh! that I might lie in hell but ſo many years as here are graſs! It would have an end.—That word was ever before me, <hi>the wicked ſhall be turned to hell—where the worm dieth not,</hi> &amp;c. And yet at this time Satan tells me, it is beſt to put ſuch thoughts out of mind, and take pleaſure while thou art here, and return to thy former merry companions and friends; which I did for a time; but the worm in the conſcience did ſtill gnaw. I went to hear the moſt noted men I could, but found it ſtill againſt me; yet often heard them ſay, I muſt repent and be humbled, and muſt pray: and then ſhould find mercy; but muſt confeſs ſins and forſake them; which brought me to a reſolution, in the moſt public way or company I could find, ever ſo to do; and had done it through ignorance, had not a friend adviſed me to the contrary, and that upon good grounds. But he alſo put me upon prayer and hearing. I then fell to prayer and duties, but found no reſt or quiet in my ſoul; for then Satan let fly at me, and told me, it was too late to return, for there was no hope for me. I anſwered him, and did inſtance ſeveral of my wicked companions God had ſhown mercy unto a little before. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, remember thou ſcorned, mocked and derided them; yea ſaying the devil was in them, they were all mad, and become fools; and withal he told me I had read and heard that there was a ſin that never could be forgiven, the which ſin I had committed. With this aſſault he fooled me a long time; even
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:015240_0221_0FA37207CD1FE8B8"/>my life was a burden to me. Oh! the knives, ropes, trees, coal-pits, can witneſs the many eſcapes of them, as one in a moſt undone, deſperate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as one appointed to eternal deſtruction. The perplexity of mind brought me to great weakneſs in body, and yet for eaſe and comfort I turned over every ſtone, hearkened to all my acquaintance and friends, as to leave off my old ways, and all my old companions, which I had done before; but all this while I never conſidered ſin according to the true nature of it, as being loathſome to the Lord, but as it brought judgment upon me; yet was I fearful to ſin, and began to love to read the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and frequent prayer and other duties, and took delight among profeſſors that were of the ſtricteſt ſort, eaſily ſeeing the groſs evil and danger of the formal miniſters and profeſſors, and ſo that conformity was only ſuperſtition and a name: Yet for all that I had no reſt in my ſoul, though I was in a manner as ſtrict as any. As I was enlarged in ſorrow for ſin, deep in humiliation, enlarged in prayer, or filled with tears, my comfort came in and encreaſed; but as I failed in them, ſo my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows renewed; and when I looked over my beſt performances found them full of ſin. Oh! then the fears, doubts and queſtioning of my own eſtate! I judged it was all done in hypocriſy, which ſin my ſoul did then abhor. In this ſad and doubtful ſtate I continued very long, yea many years. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I could ſpeak comfortably to others, yet had often much diſquiet within my ſoul; my comforts were according to my enlargements. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this there was in me a great love to the Lord; but alas! I was deceived by my own heart, and the miniſters who told me there muſt be ſuch and ſuch a love to him, as to keep to him in duty, and to
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:015240_0222_0FA372088C41DCF8"/>part with all for him, but they left me ſhort of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding him as I ſhould, and my ſelfiſh heart was willing to love him or part with all for him, yea my dear honored father, brethren and friends, houſe and lands, and my own native country, for time, and to avoid thoſe popiſh relics of the biſhops, and that filthy rabble, and to ſeparate from them, and all thoſe that mention them; and was fully known in my own country, and adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the danger of the ſeas to come to New-England, where I tried all things in ſeveral churches, and for a time thought I had made a good choice or change: But in truth it little differed from former times, and my ſpirit was like a wave toſſed up and down, as not yet come to dig ſo deep as I ſhould, or to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the only ground of a well-grounded hope, which God at laſt brought me to conſider, which is, <hi>his own love to poor loſt man, which firſt was in his own ſecret council and purpoſe before man was, and revealed to man in his time;</hi> and that there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative neceſſary to obtain Chriſt, nor any thing to deſerve that love, or to merit the ſame. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſtay or ſatisfy my ſoul till I came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider why, when and upon whom he laid ſin and tranſgreſſion, namely, on the Lord, and on him alone. And looking at me when a rebel, an enemy, yea dead in ſin and treſpaſſes, yea in my blood, he then ſaid, live, through the blood of Chriſt be cleanſed, and in him be loved, for his own love to poor man, and that the election may obtain it, for he knows who are his; but his good will is manifeſted before they have done either good or evil, ſo that neither good foreſeen ſhall prevail, nor evil original or actual ſhall hinder, but that free grace may have its free courſe; but manifeſted when he giveth faith to believe the promiſe of the Father in giving a full
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:015240_0223_0FA3720947064760"/>diſcharge to the ſoul, by taking full ſatisfaction from his only Son, who became ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God through him; and ſo remiſſion and free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is granted forth, that whoſoever believes in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life; and all thoſe that ſo come to him he will no ways caſt away. And when God had given me to ſee in any meaſure this love of his, then and not till then could I give over working for life, and to live in working. But at laſt he cauſed me to ſay, that <hi>from</hi> life I muſt work, and then all my former turnings and returnings muſt come to nought, yea all my righteouſneſs as filthy rags, and to account all as dung, ſo I might obtain Chriſt; or rather that I might be accepted by him, and ſo removed me from the covenant of works to the covenant of grace, even that new covenant of life alone by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who paid ſo dear a price, as to lay down his own blood to waſh, cleanſe and purify the ſoul, and to redeem both ſoul and body to ſerve the Lord; and that is now the life I live by faith in the Son of God; and this faith cauſes works of faith, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruits that flow from that root, ſo that now love hath conſtrained me to yield myſelf to live to him, as to a king to rule me by his holy laws and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and as to an only prophet to teach and inſtruct me, both to know and to do his holy will, and as my only chief prieſt to offer a ſacrifice for me, which he did even for all, whereby my poor imperfect prayers and all other ſervices became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Father; and this love, ſhed abroad in my heart, wrought in me a reſtleſs deſire to know his will, that I might ſhew forth the praiſes and glory of him, that had called me by his grace."</p>

               <p>As the ſentiments of the ancient Baptiſts in this country have been groſly miſrepreſented, and as Mr. Holmes was no ſmall ſufferer in that cauſe, I thought it expedient to let the reader thus far hear him ſpeak for himſelf, or tell his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and ideas about the nature of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. When he firſt came to this land he joined with the chuch in Salem, with whom he walked ſix or ſeven years, and then about the year 1645 was diſmiſſed to the Congregational church in Seaconck (Rehoboth) newly ſettled there, under the miniſtry of Mr. Samuel Newman; and he continued in that relation about four years, till an unrighteous act, as he judged, of the miniſter and part of the church, for which they would not give ſatisfaction, cauſed Mr. Holmes and ſeveral more to withdraw, and ſet up a meeting by themſelves, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the Baptiſt's way was right, a number of them were baptiſed, I ſuppoſe by the aforeſaid Mr. Clarke, for they joined to his church. After this Mr. Newman pronounced a ſentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication againſt Mr. Holmes, upon which he and two more were preſented to the General Court at Plymouth, June 4, 1650, where they met with four petitions againſt them, one from their own town with thirty-five hands to it, one from the church at Taunton, one from all the miniſters but two in Plymouth colony, and a fourth from the Court at Boſton, under their ſecretaries hand, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plymouth rulers to ſuppreſs them ſpeedily<note n="†" place="bottom">Clarke's Narrative, p. 18, 25.

He lived about two miles out of town, and the next being the Lord's-day, they concluded to ſpend it in religious worſhip at his houſe; and Mr. Clarke ſays, "finding by ſad experience, that the hour of temptation ſpoken of was coming upon all the world (in a more eminent way) to try them that are upon the earth, I fell upon the conſideration of that promiſe, made to thoſe that keep the word of his patience, which preſent thoughts, while in conſcience toward God, and good will unto his faints, I was imparting to my companions in the houſe where I lodged, and to four or five ſtrangers that came in unexpected after I had begun, opening and proving what is meant by the hour of temptation, what by the word of his patience, and their keeping it, and how he that hath the key of David (being the promiſer) will keep thoſe that keep the word of his patience from the hour of temptation: While I ſay I was yet ſpeaking, there comes into the houſe where we were two conſtables, who, with their clamorous tongues, made an interruption in my diſcourſe, and more uncivilly diſturbed us than the purſuivants of the old Engliſh biſhops were wont to do, telling us

The conſtable anſwered, that is nothing to me; I have not power to command you
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:015240_0228_0FA3720D12637560"/>to ſpeak when you come there, or to be ſilent. To this I again replied, ſince we have heard the word of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, we have been taught, as thoſe that <hi>firſt truſted in Chriſt,</hi> to be obedient unto him both by word and deed; wherefore if we be forced to your meeting, we ſhall declare our diſſent from you both by word and geſture. After all this, when he had conſulted with the man of the houſe, he told us he would carry us to the meeting; ſo to their meeting we were brought, while they were at their prayers, and uncovered; and at my firſt ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the threſhold I unveiled myſelf, civily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted them, and turned into the ſeat I was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, put on my hat again, and ſat down, opened my book, and fell to reading. Mr. Bridges being troubled, commanded the conſtable to pluck off our hats, which he did, and where he laid mine there I let it lie, until their prayers, ſinging and preaching was over; after this I ſtood up, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered myſelf in theſe words following: I deſire as a ſtranger to propoſe a few things to this congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hoping in the propoſal thereof I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend myſelf to your conſciences, to be guided by that wiſdom that is from above, which being pure is alſo peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated; and therewith made a ſtop, expecting if the Prince of peace had been among them, I ſhould have had a ſuitable anſwer of peace from them.—Their paſtor anſwered, we will have no objections againſt what is delivered. To which I anſwered, I am not about at preſent to make objections againſt what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but as by my geſture at my coming into your aſſembly, I declared my diſſent from you, ſo leaſt that ſhould prove offenſive unto ſome whom I would not offend, I would now by word of mouth declare the grounds, which are theſe: Firſt, from

               <p>ON July 31, Mr. Clarke was brought before the Court, and fined twenty pounds, or to be well whipt; and the crimes he was charged with, beſide what is above mentioned, were, that he met again the next day after his contempt, as they call it, of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip, <q>at the houſe of Witters, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <g ref="char:startq">“</g>of authority; being then in the cuſtody of the law, did there adminiſter the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper to one excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to another under admonition, and to a third that was an inhabitant of Lynn, and not in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with any church, and yet upon anſwer in open Court did affirm, that he never re-baptized <g ref="char:endq">”</g>any,</q> &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">Neal's Hiſtory of New-England, vol. 1, p. 30.</note> And, ſays Mr. Clarke, "none were able to turn to the law of God or man by which we were condemned. At length the Governor ſtepped up, and told us we had denied infants baptiſm, and being ſomewhat tranſported, told me, I had deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death, and ſaid he would not have ſuch traſh brought into their juriſdiction; moreover he ſaid, <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>you go up and down, and ſecretly inſinuate into thoſe that are weak, but you cannot maintain it before our miniſters. You may try and diſpute <g ref="char:endq">”</g>with them.</q> To this I had much to reply, but he commanded the gaoler to take us away. So the next morning, having ſo fair an opportunity, I made a motion to the Court in theſe words following:</p>

               </p>
               <p>"WHEREAS it pleaſed this honored Court yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to condemn the faith and order which I hold and practiſe; and after you had paſſed your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon me for it, were pleaſed to expreſs, I could not maintain the ſame againſt your miniſters, and thereupon publicly proffered me a diſpute with them: Be pleaſed by theſe few lines to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, I readily accept it, and therefore deſire you would appoint the time when, and the perſon with whom, in that public place where I was condemned, I might with freedom, and without moleſtation of the civil power, diſpute that point publicly, where I doubt not by the ſtrength of Chriſt to make it good out of his laſt will and teſtament, unto which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be added, nor from which nothing is to be diminiſhed. Thus deſiring the Father of lights to ſhine forth, and by his power to expel the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I remain your well-wiſher, From the priſon, this 1, 6, 52. JOHN CLARKE.</p>
               <p>"THIS motion, if granted, I deſire might be ſubſcribed by their Secretary's hand, as an act of the ſame Court by which we were condemned<note n="§" place="bottom">Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>THIS was preſented, and after much ado, one of the magiſtrates informed Mr. Clarke, that a diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was granted to be the next week, but on Monday their miniſters came together and made no ſmall ſtir about the matter, and near the cloſe of the day the magiſtrates ſent for Mr. Clarke into their chamber, and queried with him about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and demanded of him whether he would diſpute upon the things contained in his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and maintain his practice, <q>for ſaid they, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the Court ſentenced you not for your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience, but for matter of fact

They told me the motion was very fair, and the way like unto a diſputant, ſaying, becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is weighty, and we deſire that what can, may be ſpoken, when the diſputation ſhall be, therefore would we take a longer time—So I returned with my keeper to priſon again, drew up the concluſions, which I was reſolved through the ſtrength of Chriſt to ſtand in defence of, and through the importunity of one of the magiſtrates, the next morning very early I ſhewed them to him, having a promiſe I ſhould

               <p>"THE teſtimony of John Clarke, a priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt at Boſton, in behalf of my Lord, and of his people, is as followeth.</p>

It pleaſed the Father of lights, after a long

And when I heard the voice of my keeper come for me, even chearfulneſs did come upon me, and taking my teſtament in my hand, I went a long with him to the place of execution, and after common ſalutation here ſtood. There ſtood by alſo one of the magiſtrates, by name Increaſe Nowel, who for a while kept ſilent, and ſpoke not a word, and ſo did I, expecting the governor's preſence, but he came not. But after a while Mr. Nowel bade the executioner do his office; then I deſired to ſpeak a few words, but Mr. Nowel anſwered, it is not now a time to ſpeak. Whereupon I took leave, and ſaid, men, brethren, fathers and countrymen, I beſeech you give me leave to ſpeak a few words, and the rather becauſe here are many ſpectators to ſee me puniſhed, and I am to ſeal with my blood, if God give ſtrength, that which I hold and practice in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Mr. Nowel an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me, now was no time to diſpute. Then ſaid I, then I deſire to give an account of the faith and order I hold, and this I deſired three times, but in comes Mr. Flint, and ſaith to the executioner, <hi>Fellow, do thine office, for this fellow would but make a long ſpeech to delude the people.</hi>

Mr. Nowel told me, it was his fault that went away, and would not diſpute; but this the writings will clear at large. Still Mr. Flint calls to the man to do his office: ſo before, and in the time of his pulling off my cloaths I continued ſpeaking, telling them, that I had ſo learned, that for all Boſton I would not give my body into their hands thus to be bruiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another account, yet upon this I would not give the hundredth part of a<note n="†" place="bottom">A <hi>wampum peaque,</hi> is the ſixth part of a penny with us.</note>

The governor aſked me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Obadiah Holmes, according as he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by old Mr. Cole, and Thomas Buttolph, of my taking of him by the hand, and ſmiling, and I did then freely declare what I did, and what I ſaid, which was this: Obadiah Holmes, ſaid I, I do look upon as a godly man; and do affirm that he carried himſelf as did become a Chriſtian, under ſo ſad an affliction; and his affliction did ſo affect my ſoul, that I went to him being from the poſt, and ſaid, bleſſed be the Lord.— But ſaid the governor, what do you apprehend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the cauſe for which he ſuffered? my anſwer was, that I am not able to judge of it; then ſaid the governor, we will deal with you as we have dealt with him. I ſaid unto him again, I am in the hands of God. Then Mr. Symonds a magiſtrate ſaid, <hi>you ſhall know that you are in the hands of men.</hi> The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor then ſaid, keeper, take him, and ſo I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently carried away to priſon.</p>

               <p>MR. Hazel was one of Mr. Holmes brethren of Rehoboth, who, though above threeſcore years old,
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:015240_0253_0FA37224474217E0"/>and infirm in body had trevelled near fifty miles, partly indeed on other buſineſs, but chiefly to viſit his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved brother in priſon; and how he was treated there he has given us an account, written and ſubſcribed with his own hand as follows.</p>

               <p>I going from place to place, to buy and take up commodities for my uſe, was attached or arreſted by the marſhal, by virtue of a warrant from the Court, to appear in the Court, and there to anſwer for a high miſdemeanor committed by me, and coming into the Court (which was then privately kept in the chamber) they aſked me d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vers queſtions, among which this was one, Whether I did think that Obadiah Holmes did well or not, in coming among them to baptize, and adminiſter the ſacrament? laying this to my charge, that I was one with him, and of the ſame judgment, and, Whether I did think he did well or no, in his ſo carrying himſelf? To which I anſwered, I had here nothing to do with that which another man did, but I was here to anſwer for what I myſelf had committed againſt their law. Then ſaid they, you have offended our law, and have contemned authority, for you took him by the hand, and did countenance him in his ſin, ſo ſoon as he was gone from the poſt. To which I ſaid, If I have broken any law of the place, by what I then did, I am willing to ſubmit unto puniſhment. Yea, ſaid the governor, you took him by the hand, did you not? and ſpake to him, what ſaid you? did you not ſay ſo and ſo? bleſſed be God, &amp;c. To which I ſaid, I ſhall refer myſelf unto the teſtimonies that may or can be brought againſt me. Well, ſaid the governor, we ſhall find teſtimony enough againſt you; take him to you, keeper, and we will call you ſorth in publick, for what we do with you we will
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:015240_0254_0FA372258C58EB50"/>proceed in publick with you, and ſo I went to priſon. This was the ſum and ſubſtance of the firſt time I was called before them. The next day being the laſt day of the week, and the laſt day of their Court, I was in expectation all the forenoon to be called forth, but was not; ſo after dinner, when (as appeareth) the Court was riſen, and ſome of the magiſtrates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, I was ſent for again into the chamber, where was the governor with three others, <hi>ſetl.</hi> Mr. Bei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham, Mr. Hibbens, and Mr. Encreaſe Nowel. As ſoon as I was come into the room, the governor read my ſentence, which was, that I muſt pay 40 <abbr>
                     <hi>ſ</hi>
                  </abbr> or be well whipt, and ſo immediately he departed, and when he was gone (for I could not have time before) I anſwered, that I deſired the privilege of an Engliſh ſubject, which was to be tried by the country, to wit, a jury, and to be made to appear (if they can) to be a tranſgreſſor by a law. To which they ſaid, I had contemned authority, and they had a law to puniſh ſuch, and ſaid they, you did ſhew your contempt of authority in that you did take ſuch a perſon by the hand, as ſoon as he was from the poſt. To which I anſwered, I could not do that which I did in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to authority, ſeeing he has ſatisfied the law to the full, and was departed from the place ſuffering; and in the next place, what I did, I did unto him as my friend; and further I ſaid, if I had taken him by the hand ſo ſoon as he was looſed from the poſt, and had led him out of the town, I ſhould not have broken any law eiher of God or man. To this they ſaid, that there was a law in all Courts of juſtice, both in Old-England and other countries, to puniſh contempt of authority, and ſo had they ſuch a law among themſelves. To which I ſaid, that in Old-England, and in other places, they had ſuch a law I denied not, but that law alſo was both enacted and publiſhed,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:015240_0255_0FA3722619741918"/>but what law have I broken in taking my friend by the hand, when he was free, and ſatisfied the law? To this they replied, that he had not ſatisfied the keeper. To this I anſwered, that he had talked with the keeper, and there was ſome agreement between them, and ſo in that ſenſe alſo not under the law, but free. Then ſaid they, If you would have ſhewed kindneſs unto your friend, you might have forborn in that place, and done it more privately. To which I anſwered, I knew not but that place was as free as another, he having ſatisfied the law. The teſtimony that was given by Mr. Cole was this, "I ſaw John Hazel take Obadiah Holmes by the hand, but what he ſaid I cannot tell." This is the ſubſtance of all the proceedings until the laſt day at night, and then they ſaid I ſhould be whipt, but ſaid ſome of their officers, the whipper cannot be found. Then they commanded that they ſhould be ready by the ſecond day morning, and then I did expect to be called forth: but neither that day, nor the third, nor fourth, was I called, but am as I underſtand reſerved unto the fifth day, to be more publick in the view of the world; and when the fifth day came, as I had many before, ſo alſo then, that would have paid the fine, If I would give my conſent, which I denied to do, and ſo ſee myſelf by the power of Chriſt to ſuffer what ſhould be inflicted upon me; but when noon came I was told I ſhould not ſuffer whipping, yet not having a diſcharge, I did not look to be freed until the keeper told me, I might go about my buſineſs. Then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a diſcharge (meaning under the magiſtrates hands) ſo he had me go, he would diſcharge me.</p>
               <p>"The ſtrokes I was enjoined by the Court to have, were ten with a three-corded whip; the very ſame number I underſtand, that the worſt malefactors that were there puniſhed had, of which ſome were guilty
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:015240_0256_0FA372268921EBD0"/>of common whoredom, other of forcing a little child, and one Indian for coining of money. Thus far have you a relation according to my beſt remembrance from the firſt to the laſt of all the paſſages concerning this matter; by me John Hazel, written with mine own hand in Boſton priſon, the 13th day of the 7th month, 1651.</p>

And where there are ſome things wrong, yet how little care has been uſed by his party to diſtinguiſh the innocent fromt he guilty, among the baptiſts? So far from ſuch a care, that from his day to ours, it had been a common trade of that party to ranſack Germany, in order to reproach the Engliſh baptiſts with errors and bad actions, which we never had any more concern with, than our accuſers have with the whoredom of pope Joan!</note> We are amongſt thoſe whom (if you knew us better) you would account, peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Iſrael. Yet neither are we ſo vaſt in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence or toleration, as to think the men you ſpeak of, ſuffered an unjuſt cenſure.

As for his whipping, it was more volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily choſen by him than inflicted on him. His cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by the Court was to have paid (as I know) 30 pounds, or elſe be whipt; his fine was offered to be paid by friends for him freely, but he choſe rather to be whipt; in which caſe, if his ſuffering of ſtripes was any worſhip of God at all, ſurely it could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted no better than will-worſhip<note n="*" place="bottom">"Although the paying of a fine ſeems to be but a ſmall thing in compariſon of a man's parting with his religion, yet the paying of a fine is the acknowledging of a tranſgreſſion; and for a man to acknowledge that he has tranſgreſſed when his conſcience tells him he has not, is but little if any at thing all ſhort of parting with his religion; and 'tis likely that this might be the conſideration of thoſe ſufferers.

               <p>"BUT be pleaſed to conſider this point a little further. You think to compel men in matter of worſhip is to make them ſin. If the worſhip be lawful in itſelf, the magiſtrate compelling him to come to it, compelleth him not to ſin, but the ſin is in his will that needs to be compelled to a chriſtian duty. If it do make men hypocrites, yet better be hypocrites than profane perſons. Hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward man, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane

We doubt it much." To this the other party, by the help of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſter, returned a long anſwer, the turning point of which was in theſe words, viz. "What we demand of you is equal and right; what you demand of us is evil and ſinful; and hence we have the golden rule upon our ſide, while you are receeding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from it; for if we were in an error and out of the right way, as we ſee and <hi>know</hi> that you are in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reſpects, and you ſee and <hi>knew</hi> it of us, as <hi>we do</hi> of you, we think the golden rule would oblige you to tell us of our error, and not let us alone to go on peacibly in it, that is without uſing proper means to recover and reclaim us; whether by the laws of God, or the good and wholeſome laws of the land, as we now treat you."</p>

Mr. Clarke and Holmes might have gone to the eſtabliſhed worſhip, if they <hi>would;</hi> and Mr. Holmes might have had his fine paid it ſeems if he <hi>would,</hi> and ſo all his devotion under the whip is declared to be "no better than <hi>will worſhip.</hi>" According to Mr. Cotton's own words, men might then be anabaptiſts, antinomians and what not, if they would but come to hear the right miniſter, and join with the right churches; and is not the greateſt complaint they have at this day againſt the baptiſts, becauſe they refuſe to commune with pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt churches? They profeſſed to grant liberty of conſcience then, as well as now. Captain Johnſon who wrote in the time we are upon, ſays of erronious perſons, "They report in all places where they come, that New-England government doth perſecute the people and churches of Chriſt; which to ſpeak truth, they have hitherto been ſo far from, that they have endeavoured to expel all ſuch beaſts of prey (who will not be reclaimed) that here might be none left to hurt or deſtroy in all God's holy mountain.—Neither do they exerciſe civil power to bring all men under their obedience, to a uniformity in every point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but to keep them in the unity of the ſpirit, and the bond of peace; nor yet have they ever mixed their civil powers with the authority peculiarly given by Chriſt to his churches and officers of them, but from time to time have laboured to uphold their privileges, and only communion one with another."<note n="*" place="bottom">Johnſon's hiſtory, p. 107.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is readily granted that the ſentiments of Mr. Williams and Mr. Clark, about religous liberty, have had a great ſpead ſince that day, ſo that men of a contrary mind cannot carry their oppreſſive ſchemes ſo
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:015240_0263_0FA3722BC76C5C30"/>far now as they did then: yet, as to ſuch as ſtill hold that they have a right to uſe ſecular force to ſupport worſhip, I think the chief difference between them and their fathers in 1651, lies in theſe two points: <hi>Then</hi> they gave the church the whole power of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſettling miniſters; <hi>now</hi> the world is empower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to controul the church in her choice; <hi>then</hi> they obliged men to hear, as well as ſupport their good miniſters; <hi>now</hi> men may hear whom they pleaſe, if they will but let the pariſh miniſter have their money; but if that is refuſed, men are as liable to impriſonment or confiſcation of goods now as then; and whether the compelling of a man to pay for that which is no benefit to him, be not an action more void of the very appearance of juſtice, than the compelling of men to hear what the compellers eſteemed good preaching was, is freely refered to every reader's conſcience: as it alſo is, whether the real error in both caſes does not lie in blending divine and human laws together, rather than in any miſtake about applying of them then, more than now.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have abundant reaſon to think that Mr. Clarke's narrative of their ſentiments and ſufferings, is a true and juſt one; for he publiſhed it in 1652, and it greatly concerned the Maſſachuſetts colony to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the ſame if they could, and they did not want for men of ability and inclination to vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that reſpect, if they had found matter to work upon. But Captain Johnſon who publiſhed his hiſtory of that colony in 1654, is ſilent about this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable affair. Mr John Leverett their agent at the Britiſh Court, wrote to governor Endicot about it; but he in a letter of June 29 1657, ſays, "I cannot for the preſent anſwer your expectation touching Rhode-Iſland, and Clarke and Holmes."<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſ. hiſt, vol. III, p. 300.</note> Mr.
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:015240_0264_0FA3722C8A7EF748"/>Morton printed his New-England memorial in 1669, in which he endeavours to vindicate the country againſt many other compaints, but leaves this narrative un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched. Mr. Hubbard wrote a large hiſtory of the country in 1680, yet touches not this affair unleſs in an obſcure hint which confutes nothing. Dr. Cotton Mather publiſhed his folio hiſtory of New-England in 1702, but paſſes over theſe ſufferings in ſilence; yea, and ſo does governor Hutchinſon, though his hiſtory is the moſt impartial upon religious diſputes of any that has been written in this country, yet he ſays, "The firſt proſecution I find upon record of any of the people called anabaptiſts was in the year 1665."<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſ. hiſt. vol. 1. p. 226.</note> Indeed in his third volume, which is a collection of ancient papers, are a few references to theſe ſufferers, which I have now made uſe of, but inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing, they confirm Mr. Clarke's narrative. Mr. Neal who wrote in London 1720, has from that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative given a brief account of their ſufferings, and has done them the moſt honour of any pedobaptiſt author I ever ſaw; though he has made ſeveral miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes about them.<note n="†" place="bottom">As in vol. I. p. 298 he ſays, "Mr. Newman admoniſhed Holmes of his offence; but finding him obſtinate, and not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give an account of his conduct to the church, he excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated him;" for which he gaves no other proof than Mr. Clarke's narrative, and that informs us, p. 24, that the firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Mr. Holmes's ſeparation was, "That ſeven of the brethren ſhould paſs an act of admonition upon a brother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the reſt, we (ſays Mr. Holmes) being 23 in number, who might all in one hour's ſpace, if in health, have come together; ſo when I heard of it I went to Mr. Newman, and told him of the evil which he and the other ſix had done; he told me they were the church repreſentative, and if four of them had done it, it had been a church act. When this comes to the congregation, with much ado, he got five more to himſelf, and then they were twelve and we eleven, then they owned themſelves to be the church, and began to deal with me for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they had abuſed the church, and had took from them their power; whereupon I told them I ſhould renounce them, till either they ſaw their ſin, or I further light." After which a number more drew off and ſet up a meeting by themſelves, and there was public notice of the day when they were to be baptized, and many witneſſes of the tranſaction, yet ſays he, "not one man or woman of Mr. Newman's company ever come to deal with me for evil either in judgement or practice till a long time after." Now is it juſt to charge Mr. Holmes with obſtinacy, only for his refuſing to ſubmit to the other party after this?

               <p n="3">3. BY all that appears, thoſe baptiſt fathers were ſound in the faith and much acquainted with experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and practical religion. All that was proved againſt them may be ſummed up in their noble teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that there is, "None to or with Chriſt the Lord, by way of commanding and ordering with reſpect to the worſhip of God: that baptiſm or dipping in water is one of his commandments, and that a viſible believer of diſciple of Chriſt is the only perſon that is to be baptized; that every ſuch believer, may in point of liberty, yea, ought in point of duty to improve that talent his Lord hath given him with meekneſs of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that no ſuch believer hath any liberty, much leſs authority from his Lord, to ſmite his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervant, nor yet with outward force to reſtrain his conſcience, nor outward man for conſcience ſake, where injury is not offered to the perſon, name or eſtate of others." This is the ſum of all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for which they ſuffered ſuch cruel things, tho' their oppoſites have conſtantly accuſed them of others. The aſſembly of the Maſſachuſetts begin their law againſt the baptiſts in 1644, with ſaying, "That ſince the firſt ariſing of the anabaptiſts about 100 years ſince, they have been the incendiaries of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:015240_0266_0FA3722E0899C070"/>and the infectors of perſons in main matters of religion, and the troublers of churches in all places where they have been;" and great pains have been taken by teachers and writers from that day to this, to connect theſe odious ideas with the very name of anabaptiſts. But let the reader judge whether it be poſſible with miniſters of any denomination, to viſit and worſhip with any of their brethren, more peacibly than theſe miniſters did to their brother at Lynn; and whether he can find one of their martyrs who ſhewed leſs of a diſpoſition for denying the lawful authority of magiſtrates, or more of a chriſtian temper in ſuffering, under their unlawful uſurpations, than theſe baptiſts did. And whether they were hetrodox or not in main matters of religion, may be partly gathered from the foregoing account, and ſtill further by the confeſſion of their faith inſerted below.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. Clarke leſs a confeſſion of his ſaith in writing, from whence an extract was inſerted in the records of his church, the main of which here follows.</p>
                     <p>"The decree of God is that whereby God hath from eternity ſet down with himſelf whatſoever ſhall come to paſs in time, Eph. i. 11. All things with their cauſes, effects, circumſtances and manner of being, are decreed by God, Acts, ii. 23. <hi>Him being delivered by the determinate counſel and foreknowledge of God,</hi> &amp;c. Acts, iv. 28. This decree is moſt wiſe, Rom. xi. 32. Moſt juſt, Rom. ix. 13.14. Eternal, Eph, i. 4.5. 2. Theſs. ii. 13. Neceſſary, Pſa. xxxiii. 11. Prov. xix. 21. Unchangable, Heb. vi. 17. Moſt free, Rom. ix. 18. And the cauſe of all good, Jam. i. 17. But not of any ſin, 1. John, i. 5. The ſpecial decree of God concerning angels and men is called <hi>predeſtination,</hi> Rom. viii. 30. Of the former. viz. angels, little is ſpoken in the holy ſcripture; of the latter more is revealed, not unprofitable to be known. It may be defined the wiſe, free, juſt, eternal and unchangable ſentence or decree of God, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to create and govern man for his ſpecial glory, viz. the praiſe of his glorious mercy and juſtice, Rom. ix. 17, 18, and xi. 36. Election is the decree of God, of his free love, grace and mercy, chooſing ſome men to faith, holineſs and eternal life, for the praiſe of his glorious mercy, 1 Theſ. i. 4. 2. Theſ. 11.13. Rom. viii. 29.30. The cauſe which moved the Lord to elect them who are choſen, was none other but his meer good wiil and pleaſure, Luke xii, 32. The end is the manifeſtation of the riches of his grace and mercy, Rom ix. 23. Eph. i. 6. The fending of Chriſt, faith, holineſs, and eternal life, are the effects of his love, by which he manifeſteth the infinite riches of his grace. In the ſame order God doth execute this decree in time, he did decree it in his eternal counſel, 1 Theſ. v. 9. 2 Theſ. ii. 13. Sin is the effect of man's free will, and condemnation is an effect of juſtice inflicted upon man for ſin and diſobedience.— A man in this life may be ſure of this election, 2 Pet. i. 10. 1 Theſ. i. 4. Yea of his eternal happineſs—but not of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reprobation; for he that is now profane, may be called hereafter." Thus far Mr. Clarke.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Holmes ſays, "Having had two three requeſts from my friends and brethren, in ſpecial my brother Robert, to give ſome information of my preſent ſtate and ſtanding with reference to the Lord, and my own ſoul, ſhall as briefly as I can, give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof.—But before! come to ſpeak to the point in hand, I cannot forget the rock out of which I was hewn, and the ſiſtern out of which I was digged; who was by nature a child of wrath as well as others, and by actual tranſgreſſion added ſin to ſin, as my conſcience and others did know. But God had mercy for me in ſtore when I neither deſerved it nor defired it, for he knows who are his; and the elect ſhall obtain it, forever bleſſed be his holy name, to whom be glory forever, amen. Now in this faith or belief I ſtand, not doubting but it is the faith of God's elect.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I believe there is one Eſſence or Being, even one God, who made heaven and earth, the waters, and all things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, who governs all things by the word of his power, and hath appointed life and death to men and bounded their habitations, whoſe providence extendeth to the leaſt creature and actions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I believe this God is father to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. In a ſpecial underſtanding may be diſtinguiſhed as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and yet but one in Eſſence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I believe that as God made the world, ſo by his word made he man in his own image without ſin, and gave him a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent place and being, giving him commandment what he ſhould do, and what he ſhould forbear; but through the mallice of Satan working with his wife was deceived; for ſhe did eat, and gave her huſband and he did eat, which was the firſt cauſe of the curſe to him, and reached to all his poſterity, by which came death natural, and death eternal.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I believe in this interim of time the Lord manifeſted his great love in that word, the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the head of the ſerpent, but enmity was between the two ſeeds.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I believe that at and after time the Lord was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped by ſacrifices, though darkly held forth to us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I believe after that God in his own time choſe a people to himſelf, and gave them his laws and ſtatutes in a ſpecial manner, though he had always his choſen ones in every generation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I believe with this people he made a choice cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be their God, and they to be his people: which covenant they brake though he was a father to them, and was grieved for them, and yet did not only give them his laws, but ſent his prophets early and late, but they would not hear; and in fulneſs of time ſent his only Son: but as they had abuſed his prophets, ſo they killed his only Son.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. I believe God in his Son made a new covenant, a ſure and everlaſting covenant, not like that he made with Iſrael, of which Moſes that faithful ſervant was mediator, but a covenant of grace and peace through his only Son, that whoſoever believed in him ſhoud not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. I believe that all thoſe that are in this covenant of grace, ſhall never fall away nor periſh, but ſhall have life in the prince of life, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt 10. I believe no man can come to the Son but they that are drawn by the Father to the Son, and they that come, he in no wiſe will caſt away. 11. I believe he came to call ſinners to repentance, for the whole need him not, but they that are ſick. 12. I believe that by the ſhedding of his precious blood is my redemption, and not mine only but all that or ſhall be ſaved. 13. I believe that as he was God ſo was he man, for he did not take the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of angels but the nature of Abraham. 14. I believe God hath laid the iniquity of all his elect and called ones upon him. 15. I believe the Father is fully ſatisfied, and the debt is truly paid to the utmoſt farthing, and the poor ſinner is quit, and ſet free from all ſin paſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and to come. 16. I believe the holy ſcriptures which teſtify of Chriſt in dark ſhadows and types, and all that was he was born of a virgin at Bethlehem, and come to his own and they received him not. 17. I believe he was put to death and hanged upon a tree, called the croſs, and was buried, and the third day roſe again according to the ſcriptures, and appeared to many 18. I believe he aſcended to his Father and ſitteth at his right hand, having made requeſt for his. 19. I believe that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commandment and his declaration of him is to be obſerved, when the Father uttered that voice ſaying, <hi>this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed hear ye him.</hi>— 20. I believe there is no ſalvation but by him alone; no other name under heaven by which man can be ſaved. 21. I believe he is ſent unto the world, and to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all men; but ſome, ye many reject the counſel of God againſt themſelves. 22. I believe none have power to chooſe ſalvation, or to believe in Chriſt for life; 'its only the gift of God. 23. I believe although God can bring men to Chriſt, and cauſe them to believe in him for life, yet he hath appointed an ordinary way to effect that great work of faith, which is by means of ſending a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry into the world, to publiſh repentance to the ſinner, and ſalvation, and that by Jeſus Chriſt; and they that are faithful ſhall ſave their own ſouls and ſome that hear them 24. I believe that they that are ſent of God are not to deliver a miſſion of their own brain, but as it is in the ſcripture of truth, for holy men wrote as they were inſpired by the holy Spirit. 25. I believe the precious gifts of the Spirit's teaching were procured by Chriſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention and given to men for begetting of ſouls to the truth, and for eſtabliſhment and conſolation of thoſe that are turned to the Lord; for none ſhall pluck them out of his Father's hand. 26.

I believe this miniſtry is to go forth, and he that hath received grace with a talent or talents, as he hath received freely, of the Lord, ſo he it freely to give, looking for nothing again but the promiſe of the Lord. 28. I believe none is to go forth but by commiſſion, and carefully to obſerve the ſame according as Chriſt gave it fort without adding or diminiſhing; firſt to preach Chriſt, that is to make diſciples, and then to baptize them, but not to bapatize them before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and then to teach them what Chriſt commanded them.

Mr. Coddington, who had the deeds and records of the Iſlands in his own hands, went to England, and procured from the council of ſtate a commiſſion, dated April 3. 1651, ſigned by J. Bradſhaw, conſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting him governor of the iſlands, to rule them with a council of ſix men, nominated by the people and approved by himſelf; which ſplit this little colony into two parts, and Mr. Clarke and his brethren were to ſubmit to a governor that they had no hand in
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:015240_0278_0FA37237D3444040"/>chuſing, and their eſtates lay at his mercy. This melancholy news arrived juſt about the time that he and his brethren had been ſo cruelly handled in the Maſſachuſetts, only for viſiting and worſhiping with an aged brother there. At the ſame time, a party both of Engliſh and ſavages were ſupported in the heart of Mr. Williams's part of the colony, in oppoſition to all the good orders that he endeavored to eſtabliſh among them. And what could they now do! where could they go for relief! baniſhed from their mother kingdom, and from neighbouring colonies, who were exerting all their power to divide and conquer them; and a man of the greateſt worldly note among them, ſeemed as if he was like to do it effectually.<note n="*" place="bottom">Near the ſame time the court at Boſton impoſed a large fine upon the church in Malden, for calling a man to be their miniſter, without the approbation of the rulers and other miniſters; and as they had before a law againſt gathering churches without their conſent, their aſſembly now made another wherein they enacted, "That no miniſter ſhould be called unto office in any of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, without the approbation of ſome of the magiſtrates, as well as the neighbouring churches; on which ground in the year 1653, the court would not allow the north church in Boſton to call Mr. Powell, a well gifted though illetirate perſon to the ſtated office of a public teacher or miniſter; wherefore the people contented themſelves with his being called to the place of a ruling elder.—And whereas the plantations of New-England had never as yet been acquainted, with the way of paying tithes for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the miniſtry, it was now left to be power of the county courts throughout the whole juriſdiction, to make ſufficient proviſion for the maintenance of the miniſtry in the reſpective towns of the colony."</note>

               <p>A LITTLE look back will give a more clear and juſt view of the important concerns of Mr. Williams's agency at this time. When the commiſſioners of the united colonies met at Plymouth September 7, 1648, Mr. Coddington and Capt. Partridge tried for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with them, but were denied it, unleſs they would come in as part of Plymouth colony. Mr. Henry Bull then complained to them, that ſome Narraganſet Indians had beat him, and done him other injuries; and Mr. John Smith aſſiſtant for War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, ſent a writing by Mr. Holden and Warner, in the behalf of the whole town, "wherein they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, among other things, of divers injuries, inſolences and affronts offered them by the Indians that are about them, and near inhabitants to them, as namely. killing their cattle, about a hundred hogs, abuſing their ſervants when they take them alone, ſometimes making violent entrance into their houſes, and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the maſters thereof, ſtealing and purloining their goods; and hereupon do earneſtly deſire to know the
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:015240_0280_0FA37239498B5C00"/>minds of the commiſſioners herein, and to receive advice from them." Upon which the commiſſioners gave them a writing to the ſachems and others to warn them "to prevent and abſtain from all ſuch miſcarriges for the future, and if any of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any injury from the Engliſh, upon complaint in due place and order, ſatisfaction ſhall be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored them according to juſtice, as the like will be expected from them." When the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers met at Boſton, July 23, 1649: Warwick wrote again to them; but they refuſed to do any thing for their defence, till they could find under what colony their plantation fell, and it was then diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether it belonged to the Maſſachuſetts, or Plymouth, and they adviſed the latter to take it, When the commiſſioners met again at Hartford, September 5th, 1650, they received a letter from Mr. Eaſton preſident, in the name of the council of that colony, in which he declared, that "Rhode-Iſland and Warwick were combined and bound mutually to ſupport one another." Upon this the commiſſioners mention a former article of advice which they had received from the honorable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of parliament, "that in this and like caſes the bounds of patents ſhould be firſt ſet out by a jury, of unintereſted perſons, and that all inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the limits ſo ſet forth, ſhould fall under the government eſtabliſhed by patent." But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of following this direction, after mentioning that the inhabitants of Warwick claimed an intereſt in Mr. Williams's patent, and refuſed to be brought under the Maſſachuſetts government, they adviſed the authority of Plymouth "forthwith to reſume the right they formerly had by patent to the place." And that if the inhabitants refuſed to ſubmit to them then the advice of ſaid committee ſhould be

And as to what the governor of Plymouth and ſome others did in 1650, about ratifying that former reſignation of Warwick to the Maſſachuſetts, they ſaid they had "proteſted againſt it in the court of Plymouth, as being directly contrary to the order of the honorable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the parliament of England, and contrary to the articles of confederations with the reſt of the colonies, And whereas we are informed, that the court of the Maſſachuſetts have lately ſent out

                     <p>ON the 2d of October, the council of ſtate gave and order and wrote letters to vacate Mr. Codding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's commiſſion, and to confirm their former cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; which were ſent over by William Dyre. And about the 16th of February 1653, he brought a letter to Providence, ſigned by Meſſrs, Sanford Baulſton, Porter and William Jefferies, requeſting the two towns on the main to appoint a time to meet thoſe on the iſland, to hear and act upon the ſtates letters. Providence met upon the affair, and enquired why thoſe letters were not brought to
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:015240_0289_0FA372400E20CA70"/>them, ſeeing they had continued to act upon the charter, after the iſland was parted from them? Dyre told them that the two agents had united in their petition, and that as it appeared to him that the iſland was the major part of the colony, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had the greateſt intereſt in the letters, and he had left them there. Preſident Smith, William Field, and ſome others joined with Dyre, and ſtrove to perſwade them to "account themſelves a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered confuſed rout, as he acknowledged the iſlanders were, and to accout all officers orders of court, laws and caſes depending as null, and to come to a popular meeting to lay a new founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government for the colony." This they could not conſent to, but each town choſe ſix com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners who met at Pawtuxet on February 25th, and ſent four meſſengers to the iſland for thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or a copy of them; and that if the ſtates orders were for them all to unite again, then to agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a meeting for that purpoſe.

               <p>A COPY of this he ſent to each town, and many of the freemen met on the ſaid March 1ſt, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of throwing all up, they ordered, "That all officers who were in place when Mr. Coddington's commiſſion obſtructed, ſhould ſtand in their places, to act according to their former commiſſions, upon the iſland; and the reſt in the colony according as they had been annually choſen, until a new elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to former order." The commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners met again at Pawtuxet on March 9th, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the anſwer of their meſſengers from the iſland, who reported what was done, but that they could not obtain ſo much as a copy of thoſe letters from England. Upon which they ſent again therefor, and alſo a propoſal of joining with the towns on the iſland in the next election, if they would agree to it in their former method, and give them ten days notice. By ſome means ſuch notice was not given, therefore the two towns on the main met at Providence, May 17th, 1653, and elected their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. And aſſembly met at the ſame time on the iſland, and choſe Mr. Sanford their preſident, and ſome aſſiſtant for each town in the colony. And they ſent Mr. James Barker, and Mr. Richard Knight to Mr. Coddington, to demand the ſtatute book, and book of records. And as it was then a time of war betwixt England and Holland, and a mention was made of it in the letters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their charter, Dyre thought to make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereby, and procured commiſſions for himſelf, Capt. Underhill, and Edward! lull, to act againſt the Dutch in America; and ſome cannon with twenty men were ſent to the Engliſh on the
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:015240_0291_0FA372418AD68D28"/>eaſt end of Long-Iſland, to enable them to act againſt the Dutch who lay to the weſtward of them. This alarmed Providence colony, who met again in June, and a third time at Warwick, on Auguſt 13th, when they anſwered a letter from the Maſſachuſetts, and remonſtrated againſt being drawn into a war with the Dutch; and wrote to Mr. Williams an account of Dyre's conduct, and of their being urged to give up their former actings as null; but ſay they, "being ſtill in the ſame order you left us, and obſerving two great evils that ſuch a courſe would bring upon us. Firſt, the hazard of involving in all the diſorders and blood ſhed which have been committed on Rhode-Iſland ſince their ſeparation from us." Secondly, the invading and fruſtrating of juſtice in divers weighty cauſes then orderly depending in our courts, in ſome of which cauſes Mr. Smith, preſident, William Field, &amp;c. were deeply concerned;" therefore they could not yield to ſuch a motion.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Query,</hi> How did he know but that his hurry and darkneſs was cauſed by the oppoſition of his heart, and the injections of the devil againſt the truth?

<pb n="284" facs="unknown:015240_0295_0FA372448A48B4A8"/>came to converſe with a gentleman who knew more than he did, it raiſed ſcruples in his mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that practice.

Sure I am that if any baptiſt miniſter had told ſuch a ſtory, and that it made him <hi>fearful</hi> of going near a learned gentleman, whoſe arguments had bro't him to ſcruple whether he had not been educated in a wrong way, but that he was <hi>reſolved</hi> to have an argument able to <hi>work miracles</hi> before he would leave, it, the other party would then have had ſuch grounds, to charge the baptiſt with <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> and <hi>obſtinacy</hi> upon, as they never yet had.</p>

                     <p>"MY dear and loving friends and neigbours of Providence and Warwick; our noble friend Sir Henry Vane, having the navy of England moſtly depending on his care, and going down to the navy at Portſmouth, I was invited by them both to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his lady to Lincolnſhire, where I ſhall yet
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:015240_0297_0FA372460F6A9C08"/>ſtay as I fear until the ſhip is gone; I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray your pardon that by the poſt I ſend this to London. I hope it may have pleaſed the moſt high Lord of ſea and land to bring Capt. Ch-rſt-n's ſhip and dear Mr. Dyre unto you, and with him the councils letters, which anſwer the petition Sir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vane and myſelf drew up, and the council by Sir Henry's mediation granted us, for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the charter, until the determination of the controverſy. This determination you may pleaſe to underſtand is hindered by two main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. The firſt is the mighty war with the Dutch, which makes England and Holland and the nations tremble: This hath made the parliament ſit Sir Henry Vane and two or three more as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to manage the war, which they have done with much engaging the name of God with them, who hath appeared in helping ſixty of ours againſt almoſt three-hundred of their men of war, and perchance to the ſinking and taking about one-hundred of theirs, and but one of ours which was ſunk by our own men. Our ſecond obſtruction is the oppoſition of our adverſaries, Sir Arther Haſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig and Colonel Fenwicke, who hath married his daughter, Mr. Winſlow and Mr. Hopkins, both in great place;<note n="*" place="bottom">Winſlow died in the Weſt-Indies in 1655.</note> and all the friends they can make in the parliament and council, and all the prieſts both preſbyterian and independant; ſo that we ſtand as two armies ready to engage, obſerving the motions and poſtures each of other, and yet ſhy each of other.—Under God the ſheet anchor of our ſhip is Sir Henry, who will do as the eye of God leads him, and he faithfully promiſed me that he would obſerve the motion of our New-England buſineſs, while I ſtayed ſome ten weeks with his lady in
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:015240_0298_0FA37246CE3659F8"/>Lincolnſhire. Beſide here is great thoughts and preparation for a new parliament; ſome of our friends are apt to drink another parliament will more favor us and our cauſe than this has done. You may pleaſe to put my condition into your ſouls caſes; remember, I am a father and an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; I have longed earneſtly to return with the laſt ſhip, and with theſe, yet I have not been willing to withdraw my ſhoulders from the burthen leaſt it pinch others, and may fall heavy upon all; except you are pleaſed to give to me a diſcharge. If you conceive it neceſſary for me ſtill to attend this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, pray you conſider if it be not convenient that my poor wife be incouraged to come over to me, and to wait together on the good pleaſure of God for the end of this matter. You know my many weights hanging on me; how my own place ſtands, and how many reaſons I have to cauſe me to make haſte, yet I would not loſe their eſtates, peace and liberty, by leaving haſtily. I write to my dear wife, my great deſire of her coming while I ſtay; yet left it to the freedom of her ſpirit, becauſe of the many dangers; truly at preſent the ſeas are dangerous, but not comparably ſo much nor likely to be, becauſe of the late great defeat of the Dutch, and their preſent ſending to us offers of peace. My dear friends although it pleaſed God himſelf, by many favors to incourage me, yet pleaſe you to remember, that no man can ſtay here as I do, leaving a preſent employment there, without much ſelf-denial, which I beſeech God for more, and for you alſo, that no private reſpects or gains or quarrels may cauſe you to neglect the public and common ſafety, peace and liberties. I beſeech the bleſſed God to keep freſh in your thoughts what he hath done for Providence-Plantations.

How is it that there are ſuch diviſions amongſt you? Such headineſs, tumults, diſorders injuſtice? The noiſe echoes into the cars of all, as well friends as enemies, by every return of ſhips from thoſe parts. Is not the fear and awe of God amongſt you to reſtrain? Is not the love of Chriſt in you to fill you with earning
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:015240_0300_0FA372EB5E8A9E68"/>bowels one towards another, and conſtrain you not to live to yourſelves but to him that died for you, yea, and is riſen again?

Surely when kind and ſimple remedies are applied and are ineffectual, it ſpeaks loud and broadly, the high and dangerous diſtempers of ſuch a body, as if the wounds were incurable. But I hope better things from you, though I thus ſpeak, and ſhoud be apt to think, that by commiſſioners agreed on and appointed on all parts, and on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all intereſts, in a general meeting, ſuch a union and common ſatisfaction might ariſe, as through God's bleſſing might put a ſtop to your growing breaches and diſtractions, ſilence your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, encourage your friends, honor the name of God which of late hath been much blaſphemed by reaſon of you; and in particular refreſh and revive the ſad heart of him who mourns over your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evils, as being your affectionate friend, to ſerve you in the Lord.</p>

Secondly, Mr. Dyre, with no leſs want of a public ſpirit, being ruined by party contentions with Mr. Coddington, and being betruſted to bring from England the letters of the council of ſtate for our re-unitings, he hopes for a recruit to himſelf by other men's goods; and (contrary to the ſtates intentions and expreſſions) plungeth himſelf and ſome others, in moſt unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and unrighteous plundering, both of Duch and French, and Engliſh alſo, to our great grief, who proteſted againſt ſuch abuſe of our power from England; and the end of it is to the ſhame and reproach of himſelf, and the very Engliſh name, as all theſe parts do witneſs."</p>

I further add, that I never denied, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this liberty, the commander of this ſhip ought to command the ſhip's courſe; yea, and alſo command that juſtice, peace and ſobriety to be kept and practiſed, both among the ſeamen and all the paſſengers.

               <p>MR. John Brown, who had long been one of their magiſtrates, and often a commiſſioner for his colony, took a voyage to England. Capt. James Cudworth of Scituate, was a magiſtrate theſe two years; and near the beginning of this year he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained Copeland and Brend, two of the Quakers, at his houſe a night or two, and ſays, "I thought it better ſo to do, than with the blind world, to cenſure, condemn and rail at them, when they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw their perſons, nor knew any of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; but the Quakers and myſelf cannot cloſe in divers things; and ſo I ſignified to the court, I was no Quaker, but muſt bear my teſtimony againſt ſundry things that they held, as I had occaſion and opportunity. But withal I told them, that as I was no Quaker, ſo I would be no perſecutor. This ſpirit worked in thoſe two years that I was of the magiſtracy; during which time, I was on ſundry occaſions forced to declare my diſſent, in ſundry actings of that nature; which although I did with all moderation of expreſſion, together with reſpect unto the reſt, yet it wrought great diſaffection and prejudice againſt me." A perſon took pains to go to Marſhfield to procure a warrant to apprehend the Quakers he had entertained, which Mr. Hatherly underſtanding ſaid. Mr. <hi>Envy hath procured this;</hi> and in lieu of it, gave them a paſs under his hand, with which they travelled to Plymouth; but were there ſeized and whipt, by order of three other magiſtrates. And ſays, Captain Cudworth, "Truly the whipping of them with that cruelty as ſome have been, and their patience under it, hath
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:015240_0330_0FA3730188A349D8"/>ſometimes been the occaſion of gaining more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to them, than if they had ſuffered them openly to have preached a ſermon.—The Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, after they have whipped them, and cut their ears, they have now gone the fartheſt ſtep they can, they baniſh them upon pain of death, if ever they come there again. We expect we muſt do the like; we muſt dance after their pipe; now Plymouth ſaddle is on the bay-horſe, we ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them on the career.—All theſe carnal and antichriſtian ways being not of God's appointment, effect nothing as to hindering of them in their way or courſe. It is only the word and ſpirit of the Lord, that is able to convince gainſayers. They are the mighty weapons of the chriſtian warfare, by which great and mighty things are done and accompliſhed.—Our civil powers are ſo exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in things appertaining to the kingdom of Chriſt, in matters of religion and conſcience, that we can have no time to effect any thing that tends to the promotion of the civil weal, or proſperity of the place; but now we muſt have a <hi>ſtate-religion,</hi> ſuch as the powers of the world will allow, and no other; a <hi>ſtate-miniſtry,</hi> and a <hi>ſtate-way of mainteinance;</hi> and we muſt worſhip and ſerve the Lord Jeſus, as the world ſhall appoint us. We muſt all go to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic place of meeting, in the pariſh where we dwell, or be preſented. I am informed of three or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore laſt court, preſented for not coming to public meetings; and let me tell you how they brought this about. You may remember a law once made, called Thomas Hinckley's law, <hi>That if any neglected the worſhip of God, in the place where he lives, and ſet up a worſhip contrary to God, and the allowance of this government, to the public prophanation of God's holy day and ordinance, ſhall pay ten ſhillings.</hi> This
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:015240_0331_0FA373024B320B08"/>law would not reach what then was aimed at; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he muſt do ſo and ſo; that is, all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in expreſſed, or elſe break not the law. In March laſt, a court of deputies was called, and ſome acts touching Quakers were made; and then they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to make this law ſerviceable to them; and that was by putting out the word <hi>and,</hi> and putting in the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d <hi>or,</hi> which is a disjunctive, and makes every branch become a law. So now, if any neglect, or will not come to the public meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ten ſhillings for every defect.—And theſe men altering this law laſt March, yet left it dated, June 6th, 1681, [See page 214] and ſo it ſtands as the act of a general court; they to be the authors of it ſeven years before it was in being; and ſo yourſelves have your part and ſhare in it, it the records lie not. But what may be the reaſon that they ſhould not by another law, made and dated by that court, as well effect what was intended, as by altering a word, and ſo the whole ſenſe of the law; and leave this their act, by the date of it, charged on another courts account? Surely, the chief inſtruments in the buſineſs, being privy to an act of parliament <hi>for liberty,</hi> ſhould too openly have acted repugnant to a law of England; but if they can do the thing, and leave it on a court, as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſix years before the act of parliament, there can be no danger in this.—If we can but keep the people ignorant of their liberties and privileges, then we have liberty to act in our own wills what we pleaſe.—Through mercy we have yet among us worthy Mr. DUNSTAR, whom the Lord hath made boldly to bear teſtimony againſt the <hi>ſpirit of perſecution.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe things Capt.

               <p>For the above things thoſe two magiſtrates Hatherly and Cudworth were left out of all their offices, in June, this year. At the ſame time it is meet that poſterity ſhould know how thoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers behaved under their ſufferings. Humphery Norton, one of their teachers and authors, was ſent out of Plymouth colony in 1657, for being <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagrant perſon;</hi> which charge, ſays Biſhop, <hi>could not be proved.</hi> On election day June 1ſt, 1658, he and John Rouſe came again to Plymouth, and were taken up and whipt, Norton twenty-three laſhes, and Rouſe fifteen, which Biſhop ſays, "They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for no other thing but for coming into that colony <hi>in the will of God."</hi>

               <p>AFTER this prophecy Mr. Prince continued go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of that colony near fourteen years, and then died in peace (for ought we know.) His ſon was
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:015240_0334_0FA37304B5452178"/>a juſtice of peace in his day, and his grandſon was a learned and pious miniſter at Boſton, whoſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have furniſhed many valuable materials for our hiſtory. It ought alſo to be known, that in <hi>reading the works of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting that which is low</hi>—the Quakers meant to have civil as well as eccleſiaſtical government managed by the above deſcribed power. For in thoſe times George Fox publiſhed a large book in folio, in the 170th page of which he ſaid, "The magiſtrate of Chriſt, the <hi>help government</hi> for him, <hi>he is in the light and power of Chriſt;</hi> and he is to <hi>ſubject all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of Chirſt, into his light,</hi> elſe he is not a faithful magiſtrate: and his laws here are not agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and anſwerable according to <hi>that of God in every man;</hi> when men act contrary to it, they do evil: ſo he is a terror to evil-doers, diſcerneth the precious and the juſt from the vile; and this is a praiſe to them that do well." And when Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams mentioned this paſſage, as one proof, that their ſpirit tended to arbitrary government, and fiery perſecution, they ſaid upon it, "Is there one word of perſecution here? Or can Roger Williams think himſelf a chriſtian, and look upon it to be perſecution, for Chriſt's magiſtrates by Chriſt's light and <hi>power, to ſubject all</hi> under the power of Chriſt, and to bring all into this light of Chriſt!

               <p>OUR Lord directed his diſciples to depart from any houſe or city, that they ſhould travel into, when they refuſed to receive them; and when the Gadarenes beſought him to depart out of their coaſts, he did ſo; and we have no account of his forceing himſelf upon them again; but the Quakers took another courſe. Three of them who were baniſhed, on pain of death, yet returned again to Boſton, and were condemned to die; and William Robinſon gave in a paper to the court, which contains the following reaſon for his conduct therein, viz. "On the 8th day of the 8th month, 1659, in the after part of the day, in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling betwixt Newport in Rhode-Iſland, and Daniel Gould's houſe, with my dear brother Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher Holder, the word of the Lord came expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me, which did fill me immediately with <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and heavenly love, by which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained me, and commanded me to paſs to the town of Boſton, my life to lay down in his will, for the accompliſhing of his ſervice, that he had there to perform at the day appointed.

John 3.17. and 5.45; was not the <hi>zeal</hi> of theſe men like that we read of in Rom. 10.2—4? Did they not truſt <hi>in</hi> the law inſtead of the goſpel? As to the <hi>perſon</hi> of the Saviour, Mr. Williams, ſays, "Fox in all his book cannot endure to hear of the word <hi>human,</hi> as being a new name, and never heard of in ſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I ſaid in public, many words truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Engliſh, are commendably uſed that are not in ſcripture, in Engliſh. The word human comes from the Latin <hi>humanus,</hi> ſignifying pertaining, or belonging to man: So a human ſoul or body is ſuch as all mankind have. Hence I told them, that the word <hi>anthropinos peiraſmos,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. might have been turned human, but is truly turned, no temptation but ſuch as is <hi>common to man.</hi> G. Fox knows, that if Chriſt Jeſus be granted to have had ſuch a ſoul and body as is human, or common to man, down falls their monſtrous idol of a Chriſt, called light within." To which Fox anſwers, "For thee and the prieſts to give ſuch names to Chriſt, our Lord and Saviour, which the ſcriptures do not give, and yet ſay the ſcriptures are the rule, that is abominable. And there is no ſuch word in 1 Cor. 10. that calleth Chriſt's body and ſoul <hi>human;</hi> and whether is Chriſt's body celeſtial or terreſtial, or which glory doth he bear?—1 Cor. 15.14.

But they reckoned it <hi>abominable</hi> for Mr. Williams to uſe a word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Saviour's humanity, that is, not in our tranſlation, while he at the ſame time approved of the reading as it is; yet when Hebrews 1.3. was brought in thoſe times to prove the <hi>perſonallity</hi> of the Trinity, the Quakers ſaid, "That is <hi>faſly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,</hi> for in the Greek it is not <hi>perſon</hi> but <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop, page 362.</note> And ſaid Mr. Samuel Hubbard, "They turn the holy ſcriptures into allegories, all unleſs, ſome which they wreſt to their own deſtruction, as the apoſtle Peter ſaith?</p>
               <p>THEY expreſsly held to a power of direction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, ſuperior to the ſcriptures, which carried them into actions that <hi>light</hi> from thence, or from reaſon could not juſtify; and their only way, was to appeal to an inward <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>voice.</hi> As for inſtance, George Biſhop ſpeaks of Deborah Wilſon, as a "modeſt woman, of retired life, and ſober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and that bearing a great burthen for the hardneſs and cruelty of the people, ſhe went through the town of Salem <hi>naked,</hi> as a <hi>ſign,</hi> which ſhe having in part porformed, was laid hold of, and bound over to appear at the next court of Salem, where the wicked rulers ſentenced her to be whipt." Lydia Wardwel, a married woman of Hampton, went in the ſame manner into the meeting-houſe in Newbury, in time of public worſhip; for which ſhe met with the like treatment. Mr. Williams refered the Quakers to theſe inſtances that their own author had publiſhed; and told them they never could perſuade ſouls not <hi>bewitched,</hi> that the holy ſpirit would move them to do ſo: to which they

Not only ſo, but we have lately ſeen artful men trying to prevent our union in the cauſe of our civil liberties by theſe means. But from the above facts the reader may judge, whether an invaſion of each others rights, under the name of religion, was not the real cauſe of thoſe dreadful broils; which a true acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, both as to property and conſcience, would have prevented.

               <p>WE will now return to the affairs of baptiſm: Mr Hubbard upon the year 1656, ſays, "Baptiſm unto this time had been adminiſtred unto thoſe children <hi>only,</hi> whoſe immediate parents were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into full communion in the churches where they lived: but now the country came to be increaſed, and ſundry families were found, that had children born in them, whoſe immediate parents had never attempted to join to any of the churches to which they belonged, and yet were very much unſatisfied that they could not obtain baptiſm for their children; the cauſe occaſioned many debates between the miniſters of the country." Connecticut took the lead therein, and ſent a draught of queſtions about
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:015240_0343_0FA3730B46E7DE38"/>it to the rulers of the Maſſachuſetts, requeſting that the ableſt miniſters of both colonies might be called together, to anſwer the ſame. Such an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was therefore called by authority at Boſton, June 4th, 1657, and ſat till the 10th. Their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to 21 queſtions were afterwards print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in London, under the title of <hi>A diſputation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning church members, and their children.</hi> Therein they concluded, that the children of profeſſing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, "are by means of their parents covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in covenant alſo, and <hi>members of the church</hi> by divine inſtitution. 1. Becauſe they are in that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for ſubſtance which was made with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen. 17.7. compared with Deut. 29.12. &amp;c. 2.

And alſo, that "it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of infants, who confederate in their parents, when grown up to years of diſcretion, though <hi>not yet ſit for the Lord's ſupper,</hi> to own the covenant they made with their parents, by entering thereinto in their own perſons; and it is the duty of the church to call upon them for the performance thereof; and if, being called upon, they ſhall refuſe the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this great duty, or otherwiſe continue ſcandalous, they are liable to be cenſured for the ſame by the church. And in caſe they underſtand the grounds of religion, are not ſcandalous, and ſolemnly own the covenant in their own perſons, wherein they give up both themſelves and their children unto the Lord, and deſire baptiſm for them, we (with due reverence to any godly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that may diſſent) ſee not ſufficient cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny baptiſm unto their children."</p>

               <p>MR.

Mr. John Allen of Dedham anſwered Mr. Chauncey, and Mr. Richard Mather the other, while Mr. Mitchel was employed to anſwer his ſons preface.

No; and Mr. Mitchel was ſo far from doing it in

They were not only compelled to ſign an engagement to pay all dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and coſts, and to quit any claim to the Pequot country, but alſo to ſay, "The Narraganſet and Nyantick ſagamores and deputy, hereby agree and covenant, to and with the commiſſioners of the United Colonies, that henceforward, they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give, grant, ſell, or in any manner alienate any part of <hi>their country,</hi> nor any pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

"You are to uſe your beſt endeavours to gain the enemies canoes, or utterly to deſtroy them, and herein you may make good uſe of the Indians our confederates, as you may do upon other occaſions, having due regard to the honor of God, who is both our ſword and ſhield, and to the <hi>diſtance</hi> which is to be obſerved betwixt <hi>chriſtians</hi> and <hi>barbarians,</hi> as well as in other negociations."<note n="†" place="bottom">Maſſachuſetts hiſtory, vol. 3. page 151.</note>

               <p>SIXTEEN months before that covenant was made, Paſſicus and other heads of their tribes, had by an ample deed reſigned over and ſubmitted all thoſe lands to the ſupreme authority in England, and Mr. Williams had procured a charter thereof from thence, extending <hi>unto the Pequot river and country,</hi> page 148, 192. The Maſſachuſetts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, upon granting Fiſher's iſland to Mr. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp, p. 115 ſay it lies againſt the mouth of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot river. What right of juriſdiction then had thoſe colonies eaſt of that river? and what right had Paſſicus to engage any of thoſe lands to them, which he had ſubmitted to another authority ſo long before? By repeated endeavors the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners had got all the wampum that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in ſaid covenant but 308 fathom, before they met at Hartford on Sept. 5, 1650; and then cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Atherton was ſent, with twenty armed men, to demand the remainder, with orders to ſeize their goods if the Indians refuſed to pay it; and if reſiſtance ſhould be made ſo as any life was loſt
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:015240_0353_0FA37312EDCC80A8"/>that a ſpecial meeting of the comiſſioners ſhould then be called to make war upon them for it. He accordingly went, an placed his men round Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicus's tent, and going into it, ſeized the ſachem by the hair of his head, and threatened to ſhoot him, if any reſiſtance was made. This terrified them ſo much, that the wampum was preſently paid. On July 25, 1651, at the deſire of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganſet ſachems, Mr. Williams wrote to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor at Boſton, an account of ſundry complaints they had againſt Uncas; which letter was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commiſſioners when they met at New-Hanven, the 4th of September following; but tho' Uncas was preſent yet they acted nothing upon it, becauſe the Narraganſets had not ſent any of their men to ſupport the charge. At the ſame time a tribute of 312 fathom of wampum was paid by Uncas, Ninceroſt and others, on account of the Pequots they had among them; and upon laying of it down they demanded, "Why this tribute was required, how long it ſhould continue. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore, though twelve years tribute were due before the year 1650, and though the agreement was for a yearly tribute to be paid by them and theirs, ſo long as they continue in this part of the country; yet the commiſſioners, ſomething to eaſe their ſpirits, and to engage them to an inoffenſive and peacable carriage, declared that the payment of this tribute ſhall be limited to ten years, this laſt year to be reckoned the firſt; after which, unleſs they draw trouble unto themſelves, they ſhall be free."<note n="*" place="bottom">Records of the United Colonies.</note>

               <p>SUCH an uneaſineſs among the Narraganſets was diſcovered two years after, that another army was raiſed and ſent againſt them, which compelled them into another treaty, which not being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fulfilled, the ſachems were brought on Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 13, 1660 to mortgage all their lands, to Major Atherton, and about twenty aſſociates with him, for 600 fathom fo wampum, ſaid then to be due to the commiſſioners of the united colonies. I find alſo by the records, that the Maſſachuſetts and Connecticuts could never agree how to divide the Pequot lands betwixt them, till the commiſſioners from Plymouth and New-Haven had the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them, and they on Sept. 16, 1658, ſettled the line betwixt them; which was to be Miſtick river(which runs in betwixt Stonington and G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WHEN their aſſembly met at Newport May 21, 1661, they appointed a committee upon the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they had then received from the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, "who ſeriouſly conſidered and debated cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, concerning the matter in difference, betwixt the gentlemen, and ſome friends with them, that are active in ſharing the Narraganſet lands in the colony, without the conſent of the colony; and we find by their letter, that thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, major Atherton and aſſociates are not ſo well informed of the intent of the colony as might be requiſite." And they concluded to write and give them better information, and to offer to leave the caſe to referees to ſettle it; but ſay, "In caſe a fair iſſue cannot be had, as is deſired, then, in a ſpeedy and convenient time and ſeaſon, to forbid the ſaid gentlemen, or any of their company, in his majeſty's name, from further proceeding in the ſaid purchaſe, as to poſſeſſing or ſharing of any of the ſaid lands, and to proſecute them, or any of them, in caſe they ſtill proceed without conſent of the

The 27th of Auguſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing an aſſembly met at Portſmouth, of which Mr. Williams was a member. when they ſent a commiſſion and letters to Mr. Clarke, to ſollicit for a new Charter, April 27th, 1662, the town of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence gave Mr. Clarke a full purchaſe right of land therein as a free giſt. The next month came the forgoing latter from Boſton to their aſſembly, with account of their dealing with men whom they called treſpaſers, of whom. Mr. Burdick was then a member of Mr. Clarke's church.—He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Mr. Samuel Hubbard's danghter, and has a large poſterity remaining in and about weſterly to this day. Mr. Sanford, and Mr. Greene, were now ſent to Boſton to make another trial for an amicable ſettlement of this controverſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is to be noted, that neither of thoſe colonies, who had made ſuch a noiſe about their rights, had ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any charter, either from king or parliament, of any lands, to the weſt of Providence colony till Connecticut, by the help of Mr. Winthrop, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained one dated April 23, 1662, which took New-Haven into the ſame colony. And when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners met at Boſton the 4th of September, they wrote to Rhode-Iſland rulers in their former ſtrain, and informed them of a warrant they had ſeen, ſigned by Joſeph Torry their ſecretary, in the name of the general court, "warning Capt. Gookin and others to deſiſt and forbear any further or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture poſſeſſion of any lands at or about Paucatuck as they ſhall anſwer the contrary at their peril; yet withal expreſſing your ſubmiſſion to his majeſty's determination, Wherefore [ſay the commiſſioners]
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:015240_0357_0FA37315C9064D80"/>being earneſtly deſirous to prevent any further diſturbance of the peace of the colonies, though we have no doubt of the preſent right and intereſt of the Maſſachuſetts to thoſe lands, we are willing to improve the argument which yourſelves have owned and therefore thought meet to certify you, that we have read and peruſed a charter of incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, under the broad ſeal of England, ſent over in the laſt ſhip, granted to ſome gentlemen of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, wherein the lands at Paucatuck and Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganſet are contained, which we hope will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you to require and cauſe your people to withdraw themſelves, and deſiſt from further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance."</p>
               <p>THE words in ſaid charter which they built this upon, bounded that colony eaſt, "by the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet river, commonly called Narraganſet bay, where the ſaid rive, falleth into the ſea." Now it is to be remembered, that Plymouth patent was bounded weſtward by Narraganſet and bay, and theſe coloniſts pretended that Warwick was included therein, which could not be, unleſs Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catuck was the river meant; and if it was, where is their right now to go eaſt of it by Connecticut charter? The truth is, names are arbitrary, and thoſe worthy governors, Bradford and Winſlow, took Patucket to be the river intended in their patent, p. 72, 74. And there was now leſs room left for this diſpute; for on July 8, 1663 his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty granted Rhode-Iſland charter, which deſcribes their weſt boundaries to be the middle channel of Paucatuck river up to its head, and thence a north courſe to the ſouth line of the Maſſachuſetts; which river ſays he, "having been yielded after much debate, for the fixed and certain bounds between theſe our ſaid colonies, by the agents thereof; who
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:015240_0358_0FA37316893FA148"/>have alſo agreed, that the ſaid Paucatuck river ſhall be alſo called, alias, Narraganſet river; and to prevent future diſputes that otherwiſe might ariſe thereby forever hereafter, ſhall be conſtrued, deemed and taken to be the Narraganſet river, in our late grant to Connecticut colony, mentioned as the eaſtwardly bounds of that colony." This colony of Rhode-Iſland and Providence plantations, was to extend three Engliſh miles eaſt and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt of the moſt eaſtern and northeaſtern parts of the Narraganſet bay, unto the mouth of Providence river and thence by the eaſtwardly bank of it up to Patucket falls, <hi>being the moſt weſtwardly line of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth colony;</hi> and thence due north to the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts line, by which it is bounded on the north, and by the ocean on the ſouth, including Block-Iſland, and the other iſlands within their bay. As the Indians had formerly ſent over a ſubmiſſion of themſelves and land, to the king's father, they had now ſent another to him; whereupon he ſays in this charter. "It ſhall not be lawful to, or for the reſt of the colonies, to invade or moleſt the native In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, or any other inhabitants inhabiting within they bounds and limits hereafter mentioned; they having ſubjected themſelves unto us, and being by us taken into our ſpecial protection, without the knowledge and conſent of the governor and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of our colony of Rhode-Iſland, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence-plantations."</p>
               <p>This charter appointed that a governor deputy-governor, and ten aſſiſtants ſhould be elected annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the firſt Wedneſday in May, who, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties or representatives from each town, were to make laws, not contrary to the laws of England, make grants of land, conſtitute courts of juſtice, and appoint their officers both civil and military.
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:015240_0359_0FA3731746CD5158"/>Mr. Clarke ſent over this charter, and Capt. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Dexter fetched it from Boſton; upon which a large aſſembly of the freemen in all the colony, met at Newport November 2, and ordered Capt. Dexter to take forth the charter and read it before to their view, and then to have it ſafely depoſited with governor Arnold. "And they voted to pay all Mr. Clarke's diſburſtments in going to England, in their ſervice there, and upon his intended return; as alſo one hundred pounds ſterl. as a free gratuity to him, beſide thoſe expences: yea, and to give Capt. Dexter twenty-five pounds ſterl. for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and faithfulneſs in bringing the charter from Boſton. Mr. Clarke's letters were read; upon which letters of thanks were ordered to be ſent to the king, and to lord Clarendon, for theſe great ſavors they had received by their means. The next day (after the govenor, duputy-governor, and ſix aſſiſtants had taken their engagements) they called the ſachems of the Narraganſets, and Nian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks before them, and let them know what the king had done for them; upon which they ſaid, "they return his majeſty great thanks for his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious relief, in releaſing their lands from thoſe forced purchaſes and mortgages by ſome of the other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies." But another thing which is by no means to be omitted is, that the king ſays, in their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the charter they declared, "That it is much on their hearts, if they may be permitted, to hold forth a lively experiment, that a moſt flouriſhing civil ſtate may ſtand and beſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and that among our Engliſh ſubjects, with a FULL LIBERTY IN RELIGIOUS CONCERNMENTS, and that true piety rightly grounded upon goſpel principles, will give that beſt and greateſt ſecurity
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:015240_0360_0FA3731808826FB0"/>to the ſovereignty, and will lay in the hearts of men, the ſtrongeſt obligation to true loyalty. This pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was therefore fully granted: and above a hundred years after, a worthy gentleman well ſays, "This great experiment hath been made, and it hath fully appeared, that a flouriſhing civil ſtate, and the moſt unſtained loyalty, may ſtand without the help of any religious party teſts to ſupport them, and the chriſtian religion is as little indebted to <hi>human laws</hi> for its ſupport, as it is to <hi>human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,</hi> for the purity of its morals, and the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of its doctrines."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of Providence</note>
               </p>
               <p>For ſeven years paſt there had been many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about lands, and ſtrivings to ſtrain Indian purchaſes, beyond their juſt limits, in Providence, Newport, and other parts of the colony, which Mr. Williams had a great hand in compoſing and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the particulars of which would be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, had we room for them And his HOPE in 1647; that government, held forth through love, union and order, though by few in number, and mean in condition, yet would withſtand and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mighty oppoſers, [page 200] was wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted and confirmed; the memory of which, in the figure of an ANCHOR with this word for its motto, in their colony ſeal, has been continued from that time to this. Mr. Clarke returned, June 7th, 1664, after he had ſerved his colony at the Britiſh court twelve years. In October following the aſſembly appointed him, Mr. Williams and others, to inſpect their laws, to ſee if any of them were contrary to their charter, and to make a table of them. A committee was alſo appointed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of their eaſtern and weſtern boundaries, and to write to the other colonies concerning them.
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:015240_0361_0FA37318C6CCEFB0"/>Connecticut ſtill contended for power and juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Narraganſet, and offered to leave the caſe to the colonies to Maſſachuſetts and Plymouth; which Rhode-Iſland would not do. The king's commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners who were now ſent over, heard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the ſachems and others, and entered upon the Narraganſet country in the king's name, and called it the king's province. But on the eaſt line they allowed Plymouth colony to come to the the water, till his majeſty's pleaſure ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known.<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſachuſetts hiſtory, vol. 3. page 382—414, 415.</note> And ſo the line continued, till other commiſſioners in 1741, ſettled the line according to to Rhode-Iſland charter, which gave them the towns of Briſtol, Warren, Barrington, Tiverton and Littlecompton, which Plymouth and the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts had held till then.</p>
               <p>THE firſt baptiſt church within that which is now the Maſſachuſetts ſtate, was conſtituted in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboth this year; Mr. Holmes and his friends hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only held a meeting there for a while, and then removed to Newport. For a more clear idea of of its original we muſt look over into Wales, where at Ilſton in Glamorganſhire a baptiſt church was formed, October 1ſt, 1649; the beginning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their records deſcribe thus, viz. "We cannot but admire at the unſearchable wiſdom, power and love of God, in bringing about his own deſigns, far above, and beyond the capacity and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the wiſeſt of men. Thus, to the glory of his own great name, hath he dealt with us; for when there had been no company or ſociety of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, holding forth and profeſſing the doctrine, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, order and diſcipline of the goſpel, according to the primative inſtiution, that ever we heard of in all Wales, ſince the apoſtacy, it pleaſed the Lord
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:015240_0362_0FA3731986D0BC58"/>to chuſe this dark corner to place his name in, and honor us, undeſerving creatures, with the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of being the firſt in all theſe parts, among whom was practiſed the glorious ordinance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and here to gather the firſt church of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized believers." From whence they go on to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, how Mr John Miles and Mr. Thomas Proud, went up to London the next preceeding ſpring, and by the direction of Providence, came into the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt ſociety at the Glaſs-houſe in Broadſtreet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of Mr. William Conſett, and Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Draper, "immediately after thay had kept a day to ſeek the Lord, that he would ſend labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into the dark corners of the land." Theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers were well received, and were ſoon ſent back into their own country again, and were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of gathering a baptiſt church at the time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned; and which, by a bleſſing upon their labors, increaſed by the cloſe of the next year to fifty-five members. In 1651, forty more joined to it; forty-ſeven in 1652, and by the end of 1660, two hundred and ſixty-three perſons had joined to that church, whoſe names all now ſtand in a neat book of records which they kept; which contain a diſtinct account of the means and methods they took to promote vital and practical religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſeveral branches of their ſociety; as alſo letters of correſpondence to and from their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in various parts of England and Ireland</p>
               <p>BUT here another ſcene opens.</p>
               <p>THE preſbyterians had been as much againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual religious liberty as the epiſcopalians, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted as great bitterneſs againſt thoſe who broke their power in the long parliament; and theſe two parties joined in reſtoring the ſecond Charles to the throne, who came in with plauſable promiſes
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:015240_0363_0FA3731A46CCB900"/>of <hi>indulgence to tender conſciences;</hi> and great pains were taken to accommodate matters between them, without any good effect. The epiſcopalians hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got the power into their hands, determined to cruſh all that oppoſed it. Among the reſt they wreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their vengance on Sir Henry Vane, whom they beheaded in Auguſt 1662." His indiſcretion and inſolence (ſays a great author) as well on his trial as his execution, have been extreamly aggravated; but it is eaſy to ſee, it was only to ſave the king's honor, who having poſitivly promiſed a pardon to all except the king's judges, could not avoid grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pardon to Vane, without violating his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe." And when Vane's friends perſuaded him to make ſome ſubmiſſion in order to ſave his life, he ſaid, "If the king does not think himſelf more concerned for his honor and word, than I do for my life, I am very willing they ſhould take it. Nay, I declare that I value my life leſs in a good cauſe, than the king can do his promiſe."<note n="*" place="bottom">Rapin, vol. 2. page 631.</note> A preſbyterian author who writes very bitterly againſt him, yet owns that," the two things in which he had moſt ſucceſs, and ſpake moſt plainly, were his earneſt plea for <hi>univerſal liberty of conſcience,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the magiſtrates intermeddling with religion, and his teaching his followers to revile the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, calling them ordinarily <hi>black coats, prieſts,</hi> and other names which ſavoured of reproach."

               <p>MR. Hubbard ſays,"As ſome were ſtudying how baptiſm might be enlarged and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſeed of the faithful in their ſeveral gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, there were others as ſtudious to deprive all unadult children thereof, and to reſtrain the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege inly to adult believers." And Dr. Mather, after confeſſing that very odious and unjuſt things had been publiſhed againſt anabaptiſts ever ſince Luther's time, ſays, "Infant baptiſm hath been ſcrupled by multitudes in our day, who have been in other points moſt worthy chriſtains, and as holy, whatchful, fruitful and heavenly people as perhaps any in the world. Some few of theſe people have been among the planters of New-England <hi>from the beginning,</hi> and have been welcome to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our churches, reſerving their particular o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion unto themſelves—At laſt ſome of our churches uſed, it may be, a little too much <hi>cogency</hi> towards the brethren, who would weakly turn their backs when infants were brouht forth to be baptized."<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="356" facs="unknown:015240_0367_0FA3731D46D661A8"/>their dealings were, which are here covered under the obſcure term cogency, will preſently be ſeen. It was ſuch that a number drew off and met by themſelves in Charleſtown, till on May 28th, 1665; Thomas Gould, Thomas Oſburne, Edward Drinker, and John George, were baptized, and joined with Richard Goodall, William Turner, Robert Lambert, Mary Goodall, and Mary Newel, "in a ſolemn covenant, in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to walk in fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion together, in the practice of all the holy appointments of Chriſt, which he had, or ſhould further make known to them." Goodall came recommended from Mr. Kiffen's church in London; Turner and Lambert from Mr. Stead's church in Dartmouth, having been regular walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the baptiſt order before they came to this country. Gould and Oſburne ſeparated from the church in Charleſtown; Drinker and George had lived many years in this country, but had not join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any of their churches.<note n="*" place="bottom">Their church records—Ruſſell's narrative, p. 1, 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE king's commiſſioners being here, cauſed the court not to lay hold of theſe people ſo ſoon as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they might have done. But in Auguſt a note was entered in Roxbury church records, and publiſhed in an Almanack, which has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me in theſe words, "The anabaptiſts gathered themſelves into a church, propheſied one by one, and ſome one among them adminiſtered the Lord's-ſupper after he was regularly excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by the church at Charleſtown, they alſo ſet up a lecture at Drinker's houſe once a fortnight." As great noiſe was made about their receiving ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate members and officers, it is proper to give that matter a diſtinct conſideration here. Dr. Mather tells of this church being formed, "not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:015240_0368_0FA3731E5F652F88"/>with a manifeſt violation of the laws in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, relating to the orderly manner of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering a church, but alſo with a manifold provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto the reſt of our churches, by admitting into their own ſociety ſuch as our churches had excommunicated for <hi>moral ſcandals,</hi> yea, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying ſuch perſons to be adminiſtrators of the two ſacraments among them."<note n="*" place="bottom">Magnalia, Book 7. p. 27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THEY would thus repreſent as tho' that church had many ſuch members and officers, whereas in fifteen years, among fourſcore baptiſt members, they have not named but four excommunicate perſons, and but one of them an officer, viz. Thomas Gould, who with Thomas Oſburne were of the firſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and as the impartial reader would be willing to hear both ſides upon it, I will give him their ſtory in their own words.</p>
               <p>MR. Samuel Willard of Boſton, who wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this church, ſays of Thomas Gould, "1 Though he was firſt called to an account about withold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his child from baptiſm, yet that was not the reaſon of his being admoniſhed, nor becauſe he could not be convinced of error; nor yet did the church proceed to admonition, till ſuch time as he (not only ſpake contemptuouſly and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of the emptineſs and nullity of that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but alſo) uſed unbecoming geſtures in the time of adminiſtration, of which (being aſked the reaſon) he (before the congregation) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged they were to caſt diſreſpect upon it: nor then neither till after much patience. 2 At his firſt admonition he was not ſententially ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but only deſired, for preventing of the offence of ſome, to abſtain from coming to the other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. 3 Upon this Thomas Gould took up a
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:015240_0369_0FA3731EC77D7718"/>trade of abſenting himſelf from the meetings of the church to worſhip God on the ſabbath, which made a new offence. 4 The church in much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs waited upon him, and proceeded not to excommunication, but tried with admonition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on admonition, and that by the ſpace of ſeven or eight years: nor was he excommunicated, till (having left his own) he joined to another ſociety, without the churches leave, or once aſking it: and now alſo being twice ſent for by the church, he diſclaimed their authority over him. 5 Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gould did not leave the church at Charleſtown on the account of the anabaptiſts new church (as is pretended) but had many years before renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſubmiſſion to that church. 6 He did (while under admonition) neglect public worſhip, and gather a private meeting on the ſabbath to his houſe. 7 He did wickedly ſlight the admonition of the church, declaring that they had by it, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged him of all relation to them.</p>
               <p>"FOR Thomas Oſburne; the churches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with him were with the like patience as to Thomas Gould: only it is to be obſerved, that his firſt offence was this; whereas it is one thing which church-members engage to upon admiſſion to walk with the church in conſtant attendance upon public worſhip, he (without notifying any offence) did withdraw and ſeparate, frequenting thoſe ſchiſmatic meetings at Gould's on the ſabbath: this was the offence, nor did he when firſt dealt with pretend any diſlike of infant baptiſm, but that the church gave no liberty to private brethren to propheſie, that they limited the miniſtry to learned men, and that he did not find his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit free to come; though afterwards he ſpake both of that, and of their ſeverity to the Quakers, though

On a third day of the week when there was a meeting at my houſe, to keep a day of thankſgiving to God for his mercy ſhown to my wife, at that time one coming to the meeting, brought a note from the elders of the church to this effect, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to come down on the morrow to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders houſe, and to ſend word again what time of that day I would come, and they would ſtay at home for me; and if I could not come that day to ſend them word. I looking on the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:015240_0371_0FA37320488E1FE0"/>with many friends with me, I told them I had promiſed to go another way on the morrow. Maſter Dunſtan<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſuppoſe Mr. Henry Dunſtar.</note> being preſent deſired me to ſend them word, that I could not come on the morrow, but that I would come any other time that they would appoint me; and ſo I ſent word back by the ſame meſſenger. The fifth day, meeting with elder Green I told him how it was; he told me it was well, and that they would appoint ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day when he had ſpoken with the paſtor, and then they would ſend me word. This lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two months, before I heard any more from them. On a firſt day in the afternoon one told me I muſt ſtop for the church would ſpeak with me. They called me out, and maſter Sims told the church, that this brother did withhold his child from baptiſm, and that they had ſent unto him to come down on ſuch a day to ſpeak with them, and if he could not come on that day to ſet a day when he would be at home, but he refuſing to come, would appoint no time, when we writ to him to take his own time, and ſend us word.</p>
               <p>"I REPLIED, That there was no ſuch word in the letter, for me to appoint the day; but what time that day I ſhould come. Mr. Sims ſtood up and told me, <hi>I aid lie,</hi> for they ſent to me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the day. I replied again that there was no ſuch thing in the letter. He replied again, that they did not ſet down a time, and not a day, therefore he told me it was a lie, and that they would leave my judgement, and deal with me for a lie; and told the church that he and the elder agreed to write, that if I could not come that day, to appoint the time when I could come, and that he read it, after the elder writ is, and the elder
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:015240_0372_0FA3732106B8EAB0"/>affirmed it was ſo, but I ſtill replied, there was no ſuch thing in the letter, and thought I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the letter. They bid me let them ſee the letter, or they would proceed againſt me for a lie. Brother Thomas Wilder, ſitting before me, ſtood up and told them, that it was ſo in the letter as I ſaid, for he read it when it came to me. But they anſwered, it was not ſo, and bid him produce the letter, or they would proceed with me. He ſaid, I think I can produce the letter, and forthwith took it out of his pocket, which I wondered at; and I deſired him to give it to Mr. Ruſſell to read, and ſo he did, and he read it very faithfully, and it was juſt as I had ſaid, that I muſt ſend them word what time of that day I would come down: ſo that their mouths were ſtoped, and maſter Sims put it off, and ſaid he was miſtaken, for he thought he had read it otherwiſe; but the elder ſayed, this is nothing, let us proceed with him for his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now let any man judge what a fair begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this was, and if you wait a while you may ſee as fair an ending. They called me forth to know why I would not bring my child to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. But before I ſpeak to that, obſerve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God in the carriage of this letter-Brother Wilder was with us when their letter come to my houſe, and after Mr. Dunſtan had read it, he gave it to brother Wilder, and he put it into his pocket, and it lay there eight or nine week's, till that day, I was called forth, going a good ſpace from his houſe, finding it too cold to go in the clothes he had on, returned again and put on another pair of breeches which were warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and when he had ſo done, put his hand into his pocket to ſee if he had any paper to write with, and there found that letter, and put it in again
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:015240_0373_0FA37321C8937AF8"/>and went to meeting, yet not knowing what would be done that day concerning me. God had ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, to ſtop their ſirece proceedings againſt me for a lie, which they ſought to take me in. Then aſking me why I did not bring my child to baptiſm, my anſwer was, I did not ſee any rule of Chriſt for it, for that ordinance belongs to ſuch as can make profeſſion of their faith, as the ſcripture doth plainly hold forth.—They anſwered me that was ment of grown perſons and not of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: but that which was moſt alledged by them was, that children were capable of circumciſion in the time of the law, and therefore as capable in the time of the goſpel of baptiſm; and aſked me why children were not to be baptized in the time of the goſpel, as well as children were circumciſed in the time of the law? My anſwer was, God gave a ſtrict command in the law for the circumciſion of children; but we have no command in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nor example, for the baptizing of children. Many other things were ſpoken, then a meeting was appointed by the church the next week at Mr Ruſſel's.</p>
               <p>"BEING met at Mr. Ruſſel's houſe, Mr. Sims took a writing out of his pocket wherein he had drawn up many arguments for infants baptiſm, and told the church that I muſt anſwer thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which I ſuppoſe he had drawn from ſome author; and told me I muſt keep to thoſe arguments. My anſwer was, I thought the church had met together to anſwer my ſcruples, and to ſatisfy my conſcience by a rule of God, and not for me to anſwer his writing. He ſaid he had drawn it up for the help of his memory, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired we might go on. Then I requeſted three things of them. 1ſt That they ſhould not make
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:015240_0374_0FA3732287A29AE8"/>me offender for a word. 2d. They ſhould not drive me faſter than I was able to go. 3d. That if any preſent ſhould ſee cauſe to clear up any thing that is ſpoken by me, they might have their liberty without offence; becauſe here are many of you that have their liberty to ſpeak againſt me if you ſee cauſe. But it was denied, and Mr. Sim's was pleaſed to reply, that he was able to deal with me himſelf, and that I know it. So we ſpent four or five hours ſpeaking to many things to and again; but ſo hot both ſides that we quickly forgot and went from the arguments that were written. At laſt one of the company ſtood up and ſaid, I will give you one plain place of ſcripture where children were baptized. I told him that would put an end to the controverſy. That place in the ſecond of the Acts 39th, 40th verſes. After he had read the ſcripture, Mr. Sims told me that promiſe belonged to infants, for the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>The promiſe is to you and your children, and to all that are af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>r off;</hi> and he ſaid no more: to which I replied, <hi>Even ſo many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> Mr. Sims replied, that I ſpoke blaſphemouſly in adding to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. I ſaid, pray do not comdemn me, for if I am deceived, my eyes deceive me. He replied again, I added to the ſcripture which was blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. I looking into my bible read the words again, and ſaid it was ſo. He replied the ſame words the third time before the church. Mr. Ruſſell ſtood up and told him it was ſo as I had read it. Ay, it may be ſo in your bible, ſaith Mr. Sims. Mr. Ruſſell anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, yea in yours too if you will look into it. Then he ſaid he was miſtaken, for he thought on another place; ſo after many other words we broke up for that time.</p>
               <p>"AT another meeting the church required me
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:015240_0375_0FA3732348808F38"/>to bring out my child to baptiſm. I told them I durſt not do it, for I did not ſee any rule, for it in the word of God. They brought many places of ſcripture in the old and new teſtament, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on and the promiſe to Abraham, and that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were holy, and they were diſciples. But I told them that all theſe places made nothing for infants baptiſm. Then ſtood up W. D. in the church and ſaid, <hi>Put him in the court! Put him in the court!</hi> But Mr. Sims anſwered, I pray forbear ſuch words; but it proved ſo, for preſently after they put me in the court, and put me in ſeven or eight courts, whilſt they looked upon me to be a member of their church. The elder preſſed the church to lay me under admonition, which the church was back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to do. Afterwards I went out at the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of children which was a great trouble to ſome honeſt hearts, and they told me of it. But I told them I could not ſtay, for I lookt upon it as no ordinance of Chriſt. They told me that now I had made known my judgment I might ſtay, for they know I did not join with them. So I ſtayed and ſat down in my ſeat when they were at prayer and adminiſtring that ſervice to infants. Then they dealt with me for my unreverent carriage—one ſtood up and accuſed me, that I ſtoped my cars; but I denied it.</p>
               <p>"AT another meeting they aſked me if I would ſuffer the church to fetch my child and baptize it? I anſwered, if they would fetch my child and do it as their own act they might do it; but when they ſhould bring my child I would make known to the congregation that I had no hand in it: then ſome of the church were againſt doing of it. A brother ſtood up and ſaid, Brother Gould, you were once for childrens baptiſm, why are you fallen from it?
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:015240_0376_0FA373240742B420"/>I anſwered, It is true, and I ſuppoſe you were once for croſſing in baptiſm, why are you fallen from that? the man was ſilent: But Mr. Sims ſtood up in a great heat, and deſired the church to take notice of it, that I compared the ordinance of Chriſt to the croſs in baptiſm! this was one of the great offences they dealt with me for. After this the deputy governor<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Bellingham, who was chief governor, when Mr. Gould was baniſhed, in 1663.</note> meeting me in Boſton, called me to him and ſaid, Goodman Gould, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you that you would let the church baptize your child. I told him that if the church would do it upon their own account they ſhould do it, but I durſt not bring out my child. So he called to Mrs. Norton of Charleſtown and prayed her to fetch Goodman Gould's child and baptize it. So ſhe ſpake to them, but not rightly, informing them, ſhe gave them to underſtand that I would bring out my child. They called me out again and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me if I would bring forth my child? I told them no, I durſt not do it, for I ſee no rule for it. One of the brethren ſtood up and ſaid, If I would not let my child pertake of one ordinance, it was meet I ſhould not pertake of the other; ſo many of the church concluded to lay me under admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; but before they did it Mr. Sims told me, It was more according to rule for me to withdraw from the ordinance, than for them to put me by; bringing that place of ſcripture, <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the alter, and there remembereſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy offering and he reconciled firſt to thy brother.</hi> But I told them, I did not know that my brother had any thing juſtly againſt me; for they had not ſhewn me
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:015240_0377_0FA37324F05006D8"/>any rule of Chriſt that I had broken, therefore durſt not withdraw from that ordinance that I had found ſo much of God in; but if they would put me by I hoped God would feed my ſoul another way. So they proceeded to admonition. Elder Green<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Green as I take it, was ruling elder; Mr. Zechariah Sims, was teaching elder.</note> ſaid, Brother Gould you are to take notice that you are admoniſhed for three things; the firſt is, that you refuſed to bring your child to be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the ſecond is, for your contentious words, and unreverent carriage in the time of that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; the third is, for a late lie you told, and therefore you are to take notice, that you are not to pertake any more of the ordinance of Chriſt with us, till you give ſatisfaction for theſe things. But when that late lie was told I know not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it was when the letter was found in brother Wilder's pocket. This admonition was between ſeven and eight years before they caſt me out. After this I went to Cambridge meeting, which was as near to my houſe as the other; upon that they put me into the court, that I did not come to hear; but many ſatisfied the court that I did come conſtantly to Cambridge; ſo they cleared me. Then the church called me to account and dealt with me for ſchiſm, that I rent from the church. I told them, I did not rend from them, for they put me away. Maſter Sims was very earneſt for another admonition for ſchiſm, which moſt of the church were againſt; but it ſeems he ſet it down for an admonition on a bit of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This continued for a long time before they called me out again. In the mean time, I had ſome friends who came to me out of old England,
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:015240_0378_0FA373260A4F09C0"/>who were baptiſts, and deſired to meet at my houſe of a firſt day, which I granted: Of theſe was my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, my wife and Thomas Oſburne, that were of their church. Afterward they called me forth and aſked why I kept the meeting in private on the Lord's day, and did not come to the public? My anſwer was, I know not what reaſon the church had to call me forth. They aſked me if I was not a member of that church? I told them they had not acted toward me as a member, who had put me by the ordinances of Chriſt ſeven years ago— they had denied me the privileges of a member. They aſked whether I looked upon admonition as an appointment of Chriſt? I told them, yes, but not to lie un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er it above ſeven years, and to be put by the ordinances of Chriſt in the church; for the rule of Chriſt is firſt to deal with men in the firſt and in the ſecond place, and then in the third place before the church; but the firſt time that ever they dealt with me, they called me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole church. Many meetings we had about this thing, whether I was a member or not, but could come to no concluſion; for I ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that their actings rendered me no member. Then Mr. Sims told the church that I was ripe for excommunication, and was very earneſt for it; but the church would not conſent. Then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that we might ſend to other churches for their help to hear the thing betwixt us; but maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sims made me this anſwer, We are a church of Chriſt ourſelves, and you ſhall know that we have power to deal with you ourſelves. Then ſaid Mr. Ruſſell, We have not gone the right way to gain this our brother, for we have dealt too harſhly with him. But ſtill maſter Sims preſſed the church to excommunicate me. Mr. Ruſſell
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:015240_0379_0FA3732648B5B4B0"/>ſaid, There were greater errors in the church in the apoſtles time and yet they did not ſo deal with them. Mr. Sims aſked him what they were? He ſaid, <hi>How ſay ſome of you that there is no reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead?</hi> Mr. Sims was troubled and ſaid, I wonder you will bring this place of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to encourage him in his error! Mr. Sims was earneſt for another admonition; then ſtood up Solomon Phips and ſaid, you may clap one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition on him upon another, but to what end, for he was admoniſhed about ſeven years ago? Mr. Sims ſaid, Brother! do you make ſuch a light matter of admonition, to ſay, Clap them one upon another! doth not the apoſtle ſay, After the firſt and ſecond admonition reject an heretick? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there might be a ſecond admonition. It was anſwered, it was a hard matter to prove a man an heretic, for every error doth not make a man a heretic. Mr. Sims ſaid, it was not ſeven years ago, nor above three ſince I was admoniſhed, and that was for ſchiſm. A brother replied and ſaid, it was ſeven years ſince I was admoniſhed. On that there was ſome difference in the church what I was admoniſhed for. Mr. Sims then pulled a bit of paper out of his pocket and ſaid, This is that he was admoniſhed for, and that was but three years ſince. Brother Phips aſked him when that paper was writ, for he never heard of that admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before? He anſwered, he ſet it down for his own memory; then he read it, that it was for ſchiſm, and rending from the church. I told him I did not rend from the church, but the church put me away from them, and that was four years before this. Then there was much aggitation when the admonition was given, and what it was for? And this was all the church records that
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:015240_0380_0FA3732708FE6610"/>could be found, which was about ſeven years after, the admonition was given; ſo after many words we broke up, which was the laſt time we met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Now let any man judge of the church records that were drawn up againſt me, and read at the diſpute in Boſton, which contained three or four ſheets of paper; read by Mr. Shepard,<note n="*" place="bottom">Son to Mr. Thomas Shepard, formerly of Cambridge.</note> and drawn up by him, a little while before the diſpute, who was not an eye nor ear witneſs to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches actings, not above half the time.</p>
               <p>"Now after this, conſidering with myſelf what the Lord would have me to do; not likely to join with any of the churches of New-England any more, and ſo to be without the ordinances of Chriſt; in the mean time God ſent out of Old England who were baptiſts; we conſulting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what to do, ſought the Lord to direct us, and taking counſel of other friends who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dwelt among us, who were able and godly, they gave us counſel to congregate ourſelves together; and ſo we did, being nine of us, to walk in the order of the goſpel according to the rule of Chriſt, yet knowing that is was a breach of the law of this country; that we had not the approbation of magiſtrates and miniſters, for that we ſuffered the penalty of that law, when we were called before them. After we had been called into one or two courts, the church underſtanding that we were gathered into church order, they ſent three meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers from the church to me, telling me the church required me to come before them the next Lord's-day. I replyed, The church had nothing to do with me, for they had put me from them eight years before. They replied, that they had nothing to do with that, but were ſent by the
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:015240_0381_0FA37327C93383B8"/>church to tell me it was the mind of the church to ſpeak with me. I told them I was joined to another church, and that church was not willing I ſhould come to them, they having nothing to do with me, therefore I would not come without the churches conſent; then they departed. The next week they ſent three meſſengers more, who came to my houſe and told me that the church had ſent them to require me to come to the church the next Lord's-day after. I told them that the church had nothing to do to require me to come, who had put me from them eight years, and the church I now walked with would not let me come. They told me again that if I did not come, the church would proceed againſt me the next Lord's-day. I told them that I could not come for we were to break bread the next Lord's-day. They told me they would return my anſwer to the church. One of them aſked if I would come the next Lord's-day after? But another preſently ſaid, We have no ſuch order from the church; ſo they departed. The laſt day of that week three loving friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me of their own account, one of them was pleaſed to ſay to me, Brother Gould, though you look upon it as unjuſt for them to caſt you out, yet there be many that are godly among them that will act with them through ignorance, which will be a few of them, and you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded I believe that it is your duty to prevent any one from any ſinful act; for they will caſt you out for not hearing the church; now your coming will ſtop them from acting againſt you, and ſo keep many from that ſin. Upon theſe words I was clearly convinced that it was my duty to go, and replied, Although I could not come the next day, yet I promiſed them that if I was alive
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:015240_0382_0FA373288894FDB0"/>and well I would come the next Lord's-day if the Lord permit. He replied, What if the church I was joined to was not willing? I told him I did not queſtion that any one would be againſt it upon this ground. After I had propounded it to the church, not one was againſt it. I intreated theſe friends to make it known to the elders that I would come to them the next Lord's-day after: Yet tho' they knew of it, they proceeded againſt me that day, and delivered me up to Satan for not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the church."</p>
               <p>THIS narrative I met with among Mr. Callen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's papers, and have good reaſon to think it genuine, and that the manuſcript now in my hands was written above a hundred years ago, which I have copied that the public may be better able to judge of what thoſe excomunications were. It appears by Mr. Willard, that the firſt charge they had againſt Mr Oſburne, was his going to meeting with that ſchiſmatical Gould; therefore, as the reader judges of the one, ſo likely he will of the other. Only it ought to be noted, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them were excommunicate perſons, when they formed that baptiſt church, but had that ſentance pronounced upon them, and afterwards for refuſing to return to thoſe, who had treated them ſo ill. And before that act, viz on Auguſt 20, 1665. Richard Ruſſell, <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> iſſued a warrant to the conſtable of Charleſtown, the original whereof is now before me, requiring him in his majeſty's name, to labour to diſcover where theſe people were aſſembled, and to require them to attend the <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> worſhip, which if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, he was to return their names and places of abode to the next magiſtrate. In conſequence whereof they were brought before the court of
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:015240_0383_0FA3732946AA3CE0"/>aſſiſtants in September: to whom they exhibited ä confeſſion of their faith, which is copied into their records. The only article of which, that I find objected againſt is in theſe words, viz. "Chriſt's commiſſion to his diſciples is to teach and baptize, and thoſe who gladly receive the word and are baptized, are ſaints by calling, and fit matter for viſible church. This was complained of as exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all from a viſible ſaint-ſhip but baptized perſons, which we ſhall hereafter ſee they had no thought of. But their grand crime lay in not obeying the fuling party in their religious affairs.</p>
               <p>THE court of aſſiſtants charged them to deſiſt from what they called their ſchiſmatical practice; and becauſe they would not, the general court that met Oct. 11, convented Gould, Turner, Oſburne, Drinker and George before them, to whom theſe baptiſts exhibited the ſame confeſſion as they had to the court of aſſiſtants, which was cloſed with ſaying, "If any take this to be hereſy, then do we with the apoſtle confeſs, that after the way which they call hereſy, we worſhip God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, believing all things that are written in the law and the prophets and apoſtles." Which the court called a "contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authority and laws here eſtabliſhed, for the maintenance of godlineſs and honeſty, as well as continuing in the prophanation of God's holy ordinances; (and ſaid) This court taking the premiſes into their ſerious conſideration, do judge meet to declare, that the ſaid Gould and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="378" facs="unknown:015240_0389_0FA3732E1C7C57D8"/>the court had heard what they had to ſay for themſelves, proceeded.

               <p>THIS looked like a powerful way of arguing; but the baptiſts were not convinced by it, either of its being duty to return into fellowſhip with thoſe who managed the argument, or to quit their ſtations and enjoyments at their command. I find by the colony records, that John Farnum was admitted a freeman of that colony May 13, 1640; Thomas Gould, June 2, 1641; in which year John George bound himſelf to governor Winthrop, I ſuppoſe to pay for his paſſage over to this country. And I have a copy before me of a warrant for the commitment of Turner and Farnum to Boſton Goal, dated July 30 this year, ſigned by governor Bellingham, Eleazer Luſher and Edward Tyng. When the aſſembly met again in the fall, a petition was preſented to them whereof a copy found among their church papers, is before me, in theſe words.</p>
               <p>"WHEREAS by the cenſure of this honorable court Thomas Gould, William Turner and John Farnum, now lie in priſon deprived of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, taken off from their callings, ſeparated from their wives and children, diſabled to govern or to provide for their families, to their great damage and haſtening ruin, how innocent ſoever; beſide the hazard of their own lives, being aged and weakly men, and needing that ſuccour a priſon will not afford; the ſenſe of this, their perſonal and family moſt deplorable and afflicted condition, hath ſadly affected the hearts of many ſober and ſerious chriſtians, and ſuch as neither approve of their judgment or practice; eſpecially conſidering that
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:015240_0392_0FA373300B341A60"/>the men are reputed godly, and of a blameleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and the things for which they ſeem to ſuffer ſeem not to be moral, unqueſtioned, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous evils, but matters of religion and conſcience; not in things fundamental, plain and clear, but circumſtantial, more dark and doubtful, wherein the ſaints are wont to differ, and to forbear one another in love, that they be not expoſed to ſin, or to ſuffer for conſcience ſake. We therefore moſt humbly beſeech this honored court, in their chriſtian mercy and bowels of compaſſion, to pity and relieve theſe poor priſoners; whoſe ſufferings (alſo being doubtful to many, and ſome of great worth among ourſelves, and grievous to ſundry of God's people at home and abroad, may crave a further conſideration) whereby perceiving this court not likely to effect the end deſired, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to grieve the hearts of God's people: Now your wiſdoms may be pleaſed to think of ſome better expedient, and ſeriouſly conſider whether an indulgence, juſtifiable by the word of God, pleaded for and practiſed by congregational churches, may not, in this day of ſuffering to the people of God, be more effectual, ſafe and inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive than other ways, which are always griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſeldom find ſucceſs. We in all humility hope, hereby occaſions of difference being removed, that love and communion among all ſaints, which our dying Lord ſo weightily charged and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayed for, will more eaſily be preſerved and practiſed, to the glory of God, honor of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, peace and welfare of all the churches, which this honored court being the happy inſtruments of effecting, will oblige your poor petitioners, as in duty bound, to pray for your happineſs both in this life and in that to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WE are informed that Capt. Edward Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Capt. Oliver, and many others ſigned this petition; but the Court were ſo far from granting it, that the chief promoters of it were fined, and others compelled to an acknowledgment of their fault in reflecting upon the Court herein. We are alſo told, that the Hon. Francis Willoughby, who was their deputy Governor from 1665, till he died on April 4, 1671, "was a great oppoſer of theſe perſecutions againſt the baptiſts."<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſ. hiſt. vol. p. 227, 269.</note> Leveret and Symonds, his ſucceſſors in that office, appear alſo to have been on that ſide of the queſtion. The ruling party printed their ſentance againſt thoſe baptiſts, and anſwer to which I find among their church papers, which is cloſed with theſe words. "This my huſband would intreat of you, to take counſel of maſter Bennet, and if he and you judge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

I conclude the perſon here ſpeaking is elder Gould's wife; and the moſt material points of her anſwer are as follows:</p>
               <p>"FIRST, They call them <hi>obſtinate and turbulent anabaptiſts.</hi> 1. I deſire to know wherein their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy doth appear? They deſired the court to ſhow them, from the rule of Chriſt, of any point that they were out of the way of God; and if the Lord was pleaſed to ſhew them wherein they were out, they would freely lay it down; but they ſhewed them no other rule than their own law; and ſentanced them to be fined and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; and this was all the rule they could give,
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:015240_0394_0FA37331886F2630"/>which did not convince them. 2. They ſay they were <hi>turbulent:</hi> I deſire them to prove wherein they were turbulent, when they did not diſturb neither churches nor courts, neither by word nor by action; but deſired to live quietly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably among them, and they cannot tell of any one thing that they diſturbed them in, but deſired they might enjoy that liberty that Chriſt hath purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them. They know not that they ſpoke any word that gave offence to the court, unleſs it was thoſe few words, when maſter Bradſtreet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced that ſentance againſt them, and charged them no more to meet together, whether on the Lord's day or on the weekdays , <hi>in their conventicles;</hi> thoſe words were returned by them, <hi>We ought to obey God rather than man; we cannot but do the things that we have heard and learned.</hi> 3. As for <hi>anabaptiſts,</hi> they do not own that name, except they will be pleaſed to explain what they mean by it; for they own them to be of the baptized. Again they ſay, <hi>they combined together in a pretended church eſtate.</hi> They need not have ſaid ſo, unleſs they could have proved they ſet up their church contrary to a rule of Chriſt. Beſide, they gave them in a writing wherein they gave a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their faith, where they declared what they owned to be a church of Chriſt, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it according to the rule of the ſcripture, which neither the court nor the elders ever an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to this day. They ſay it was <hi>without the knowledge or approbation of the authority here eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the law required.</hi> Anſwer, 1. If the apoſtles had not ſet up churches in their time, without the approbation of the authority and their prieſts, there had been few or no churches in their time. 2. Chriſt is Lord and King of his church, and he
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:015240_0395_0FA3733248234850"/>will ſet up his government therein, and hath given them rules from himſelf, how to ſet it up and to carry it along according to his appointment, and not to aſk leave of the powers of the word to ſet up his church; for Chriſt's juriſdiction is the reateſt juriſdiction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the world. 3. They had aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged leave, had they found a command of Chriſt for it, but finding no rule of Chriſt they did not do it.</p>
               <p>"AGAIN, they ſay ſome of themſelves were <hi>excommunicated perſons.</hi> Firſt, it is true what they ſay, yet that ſome was but two that were caſt out, and that after they were gathered into this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended church, as they call it, a good ſpace of time. But conſider for what it was, and how it was? [Hear the foregoing account of Mr. Gould and Oſburne is confirmed. And of the day they were caſt out ſhe ſays,] The word was carried to the elder, that if they were alive and well they would come the next day, yet they were ſo hot upon it that they would not ſtay, but maſter Sims, when he was laying out the ſins of theſe men, before he had propounded it to the church, to know their mind, the church having no liberty to ſpeak, he wound it up in his diſcourſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them up to ſatan, to the amazment of the people, that ever ſuch an ordinance of Chriſt ſhould be ſo abuſed, that many of the people went out: and theſe were the excommunicated perſons. They ſay, <hi>after long forbearence to uſe the utmoſt mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> convince and reduce them, intreated the aſſiſtance of to divers elders.</hi> Anſwer 1. It is true there were ſeven elders appointed to diſcourſe with them, and there were a few plowman and taylors to come before: but how they were ſerved with a warrant to appear before theſe elders in his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t'ys name! 2. When they were met, there was a
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:015240_0396_0FA3733308714910"/>long ſpeech made by one of them, of what vile perſons they were and how they acted againſt the churches and government here, and ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the court. The other deſiring liberty to ſpeak, they would not ſuffer them, but told them they ſtood there as delinquents, and ought not to have liberty to ſpeak. Then they deſired they might chooſe a moderator as well as they: they denied them. Two days were ſpent to little purpoſe—in the cloſe, maſter Jonathan Mitchel pronounced that dreadful ſentance againſt them in Deut. xvii, 8. to the end of the 12th, and this was the way they took to convince them, and you may ſee what a good effect it had—There was nothing ſpoken from the rule of Chriſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the court nor the elders, but ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances as theſe, fineing, and whipping, and priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and baniſhing, and maſter Mitchel's ſentance, and all theſe are not the weapons of Chriſt, but carnal weapons that never did convince any ſoul of the error of his ways.</p>
               <p>"WHEREAS they ſay, <hi>which practice making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm a nullity,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, it is good for every one to be ſure that they are upon good ground whatſoever the practice of others may ſeem to condemn—They ſay, <hi>tending to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and deſtruction of theſe churches.</hi> For anſwer, 1. If eight or nine poor anabaptiſts, as they call them, ſhould be the deſtruction of their churches, then let any ſeeing man judge what their churches are built upon; then we may think they are built upon a ſandy foundation; for the church of Chriſt is built upon himſelf, and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. 2. If they be the churches of Chriſt, and think they ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by them, it is from the weakneſs of their
<pb n="386" facs="unknown:015240_0397_0FA37333C6C7EA88"/>faith, looking more to an arm fleſh and powers of the world to uphold them, than to Chriſt and his faithful promiſe. 3. If they fear they will be the deſtruction of their churches, now all the power of the country is for them and have an arm of fleſh to help them, what will they do when all the powers of the country are againſt them, as are againſt the other, as you ſay yourſelves of them, that when they were in examination before the court, they profeſſed themſelves reſolved to adhere to the ſame practice; and now ſuffer will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly for it. But for the men, what they are I ſhall ſay nothing, for the ſixty-five hands to the petition that was put into the general Court, does plainly declare to their beſt diſcerning, that they have been honeſt and godly, and lived quietly and peacably among them a good length of time. Again they ſay, <hi>by uſing the moſt compaſſionate and effectual means to attain the ſame.</hi> Anſwer, 1. The Lord keep every gracious ſoul from ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate means for the truth of the goſpel! 2. For what compaſſionate means were uſed with them, let men fearing God judge; for one of them was called from priſon when this ſentance of baniſhment was read againſt them; and if any man deſires to inform himſelf wherein their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion appears, let him read their printed ſentance againſt them, which was executed upon them; for not moving themſelves, they ſent the conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and fetch them away to priſon on a public lecture day at Boſton, when the ſaid Thomas Gould, William Turner and John Farnum, had been all there, and newly come home to their houſes, and they remain in priſon to this day."</p>
               <p>How any that feared God, could be enſnared and held in ſuch a way of treating their follow
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:015240_0398_0FA3733488AACFA0"/>ſervants, may doubtleſs appear unaccountable to many; but a careful ſearch will help us to diſcover the nature of this myſtery. The eſtabliſhment of chriſtian commonwealth, was the grand object that had been before thoſe leaders for forty years, and it continued ſo to their laſt hours. Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the firſt miniſter of Boſton, had been famed for a giſt of prophecy, or foreteling future events; and as his diſſolution appeared near, a large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<list>

The gain-ſaying

And they have often told us of David's error, in carrying the ark upon a new cart, inſtead of the prieſts ſhoulders; but that error is theirs, not ours; and had they been as ready to immitate David in reformation as they were in tranſgreſſion what happy times might we have ſeen before now?

I have ever been warmed with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the grace of God towards me in carrying me thither. I have always thought that of the congregational churches of N. E. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n our days. But now it is otherwiſe, with joy as to ourſelves and grief as to you be it ſpoken. Now the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my love is to N. E. the more am I grieved at their failings. It is frequently ſaid here, that they are ſwerved aſide towards preſbetery: if ſo, the Lord reſtore them all. But another ſad thing that much effects us is, to hear that you even in N. England perſecute your brethren; men ſound in the faith; of holy life; agreeing in worſhip and diſcipline with you; only differing in the point of baptiſm. Dear brother, we here do love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor them, hold familiarity with them and take ſweet council together; they lie in the boſom of Chriſt and therefore they ought to be laid in our boſoms. In a word, we freely admit them into churches; few of our churches but many of our members are anabaptiſts: I mean baptized again.
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:015240_0402_0FA3725689E36328"/>This is love in England; this is moderation; this is a right new teſtament ſpirit. But do you now (as is aboveſaid) bear with, yea, more than bear with, the Preſbyterians? yea, and that the worſt ſort of them, viz. thoſe who are the corrupteſt, rigedſt; whoſe principles tend to corrupt the churches; turning the world into the church, and the church into the world; and which doth no leſs than bring a people under meer ſlavery. It is an iron yoke which neither we nor our congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational brethren in Scotland were ever able to bear. I have heard them utter theſe words in the pulpit, that it is no wrong to make the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants ſell all they have, and depart the land; and many more things I might mention of that kind; but this I hint only, to ſhew what cauſe there is to withſtand that wicked tyranny which was once ſet up in poor miſerable Scotland, which I verily believe was a great wrong and injury to the reformation. The generality of them here, even to this day, will not freely conſent to our enjoyment of our liberty; though through mercy the beſt and moſt reformed of them do otherwiſe. How much more therefore would it concern dear N. E. to turn the edge againſt [thoſe] who, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, will certainly corrupt and enſlave, not only their own, but alſo your churches? Whereas anabaptiſts are neither ſpirited nor principled to injure nor hurt your government nor your liberties; but rather theſe be a means to preſerve your churches from apoſtacy, and provoke them to their primitive purity, as they were in the firſt planting, in admiſſion of members to receive none into your churches but viſible ſaints, and in reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intire juriſdiction of every congregation compleat and undiſturbed. We are hearty and
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:015240_0403_0FA37257483C1BC8"/>full for our preſbyterian brethren's enjoying equal liberty with ourſelves, oh that they had the ſame ſpirit towards us! but oh how it grieves and affects us that New-England ſhould perſecute! will you not give what you take? is liberty of conſcience your due? and is it not as due unto others that are ſound in the faith? Read the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the declaration of the faith and order, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and practiſed in the congregational churches in England, p. 6, 7. Amongſt many others ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that in the 14th of Romans much confirms me in liberty of conſcience thus ſtated; To him that eſteems any thing unclean, to him it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, verſe 13. Therefore though we approve of the baptiſm of the immediate children of church members, and [of] their admiſſion into the church when they evidence a real work of grace; yet to [thoſe] that in conſcience believe the ſaid baptiſm to be unclean it is unclean. Both that and meer ruling elders, though we approve of them, yet our grounds are meer interpretations of, and not any expreſs ſcripture. I cannot ſay ſo clearly of any thing elſe in our religion, neither as to faith or practice. Now muſt we force our interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon others Pope-like! In verſe 5 of that chapter the ſpirit of God ſaith, <hi>Let every one be fully perſwaded in his own mind;</hi> therefore this being the expreſs will of God, who ſhall make a contrary law, and ſay, perſwaded or not perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you ſhall do as we ſay, and as we do! and verſe 23, <hi>what is not of faith is ſin;</hi> therefore there muſt be a word for what we do, and we muſt ſee and believe it, or elſe we ſin if we do it. And Deut. 12 and laſt, as we muſt not add, nor may we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh: what is commanded we muſt do. Alſo 28th of Matthew. And what principles is perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:015240_0404_0FA37258098D1180"/>grounded upon? Dominiation and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: this we teach is the truth. But are we infallible, and have we the government? God made none, no not the apoſtles who could not err, to be lords over faith; therefore what mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous pride is this! At this rate any perſwaſion geting uppermoſt may command, and perſecute them that obey them not; all non-conformiſts muſt be ill-uſed. Oh wicked and monſtrous principle! What ere you can plead for yourſelves againſt thoſe that perſecute you, thoſe whom ye perſecute may plead for themſelves againſt you. Whatever they can ſay againſt the poor men, your enemies ſay againſt you: and what! is that horrid principle crept into precious New-England, who have felt what perſecution is, and have always pleaded for liberty of conſcience; Have not thoſe run equal hazards with you for the enjoyment of their liberties; and how do you caſt a reproach upon us, that are congregational in England, and furniſh our adverſaries with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons againſt us? We bluſh and are filled with ſhame and confuſion of face, when we hear of theſe things. Dear brother! we pray that God would open your eyes and perſwade the hearts of your mageſtrates, that they may no more <hi>finite their fellow-ſervants,</hi> nor thus greatly injure us their bretheren; and that they may not thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor the name of God and cauſe his people to be reproached, nor the holy way of God (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way) to be evil ſpoken of. My dear brother! pardon my plainneſs and freedom, for the zeal of God's houſe conſtrains me. What cauſe have we to bleſs God who gives us to find favour in the eyes of his Majeſty? and to pray God to continue him, and to requite it graciouſly to him in ſpiritual bleſſings. Well, ſtrive I beſeech
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:015240_0405_0FA37258C9CAA338"/>you with God by prayers, and uſe all lawful ways and means, even to your greateſt hazard, that thoſe poor men may be ſet free. For be aſſured, this liberty of conſcience, as we ſtate it, is the cauſe of God; and hereby you may be a means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the judgments of God from falling upon dear New-England, for our Father in faithfulneſs will afflict us if we repent not. Doth not the very goſpel ſay, <hi>what meaſure we mete to others ſhall be meaſured to us?</hi> God is not unrighteous: what is more provoking to him than the perſecuting of his ſaints! <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets no harm;</hi> did he not <hi>reprove kings for their ſake?</hi> Thoſe who have the unction the apoſtle John ſpeaks of, and the ſpirit and gift of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. With what marvellous ſtrength did holy Mr. Burroughs urge that place againſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Perſecution is bad in wicked men, but it is moſt abominable in good men, who have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and pleaded for liberty of conſcience them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Diſcountenance men that certainly err, but perſecute them not. I mean groſs errors. Well, we are travelling to our place of reſt: with joy we look for new heavens and new earth. We ſhall ere long be in the fulneſs of bliſs, holy, harmleſs in the boſom of Chriſt. Let us pray, the earth may be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, that they may not hurt nor deſtroy in all his holy mountain.

                     <p>We will now look a little back, and ſee how their oppreſſors got along. The breach in Boſton church affected many; and the governor appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the new party, and in July 1669 called his council together, fearing he ſaid, "a ſudden tumult, ſome perſons attempting to ſet up an edifice for public worſhip, which was apprehended by authority to be detrimental to the public peace." But the majority of the council were for not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their proceeding. On May 11, 1670, Mr. Danforth of Roxbury, who was one of thoſe that had been called to the baptiſt diſpute two years before, ſaid to the aſſembly in his election ſermon, "Is not the temper, complexion and countenance of the churches ſtrangely altered?

They then go on to ſpeak of the late tranſaction of the elders, in conſtituting the third church in Boſton, as "irregular, illegal and diſorderly." But the effect was ſuch, that among fifty deputies in their next aſſembly, there were but twenty of thoſe who were in this; and then fifteen miniſters preſented an addreſs to the new modled houſe, wherein they mention their former connection with rulers like Moſes and Aaron, and then call the ſitting up of ſaid church in Boſton, "That weighty and worthy tranſaction."

But three of them are in theſe words, viz. "13 That the baptizing of infants is an abominable cuſtom. 14. That there ought not in the church the uſe of the Lord's ſupper to be celebrated in the elements of bread and wine; and the uſe of baptiſm to be celebrated in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water, AS they are now practiſed in the church of England; but the uſe of baptiſm is to be adminiſtered in water, only to converts of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent age and underſtanding, converted from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity to the faith. 16. That chriſtianity is not wholly profeſſed and preached in the church of England but only in part."

                     <p>THE above clearly ſhews that the church of England far exceeded her daughters in this land, both in the number of hard names they impoſed upon the baptiſts, and alſo in their degree of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards them; though a lamentable imitation of thoſe evils appear in this hiſtory. And to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the forecited law among the reſt, the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts placed the following motto in the title page of their law book; <hi>whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt receive to themſelves damnation.</hi> But whether the aſſuming and exerting of <hi>ſuch power</hi> in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affairs, be not the way to damnation, rather than the reſiſtance of it, deſerves the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all? Some years ago, when the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians had the upper hand in England [See p. 174] Mr. Samuel Oates, a noted and ſucceſsful baptiſt miniſter, was impriſoned, put in irons and tried for his life as a murderer, at Chelmsford aſſize, only becauſe Ann Martin, a young woman that he had baptized, happened to die a few weeks after. But when his caſe came to be tried, her mother and others declared upon oath, "that ſhe was in better health for ſeveral days after her bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm than ſhe had been for ſome years before; and was ſeen to walk abroad very comfortably,' ſo that he was acquitted.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid: p. 237, 238.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>AND now when the epiſcopalians had gotten the power again into their hands, Mr. Neal truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that the enemies to the baptiſts tried to ruin them, "by as unparalled a piece of villany as ever was heard of.

                     <p>As a contraſt to the above, I will give a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taſte of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of thoſe men who have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been accuſed of hatred to orthodox miniſters. In the beginning of 1665 Mr. Stephen Mumford, a ſeventh day baptiſt, arrived from London at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and Mr. Hiſcox, Mr. Hubbard, and other members of Mr. Clarke's church ſoon embraced the keeping of that day; but in 1671, two or three men who had ſo done, turned back to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the firſt day, which Mr. Hubbard and others called <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> though many accounted it a reformation; and in June that year Mr. Holmes preached ſmartly againſt the others ſentiments; and the contention increaſed, till in December it cauſed an open ſeparation; upon hearing of which our ſuffering fathers in the Maſſachuſetts wrote the following letter.</p>
                     <p>"To brother William Hiſcox, and the reſt of our beloved brethren and ſiſters, that obſerve the ſeventh day ſabbath with him. The church of Chriſt in or near Boſton ſends greeting. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, beloved of the Lord, we having had a view of the proceedings between yourſelves and the church, cannot but be grieved to ſee how buſy the adverſary hath been, and how eaſily he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon the corruptions of our nature, to make breaches and diviſions among thoſe whom we dare not but judge, are united unto one head, even Chriſt Jeſus. And although we dare not judge your conſciences in the obſervation of a day or days to the Lord, yet brethren, your judging them that have ſo done, and we hope have not unadviſedly changed their minds, to be <hi>apoſtates,</hi> ſeems to our underſtandings to ſavour too much a cenſorious ſpirit. And we, as brethren, made pertakers of the ſame grace of God through the
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:015240_0423_0FA3726648BB4A60"/>influence of his holy ſpirit, not being enlightened in the obſervation of the ſeventh day as a ſabbath to the Lord, ſhall humbly beſeech you all, to put on bowels of mercy, and not be ſo ſtrait in your ſpirits towards others; but conſider, the only wiſe God giveth to each ſoul what meaſure of light and knowledge he pleaſeth; and it is he muſt give wiſdom to improve that meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſo given, or elſe we ſhall make a bad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement thereof. Now brethren we dare not juſtify your action, nor the manner of the actions that have been between you and the church; but ſhould have been glad, if it had been the good pleaſure of the Lord, that you could have borne each with other in the matter of difference, and ſo have left it for the Lord to reveal more light and knowledge to thoſe that are yet in the dark. But may we not ſay, we are all in the dark, and ſee and know but in part? and the little part that any one knoweth, he is ready to conceive is the will of God, and ſo would have all to ſee with his eyes, and underſtand with his underſtanding; and cannot patiently wait on the Lord till he ſhall make diſcoveries of it to his brethren; ſo that our quick, narrow and impatient ſpirits are the cauſe of ſo many breaches and diviſions amongſt the citizens of Sion at this day. By all which we humbly deſire the Lord may make you and us, and all the Lord's people, to ſee the corruption of our natures that is yet unſubdued, that ſo we may all with ſincerity of ſoul, wait on him according to that meaſure of light and knowledge that each of us have received from him. And now bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, our deſire is, if it may be the good pleaſure of God, that this breach may be healed between you and the church. Our prayers ſhall be to the
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:015240_0424_0FA37267093456A8"/>Lord for you, that each one of you may be truly ſenſible, wherein you have ſo far departed from the law of brotherly love, as to be an occaſion of grief one to another, and to the Iſrael of God, and have given an occaſion to the enemies to ſpeak re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully of the ways of God; not doubting but you will be willing to look back over all thoſe actions paſt in theſe differences, and if you find any thing contrary to the mind and will of God, be willing to own it both to God and his people. We ſhall leave you to his care and guiding, who is able to comfort you in all your tribulations, and to eſtabliſh, ſtrengthen and ſettle you; to whom we leave you, and remain your poor unworthy brethren, who ſhould rejoice in your proſperity, both in ſpirituals and temporals.

               <p>THIS ſweet letter, Mr. Hubbard has preſerved, and it cauſed no alianation of mind, but there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a great nearneſs between them as long as they lived. I find him in a letter the next year to his brother Hamlit, "deſiring the welfare of the whole Sion, and the brethren with you; brother Foſter, brother Farlow, elder Ruſſell and his ſon; yea to all the church, with thanks for their love to me and my wife." Mr. Hamlit wrote on June 19, 1673, that the baptiſts were ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for their withdrawing from the public meetings, and ſaid, "Brother Trumbel and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Oſborne were fined laſt court at Charleſtown twenty ſhillings a piece; they have appealed to
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:015240_0425_0FA37267CB1CB618"/>the court of aſſiſtants." But Mr. Bellingham dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Mr. Leveret being choſen governor, and Mr. Symonds deputy governor; things took ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turn, ſo that Mr. Hamlit wrote to his brother Hubbard on Jan. 9, 1674, and ſaid, "Brother Drinker hath been very ſick near unto death, but the Lord hath reſtored him to health again. The church of the baptized to peacably enjoy their liberty. Brother Ruſſell, the elder and the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, have good remembrance of you." And while thoſe governors lived, that church enjoyed the greateſt liberty that ever they did under their firſt charter. After governor Leveret's death, I find Mr. Ruſſell and his church, in a appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a day of thankſgiving, expreſſing their ſenſe of "the Lord's goodneſs in preſerving our peace and liberty beyond all expectation; God having removed him, who was a friend to us in the authority, by reaſon of which our oppoſites have the greater advantage againſt us, who have not been wanting to do their endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs us." Whe ſhall ſoon find how that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was improved. We are informed by their records, that the next members that were added, after the firſt conſtitution of the church, were Iſaac Hull, John Farnum, Jacob Barney, John Ruſſell, junior, John Johnſon, George Farlow, Benjamin Sweetſer, all before Ellis Callender, who was received, Nov. 9, 1669. Mr. Hull was called alſo to be an elder in the church in the time of their ſufferings. The next on the liſt are Joſhua Turner, Thomas Foſter, John Ruſſell, ſenior, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards their paſtor) William Hamlit, James Landon. Thomas Skinner, John Williams, Philip Squire, Mary Gould, Suſanna Jackſon, Mary Greenleaf, &amp;c. Elder Gould died Oct. 27, 1675,
<pb n="415" facs="unknown:015240_0426_0FA3726888804118"/>having been a man, "in ſome good meaſure fitted and qualified (ſays elder Ruſſell) for ſuch a work; and proved an eminent inſtrument in the hand of the Lord, for the carrying on this good work of God in its low and weak beginnings" And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the other firſt conſtitutors with him, ſays, "Their trouble and temptations followed, one upon the neck of another, like the waves of the ſea; but theſe precious ſervants of the Lord, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome good meaſure counted the coſt before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, were cheerfully carried on by the hand of the Lord upon them, through all the afflictions and reproaches they met with; and are the moſt of them now at reſt with the Lord, having ſerved the will of God in their generation."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hubbard—Ruſſell's narrative 1680, p. 1. 2. 6.</note>

I find by their records, that the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the united colonies, in September 1662, appointed Capt. George Deniſon, Thomas Stanton and James Averell, to manage their affairs at Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catuck, to govern the Indians, and collect the tax impoſed upon them on account of the Pequots; and then ſay, "They are alſo hereby authoriſed to act and do, or cauſe to be done, what in their diſcretion may beſt conduce, to reduce them to civility and the knowledge of God, as well by cauſing due puniſhment to be inflicted on diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly perſons according to their demirits, as by encouraging ſuch as ſhall be ſent to inſtruct them by order of the commiſſioners, and by cauſing them to attend thereunto." And nothing has been more common with their party ever ſince, than to repreſent the Rhode-Iſlanders as an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people: but I truſt the forgoing facts ſhew that they were not all ſo, to which I ſhall add, that Mr. S. Hubbard's daughter Ruth was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and joined to Mr. Clarke's church in 1652, when ſhe was not 13 years old, and on Auguſt 4, 1666, ſhe wrote from Weſterly thus,</p>
               <p>"MOST loving and dear father and mother, my duty with my huſband and children preſented unto you, with all my dear friends,—My longing deſire is to hear from you, how your hearts are borne up above theſe troubles which are come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and are coming as we fear; for we have the rumours of war, and that almoſt every day. Even now we have heard from your Iſland by ſome Indians who declared unto us, that the French have done ſome miſchief upon the coaſt, and we have heard that 1200 Frenchmen have joined with the Mohawks, to clear the land both
<pb n="417" facs="unknown:015240_0428_0FA3726AF810A940"/>of Engliſh and Indians. But I truſt in the Lord, if ſuch a thing be intended, that will not ſuffer ſuch a thing to be. My deſire and prayer to God is, that he will be pleaſed to fulfil his promiſe to us, that is, that as in the world we ſhall have troubles, ſo in him we ſhall have peace. The Lord of comfort, comfort your and our hearts, and give us peace in believing, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Oh that the Lord would be pleaſed to fill our hearts with his good ſpirit, that we may be carried above all theſe things! and that we may remember his ſaying, <hi>When ye ſee theſe things come to paſs, liſt up your heads, knowing that your redemption draws nigh.</hi> Then if theſe things be the certain ſign of our Lord's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, let us mind his command, that is, <hi>pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that ye may be counted worthy to eſcape all theſe things, and to ſtand before the ſon of man.</hi> Let us have boldneſs to come unto him in the new and living way, which he hath prepared for us.

               <p>Mr. John Tracy of Norwich had married Mrs. Mary Winſlow from Marſhfield five years before, and returning from a viſit there at this time, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to fall in among a party of Indians in arms, waiting to hear whether their friends would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted or not.

Philip ſoon left his ſtation at Mount Hope, now Briſtol, and retired to a great ſwamp eaſt of the great river. The Maſſachuſetts part of the army went into the Narraganſet country, and brought thoſe Indians to promiſe not to join in the war, and then returned, and with the other forces, attacked Philip at the ſwamp on July 18, but had little ſucceſs therein. Soon after which, Philip and many of his men repaſſed the river, and croſſing Seaconk plain, made his way up to the Nepmuck Indians in Worceſter county, who had begun the war on July 14.</p>
               <p>THESE alarms cauſed Mr. Joſeph Tory and Mr. Hubbard to ſend a boat which brought their friends from Weſterly to Newport this month, who continued on the iſland till the war was over. Soon after Philip had joined the Nepmucks, they violently aſſaulted a ſmall Engliſh plantation at Brookfield, and at Capt. Hutchinſon with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany went to relieve them on Auguſt 2, they from an ambuſh gave him a mortal wound. But Major Willard came two days after with 48 men, and ſlew many of the enemy, and delivered his friends. Upon which the enemy ſteered further weſtward, and on Sept. I, burnt moſt of the houſes in Deerfield, and killed 8 men the next day at Northfield; and Capt. Beers going with
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:015240_0431_0FA3726D18266B38"/>36 men to fetch off the inhabitants there, had a terrible fight with the enemy, wherein he and above half of his men fell. September 18, ſundry teams went to bring off a large quantity of grain from Deerfield, and Capt. Lothrop went with about 80 men to guard them; but not ſeeing any of the enemy, they on their return, got to picking grapes by Muddy-brook, when the enemy got a dreadful advantage of them. I have ſeen the ſtone over the place where they tell me about 70 of them were buried in one grave. Preſently after an aſſault was made upon Springfield, where the miniſter's houſe and library was burnt, with 31 houſes beſide. But a large body of Indians making an onſet upon Hadly, Oct. 19, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed one man, were ſo bravely repulſed by the Engliſh, that in their flight ſome of them were drowned in Connecticut river, and others who eſcaped retired into Narraganſet. In that country on a ſmall tract of upland within a great ſwamp, ſeven miles weſt from the ſouth ferry that goes over from Newport, the Indians built and ſtored the ſtrongeſt fort they ever had in this country.

               <p>HERE I muſt open ſomething that has been ſurprizingly concealed from this country.

<pb n="423" facs="unknown:015240_0434_0FA3726F49E07910"/>beginning of the war, William Turner gathered a company of volunteers, but was denied a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and diſcouraged, becauſe the chief of the company were anabaptiſts. Afterwards when the war grew more general and diſtructive, and the country in very great diſtreſs, having divers towns burnt, and many men ſlain, then he was deſired to accept a commiſſion. He complained it was too late, his men on whom he could confide being ſcattered; however was moved to accept." They made him Captain, and his brother Drinker Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of a company that marched up with others in the beginning of this month, to relieve the weſtern towns, under Major Savage as chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and by them the Indians were repulſed and driven off from Northampton on March 14. The 17th they burnt all but one of the houſes in Warwick, moſt of the inhabitants being gone to Rhode-Iſland. On Lord's day, March 26, Capt. Pierce being at Rehoboth, with fifty Engliſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and twenty friend Indians, heard of a body of the enemy up Patucket river, and wrote to Capt. Andrew Edmunds of Providence, to meet him there with his company to attack them. He ſent the letter by a perſon who was going over to Providence meeting, but who did not deliver it till their worſhip was done at noon. As ſoon as Capt. Edmunds had read the letter, he gave the bearer a ſharp reprimand, for not delivering it before, and expreſſed his fear of the conſequence as it proved; for Capt. Pierce engaging the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my alone, who were alſo more numerous than he expected, he was ſurrounded and cut off; with all but 13 of his men, only one of whom was of the Engliſh; and it is ſaid he eſcaped by a friend Indian's turning and runing after him with a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:015240_0435_0FA372700A42CCF0"/>as if he was an enemy, which others ſeeing did not perſue him. They tell us that another of thoſe friends eſcaped in this manner; being perſued by an enemy, he took ſhelter behind a rock, where as each waited for an opportunity to ſhoot the other, our friend gently raiſing his hat above the rock upon a ſtick, the enemy diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his gun at it, on which the other ſhot him down and eſcaped. It is reported, that Capt. Pierce and his men ſlew 140 of the enemy in the conflict. The people both of Marlborough and Springfield ſuffered conſiderably the ſame day. March 28, forty houſes were burnt in Rehoboth, and twenty-nine the next day at Providence, the people returning into garriſons.</p>
               <p>IN the clerk's office in that town is a paper, in which Mr. Williams ſaid. "I pray the town, in the ſenſe of the late bloody practices of the natives to give leave to ſo many as can agree with Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Field, to beſtow ſome charge upon fortifying his houſe, for ſecurity to women and children; alſo to give me leave and ſo many as ſhall agree, to put up ſome defence on the hill, between the mill and the highway, for the like ſafety of the women and children in that part of the town." To this eleven principal inhabitants ſubſcribed, the higheſt whereof was two pounds ſix ſhillings, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Mr. Williams who ſubſcribed ten pounds. Tradition ſays, that when the Indians appeared on the high lands north of their great cove, Mr. Williams took his ſtaff and walked over towards them, hoping likely to pacify them as he had often done; but when ſome of their aged men ſaw him, they came out and met him, and told him that though thoſe who had long known him would not hurt him, yet their young men were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<pb n="425" facs="unknown:015240_0436_0FA37270C91005C8"/>that it was not ſafe for him to venture among them; upon which he returned to the garriſon. The houſe where their records were kept was plundered, and they thrown into the mill-pond, but were recovered, though by that means ſome paſſages are not legible, and likely many articles were loſt.</p>
               <p>IN April Capt. George Deniſon of Stonington, with a number of Engliſh and Mohegan Indians, performed two great exploits. They penetrated into the Narraganſet country, and ſlew forty-four of the enemy at one time, and ſixty-ſix at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the loſs of a man. Though in the mean time the Maſſachuſetts met with a dreadful blow Capt. Wadſworth and Lieut. Bruttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, with above thirty men, were cut off as they were going to relieve Sudbury, on April 18. Bridgewater, which was planted in 1652, was now aſſaulted by a great body of the enemy on May 8, when twelve deſerted houſes were burnt, but there was never one of their people killed in that war; neither can we learn that any Engliſh perſon who was born in that town, was ever ſlain by the ſword for eighty years after. Major Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage and moſt of his men returning, he left Capt. Turner to command in that quarter. Hereupon the enemy, thinking themſelves more out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, reſorted ſeven or eight hundred of them to to the great falls above Deerfield, on the fiſhing deſign. Two captive lads made their eſcape, and gave information of their ſecure ſtate, whereupon Capt. Turner and young Capt. Holioke of Spring-field, collected what force they could on a ſudden, being not much more than a hundred and fifty men, and went up ſilently in the night, tied their horſes at ſome diſtance, and a little before day
<pb n="426" facs="unknown:015240_0437_0FA372718BD995A8"/>break, May 13, 1676, came unawares upon the enemy, "fired amain into their very wigwams, killing many upon the place, and frighting others with the ſudden alarm of their guns, made them run into the river, where the ſwiftneſs of the ſtream carrying them down a ſteep fall, they periſhed in the waters; ſome getting into canoes, ſank or overſet by the ſhooting of our men; others creeping for ſhelter, under the banks of the great river, were eſpied by our men and killed with their ſwords.—Some of their priſoners after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards owned that they loſt above three hundred, ſome whereof were principal men, ſachems and ſome of their beſt fighting men that were left.—Nor did they ſeem ever to have recovered themſelves after this defeat, but their ruin immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon it" When our people firſt fired upon them they cried out, <hi>Mohawks!</hi> but in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovering their miſtake, they rallied their ſcattered men, and Capt. Turner being unwell, and ſo "not able for want of bodily ſtrength (no ways defective for want of ſkill or courage) to aſſiſt or direct in making a retreat; ſome of the enemy fell upon the guards that kept the horſes, others perſued them in the rear, ſo as our men ſuſtained pretty much damage as they retired, miſſing after their return thirty-eight of their men."

Turner, who was afterwards found and buried.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hubbard's hiſtory of that war. p. 88, 94.</note> Dr. Stephen Williams ſays, "There were many remarkables in this affair (as related by Jonathan Wells, <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> who was preſent) which are taken notice of by Mr. Hubbard, or Dr. Mather."<note n="†" place="bottom">Appendix to his father and Deerfield's captivity. p. 66.</note> Mr. Hubbard's account was examined and approved by three

Our conſtant ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience to their laws, both actively, as far as we can with a good conſcience, and where we could not actively, there have we been paſſively obedient; in ſuffering what they inflicted on us, without ſeeking any revenge in the leaſt. 4. In paying all due demands whatſoever; not being deſirous to withhold from Caeſar at any time, any of his dues. In a word, both our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and eſtates are always ready at command to be ſerviceable in the defence of the country; yea and have been voluntarily offered on the high places of the field, in the time of the country's greateſt extremity.—Among whom was William Turner, whom they pleaſed to make Captain of that company, who had been one of the greateſt ſufferers among us, for the profeſſion of religion. He was a very worthy man for ſoldiery; and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Drinker, who had been another ſufferer, whom they pleaſed to make Lieutenant; and by

Here it is to be obſerved that thoſe who had ſuffered ſo much from the country, and ſcandalized as enemies to the country, and their privileges, freely offering themſelves in their ſervice have been (through the Lord's preſence with them) ſome of the principal inſtruments to ſubdue the barbarous heathen, and to deliver the country from its greateſt diſtreſs; which may ſtand as a witneſs of our fidelity to the government to the world's end. We have been vilified and greatly reproached, and are at this day, it being without any juſt reaſon laid to us, that we are one chief cauſe of all the judgments of God on the land. We do not excuſe ourſelves, as not having a ſhare or part in many of the ſins that have provoked the Lord againſt poor New-England; neither have we been freed from having part with others in the general calamities that God hath brought on this poor place. Yet it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable bow graciouſly the Lord hath dealt with us; that in the time of great mortallity by the ſmall-pox, when ſo many hundreds died, though many of us were viſited with that viſitation, yet not one of our ſociety was removed by it; but it was not for any thing in us, that the Lord ſpared us, but for his names ſake, that the mouth of our

               <p>"THE German anabaptiſts were enemies to civil government, we hope theſe (though they have ſhown too much contempt of authority) are not ſo far gone. But for his ſo gloriouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blazoning their ſervice in the late wars, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the purpoſe, nor of much moment. That they did join againſt the common enemy is true. Swanzey (a place chiefly conſiſting of anabaptiſts, and where they had a church) was the place where the enemy made the firſt onſet.—Beſides, any man would fight, rather than have his throat cut; it was not for religion, nor civil government, but for lives and eſtates.—Nor did the Indians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the greateſt blow at that time; nor it is the anabaptiſts true, but vain glory, to ſet ſuch an encomium upon their own deeds.—We have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the charge, now comes a ſtrong argument of their orthodoxy, a witneſs from Heaven, viz. their happy preſervation in the time of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox. Let it be remembered, that one of their perſwation died of it at Woborn, (where John Ruſſell lived, and ſhould have obſerved it) and many of their children. But be it ſo; their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is ſmall, and ſcattered from Dan to Beerſheba. And who knows, but God might ſpare them in judgment, to harden them? Theſe are too high things for us; only when God comes to chaſten his people, thoſe that are not chaſtened, may aſk whether they are not baſtards?" He had before ſaid, "As the honored magiſtrates here are chriſtians, ſo have they judged it their duty to maintain the ways of Chriſt, and ſtrengthen them by <hi>civil laws,</hi> which hath not only been the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

But let the anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts offer themſelves ever ſo willingly, and at a time when the main of the enemy were remote from their churches, both of Boſton and Swanzey; and let them do ever ſo great public ſervice, yet it muſt not be thought that they were moved
<pb n="431" facs="unknown:015240_0442_0FA372756E1681F8"/>thereto, either by religion or loyalty. No, all proceeded either from love to the world, or elſe fear of having their throats cut by the Indians in Boſton, if they had not gone a hundred miles into the country to meet them! Which is ſpoken, not in contempt to any man's perſon, but to expoſe and detect that <hi>ſelf-flatiery</hi> which ſo often deceives mankind. The above is all the mention I ever ſaw, in any publication from that party, that ſhews the chief commander in the fall-fight to have been a baptiſt. Moſt of their hiſtories of that war mention his name, but not a word of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man who had before ſuffered in the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts cauſe. And leſt it ſhould detect the ſlanders they ſtill were caſting upon our denomination, they having gained his ſon to their party, intirely concealed this fact from his numerous poſterity. For though his grandſon, Capt. William Turner of Swanzey embraced our principals, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in after he removed to Newport, where he died in 1759, bequeathing, among other legacies in his will, his lands in Fall-town, adjoining to the place where his grandfather was ſlain; yet in June 1774, I was converſing with one of his daughters, together with her ſon, William Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Millar, <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> both members of the baptiſt church in Warren, and they told me, they had often heard of their anceſtors exploits and death in Philip's war, but never a word before of his being a baptiſt, or of his ſufferings in that cauſe. Neither have any of their hiſtorians ever ventured to publiſh a particular account of the baptiſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as they have of the Quakers. For which I can give no better reaſon than, becauſe they could find incroachments upon their rights in the batter to found a plea upon, which they could not
<pb n="432" facs="unknown:015240_0443_0FA3727608EDDBB0"/>in the former. And the author of the Magnalia plainly expreſt his unwillingneſs, that the <hi>records</hi> thereof ſhould be kept any where.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN Benjamin Church of Duxbury near Plymouth, who had made ſome beginning at Sokonet, now Little-Compton, eaſt of Rhode-Iſland, the year before the war, carried his family on that Iſland after it began, as a place in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of greater ſafety than Duxbury or Plymouth; and he was an active and ſucceſsful commander through the war. As he knew that Philip had forced the Sokonet Indians into the war, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the minds of the leading part of them, he againſt his friends advice, went over in a canoe, and adventered himſelf among them in June this year, and gained them over to our ſide, by whoſe help he took great numbers of the enemy from day to day, who had now loſt all their courage. At length returning to viſit his wife, whoſe anxious mind fainted to ſee him again well; he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately informed by Major Sanford and Capt. Golding, that one of Philip's men had fled from him (then at the foot of Mount-Hope) and was come over to the Iſland. Hereupon they all put ſpurs to their horſes, and having heard the Indian's account, croſſed the ferry in the night with a few men, and after Capt. Church had ſtationed his ambuſh, of the Rhode-Iſland gentlemen, beat up Philip's head-quarters, upon which he ſet out to flee through a little ſwamp, but after an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man had ſnapt his gun at him without effect, Alderman, an Indian, fired a bullet through his heart on Auguſt 12, 1676, a little before the break of day; after which the war was ſoon brought to a cloſe.</p>

<pb n="433" facs="unknown:015240_0444_OFA37276C8100E70"/>collected from a gret variety of hiſtories and accounts.

That about one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, two hundred houſes were burnt, eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand head of cattle, and many thouſand buſhels of grain deſtroyed; and alſo three thouſand Indians. The loſs to the Engliſh colonies, was computed at £ 150,000 ſterling, and Capt.

And for the other ſide over againſt us on the main, which
<pb n="434" facs="unknown:015240_0445_0FA3727AB5011F50"/>once was ours, and is I judge by charter, many are killed by the Indians, the reſt came to us with what they could bring. Connecticut army, Plymouth and Bay armies being there, waſted very much; when they left it, the Indians burnt near all that was left. In Plymouth the wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and are ſore waſted; the Bay loſt very many men. Connecticut did moſt ſervice, and I have not heard of one town deſtroyed or fired in that colony. In the beginning of theſe troubles of the wars, Lieutenant Joſeph Tory, elder of Mr. Clarke's church, having but one daughter living at Squamicot [Weſterly] and his wife being there, he ſaid unto me, come let us ſend a boat to Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micot, my all is there and part of yours. We ſent a boat ſo as his wife, his daughter, and ſon-in-law, and all their children, and my two daughters and their children (one had eight, the other three, with an apprentice boy) all came, and brother John Crandal and his family, with as many others as could poſſibly come. My ſon Clarke came afterwards before winter, and my other daughter's huſband came in the ſpring, and they all have been at my houſe to this day. Now dear brother, although we are not deſtroyed by the Indians, God hath viſited this land by taking away many by death; and in this place, of all ſorts. Of the old church firſt Mr. Joſeph Tory, then my dear brother John Crandal, then Mr. John Clarke, then William Weeden, a deacon, then John Salmon: a ſad ſtroke in very deed: young men and maids to this day, I never knew or heard the like in New-England. Laſt week four or five were buried in this town—Brother Turner went to war, and God proſpered him for a time, but he is now kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Indians; the reſt are well and enjoy

               <p>THE above account of the preſervation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, as well as the other articles expreſſed are juſt, as far as I can learn. The Mohegan Indians, under Uncas, did the Engliſh great ſervice in that war. I have ſeen ſcarce any account of any other damages in Swanzey and Rehoboth, beſide what have been recited, except the Indians killing Capt. Willet's ſon near the garriſon in Swanzey this year. Middleborough and Dartmouth were but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun before the war, and when it came on, the Engliſh and part of the Indians therein, removed to Plymouth and other places of greater ſafety; and the large body of natives near to and upon Cape-Cod, continued in amity with the Engliſh, as thoſe on the Iſlands ſouth of it alſo did; and of the latter I have met with the following entertaining account.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MAYHEW, <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> obtained agrant of Martha's-Vineyard, with the iſlands adjacent, and began a ſettlement at Edgarton on the eaſt part of the Vineyard, in 1642, where he was their chief ruler, and his ſon their miniſter In 1646, the ſon began to preach to the Indians with ſucceſs; to promote which cauſe his father told them, "That by order from the crown of England, he was to govern the Engliſh who ſhould inhabit thoſe Iſlands; that his royal maſter was in power far above any of the Indian monarchs; but that as he was great and powerful, ſo he was a lover of
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:015240_0447_0FA3727C07486528"/>juſtice; and that therefore he would in no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure invade their juriſdictions, but on the contrary aſſiſt them if need required; that religion and government were <hi>diſtinct things,</hi> and their ſachems might retain their juſt authority, though their ſubjects were chriſtians." And he practiſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his profeſſion; "for he would not ſuffer any to injure them, either in their goods, lands or perſons. They always found a father and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in him; and he was ſo far from introduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any form of government among them <hi>againſt their wills,</hi> that he firſt convinced them of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, and even brought them to deſire him to introduce and ſettle it." This wiſe conduct and the goſpel means that were uſed with them, produced ſuch happy effects, that a chriſtian church was formed and organized among them five years before this war. And now in the time of it, the government furniſhed thoſe chriſtian Indians with arms and ammunition, and employed them to defend the Iſlands againſt the enemy. "And ſo faithful were they, that they not only reſolutely rejected the ſtrong ſollicitations of the natives on the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Main, but, in obſervance of the gerneral orders given them, when any landed to ſollicit them though ſome were nearly related by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raige and others by blood, yet the Iſland Indians would immediately bring them before the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to attend his pleaſure." By the divine bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on theſe means, though the Indians there were twenty to one of the Engliſh, yet through this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and bloody war, "Theſe Iſlands enjoyed a perfect calm of peace; and the people wrought and dwell ſecure and quiet."<note n="*" place="bottom">

In that performance I find that Mr. Peter Foulger was early employed as a "ſchool-maſter among thoſe Indians, and when young Mr. Mayhew went for England, in 1667, Mr. Prince ſays, they had not only ſeveral Indian teachers on the Iſland but alſo "and able, godly Engliſhman named Peter Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, employed in teaching the youth in reading, writing and the principles of religion by catechizing; being well learned likewiſe in the ſcripture, and capable of helping them in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters" p. 291. I find by Mr. Samuel Hubbard, that M. Foulger became a baptiſt, and joined Mr. Clarke's church about the time of this war; as Thomas Weft an Engliſh man, and ſome Indians from thence did to Mr. Hiſcox's church, in 1680. And Mr. Foulger promoted the baptiſt priciples among the Indians. Though one of them named Japeth, who had been his ſcholar, and now was got to be a noted teacher, reminded him that he had formerly warned them againſt falſe teachers that would come, and ſaid he, "Now ſir, I find your prediction true for you yourſelf are become one of theſe teachers, you cautioned us againſt; I am therefore <hi>fully reſolved</hi> to take your good counſel, and not believe you, but <hi>will</hi> continue ſtedfaſt in the truths wherein you formerly inſtructed me." Mayhew, p. 49.50. However he found others no to be ſo <hi>reſolute,</hi> for by the time that their governor Mayhew died, in 1681, the baptiſt principles had prevailed conſiderably among them; and by the year 1694, they had one baptiſt church on the Vineyard among the chriſtian Indians, and another on Nantucket. Magnalia, b. 6, p. 56. The firſt Indian paſtor over thoſe baptiſts on the Vineyard, that I have ſeen any account of, was S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Mayhew informs us, that he was <hi>rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> ſome years after, and became a member and a teacher of that church, but ſays, "However, he appeared to be ſo ſerious a man, that I cannot but judge, that he acted according to the dictates of his conſcience in what he did, and not out of any baſe or fordid ends." He died in Chilmark, in 1708; and our author ſays, "I had frequent converſation with him while he was in health, and ſometimes—in the time of that long ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereof he died; and never from firſt to laſt ſaw any thing by him, that made me any ways ſuſpect he integrity of his heart, but did ever think him to be a godly and diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The laſt time I went to ſee him, he profeſſed his good opinion of thoſe people and churches, from whom he differed in his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions about the ſubjects and mode of baptiſm, and blamed ſome of his brethren for being too uncharitable and cenſorious towards them; and he on other ſubjects, diſcourſed like a good chriſtian.—He ſeemed not to be at all terrified at the approaches of death towards him, of which he was very ſenſible, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to enjoy that peace in his ſoul which paſſeth underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing." P. 42.—44. Theſe are the words of Mr. Experience Mayhew, in his <hi>Indian converts,</hi> publiſhed in 1727. His wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſon who ſucceeds him in the miniſtry among the Indians on the Iſland, treated one of my brethren in the miniſtery, very friendly when he was over and preached among thoſe baptiſts, near three years ago. I had requeſted my friend to collect ſome account of thoſe baptiſts, and he applied to Mr. Mayhew for that purpoſe; who promiſed he would get the beſt intelligence he could concerning them, from an aged Aunt of his, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her mental powers remarkably and others. And he ſent the ſame in the following letter.</p>

My aged Aunt informs me, that the firſt baptiſt miniſter among the Indians on the Iſland, that ſhe knew or heard of, was one Iſaac Decamy, who came from the Main-land with his family, and preached and adminiſtered the ordinances of baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper, a number of years: ſhe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain what year he came, but according to the beſt of her memory the ſaid Decamy died near ſixty years agone: ſhe ſaith further, that he was a man of a ſober life and converſation. The next Indian miniſter of this denomination, by the beſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence I can get, was Jonas Horſwet, who preached and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered the ordinances to a ſmall ſociety of baptiſts at Gayhead. The next was Ephraim Abraham, originally of Chappaquidick, at the eaſt end of the Iſland, who had the charge of the ſociety at Gayhead, as alſo of one, which about this time was formed at ſaid Chappequidick. The next ordained miniſter was Samuel Kakenchew, whom I had a perſonal acquaintance with: he lived at Chappaquidick, was eſteemed by ſuch as knew him, to be a man of ſenſe, and of a regular and chriſtian life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There were ſeveral other preachers among them, but not ordained; except Silas Paul, who is now living, and is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained paſtor of the baptiſt church at Gayhead, and who alſo takes upon him the care of the ſmall ſociety of that denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Chappaquidick; preaching occaſionally and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering the ordinanoes to them. He is the only Indian miniſter of this denomination now upon this Iſland.</p>

               <p>It may be proper to take ſome particular notice here of Mr. Clarke, who left as ſpotleſs a character as any man I knew of, that ever acted in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſtation in this coutry.<note n="*" place="bottom">He was born October 8, 1609; married Elizabeth, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of John Harges, <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> of Bedfordſhire. In a power of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney ſigned by them, May 12, 1656, he ſtiles himſelf John Clarke, phyſician of London. It was for the recovery of a legacy of £20 per annum during her life, that was given her by her father out of the mannor of Wreſling worth Bedfordſhire. Where he had his education I know not; but the following clauſe in his will may give ſome idea of his learning, viz "Item, unto my loving friend Richard Baily, I give and bequeath, my concordance and lexicon to it belonging, written by myſelf, being the fruit of ſeveral years ſtudy; my Hebrew Bibles, Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſſ's and Paſſor's lexicon, Cotton's conccidance, and all the reſt of my books." His firſt wife died at Newport without an iſſue, and Feb. 1. 1671, he married Mrs. Jane Fletcher, by whom Feb 14, 1672, he had a daughter born; but the mother died the 19th of April following, and the daughter May 18, 1673. His third wife was the widow Sarah Davis, who ſurvived him, he gave ſome legacies, both to her and to the children ſhe had by her former huſband, Mr. Baily came from London with him, in 1664.</note> The Maſſachuſett

Though he was diſarmed by them, in 1637, and impriſoned and fined at Boſton, in 1651, and he expoſed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and cruelty, to him and his berthren, in print the next year, and continued in England, to oppoſe and defeat all their attempts at the court there againſt his colony, till he obtained their preſent charter; yet among all their authors or records, that I have ſearched, I have not met with a ſingle reflection caſt upon him by any one; which I think is very extraordinary. There was doubtleſs enough ſaid againſt him, for his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of believers baptiſm, and liberty of conſcience, to ſecure him from the wo, of being ſpoken well of by all men; yet, like Daniel, it ſeems as if his enemies could find no fault in him in matter of the kingdom, but only concerning the law of his God.</p>
               <p>FEW men ever merited the title of a Patriot more than he did; for he was a principal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer of Rhode-Iſland, for ſufferers and exiles. And when their rights and liberties were groſſly invaded, he croſſed the boiſtrous ocean, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted all his influence, in twelve years watchful and diligent labours, for his colony at the Britiſh court, till he obtained a new charter for them, of great and diſtinguiſhing privileges; for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of which, he mortgaged his own eſtate in Newport, willing to venture his all, in ſo good a cauſe, though he was not inſenſable of the coveteouſneſs and ingratitude of ſome great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
<pb n="441" facs="unknown:015240_0452_0FA3727FC9AFB898"/>to liberty in that colony; whoſe influence had cauſed a great deal of trouble and expence to Mr. Williams, without any ſuitable recompence.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Six years after Mr. Williams obtained their firſt charter, viz—On March 22, 1650, he preſented a paper to the deputies and inhabitants of Providence, which contained four requeſt for others, and a fifth for himſelf, wherein he ſays. "I cannot be ſo unthankful to you, and ſo inſenſible of my own families comfort, as not to take notice of your continued and conſtant love and care, in your many public and ſolemn orders for the payment of that money due unto me about the charter. It is true, I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver demanded it; yea, I have been truly deſirous, that it might have been laid out for ſome further public benefit in each town; but obſerving your loving reſolution to the contrary, I have at laſt reſolved to write unto you (as I have alſo lately done to Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth and Newport) about the better ordering of it to my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage I have here, through God's providence, conveniency of improving ſome goats; my requeſt is therefore that, if it may be without much trouble, you would pleaſe to order the payment of it in cattle of that kind. I have been ſollicited, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed my help about iron works, when the matter is ripe; earneſtly deſirous every way to further the good of the town of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to which I am ſo much engaged, and to yourſelves the loving inhabitants thereof, to whom I deſire to be your truly lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ever faithful ROGER WILLIAMS."</p>
                     <p>YET he never received all his pay for that firſt charter.

               <p>AFTER Mr. Clarke's return, he was improved in various public offices; was elected deputy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor three years ſucceſſively, in two of which he accepted the office; but all the concern of the ſtate did not prevail with him, as it has done with many, to neglect the affairs of religion. His church records and other writings prove, the continuance of his paſtoral relation to the firſt church in Newport, and his care and labours to uphold goſpel worſhip, and diſcipline therein. And the inſtrument by which he ſettled his laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in this world, ſhews what his faith and hope were, as to that which is to come; for therein he ſays, "Whereas I John Clarke of Newport, in the colony of Rhode-Iſland, and Providence plantations in New-England, phyſician, am at this preſent, through the abundant goodneſs and mercy of my God, though weak in my body, yet ſound in my memory and underſtanding, and being ſenſible of the inconveniences that may enſue in caſe I ſhould not ſet my houſe in order, before this ſpirit of mine be called by the Lord to remove out of this tabernacle, do therefore make and declare this my laſt will and teſtament, in manner following; willing and readily reſigning up my ſoul unto my merciful Redeemer, through faith in whoſe death I firmly hope and believe, to eſcape from that ſecond hurting death, and through his reſurrection and life, to be glorified with him in life eternal.

                     <p>Copied from the original will, dated April 20, 1676; and he quitted our world the ſame day. As he left no child, he gave many legacies to his relations and friends, both in that colony and the Maſſachuſetts. His brother Joſeph Clarke was early a member of the church in Newport with him, and was often a magiſtrate of the Colony; whoſe ſon Joſeph was alſo a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that church, and then of the church in Weſterly, where his poſterity are numerous and reſpectable to this day. Elder Clarke, gave a particular lot of land in Newport, to his brother's ſon John, whoſe poſterity have alſo been reſpectable among the baptiſts ever ſince, one of whom is Mr. Edward Clarke, now a goſpel preacher near Providence. Then after giving a ſmall lot in town to his church, and giving his wife the uſe of his houſe and farm, containing more than a 150 acres, of upland and marſhes, together with ten acres in a part of Newport, called the neck, during her life, he gave ſaid farm and neck to his friends, William Weeden, Philip Smith and Richard Baily, and to their aſſigns, "qualified and choſen in manner following forever; that is to ſay, that when it ſhall happen that either of them three deceaſe, the two ſurviving ſhall make choice of an underſtanding perſon, fearing the Lord, to ſucceed in the place of him ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed; and in caſe the two ſurviving differ in their choice of the perſon to ſucceed in the room of him ſo deceaſed, that then the choice ſhall be decided by lot; which perſon ſo choſen ſhall be the aſſignees of the ſaid perſons above-mentioned, and ſhall have equal power to act with them in all matters relating to the diſpoſal of the profit or rent of the ſaid land and farm, from time to time; and ſo all perſons choſen as aboveſaid to make good the ſaid number of three, ſhall be deemed and taken to be the aſſigns of the ſaid William Weeden, Philip Smith and Richard Baily, and none other; which ſaid perſons and their aſſigns, from time to time, choſen and ſucceeding as above ſaid, ſhall be ſeized of the ſaid farm and land called the neck, to the uſe and uſes following forever; that is to ſay faithfully and truly to diſtribute and diſpoſe of the rent and profit of my ſaid farm and land, for the relief of the poor, or bringing up children unto learning, from time to time forever, according to ſuch inſtructions as I ſhall give unto them, bearing even date with theſe preſents."

               <p>ABOUT the begining of 1677, came out Mr. Williams's account of his diſpute with the Quakers, upon which M. Cordington wrote over to his friend Fox and ſaid, "Here is a lying ſcandalous book of Roger Williams of Providence, printed at Cambridge in New-England—I have known him about fifty years a meer weathercock, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant only inconſtancy: poor man! that doth not know what ſhould become of his ſoul, if this night it ſhould be taken from him.

<pb n="447" facs="unknown:015240_0458_0FA37284495AAF10"/>an anſwer to Williams, in 1678, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>A New-England firebrand quenched.</hi> Fox's former book in folio Williams ſays was wrote againſt about ſix ſcore authors and papers, to which Edward Burroughs wrote a preface; and ſome things that they ſaid in the diſpute, turned his thoughts ſo, as from thoſe names he called his work, <hi>George Fox digged out of his Burroughs.</hi> Such titles were more common in that day than ours, but I have nothing to ſay to juſtify them, nor a great deal of the language that was uſed on both ſides.

As Mr. Williams had occaſion to vindicate many things in the writings of Mr. Richard Baxter, Dr. John Owen, and others that Fox had written againſt, whom Williams call <hi>pious and learned men;</hi> he prefixed a particular addreſs to them, in which he ſays, "As to matters in difference between your ſelves and me, I have willingly omitted them as knowing that many able and honeſt ſeamen in their obſervations of the ſun (one picture of Chriſt Jeſus) differ ſometimes in their reckings, though uprightly aiming at, and bound for one port and harbour, I humbly beg of you, 1.

               <p>THUS both parties could extol Mr. Cotton, while they vented their reſentment againſt Mr. Williams at a high rate; and by theſe means, and by ſome connection with the Coddington family, Mr. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender in his century ſermon ſcrupled to own him for a baptiſt, and in the dedication of it, ſet Mr. Coddington up as the main founder and ſupporter of that colony. Though by his papers, I find he was afterwards convinced of his error herein; and let us now examine the evidences refered to, to prove thoſe dreadful charges again? Mr. Williams.</p>
               <p n="1">1. MORTON does not repreſent that the people were weary of him at Plymouth, but that they were backward to grant his requeſt of a diſmiſſion to Salem, though their elder prevailed with them to do it; and governor Bradford bleſſed God for the good effects of his miniſtry many years after he was baniſhed, p. 54. 2. Like thoſe he calls New-England prieſts, Coddington tries to draw womens vails, and mens hats and caps over people's eyes,

Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but now he went to Salem, and preached the people out of conceit of it. And among all Mr. Williams's numerous writings, I have not met with any thing about it; no, nor about his hat or cap though in the Maſſachuſett records, I find that the year before they baniſhed him, when Codding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was both a magiſtrate and their treaſurer, they made a law againſt <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> and <hi>expenſive faſhions,</hi> wherein they prohibited the making or wearing of <hi>beaver hats</hi> upon penalty of forfeiting of them if they did. 3. As to the <hi>croſs</hi> in the military co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which Hutchinſon alſo names as a ſufficient ground for the authority to take hold of Mr. Williams, it is certain from Winthrop Hubbard, and the colony records, that the aſſembly took hold of Endicot and not Williams for that act, and put him out of all office for one year therefor; and the Magnalia aſſures us, that the ſcruple about that Popiſh ſign prevailed in their colony, after Mr. Williams was gone out of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Book 7, p. 11.</note> 4. Upon the affairs of the patent, Coddington artfully ſlips in the word <hi>authority,</hi> willing with his friend Cotton, to have Williams appear as a rebel againſt the king. We learn from governor Winthrop, that Mr. Williams firſt wrote upon that ſubject at Plymouth, and after he came to Salem, the court called for a copy of it, which he granted them, and then near
<pb n="452" facs="unknown:015240_0463_0FA37288C4FF1168"/>the cloſe of 1633, they had him before them; but he gave them ſuch ſatisfaction about it, that they diſimiſſed him; yet they afterward brought in and <hi>re-examined</hi> that matter, as one cauſe of his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note n="*" place="bottom">Williams's reply to Cotton, p. 277.</note> 5. By the foregoing hiſtory, the reader may ſee with what grace the Quakers could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Mr. Williams, of being mercinary or <hi>hired for money,</hi> in procuring their firſt charter. And I find that when he was ſetting off upon his ſecond agency, to get Mr. Coddington's commiſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, he, on Sept. 3, 1651, ſold his trading houſe and intereſt in Narragganſet, for 50<abbr>l.</abbr> to Mr. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Smith.<note n="†" place="bottom">Newport Records</note> His great crime therefore, was his advancing ſuch queſtions as he did, <hi>againſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> which in plain terms, was a power to frame to themſelves a goſpel and a Chriſt without the croſs. A power to ſuſpend obedience to what they looked upon to be truth in England, and to compel others to their judgments, when they had got out of the prelates reach. Yea, a power to confirm and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch corruptions by oaths, both there and here. p. 71.</p>
               <p>MR.

Though Mr. Cotton repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it as a meer <hi>pretence</hi> for him to tell of church government, when he did not join fully with any church that was then extant, yet he replies and ſays, "The <hi>inſtitution</hi> of any government and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is one thing, and the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> and <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which may be interrupted and eclipſed, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeremiah could not rightly have been judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a pretender, when he mourned for, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the deſolations of the temple, prieſts, el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, altar and ſacrifices; and neither he nor Daniel, nor any of God's ſervants, could, during the deſolation and captivity, acknowledge either temple, altar of ſacrifice aright, extant upon the face of the earth,—Although the diſcuſſor be not ſatisfied in the period of the <hi>times</hi> and the <hi>manner</hi> of Chriſt's glorious appearing, yet his <hi>ſoul uprightly deſires</hi> to ſee and adore, and to be thankful to maſter Cotton, yea to the leaſt of the diſciples of Chriſt, for any coal or ſpark of true light, among ſo many falſe and pretended candles and candle ſticks."<note n="*" place="bottom">Reply to Cotton, p, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I know of no other conſiſtant way, to get over this difficulty but this; that as the lawful ſeed of Aaron were to govern in the Jewiſh church, ſo are the ſpiritual ſeed of Chriſt to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in his church, into which none ought to be admitted, without goſpel evidence of their being ſuch; and it ſeems that Mr. Williams had not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a clear ſettlement in this point.

The light of nature teaches the importance of <hi>ſeeking</hi> to God for what we need, and of <hi>praiſing</hi> him for what we receive; which duties ought to be inculcated upon all men, as much as love to God or our neighbours; while the revealed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of baptiſm and the ſupper, are tokens of fellowſhip with Chriſt, and therefore cannot be our duty to perform <hi>before</hi> we are united to him.

                  </gap>ſtion to the moſt enlightned ſaints; yet Mr. Williams's grand crime in the view of both of theſe parties, was becauſe he would not yield to their power in this matter. And the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage the Quakers ſo often appealed to, as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his being a bloody perſecutor, is as follows.</p>
               <p>AN author had ſaid, <hi>the Quakers ſpirit doth teach them to honor no man,</hi> Upon which Fox ſaid,
<pb n="455" facs="unknown:015240_0466_0FA3728A55EF7698"/>"That is a <hi>lie;</hi> for it teacheth them to have all men in eſteem and to honor all men in the Lord; yet they are convinced by the law as tranſgreſſors if they reſpect mens perſons as you do. In reply to which Mr. W. ſays, "All men may ſee how truly they honor all in the Lord, and what Lord they mean, when his firſt word to his oppoſite is that moſt provoking term, <hi>that is a lie.</hi> It is true that Chriſt Jeſus and his ſervants, uſed ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, ſimilitudes, &amp;c. but thus ſuddenly at the firſt daſh to give fire, <hi>thou lyeſt, that is a lie,</hi> &amp;c. Shews neither religion nor civility, but a <hi>barbarous ſpirit,</hi> for they that know the <hi>barbarians,</hi> know how common that word is in all their mouth's— The moſt Holy and only Wiſe knows how proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſimply, and barbarouſly they have run into uncivil and inhuman behaviour towards all their ſuperiors, the eldeſt and higheſt, how they have declared by principle and practice, that there are no men to be reſpected in the world but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as being God's and Chriſt's. It is true our Engliſh bibles and grammar (as Fox in his great learning often objects) makes thou to a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thou in holy ſcripture is uſed in a grave and reſpective way unto ſuperiors, unto kings and patents, and God himſelf. But 1. the Hebrew and Greek ſignify no more thou than you, and ſo may be truly turned. 2. Every nation, every ſhire, every calling have their particular properties or idioms of ſpeech, which are improper and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culuos with others. Hence theſe ſimple reformers are extreamly ridiculous in giving thou and thee to every body, which our nation commonly gives to <hi>familiars</hi> only; and they are inſufferably proud and contemptuous unto all their <hi>ſuperiors</hi> in uſing thou to every body, which our Engliſh idiom of
<pb n="456" facs="unknown:015240_0467_0FA3728B17803858"/>propriety of ſpeech, uſeth in a way of familiarity, or anger, ſcorn and contempt. I have therefore publicly declared myſelf, that a due and moderate reſtraint, and puniſhing of <hi>theſe incivilities</hi> (though pretending conſcience) is ſo far from perſecution, (properly ſo called) that it is a duty and command of God unto all mankind, firſt in families, and thence into all human ſocieties."<note n="*" place="bottom">Williams, p. 199, 200.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is all the paſſage in his whole book that ſpeaks in favour of puniſhing Quakers; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the inſtance of Norton's <hi>incivilities</hi> to governor Prince and others, and obſerving that the empheſies lies upon their <hi>manner</hi> of uſing thoſe words, the reader will judge, whether a <hi>moderate</hi> puniſhing of the ſame, is any ways inconſiſtant with Mr. William's plea for liberty againſt Mr. Cotton. And as to his practice, we learn expreſlly that the inſtance Scott refers to at Newport, was that of Harris's at the election, in 1655. And though he and Mr. Coddington ſubmitted to Mr. William's government the next year, (a few months before the Quakers arrived) yet after that they and others became ſo ſpiritual as to refuſe to act therein. This is ſeems cauſed Mr. Williams to aſk Mr. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright what they ſhould do with them, which in their view was another proof of his perſecuting diſpoſition. In 1665 their aſſembly framed an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagment to the government, which they hoped thoſe men would have taken, and ſo have come in to act with them again; but in March 1666 they pleaded that they could not in conſcience do it, and prevailed with the aſſembly to make a law, to allow thoſe who pleaded, that they could not in conſcience take either that engagment, nor the oath of alliegence in England, to make their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="457" facs="unknown:015240_0468_0FA3728BCFB16CF0"/>to the government, either before the court or before two magiſtrates, in their own words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of any that others could frame for them. And no ſooner was this point gained, than at the election in May enſuing, they got in a Quaker deputy governor, and three magiſtrates; two of the latter being Coddington and Harris. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris was in the ſame office in 1667, when on July 2, he procured an extraordinary meeting of the aſſembly, to try Mr. Fenner, (another magiſtrate) for a <hi>rout</hi> which Harris charged him with making in Providence on June 3. But the aſſembly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited Fenner, and fined Harris 50<abbr>l.</abbr> and put him out of office, chooſing Stephen Arnold in his ſtead. The next fall lie was fined 10<abbr>s.</abbr> for breach of peace, and bound to his good behaviour. Yet he had influence enough in May 1668, to get again into the magiſtracy, and in the fall to have his 50<abbr>l.</abbr> remitted. He was likewiſe in the ſame office in 1669; and as Connecticut then revived their claim to the Narraganſet country, he eagerly turned to aſſiſt them, hoping doubtleſs, to ſhare largely therein, if they prevailed.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems that the agents who procured their charters, agreed that ſome perſons living near Mr. Smith's trading houſe in Narraganſet, ſhould have liberty to chooſe which government they would be under; therefore from thence, and from the words of Connecticut charter, they ſet out afreſh to graſp all that country to themſelves.

               <p>FOX and other noted teachers of theirs were now come over, and gained many proſelytes; upon which Mr. Williams went to a general meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had at Newport, and began to preſent to them ſome conſiderations concerning the true Chriſt and the falſe, the true ſpirit and the falſe, but ſays I was <hi>cut off in the midſt,</hi> by the ſudden prayer of one, and ſinging of another, &amp;c. which is afterward explained thus, viz.

               <p>THUS each party call their own way <hi>order;</hi> but the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>decency</hi> which the inſpired apoſtle enjoined upon the church of Corinth, concerned the behaviour of <hi>their women,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from men; their women who had <hi>huſbands,</hi> in the plural number, who had each a diſtinct part to act in divine worſhip, which they ought to know and attend unto. As all ſaints are one in Chriſt, there is but one huſband and one bride; and viewing things in this diſtinct light, tends both to purity and peace; but the confounding of literal women with myſtical huſbands, has often produced the grapes of Sodom and cluſters of Gomorrah. And among the many inſtances of the Quakers aſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a power to govern the ſcriptures inſtead of being governed by them, take the following. The baptiſt churches in Wales, gathered by our Mr. Miles and others, publiſhed a confeſſion of their faith, wherein they adopted the words of David in Pſalm. 51, 5. To which Fox, in p. 214 of his former book ſaid, "David doth not ſay, <hi>you were conceived in ſin,</hi> but I.

               <p>IN July 1672, Mr. Williams drew up fourteen propoſitions, and incloſed them in a letter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty governor Cranſton, whom he ſtiles, <hi>My kind friend,</hi> for him to deliver them to Fox or his friends; in which Mr. Williams propoſed a fair diſpute upon thoſe points with any of them, ſeven propoſitions to be handled at Newport, and the other at Providence, on the days they ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. By ſome means the matter was delayed till Fox had ſailed for England; after which John Stubs, John Burnyeat and William Edmundſon, engaged in the affair, and with them Williams held the diſpute at Newport, on the 9th, 10th and 12th of Auguſt, and at Providence the 17th. When they began at Newport, he publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his motives to be theſe. "1.

               <p>"WHETHER it comes into them at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or at the birth, or when elſe? whether it was in all mankind before the coming and death of Chriſt or to thoſe ſince his coming, or both? whether it be in the underſtanding, will, memory, affections, in any of them ſeverally, or lodged in all of them jointly.?<note n="†" place="bottom">Williams, p. 35.</note> In anſwer to which they ſay, "As to his <hi>unlearned queſtions,</hi> whether the light cometh into mankind at the conception, or at the birth, or when elſe? we leave him to what is written John 1, 9.

               <p>HIS laſt propoſition was, that their ſpirit tended to arbitrary government and firery perſecution;

               <p>HE then refered them to the paſſage before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited about the magiſtrates <hi>ſubjecting all into his light;</hi> and cloſed that head with obſerving, that Chriſt ſays, <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> and aſks if any profeſſors of the

               <p>THE Quakers prevailed ſo far, that in 1675, Mr. Coddington was governor, and Mr. John Eaſton deputy governor; when finding that their <hi>ſpiritual power</hi> would not ſecure them againſt the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they gave out <hi>military commiſſions under their hands and ſeals</hi> to <hi>arm</hi> both <hi>veſſels</hi> and <hi>garriſons</hi> againſt them.<note n="†" place="bottom">Callender, p. 80—Colony Records.</note> Harris was again choſen an aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in the years 73, 74 and 76, in the laſt of which Mr. S.

Mr. Williams book came out ſoon after, and at their next election, May 2, 1677, the Quakers were left out of office; and on June 28,
<pb n="466" facs="unknown:015240_0477_0FA372929012DA58"/>Mr. Coddington wrote the forecited letter to his friend Fox; which facts may enable us to account for the ſpirit of it. Mr. Williams was again cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a magiſtrate, but excuſed himſelf from that ſervice; yet he wrote thus to Providence, viz. "I pray the town that the place of meeting be certain, and ſome courſe ſettled for payment, that the clerk and ſerjeant be ſatisfied according to moderation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the town buſineſs may go on cheerfully, that the buſineſs of the rate (paid by ſo many already) be finiſhed, that the old cuſtom of order be kept in our meetings, and thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly be reproved, or upon obſtanacy, caſt out from ſober and freemens company, that our ancient uſe of arbitration be brought into eſteem again, that (it being conſtantly reported that Connecticut is upon the gaining his majeſty's conſent to <hi>enſlave us to their pariſh worſhip</hi>) we conſider what we ought to do"</p>
               <p>A SPECIAL court of commiſſioners met at Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, October, 3, 1677, procured by Harris; who by a jury gave his party five verdicts for land, the firſt of which was againſt Gregory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Arthur Fenner, and the town of Providence, wherein they gave, "two pounds in money da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and coſt of court; and alſo that the ſaid defendants run the line equally between Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuxet river and Wenaſquatucket river, till they meet with a thwart line from the head of Wenaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatucket river, directly runing to Pawtuxet river." The two next verdicts gave that party 30<abbr>l.</abbr> damages in each, with lands further ſouth-ward; of which the town of Warwick, by the hands of Mr. Holden and Mr. Greene, gave an account two years after to the King, wherein they mention the former ill treatment they had
<pb n="467" facs="unknown:015240_0478_0FA372934F2F11D8"/>met with at Boſton, and repreſent, that the late war was wholly cauſed by the arbitrary conduct of the neighbouring colonies, who after the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganſet fight in December, 1675, they ſay, "with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew their forces from us, leaving our unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towns to the deſtroyer, whereby the town of Warwick was wholly burnt, great part of our goods and cattle loſt and conſumed, but the lives of moſt of us reſerved as a prey, ſupported with hope that yet in time of peace, we might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to re-build and provide for our diſtreſſed families and ſucceeding generations—But William Warris of Pautuxet, came over in 1674, and claimed land in Narraganſet by Indian purchaſe, and the King appointed the caſe to be heard by commiſſioners, choſen out of the ſeveral colonies of New-England. We attended time and place according to ſummons, but the major part of the commiſſioners, elected out of our profeſſed and mortal enemies, out-voted thoſe of Rhode-Iſland, granting and awarding to him the lands brought and improved by your petitioners, alſo giving him great damages, notwithſtanding the teſtimony of one Mr. Williams, the firſt Indian perchaſer of thoſe lands, and other material witneſſes in our behalf, whereby above 5000 acres of land and medows, belonging to the poor town of Warwick, and parts adjacent are taken away, and we prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to rebuild, or attempt any thing for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our dependances," and ſo went on to pray for relief, p. 299.</p>
               <p>CONNECTICUT in the mean time had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their encroachments upon the weſt part of that colony, till a letter was obtained from the King dated July 9, 1679, confirming Rhode-Iſland charter; upon which the aſſembly wrote to warn
<pb n="468" facs="unknown:015240_0479_0FA372940B855358"/>them off their lands, and to charge their own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not to obey them. But at the ſame time Harris had procured an order from the King to the authority of the colony, to levy the aforeſaid exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. In conſequence whereof I have ſeen war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants iſſued to John Smith of Newport, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him magiſtrate to levy three of them, ſigned Nov. 24, 1679, by John Cranſton, governor, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb Carr, Joſeph Clarke, Arthur Fenner and John Sanford, aſſiſtants. But this not ſatisfying Harris, he ſoon ſet off again for England with new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Mr. Samuel Hubbard wrote to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at Weſterly the 7th of February following, informing them or a rumor he heard of turning their governor out of his place, and of puting a Quaker into it and of ſeting Narraganſet, which they called the King's province off by itſelf; and ſaid he, "William Harris is gone for Old-England, diſpleaſed at our courts act, and will not accept, though offered it is ſaid, to be Connecticut agent's attorney. God can have Ahithophel's counſel to fall, and to hang himſelf." Poor man! he was taken and carried into Turkiſh ſlavery, from whence he never returned. Thus ended the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with him, whoſe firſt title to any of thoſe lands was a free gift from Mr. Williams.</p>
               <p>TWO conſiderations have moved me to be much larger and more particular upon theſe unhappy affairs, than I had any thoughts of at firſt. One is, that harrangues have often been made from pulpits, and in courts of juſtice, from that time to ours, upon the great diſorders of Rhode-Iſland colony, to prove that an eſtabliſhed religion by human laws is exceeding neceſſary in every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. I thought it duty, therefore to give the public a fair and full ſtate of thoſe facts, to
<pb n="469" facs="unknown:015240_0480_0FA37294D1B2E240"/>enable them to judge righteouſly concerning ſuch addreſſes. The other is, that I might plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ect and expoſe the pernicious nature, of imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that dominion is founded in grace, or that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon endows the ſubjects of it with a right to act as lawgivers and judges over others. In the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly that baniſhed Mrs. Hutchinſon, in 1637, Mr. Coddington ſaid, "I do not ſee any clear witneſs againſt her; and you know it is a rule of the court, that no man may be a judge and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer too."<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſ. hiſt. vol. 2, p. 516.</note> But where was that rule when he, in his letter to Fox, acted the part of an accuſer, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and judge againſt Mr. Williams, even as to the in ward ſtate of his ſoul! with all their talk about light, Mr. Cotton formerly (p. 159) and the Quakers now, accuſed Mr. Williams of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting his own principles about liberty of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, only for <hi>examining</hi> and <hi>bringing to light</hi> the nature of their principles and behaviour; and the word of truth tells us what light that is, Mat. 6. 23. John 3.19, 21. The Quakers have had a fame among many for honeſtly and liberty, and far be it from me to detract in the leaſt from what has truly been among them of that nature; and I readily grant that not only in thoſe reſpects, but alſo in their moderation in dreſs, and ſolemnity in worſhip, (though not ſingularity) and hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to ſtrangers they have merited high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and more ſo for their zeal againſt the ſlave-trade.

               <p>MR. Williams's zeal appeared to be directed, not againſt the perſon of any man, but only againſt their errors. In the preface to his reply to Mr. Cotton he ſays, "Since it pleaſed God to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Therefore (notwithſtanding ſome of no common judgment and reſpect to him, have ſaid, he wrote his waſhings of the bloody tenet in blood againſt Chriſt, and gall againſt me, yet) if upon ſo ſlippery and narrow a paſſage, I have ſlipt into any term or expreſſion unbeſeeming his perſon, or the cauſe of the Moſt High in hand, I humbly crave pardon of God, and Mr. Cotton alſo." And though he could not ſay the like of the chief teachers among the Quakers, yet he ſaid, "Many truly humble ſouls may be captivated among them.—And many of the Quakers I love and honor." And he ſaid, "He that ſhall ponder the fathers polligamy, the beſt kings of Judah ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the high places, David's ſlaying Uriah, Aſia's impriſoning the prophet, Peter's raſh uſing the ſword, the diſciples calling for fire from Heaven, ſhall ſee cauſe to reprove the Quakers for their raſh damning of others from whom they have

In the cloſe of the year 1674, the family of Mr. James Rogers of New-London, called Mr. Crandal over from Weſterly, who preached among them, and baptized his ſons John and James, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian named Japheth.

<pb n="474" facs="unknown:015240_0485_0FA3729887D40B28"/>Jonathan Rogers was alſo baptized, and all four of them were received as members of their church, by prayer and laying on of hands. Hereupon John Rogers's father-in-law, took his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from him; and, upon her complaints againſt him, he was carried before their deputy governor, and committed to Hartford goal, from whence he wrote to Mr. Hubbard April 6, 1675. How long he continued there I do not find, only he viſited the church at Newport the next September. In September 18, 1676, thoſe four members went with a boat, and brought elder Hiſcox and Mr. Hubbard to New-London again, when old Mr. Rogers, his wife and daughter were all baptized and received into that church; whereupon they were called before the magiſtrate, but were ſoon releaſed; though from that time they began to impriſon the Rogers's for working on the firſt day of the week. And when Mr. Hiſcox and Mr. Hubbard viſited them again, and held worſhip with them two miles out of town on their ſabbath Nov. 23, 1677, and Joſeph Rogers's wife had next morning given them a ſatisfying account of her experiences, John muſt needs have them go up to town to baptize her there. Mr. Hubbard oppoſed it, but John carried the day; and while Mr. Hiſcox was preaching at town the conſtable came and took him, and they all went before the magiſtrate; where alſo was the miniſter, Mr. Bradſtreet, who had much to ſay, about the <hi>good way that their fathers had ſet up.</hi> Upon which Mr. Hubbard, obtaining leave to ſpeak, ſaid, "You are a young man, but I am an old planter of about forty years, a beginner of Connecticut, and have been perſecuted for my conſcience from this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and I can aſſure you, that the old beginners
<pb n="475" facs="unknown:015240_0486_0FA372D249282590"/>were not for perſecution, but we had liberty at firſt." After further diſcourſe the magiſtrate ſaid, <hi>Could you not do it elſe whore?</hi> "A good anſwer," ſays Mr. Hubbard; and ſo they were releaſed and went to Samuel Rogers's houſe, where his brother John put himſelf forward, prayed, and then went out to the water and baptized his ſiſter; upon which Mr. Hiſcox was ſeized again, as ſuppoſing he had done it, but John came before the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, and was forward to make known his act therein; ſo the others were releaſed and returned home.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN ROGERS, had married Naomi Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick, grand daughter, to Mr. Hubbard, and on March 2, 1678, elder Hiſcox baptized her at Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, together with James Babcock, George Lamphere, and two others; and on the 5th of May following Joſeph Clarke wrote from thence to his father Hubbard, that John and James Rogers with their father were in priſon; having previouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated Jonathan, chiefly becauſe he did not retain their judgment, of the unlawfulneſs of uſing medicines, nor accuſe himſelf before authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for working on the firſt day of the week." Hereupon the church at Newport, ſent meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to New-London about this matter, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I have always had a love to the intended purity, and unſpotted doctrine of New-England; for Mr. Cotton was of the ſame college and univerſity, of Emanuel in Cambridge, as I was, and ſo was Mr. Hooker and others with whom we were all contemporary; and I never knew them, but of a holy life and converſation. I alſo knew Colonel Humfrey, ſir Richard Saltonſtall and Mr. Peters, who were of note among you, and ſir Henry Vane, who all had ſome ſhare in the foundation of your government. But certainly the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were never to debar the truths of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and liberty of conſcience guided thereby; but to ſuppreſs ſin and idolatry, and prevent all the adulteries of Rome, to whom all things are lawful, eſpecially lies in hipocriſy, to promote their moſt damnable doctrines, coveteous ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and blaſphemous ſupremacy. It is great wiſdom to ſuppreſs ſin, but not oppreſs the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a good conſcience; and whilſt men grant liberty of conſcience not to admit liberty of ſin. All magiſtrates have not attained to this wiſdom, elſe England had been long ſince freed from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and perjury. Whatſoever is againſt the ten
<pb n="477" facs="unknown:015240_0488_0FA372D3D7222A38"/>commandments is ſin. Rom. 3, 20. 1. John 3, 4. and he that ſinneth in one point is guilty of all, becauſe he that ſpake one word of them ſpake all, and he added no more. Jam. 2, 10, 11. Exo. 20, 1. While Moſes and Solomon caution men, ſo much againſt adding to, or taking from Deut. 4, 2. Prov. 30, 5, 6, and ſo doth the beloved apoſtle, Rev. 22, 18, 19, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe that take away of thoſe ten words, or thoſe that make them void, and teach men ſo? Nay, they dare give the lie to JEHOVAH, and make Jeſus Chriſt not only a breaker of the law, but the very author of ſin in others, alſo cauſing them to break them. Hath not the little horn played his part luſtily in this, and worn out the ſaints of the Moſt High, ſo that they become little horn men alſo!

               <p>THE church repeatedly ſent and labored with them but to little effect. Mr. Gibſon went and lived and preached a while among them at New-London; but Mr. Hubbard wrote to their aged brother Thorton (who had removed from New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to Providence) on Nov. 8, 1679, informing him of his late viſit to that people, when he found that old Mr. Rogers, had the wheel of a loaded cart went over his leg a little below his knee, bruiſing it much, and had been ſo ſix weeks, but now could move it: their judgment is not to uſe any means." And ſaid he, "pray remember my reſpects to Mr. Roger Williams; I ſhould be glad to hear of him and his wife;" a great reſpect to whom was ſhewn in all their letters as long as he
<pb n="479" facs="unknown:015240_0490_0FA372D548ECFD08"/>lived. But on June 7, 1685, Mr. Hubbard wrote to Mr. Henry Reeve of Jamaica, and informed him that meſſengers were then gone from thier church to New-London, "to declare againſt two or more of them that were of us, who are declined to Quakeriſm, I might ſay more; of whom be thou aware, for by their principles, they will tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel by land and ſea to make diſciples, yea, ſorry ones too. Their names are John and James Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and one Donham."</p>
               <p>FROM this beginning proceeded a ſect which has continued to this day, who from their chief leader have been called ROGERENES. In their dialect, and many other things, they have been like the firſt Quakers in this country? though they have retained the external uſe of baptiſm and the ſupper, and have been ſingular in refuſing the uſe of means and medicines for their bodies. Their greateſt zeal has been diſcovered going from meeting to meeting, and from town to town, as far as Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich and Lebanon, (the one 14, the other 24 miles) to teſtify againſt hireling teachers, and againſt keeping the firſt day of the week as a ſabbath, which they call the idol-ſabbath. And when the authority have taken them up and fined them therefor, and have ſometimes whipt them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to pay it they have ſoon publiſhed accounts of all ſuch perſecutions, which has been the very means of keeping their ſect alive. When the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox was very terrible in Boſton, in 1721, and great fear of it was diſcovered in the country, John Rogers their founder, was confident he could go in where it was and not catch it; and to prove his faith, went 100 miles to Boſton, but catched the diſtemper, came home and died with it, and ſcattered it in his family: yet his ſucceſſors ſtill
<pb n="480" facs="unknown:015240_0491_0FA372D691966D18"/>kept on in their way. So late down as 1763, ſome of them repeatedly came and clapped ſhingles and pieces of boards together around the meeting-houſe in Norwich town, as well as delivered meſſages to the worſhippers, againſt their keeping of the Lord's day. But as the rulers had learned ſo much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as only to remove them away from diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others without inflicting either fine, or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment upon them, they have ceaſed from ſuch things ſince in a great meaſure, and as they never were a large ſociety, there is hope of a true reformation among them. Beſides theſe, there have been ſome ſabbatarian baptiſts in that place from the beginning to the preſent time, though not a diſtinct church.</p>
               <p>WE muſt now return to our baptiſt fathers at Boſton. The liberty they had enjoyed, with a bleſſing upon the miniſtry of Mr. Miles and others, had cauſed ſuch an increaſe of members, that in February 1677, they agreed to divide into two churches; but in January 1678, they revoked that act, and concluded to build them a meeting-houſe, in Boſton, and to defer the affair of dividing, till they could obtain the ſettlement of an able ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient miniſtry there. They firſt nominated Mr. Ruſſell for that end, and then talked of his going to Swanzey in Mr. Miles's room; but in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Mr. Miles returned to his old flock, and Mr. Ruſſell was ordained their paſtor in Boſton, July 28, 1679, and removed there. Before which time governor Leveret was deceaſed, and Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet choſen in his ſtead; in conſequence of which this church wrote to their brethren at Newport the 25th of January this year, that ſeveral of their brethren and ſiſters had been called to court, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, fined twenty ſhillings a piece, and to pay
<pb n="481" facs="unknown:015240_0492_0FA372D6D278E5A8"/>court charges, and others only admoniſhed and to pay court charges, which had not then been paid, and the conſtables were backward to make diſtreſs upon them if they could ſhift it off. Feb. 9, the church met, and purchaſed their meeting-houſe with the land it was built upon, of Philip Squire, and Ellis Callender, for 60<abbr>l.</abbr>; and they met in it for worſhip the 15th.

               <p>HOW different is this from the above language of governor Leete? But inſtead of ſeeking for porſecution as Rogers did, this peaceable people refrained from meeting in their own houſe for the preſent, waiting to ſee what God would do for them. And he who has the hearts of kings in his hand, moved their king to write to the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts rulers on July 24, requiring that <hi>liberty of conſcience</hi> ſhould be allowed to all proteſtants, ſo as they might not be diſcountenanced from ſharing in the government, much leſs that no ſuch good ſubjects of his, for not agreeing in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way, ſhould by law, "be ſubjected to <hi>fines</hi> or <hi>forfeitures,</hi> or other incapacities for the ſame; which is a ſeverity to be the more wondered at, whereas liberty of conſcience was made a principle motive for your firſt tranſportation into thoſe parts."<note n="*" place="bottom">Maſſ. hiſt. vol. 3, p. 520.</note> Deplorable indeed was their caſe at this time. Their all was in great danger, for doing ſo much of that which they thought Heaven frowned upon them for not doing more of; and it was evidently the two errors I have mentioned at the foot of p. 48, which brought them into this dilemma. Mr. William Hubbard, whom I have ſo often quoted, who was a miniſter at Ipſwich, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their election in Boſton May 3, 1676; and as the permiſſion of quaker meetings had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clard by many miniſters, to be one great cauſe of God's judgments then upon them, which had ſtirred up the court to ſeverity againſt that people, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave his mind to the contrary; and that pride and woridlymindedneſs were the greateſt evils then among them: yet leaſt governor Leveret and his court ſhould be too favorable to the baptiſts, he in his dedication of that ſermon to them, p. 6,
<pb n="483" facs="unknown:015240_0494_0FA372D848CAF230"/>ſaid, "If he were not much miſtaken who ſaid it is morally impoſſible to rivit the chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into the body of a nation without infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, by proportion it will as neceſſarily follow, that the neglect or difuſe thereof, will as directly tend to root it out." And Dr. Increaſe Mather, who yielded to Mr. Mitchel's reaſonings about the Maſſachuſetts miniſters after his death, he in that capacity now moved the aſſembly to convene, what they called <hi>The reforming ſynod.</hi> Firſt they kept a general faſt in their churches, and then the ſynod met at Boſton, Sept. 20, 1679, to anſwer theſe two queſtions. 1ſt. <hi>What are the evils that have provoked the Lord to bring his judgements on New-England?</hi> 2d. <hi>What is to be done, that ſo theſe evils may be reformed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY had not gone far in their anſwer before they ſaid, "men have ſet up their threſholds by God's threſholds, and their poſt "by his poſt. Quakers are falſe worſhippers; and ſuch <hi>anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> as have riſen up among us, in oppoſition to the churches of the Lord Jeſus, receiving into their ſociety, thoſe that have been for ſcandal delivered unto ſatan; yea, and improving thoſe as adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of holy things, who have been (as doth appear) juſtly under cenſure, do no better than ſet up altar againſt the Lord's altar. Wherefore it muſt needs be provoking to God, if theſe things be not duly and fully teſtifyed againſt, by every one in their ſeveral capacities." Their reſult was approved of by the general court on Oct. 15, who commended it to all their churches, "enjoining and requiring all perſons in their reſpective capacities to a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diligent reformation of all thoſe provoking evils mentioned therein, according to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof, that ſo the anger and diſpleaſure of

               <p>THIS dreadful charge, coming out from the whole power of the colony againſt one ſmall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, put them upon a critical review of their paſt conduct; and they found that among about eighty members that they had received, there were but two who had been cenſured in thoſe other churches (ſince Mr. Gould and Mr. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, of whom we have before ſpoken) one of whom was Mr. Thomas Foſter of Biderica who for turning and going away, when infants were ſprinkled, and for going at laſt and joining with the baptiſt, and refuſing, after they had preſented him to court, to return to the other church, was cenſure and excommunicated by them. The other was Mr. Farnum, who was the only one that the baptiſt had received, after others had caſt him out; which was from the north church in Boſton, where Mr. Mayo and Dr. Mather was mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The baptiſts now ſeat and obtained copies of the proceedings of that church againſt him, whereby it appeared, that they were in the height of their dealings with him, the ſame month that the aſſembly disfranchiſed Gould and Oſborne for conſtituting that baptiſt church, viz. in October 1665; and that Farnum got his temper up, and in ſundry inſtances ſpake and acted very unadviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly;
<pb n="485" facs="unknown:015240_0496_0FA372D9C9C63280"/>for which the baptiſt now required him to offer ſatisfaction to that church, before they would commune with him again. This he ſoon after did. Mr. Willard owns that he offered a confeſſion therefor both orally and in writing; but becauſe he refuſed to return into their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion they judged it not to be ſincere. The baptiſts ſay that ſome who had been baptized among them had afterward been refuſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by the other churches, when they had deſired it. To which Mr. Willard ſays, "They know that our churches have received ſome that were <hi>ſcrupelous</hi> about infant baptiſm, who were willing to carry inoffenſively: that we have refuſed ſuch as were re-baptized among thoſe excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate anabaptiſts, is true hypothetically, viz. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they would acknowledge and repent of <hi>that act;</hi> becauſe <hi>we judge</hi> it ſcandalous."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ruſſell, p. 10.

               <p>IN primum, that whereas the only wiſe God, having by his providence led us into that order and way of the goſpel of gathering into church fellowſhip, we do hereby confeſs, that what we did was not out of oppoſition to, or contempt of the churches of Chriſt in New-England, but in a holy imitation meerly for the better enjoyment of the liberty of our conſciences, the great motive to their removal at firſt into this wilderneſs 2.

As therefore the two tribes and half did humbly and meekly vindicate themſelves, upon the erecting of their altar, when challanged for it by Eleazer, and the meſſengers of the ten tribes, ſo do we hereby confeſs in like manner, that we have not deſigned by this act any contempt of authority, nor any departing from the living God, or churches of his worſhip, <hi>the Lord God of gods he knows it,</hi> Joſhua xxii, 22. Though it be our lot, with the apoſtles, in the way that ſome call hereſy ſo to worſhip the God of our fathers. Your petitioners therefore, having no deſign againſt the peace of this place, but being ſtill as ready as ever to hazard our lives for the defence of the people of God here, do humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that this our profeſſion and declaration may find acceptance with this honorable court, as that of the two tribes did with Eleazer; and that we may ſtill, through your allowance and protection, enjoy the liberty of God's worſhip, in ſuch places as God hath afforded us, which will greatly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige your petitioners, as in duty bound, humbly to pray.</p>

<pb n="489" facs="unknown:015240_0500_0FA3729AC78EB140"/>doors, putting a paper thereon which ſaid, "All perſons are to take notice, that by order of the court the doors of this houſe are ſhut up, and that they are inhibited to hold any meeting therein, or to open the doors thereof, without licenſe from authority, till the general court take further order, as they will anſwer the contrary at their peril.</p>

               <p>THE Baptiſts required a copy of the Marſhal's warrant, but he refuſed it; they then went to the ſecretary for one, who plainly told them, "he was not to let them have any." They met the next Lord's-day in their yard, and in the week enſuing prepared a ſhed therein for the purpoſe; but when they came together the ſecond Lord's-day, they found the doors open; and conſidering ſay they, "that the court had not done it legally, and that we were denied a copy of the conſtables order and Marſhal's warrant, we concluded to go into our houſe, it being our own, having a civil right to it." And they met therein till the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſat, before whom they were convented on May 11. When they gave in theſe pleas, "1. The houſe was our own, 2.

What was ſaid in anſwer thereto, we ſhall ſee preſently, after I have obſerved, that elder Ruſſell was taken from his beloved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN 1681, a miniſter of the church in Boſton, which was formed in a ſchiſmatical way, in 1669, publiſhed an anſwer to the Baptiſt's narrative; and though it's author was deceaſed, yet he intitled it, "<hi>Ne ſutor ultra crepidam:</hi>

To which he adds as a motto, Rom. 16, 17, 18. Dr. Increaſe Mather, wrote a preface to this work, wherein he ſays, "Many are of the mind, that it is not worth the while, to take notice of what is emitted, by men ſo obſcure and inconſiderable.—It ſeems to me, that the reverend author of the following animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, hath ſhewed much humility, in conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to take perſons in hand, between whom and himſelf there is ſuch an <hi>impar congreſſus.</hi>—As for the brethren, that have thought good to prefix an epiſtle to ſuch a narrative, and therein declare, that moleſtation is given and ſeverity is exerciſed towards antipedobaptiſts in New-England, meerly for a ſuppoſed error about the ſubject of baptiſm,

               <p>BUT, ſearch through all they have ſaid againſt thoſe people, and I am confident that the greateſt real diſorder they have produced, was the churches receiving Farnum as they did; which when they had proper knowledge of, they rectified. But is this comparable to the diſorders at Hingham, 20 years before: Where Lieut. Eames was regularly choſen their captain, and preſented to the court for a commiſſion; but ſoon upon it, a notion was ſtarted to chooſe another man, related to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, into that office, who accordingly was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and preſented. And when the reaſon of it was aſked for, they ſaid Eames had reſigned; but he ſaid he had not. Hereupon the miniſter cenſured him for lying; and this coſt three or four days tedious labors of a council, without being able to ſettle it; and occaſioned the petition of Dr. Child and others, with much trouble to governor Winthrop and the aſſembly. Seep. 139, 140. Yet the iſſue of all was, that the miniſter of Hingham excommunicated captain Eames, contrary to the
<pb n="495" facs="unknown:015240_0506_0FA3729F4A4DB5E8"/>minds of other miniſters, and by their advice, "Thoſe that were without juſt cauſe caſt out at Hingham, were received into the church of Weymouth, the next town, and the matter ſo continued through the <hi>ſtifneſs</hi> of their minds, and their <hi>ſelfwilled reſolutions.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>IN the piece upon infant baptiſm, which Dr. Mather had publiſhed, he accuſed thoſe baptiſts of the ſin of Jeroboam, who made prieſts of the <hi>loweſt of the people;</hi> in which ſays Mr. Ruſſell, "we eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand" what he means; our evil in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, is our calling to office thoſe who have not been bread up in colleges, and taught in other languages, but have been bread to other callings. It is not becauſe we are againſt learning, for we eſteem it, and honor it in its place; and if we had ſuch among us and that they were together with that, otherways duly qualified for the work of the miniſtry, we ſhould readily chuſe them. But we do not think the ſpirit of God is locked up ſo in the narrow limits of college learning, that none are to be called to office in a church but ſuch, nor that all ſuch are fit for that work, be they never ſo great ſchollars; neither do we think that all thoſe who have not that learning, are to be accounted the loweſt of the people. Indeed the prieſthood was bounded to the tribe of Levi by divine inſtitution, but we cannot find that the Lord hath, by divine inſtitution, given the work of the miniſtry to men of ſuch learning only. Whom he will he fits and quallifies for that work; neither are we left without a plain rule in the new

               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, the baptiſts had ſaid in their confeſſion of faith, that thoſe who gladly receive the word and are baptized, are ſaints by calling, and fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a viſible church.

Far be it from us to judge all that are not baptized, not to be viſible ſaints, for we judge that the Lord hath many precious people in the world that are not baptized, according to, or in the manner we bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize; and further we judge they ſhould be viſible

               <p>MR. Hubbard got the moſt out of temper upon this occaſion that he ever did in a whole volume in folio, and ſaid, "one John Ruſſell, a wedder-drop'd ſhoe-maker—ſtiched up a ſmall phamphet,
<pb n="498" facs="unknown:015240_0509_0FA372A18ADCBB30"/>wherein he endeavors to clear the innocency of thoſe, commonly (though falſly he ſays) called anabaptiſts. Surely he was not well aware of the old adage, <hi>Ne ſutor ultra crepidam,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">It was truly of ſome age; for after James I. had preached in the ſtar-chamber, "That the myſtery of the King's power, is not lawful to be diſputed; for that is to wade into the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of princes, and to take away the Myſtical reverence that belongs to thoſe who ſit in the THRONE OF GOD.—It is atheiſm and blaſphemy to diſpute what God can do—So is it preſumption and high contempt in a ſubject to diſpute what a King can do or ſay:" He, the year after our fathers firſt came to Plymouth, repremanded his parliament for petitioning againſt his taking a Popiſh wiſe for his ſon Charles, and ſaid, "A ſmall miſtaking of matters of this nature, may produce more effects than can be imagined: therefore, <hi>Ne ſutor ultra crepidam.</hi>" Rapin, vol. 2, p. 192, 211.</note> or elſe he would not have made ſuch botching work."—And goes on to recite what you may ſee of the <hi>ſimple cobler,</hi> in p, 183, 184, which he calls <hi>honeſt ſtitches uſed to much better purpoſe.</hi> But having taken the old round to Germany, he recovers his ſenſes again, and then ſays, "To return to what was in hand, and give this goſpel ordered church (as John Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell terms them) what is their due, from an hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian; as for the perſons of thoſe ſeven [firſt males of the church] he apologizes for, it may be more eaſily granted that they were good in the main, than that it was a good work for God, they were engaged in—Good men may be found to be ill employed; as Peter was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Chriſt rebukes and calls ſatan, and bids him get behind him.

               <p>I LOVE to ſee honeſty if perſons are erronious; for then we have an advantage to judge for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to know the better how to deal with them. And I muſt ſay that governor Winthrop, from whom Mr. Hubbard took many things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in that noble quality; and that Mr. H. exceeded all the hiſtorians I have ſeen who have copied from him, except the pious Mr. Prince. Others have often given us hard names without explaining what they ment by them; but Mr. Hubbard plainly tells us ſoon after Mr. Cotton's arrival at Boſton, that the miniſters, "uſed to meet once a fortnight at one of their houſes in courſe, where ſome queſtion of momeant was debated: Mr. Skilton, paſtor of Salem, and Mr. Williams (as yet not ordained an officer there) out of <hi>a rigid ſeperation-jealouſy,</hi> took exception at; prognoſticating that it might in time bring forth a preſbytery, or ſuperintendancy, to the prejudice of the churches liberties. (A ſpirit of rigid ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration had it ſeems ſo early fly-blown their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings) —the venum of which ſpirit had ſoon after infected ſo many of that church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Salem, as will appear in the next chapter. But this fear was without cauſe; nor did it ſpring from a godly jealouſy, but from the bitter root of
<pb n="500" facs="unknown:015240_0511_0FA372A3092C4828"/>pride, that venteth itſelf above order, and againſt love and peace. No ſuch ſpirit was ever obſerved to appear in Mr. Cotton's days, but a ſpirit of love and meekneſs, nor ſince his time, to the preſent year." And though the author of the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts hiſtory, approves of Mr. William's opinion about liberty of conſcience, and fixes upon his moving Mr. Endicot to cut the croſs out of the training colours, as the beſt plea he could make for their baniſhing of him; yet Mr. Hubbard honeſtly ſays, "This eſſay did but tick at ſome of the upper branches, whereas Mr. Williams laid his <hi>ax at the very root of the magiſterial power in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the firſt table,</hi> which he drove on at ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now if the reader will look back to p. 156—175, and compare that with their actings down to this time, he will have a fair opportunity to know the meaning of the terms, rigid-ſeparation, turbulent anabaptiſts, giddy ſectaries, &amp;c. as they were often uſed by that party.</p>
               <p>MR. Williams cloſed his ſecond plea for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty, with an addreſs to the popiſh, prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical preſbyterian and independant clergy of the whole kingdom, wherein he makes uſe of the "fable or ſimilitude of a wolf and a poor lamb coming down to drink at the ſame ſtream toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the wolf cruel and ſtrong drinks above and aloft; the lamb innocent and weak, drinks upon the ſtream below: the wolf queſtions and quarrels the lamb for corrupting and defiling the waters: the lamb (not daring to plead how eaſily the wolf drinking higher might transfer defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment downward, but) pleads improbability and
<pb n="501" facs="unknown:015240_0512_0FA372A41FDB3660"/>impoſſibility, that the waters deſcending could convey defilement upwards: this is the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, this the plea: but who ſhall judge? Be the lamb never ſo innocent, his plea never ſo juſt, his adverſary the wolf, will be his judge, and being ſo cruel and ſo ſtrong, ſoon tears the lamb in pieces. Thus the cruel <hi>beaſt,</hi> armed with the <hi>power of the kings.</hi> Rev. 17, fits judge in his own quarrels againſt the lamb, about the drinking at the waters. And thus (ſaith Mr. Cotton) the judgment ought to paſs upon the heretic, not for matter of conſcience but for ſinning againſt his conſcience."</p>
               <p>"OBJECTION, methinks I hear, the great charge againſt the independent party to be great pleaders for liberty of conſcience, &amp;c.

               <p>TOWARD the cloſe of this year Mr. Miles came again and miniſtered a while to his brethren in Boſton. And Mr. Sprague, who in thoſe times joined to the baptiſt church in Providence, in writing to the Maſſachuſetts many years afters ſays, "Why do you ſtrive to perſuade the riſing generation, that you never perſecuted nor hurt the baptiſts, which is ſo apparantly falſe?—Did you not barbarouſly ſcourge Mr. Baker in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, the chief mate of a London ſhip? where alſo you impriſoned Mr. Thomas Gould, John Ruſſell and Benjamin Sweetſer, and many others, and fined them 50<abbr>l.</abbr> a man.—And did you not nail up the baptiſt meeting-houſe doors, and fine Mr. John Miles, Mr. James Brown and Mr. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Tanner?" &amp;c. I find alſo that a number of people from Kittery on Piſcataqua river, in the province of Maine, were baptized this year, and in the beginning of the next ſent their moſt gifted brother to Boſton with a letter of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and requeſt; in conſequence of which the church there wrote thus on Jan. 11, 1682. "To all whom it may concern; theſe are to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, that our beloved brother William Screven is a member in communion with us, and having had trial of his gifts among us, and finding

               <p>BUT no ſooner was this deſign heard of in their town, than Mr. Woodbridge the miniſter, and Hucke the magiſtrate began to beſtir themſelves, and not only ſpread the ſlanders we have heard ſo much of againſt the baptiſts at Boſton, but the magiſtrate repeatedly ſummoned thoſe people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him who had been to the baptiſt meetings, and threatened them with a fine of five ſhillings for every ſuch offence for the future. On Jan. 23, he convented Humphrey Churchwood, a baptized member of Boſton church, before him, where was the ſaid miniſter, who after caſting thoſe old ſtories upon him, ſaid, "Behold your great doctor, Mr. Miles of Swanzey, for he now leaves his profeſſion and is come away, and will not teach his people any more, becauſe he is like to periſh for want, and his gathered church and people will not help him." Churchwood told them it was a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth; and directly wrote to Boſton upon it, which letter is now before me. Several others from that place were baptized ſoon after, but to
<pb n="504" facs="unknown:015240_0515_0FA372A60A858AE0"/>hinder their proceedings, their general court took the matter in hand as follows, viz.</p>
               <p>"WILLIAM SCREVEN, appearing before this court, and being convicted of the contempt of his majeſty's authority, and refuſing to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſentence of the court, prohibiting his public preaching, and upon examination before the court, declaring his reſolution ſtill to perſiſt therein, the court tendered him liberty to return home to his family; in caſe he would forbear ſuch turbulent practices and amend for the future; but he refuſing, the court ſentanced him to give bond for his good behaviour, and to forbear ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious behaviour for the future, and the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to ſtand committed untill the judgment of this court be fulfilled.</p>

               <p>To this is added a copy of the ſame date by the ſame hand, of an act of their executive court which ſays, "This court having conſidered the offenſive ſpeeches of William Screven, viz. his raſh and inconſiderate words tending to blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my do adjudge the delinquent, for his offence to pay ten pounds into the treaſury of the county or province.

But he was ſo far from yielding to ſuch ſentences, that on Sept. 13, he with the reſt ſent a requeſt to Boſton that elder Hull and others might viſit and form them into a church, which was granted, ſo that a covenant was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſigned on Sept. 25, 1682, by William Screven, elder, Humphrey Churchwood, deacon, Robert Williams, John Morgandy, Richard Cutt, Timothy Davis, Leonard Drown, William Adams, Humphrey Azell, and George Litten, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſiſters. A baptiſt church was alſo formed this year from that of Boſton, at Newbury, by William and John Sayer, Benjamin Morſe, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Woodman and others, to whom I find elder Hull and elder Emblen writing as a ſiſter church, on March 25, 1689; though how much longer they continued a diſtinct church I do not find.</p>
               <p>MR. Philip Edes, a member of the firſt baptiſt church in Newport, died this year on March, 16, of whom Mr. Samuel Hubbard ſays in a letter to governor Leete, "This friend of yours and mine, one in office in OLIVER's houſe, was for liberty of conſcience; a merchant, a precious man, of a holy life and converſation, beloved of all ſorts of men, his death much bewailed by all." Mr. Thomas Oleny, ſenior, alſo died this year. He was next to Mr. Williams in the paſtoral office at Providence, and continued ſo to his death, over that part of the church who were called five prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal baptiſts, in diſtinction from thoſe who part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their brethren about the year 1653, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leading of elder Wickenden, holding to the <hi>laying on of hands</hi> upon every church member. The greateſt fault that I find Mr. Olney charged with is, that he was for extending the firſt deed of Providence up to the head of the two great
<pb n="506" facs="unknown:015240_0517_0FA372A78904A7A0"/>rivers it lay between, or at leaſt as far as their charter reached, from the words <hi>without limits,</hi> in p. 90. In this he was oppoſed by our elders, Wickenden and Dexter, the latter of whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that Mr Williams ſaid, the only intent of the expreſſion was to prevent the Indians hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their cattle if they wandered far into the woods. Their writings on both ſides are yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in their town-clerks office. They tell me at Swanzey that elder Miles permitted Mr. Brown's wife, who was not a baptiſt, to commune with their church, till by elder Olney's influence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The learned and pious Mr. Miles having return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his flock in Swanzey, fell aſleep in Jeſus on Feb. 3, 1683; and his memory is ſtill precious among us. We are told that being once brought before the magiſtrates he requeſted a bible, and upon obtaining it he turned to thoſe words, <hi>ye ſhould ſay, Why perſecute we him, ſeeing the root of the matter is found in me.</hi> Job 19, 28. which having read he ſat down; and the word had a good effect upon their minds, and moved them to treat him with moderation if not kindneſs. His ſon went
<pb n="507" facs="unknown:015240_0518_0FA372A8495A35F8"/>back to England, and his grandſon Mr. Samuel Miles was an epiſcopal miniſter at our Boſton in 1724. Though Mr. Willard, and the Magnalia from him, accuſed the baptiſts of Boſton, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating becauſe they wanted to be teachers, yet that was ſo far from truth, that on June 27, 1681, they wrote to London for a miniſter, giving this as one reaſon for it that, "our miniſter is very aged and feeble, and often incapable of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial work;" and as another motive they ſay, "We conceive there is a proſpect of good encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment for an able man to come over, in that there ſeems to be an apparant and general apoſtacy among the churches who have profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves congregational in this land; whereby many have their eyes opened, by ſeeing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clention and confuſion that is among them." A kind anſwer hereto was retured by eleven baptiſt minſters, which is before me.</p>
               <p>AND now as ſome ſingular and curious things are generally expected from a new country, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the cloſing part of one of the greateſt curioſities I have met with in modern hiſtory; the ſum whereof is this. A large number of people fled out of the old world into this wilderneſs for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liberty; but had not been here long before ſome put in high claims for power, under the name of orthodoxy; to whom others made fierce oppoſition profeſſedly from the light within; and their claſhings were ſo great that ſeveral lives were loſt in the fray. This made a terrible noiſe on the other ſide of the water. But as ſelf-defence is a natural principal, each party wrote volume after volume to clear themſelves from blame; and they both conſpired to caſt a great part of it upon one ſingular man, whom they called a weather cock,
<pb n="508" facs="unknown:015240_0519_0FA372F909F52608"/>and a wind-mill. Now let the curious find out if they can, Firſt, how men of univerſity-learning, or of divine inſpiration, came to write great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes againſt a wind-mill and a weather-cock? Secondly, how ſuch a ſtrange creature came to be an over-match for them all, and to carry his point againſt the arts of pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, how he and his ruined friends came to lie under thoſe reproaches for a hundred years, and yet that their plan ſhould then be adopted by thirteen colonies, to whom theſe diſpiſed people could afford SENATORS of principal note, as well as COMMANDERS by ſea and land? The excellency of this ſcene above thoſe which many are bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, conſiſts in its being founded upon facts and not fictions; being not the creature of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered brains, but of an unerring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to Mr. Williams's own teſtimony, (p. 143) his ſoul was renewed by divine grace when he was not more than ten or twelve years old. And the myſtery of his being rigidly ſet in his way, and yet <hi>given to change,</hi> is to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus. Neither frowns nor flatteries could move him to part with what he judged to be truth, or to aſſent to any thing contrary thereto. As he ſcrupled the exactneſs of the kalender then in uſe, ſo he diſcovered it in all his dates. Even when dedicating his quaker diſpute to the King, he dated it March 10, 1672, 3, <hi>(ut vulgo.)</hi> On the other hand he was ever ready to change, when
<pb n="509" facs="unknown:015240_0520_0FA372A9CA7041A8"/>he could obtain light for it from any quarter. While he miniſtered to his brethren at Plymouth, he objected againſt their cuſtom of giving their neighbours the tittle of <hi>goodman,</hi> if they were not judged to be godly perſons. When governor Winthrop paid them a viſit in 1632, (p, 56,) and his advice was aſked upon it, he ſhewed them that they ought to diſtinguiſh betwixt theological and moral goodneſs, and obſerved that when trials by jury was firſt introduced in England, after the names of fit perſons for the purpoſe were called over, the crier called them to attend, <hi>good men and true,</hi> from whence proceeded the cuſtom then in queſtion; and he thought it a pity to make a ſtir about a cuſtom ſo innocently intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.<note n="*" place="bottom">Magnalia, b. 2, p. 14.</note> Mr. Williams readily embraced this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and made a very good uſe of it afterward, in expoſing the miſchiefs that aroſe from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of thoſe two ſorts of goodneſs together, as Mr. Cotton and many others had done. And becauſe he was earneſtly looking for a better church-eſtabliſhment than he had then ſeen, they impoſed the name of <hi>ſeeker</hi> upon him. The great Mr. Baxter calls him <hi>The father of the ſeekers in London.</hi>

               <p>AND as to his later ſervices, he was ſo far from being meanly hired, as they ſaid, <hi>for a piece of bread,</hi> to write againſt the quakers, that after he had done it, he wrote thus to Newport. "My dear friend Samuel Hubbard, to yourſelf and aged companion my loving reſpects in the Lord Jeſus, who ought to be our hope of glory, begun in this life and enjoyed to all eternity.

               <p>IF the reader reviews Dr. Chamberlain's firſt letter, and is informed that he with his brethren he wrote to, took the whole of the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments to be moral and immutable, and held that it was the little horn that <hi>changed the time</hi> from the ſeventh to the firſt day: but that Mr. Olney and his church obſerved to their brethren, that Paul ſpeaks of a <hi>glory which was done away</hi> that was <hi>written and engraven in ſtones,</hi> 2 Cor. 3, 7, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this letter, he will then have a plain idea of the nature of that controverſy on both ſides, as it was managed in that day. And to go on; it is to be remembered, that ſome perſons in different parts of that colony had ſuch a conceit of liberty, as that officers ſhould manage the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without any reward from them; by which means Mr. Clarke received but part of his pay for procuring their charter as long as he lived; and occaſioned a remonſtrance from his executors to the aſſembly upon it ſoon after his death.

To juſtify or excuſe their making the law againſt the baptiſts in 1644, Mr. Hubbard ſaid, "It were well if thoſe who cannot comply with the religion of the ſtate or place where they live, yet had ſo much <hi>manners</hi> as not to juſtle againſt, nor openly practice that that is inconſiſtant therewith, as if they would bid a kind of defiance thereunto.

We have ſeen how Dr. Mather treated the characters of the baptiſts; now a letter is forged in his name, full of <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>treaſonable</hi> expreſſions, which being pretendedly detected in its way to Holland, was laid before the Britiſh miniſtry, and then was printed and ſpread through the nation to expoſe him. When he came to know it he ſaid, "That which troubled me was, that I was like to ſuffer as an evil-doer, through the malice and falſhood of wicked men. Might I have ſuffered for any truth

Andros carried his epiſcopal worſhip into Mr. Williard's meeting-houſe, after their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe was over, and threatened, "To ſhut up their doors if he was refuſed, and to puniſh any man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Do not theſe things verify the truth of the chriſtian reveration?

For an uppermoſt party of chriſtians, to puniſh men, it then temporal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, becauſe in ſome religious opinions they diſſent from them, or with an excluſion from the temporal enjoyments, which would juſtly belong unto them, is a <hi>robbery.</hi>

               <p>HIS ſon Eliſha had joined to that church the 10th of Auguſt preceeding, and he gave him an education at Cambridge; and Dr. Increaſe Mather
<pb n="523" facs="unknown:015240_0534_0FA372B5C9342F98"/>having ſignified his willingneſs for ſuch a thing, the church called him, his ſon, and Mr. John Webb to aſſiſt in ordaining the ſaid Mr. Eliſha Callender then paſtor on May 21, 1718; and in the preface to that ordination Sermon, the old gentlemen ſays, "It was a grateful ſurpriſe to me, when ſeveral of the brethren of the antipedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt perſuaſion came to me, deſiring that I would give them the right-hand of fellowſhip in ordaining one whom they had choſen to be their paſtor. I did (as I believe it was my duty) readily conſent to what they propoſed: conſidering the young man to be ordained is ſerious and pious, and of a candid ſpirit, and has been educated in the college at Cambridge; and that all of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of that church with whom I have any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance (I hope the like concerning others of them) are in the judgment of rational charity god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons." Two of whom were old elder Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender and deacon Sweeſter, who were principal members when their meeting-houſe was formerly nailed up. Dr. Cotton Mather preached the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which he intitled <hi>Good men united.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opening the nature and importance of ſuch a union he ſays, "It is very ſadly true, that many eccleſiaſtical communities, wherein <hi>piety</hi> has its votaries, yet are guilty of this evil, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe terms of communion which many that have the fear of God, are by juſt exceptions kept from complying withal.

               <p>I SHALL cloſe this chapter with a liſt of New-England rulers, and a few remarks thereon. Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth never had any charter but only from the council for New-England that was eſtabliſhed at Plymouth in Dovenſhire. Their form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſettled by voluntary agreement among themſelves. At firſt they only choſe a governor; the next year, one aſſiſtant with him; in 1624, they choſe five, and in 1633, ſeven aſſiſtants, and kept to that number to the end of their colony. Mr. Bradford was always an aſſiſtant when he was not governor, as long as he lived: his ſon was aſſiſtant and then deputy governor till the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he and ſeveral of his poſterity have been counſellors in this province; and one of his deſcendants is now deputy governor of the ſtate of Rhode-Iſland. In 1639, they began to have a houſe of deputies in their general court; and about 1662, they agreed that their eldeſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhould have the power of a deputy governor, to act in the governor's place when he was abſent. This continued till 1680, when by reaſon of Mr. Alden's age, though they continued him an aſſiſtant, they began to chooſe other deputy governors.</p>

And they then appointed Mr. CODDINGTON as judge, and Mr. Aſpinwall ſecret'y, to rule them according to this covenant; till on Jan 2, 1639, an aſſembly of the freemen ſaid, "By the conſent of the body it is agreed, that ſuch who ſhall be choſen to the place of <hi>Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> they are to aſſiſt the judge in the execution of juſtice and judgment, for the regulating and ordering of all offences and offenders, and for the drawing up and determining of all ſuch rules and laws as ſhall be according to God, which may conduce to the good and welfare of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal; and to them is committed by the body the whole care and charge of all the affairs thereof; and that the judge together with the elders, ſhall rule and govern according to the general rules of the word of God, when they have no particular rule from God's word, by the body preſcribed as a direction unto them in the caſe. And further it is agreed and conſented unto, that the judge and elders ſhall be accountable unto the body once every quarter of the year, (when as the body ſhall be aſſembled) of all ſuch caſes, actions or rules which have paſſed through their hands, by them to be ſcanned and weighed by the word of Chriſt; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Plymouth had this liberty in its full extent: hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full power to lay the plan of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they pleaſed, and to elect whom they would into office. Each freeman in that colony had their equal vote in the annual choice of their governor; and had not governor Bradford requeſted them ſometimes to elect others into that office, it is probable that in the whole 73 years of their continuance as a diſtinct colony, they would never have changed it into any more hands than death obliged them to; and in fact they never did but five times in all thoſe years; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

And the Maſſachuſetts choſe but eight governors in 63 years. But ſince this fickle popularity (as ſome call ſuch government) was taken away, and the power was veſted in a crowned head, to fix, governors over us by a ſteady commiſſion, in which the people had no voice, the province in 82 years has had a Phips, Stoughton, Bellamont, Dudley, Tailor, Shute, Dummer, Burnet, Belcher,

All theſe in a ſpace when Connecticut had but about half ſo many governors, and in 34 years of the time Rhode-Iſland had but two.

And the ſecond time Mr. Winſlow was governor he wrote to Mr. Williams to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of that juriſdiction, p. 72, and a law was made that year to forbid the gathering of any church therein without the rulers leave. He and Mr. Colliar were the commiſſioners for Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth who on Sept. 7, 1643, ſigned the articles of confederation that the other three colonies had entered into the May before; and who then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in the delivery of Miantinomo to Uncas to be ſlain (though without torture) and in adviſing the Maſſachuſetts to ſend an armed force to War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick. He was again a commiſſioner in their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Hartford Sept. 1, 1644, when they wrote to each colony, to enter upon a method of <hi>rating all perſons by authority,</hi> that refuſed or neglected to give what the rulers judged to be their meet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion toward <hi>miniſters maintenance;</hi> againſt which Mr. John Brown, the other Plymouth commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, entered his diſſent.

But Mr. Winſlow had influence enough to prevent the putting of that matter to vote. When the commiſſioners
<pb n="537" facs="unknown:015240_0548_0FA372C049C43E80"/>met at New-Haven Sept. 9, 1646, they ſaid, "up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on information of what petitions have been lately put up in ſome of the colonies againſt the good and ſtraight ways of Chriſt, both in the churches and in the common-wealth, the commiſſioners, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering that theſe colonies, for themſelves and their poſterity, did unite into this form of perpetual league, as for other reſpects, ſo for mutual advice, that the truth and liberties of the goſpel might be preſerved and perpetuated, thought it their duty ſeriouſly to commend it to the care and juriſdiction of each general court within theſe united colonies, that as they have laid their foundations and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the houſe of God, the worſhip and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, by the rod God hath put into their hands, ſo they would walk on and build up (all diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agements and difficulties notwithſtanding) with an undaunted heart and unwearied hand, according to the ſure rules and patterns—That anabaptiſm, familiſm, antinomianiſm, and generally all errors of like nature, which oppoſe, undermine and ſlight either the ſcriptures, the ſabbath or other ordinances of God and bring in and cry up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable revelations, <hi>inventions of men,</hi> or any <hi>carnal liberty,</hi> under a deceitful colour of <hi>liberty of conſcience,</hi> may be ſeaſonably and duly ſuppreſt; though they wiſh as much forbearance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect may be had of tender conſciences, ſeeking light, as may ſtand with the purity of religion and peace of the churches."

               <p>MR. Winſlow was then gone to England, from whence he never returned; and not having his
<pb n="538" facs="unknown:015240_0549_0FA372C10ABAAC70"/>influence, all the miniſters in Plymouth colony, and the Maſſachuſetts court to help them, could not prevail in 1650, with governor Bradford, and his court, to inflict ſo much as a fine upon Mr. Holmes; who was moſt cruelly whipt at Boſton the next year, p. 213, &amp;c. Said miniſters were not of the original planters of Plymouth colony, and becauſe their court would not be governed by them, the moſt of them left it, and carried their complaints to Boſton, from whence freſh exertions were made, which then in a meaſure introduced a <hi>ſtate-worſhip,</hi> and <hi>ſtate-ways of maintenance</hi> into Plymouth colony. Though the <hi>bloody work</hi> that followed at Boſton, gave ſuch a ſhock to it as turned them back again in a great meaſure. Mr. John Brown had been a magiſtrate 17 years, and a commiſſioner for his colony 11 years, even down to 1656. And we are told that he was, "well accompliſhed with abilities both civil and religious, and attained, through grace, unto a comfortable perſuaſion of the love and favour of God to him; he falling ſick of a fever, with much ſerenity and ſpiritual comfort fell aſleep in the Lord, at Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namoiſet near Rehoboth, in the ſpring of the year 1662."<note n="*" place="bottom">Marton, p. 175, 176.</note> His ſon James joined the next year in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming a baptiſt church there, and both in 1665, and 1666, the freemen through the colony elected him for one of their magiſtrates, at the ſame time that the Maſſachuſetts court disfranchiſed two of their ancient freemen, for no worſe crime than Mr. Brown then lived in. And though he did not ſee cauſe then to accept of that office, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen again in 1673, he accepted it, and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his colony therein eleven years; in the midſt of which time perſecution was again revived at Boſton, and Mr. Brown and his miniſter were
<pb n="539" facs="unknown:015240_0550_0FA372C1CA68CF68"/>fined for viſiting their afflicted brethren there. With what face then can any man reproach New-England in general, with the perſecutions which its firſt founders, and many of its beſt members afterward abhorred! And of all men how inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable are epiſcopalians in ſo doing, when it was the errors the Maſſachuſetts brought out of their church that produced all thoſe miſchiefs, of which they were then, and have been ever ſince, much more guilty than thoſe they complain of here! In England and Scotland they in that day deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more hundreds of lives, in trying to eſtabliſh their <hi>ſupremacy over the conſciences of men,</hi> than the Maſſachuſetts hanged perſons. And they have not only always taxed diſſenters to their miniſters wherever they could get power to do it, but alſo in Virginia they have ſined and impriſoned our miniſters only for preaching without their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; and continued this cruel trade till the preſent rapture put a ſtop to it. 3. Hence ſee the pernicious evil of uſing carnal weapons in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious affairs. Papiſts, epiſcopalians, preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and congregationaliſts have all tried it in their turns; but inſtead of giving up the root of this miſchief, they have each of them tried to caſt all the reproach of it, upon the bad diſpoſitions of their neighbours; and ſo it has been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſource of raillarly and ſlander. But where can a better ſet of men be found upon earth, ſince Conſtantine firſt brought the carnal weapon into the church, who concured in uſing of it there, than the fathers of the Maſſachuſetts? Look back to p. 138—141, and then tell me where you can find a more excellent ruler than governor Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp, that ever travelled in that path?

But the valiant of the Lord waited with patience, and in the miſs of beer, ſupplied themſelves with water; even the moſt honored as well as others, contentedly rejoicing in a cup of cold water; bleſſing the Lord that had given them to taſte of that living water, and that they had not the water that ſlakes the thirſt of their natural bodies, given

            <p>FOUR principles have, in different ages and countries, been propoſed to found govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon, viz. nature, grace, power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact. James the firſt took much pains to perſuade his people, that he was born to rule them; even ſo that the privileges he was pleaſed to allow them, were rather favours from him, than original rights in them. And his flattering courtiers, perceiving his humor, gave him the title of <hi>ſacred majeſty,</hi> which the kingdom was very little acquainted with before. His high claims occaſioned perpetual troubles to himſelf, and coſt his ſon his crown and the head that wore it. And when facts are examined it appears, that Henry VII, from whom came their hereditary title, had as little right by birch to the crown of England, as any man that had worn it in 500 years; and he made his way to it thro' blood and ſlaughter,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rapin, vol. 2, p. 160, 161.</note> The Pope has been the moſt notable advocate for founding dominion in grace; and by <hi>deceitful reaſonings</hi> from the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh <hi>hand-writing,</hi> he has uſurped the ſeat of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

But the hiſtory of all ages and nations ſhews, that when men have got the power into their hands, they often uſe it to gratify their own luſts, and recur to nature, religion or the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution (as they think will beſt ſerve) to carry and yet cover their wretched deſigns; a lamentable proof of which is now before us.</p>
            <p>DR. Mather, as a capable and faithful friend to his country, laboured unweariedly to have the rights and privileges of it reſtored and enlarged; in order to which he prevailed with archbiſhop Tillotſon to tell the king that. "it would by no means do well for him to take <hi>any</hi> of thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges from the people of New-England, which
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015240_0559_0FA372C88BDEA2A0"/>king Charles the firſt had granted them." And obtained a promiſe from biſhop Burnet that, "On the firſt opportunity he would declare openly in the houſe of lords, that there was a greater SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CREDNESS in the CHARTER of New-England, than in thoſe of the corporations in England; becauſe thoſe were only <hi>acts of grace,</hi> whereas the charter of New-England was a CONTRACT between the king and the firſt patentees. They promiſed the king to enlarge his dominions on their own charges, provided they and their poſterity might enjoy ſuch and ſuch privileges; they had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their part, now for the king to deprive their poſterity of the privileges therein granted unto them, would carry a face of injuſtice in it." This had ſome effect upon the king's mind, and cauſed a ſcruple whether he might <hi>lawfully</hi> take from us the privilege of chooſing our chief rulers or not. To this ſome of his arbitary councellors ſaid, "Whatever might be the merit of the cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the charter of the Maſſachuſetts ſtood vacated by a judgment againſt it, it was in <hi>his power</hi> to put them under what form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſhould think beſt for them."<note n="*" place="bottom">Mathers life, p. 126, 127, 132.</note> This was ſo flattering and plauſible that it took with Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, who had often heard of ther perſecutions here, and thought that by reſerving to himſelf a power to negative all their acts, he ſhould prevent the like for the future.</p>
            <p>Accordingly a new charter was drawn dated Oct. 7, 1691 which included Plymouth colony, conſiſting of the counties of Plymouth, Barnſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Briſtol; the Maſſachuſett colony, which contained the counties of Suffolk, Middleſex, Eſſex, Worceſter, Hampſhire and Berkſhire: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015240_0560_0FA372C9486AB960"/>of Maine, viz. the counties of York and Cumberland; and Sagadehock, which, with lands annexed in the county of Lincoln, extends to Nova-Scotia. The iſlands alſo ſouth of Cape-Cod were included in this charter of <hi>The Province of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſett's-Bay in New-England,</hi> which reſerved an arbitary power in the crown, to appoint our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, lieutenant governor and ſecretary; but that the people might chooſe a houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives annually, to meet upon the laſt Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in May; when they were to elect 28 coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, which was to be their legiſlature; the council and houſe to have a negative on each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers acts, and after both were agreed therein, yet the governor, or in his abſence the lieutenant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, might negative any act they could paſs, and alſo negative the election of as many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillors as he pleaſed. Upon all times except elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion day, he could call, adjourn, prorogue or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the aſſembly at pleaſure. He had the ſole power of appointing military officers; and was to appoint all officers of the courts of juſtice with the conſent of the council; other civil officers were elected by the two houſes, where he had his nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and no money could iſſue out of the treaſury but by his warrant by the advice and conſent of the council. And after all, the king in council could, at any time within three years, diſannul any act or law that all three branches here could make. Now from whence came this arbitrary power in the crown of England over this country? Their plea founded upon the vacation of the former <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> would diſannul any contract that could poſſibly be made with any diſtant people in the world; for a complaint againſt us was entered and judgment was paſſed, before we could poſſibly

            <p>A FEW facts may help to explain this, and to ſhew how much greater liberty of conſcience we have enjoyed ſince the revolution than before.

            <p>FOR 36 years after the Maſſachuſetts received their laſt charter, they exerted all their power, both in their legiſlative and executive courts, with every art that miniſters could help them to, in attempts to compel every town to receive and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch miniſters as they called orthodox. They made two attempts of this nature upon Swanzey
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015240_0564_0FA372CC4AFFE330"/>and in 1722, they added the ſum of 172<abbr>l.</abbr> 11<abbr>s.</abbr> to the province taxes upon Dartmouth and Tiverton, for ſuch miniſters, intending that they ſhould draw it out of the province treaſury. And for refuſing to aſſeſs the ſame, Joſeph Anthony, John Siſſion, John Akin (quakers) and Philip Tabor (a baptiſt miniſter) ſelect-men of thoſe towns, were ſeized and confined in Briſtol goal, till the caſe was carried to England, and thoſe taxes were diſannulled by the king in council, and an expreſs order was ſent over to releaſe them. And the firſt act that was made in our province, to exempt either baptiſts or quakers from taxes to pedobaptiſt miniſters was in 1728; which ſays, "That from and after the publication of this act, none of the perſons commonly called anabaptiſts, nor any of thoſe called quakers, that are or ſhall be enrolled or entered in their ſeveral ſocieties as members thereof and who alledge a ſcruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as the reaſon of their refuſal to pay any part or proportion of ſuch taxes, as are from time to time aſſeſſed for the ſupport of the miniſter or miniſters of the churches eſtabliſhed by the laws of this province, in the town or place where they dwell, ſhall have their polls taxed toward the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſuch miniſter or miniſters, nor ſhall their bodies be at any time taken in execution to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy any ſuch miniſterial rate or tax, aſſeſſed upon their eſtates or faculty.

Mr. Thomas Hollis of London, had received ſuch accounts of their catholic temper at Harvard-college, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ordination of a pious youth in Boſton who was educated there, p. 523, that he became the greateſt benefactor to that college that they ever had. And I have a letter which he wrote to Mr. Ephraim Wheaton, paſtor of the firſt church in Swanzey, dated March 23, 1723, wherein he ſays, "you have heard, or may be informed by Mr. Callender, of my foundation in Harvard-col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and the proviſion I have made for baptiſt youth to be educated for the miniſtry, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded with pedobaptiſts.

But what heart could he have to ſendany youths there, while a large number of his brethren, who, with himſelf, lived within the bounds of Rehoboth, were taxed from year to year to preſbyterian miniſters? And after the above exempting act was made, they were told by their county court, that it did not take place that year.

The conſtitution that we ſeparated from, was formed at Saybrook in 1708, which ſays, "That the churches which are neighbouring to each other <hi>ſhall conſociate</hi> for mutual affording to each other ſuch aſſiſtance, as may be requiſite, UPON ALL OCCASIONS ECCLESIASTICAL." And their firſt proof to ſupport this article is Pſalm 122, 3,—5, which ſpeaks of the <hi>thrones of judgment</hi> that were ſet in Jeruſalem for the <hi>houſe of David.</hi> A crafty miniſterial governor, ſon to a Maſſachuſett magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate prevailed with Connecticut legiſlature to approbate this platform the next year. Another Cambridge ſchollar was then miniſter of Norwich, and was reſolute to introduce the ſcheme there. The law whereby it was approbated ſaid, "Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that nothing herein ſhall be intended or conſtrued to hinder any ſociety or church that is or ſhall be allowed by the laws of this government, from exerciſing worſhip and diſcipline in their own way according to their conſciences." Yet becauſe Richard Buſhnel and Joſeph Backus Eſq'rs repreſentatives for Norwich (with other fathers of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015240_0568_0FA372CF48D3DB70"/>the town) withdrew from the miniſters party, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than come under that yoke, they laid them under church cenſure, and by that means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their expultion out of the next aſſembly when they met. About the ſame time Mr. Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard publicly advanced his ſcheme of the Lords-ſupper being a converting ordinance, p. 484, And tho with much labour Norwich got rid of ſaid miniſter, and ſettled another upon their former principles, yet before I left this latter miniſter, he not only plainly diſcovered his fondneſs for Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook platform, but actually procured a vote of the church to receive members without ſo much as a written account of any inward change; and they practice ſo to this day. A few months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſeparated Mr. Eliſha Williams, a former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of Yale-college, publiſhed <hi>a ſeaſonable plea for the rights of conſcience,</hi> wherein he ſays, "The fountain and original of all civil power is <hi>from the people,</hi> and is certainly inſtituted for their ſakes; the great end of civil government, is the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their perſons, their liberties, and their property. A chriſtian is to receive his chriſtianity FROM CHRIST ALONE; for what is it which is neceſſarily implied and ſuppoſed in the very notion of a CHIRISTIAN but this, that he is a <hi>follower and diſciple of</hi> CHRIST! As Chriſts officers have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to teach men his mind in things pertaining to his kingdom; ſo they have no authority to teach men any thing but the mind and will of Chriſt. It is a truth that ſhines with a meridian bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that whatever is not contained in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, is out of it and excluded by it; and the teaching HIS LAWS ONLY being contained in the commiſſion, what is not his law is out of it, and by that commiſſion they are excluded from teaching it, or forbid by it."</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="unknown:015240_0569_0FA372D008BEA5C0"/>
            <p>BUT what can be more contrary hereto than for a civil legeſlature to form every town and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh into <hi>religious ſocieties,</hi> and to <hi>force</hi> every inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant therein either to ſupport the miniſter which the majority have choſen, or elſe to pay a yearly acknowledgment to that uſarped power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rer their conſciences! And which is as real a breach of public faith in our charter, as ever it was for the Britiſh court to take from us the right of chooſing our own governors, and then to burn our towns and cut our throats for not paying them as much money as they demanded. I have the expreſs teſtimony of the elders and brethren of ſeventeen of our baptiſt churches, who met laſt year at Grafton, that they intirely agree with the ſentiments and principles receited in our hiſtory. p. 14—32, excepting that of infant baptiſm; yet great numbers of them have been taxed to pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts miniſters ſince that time only becauſe we refuſe to pay any further acknowledgment to the aboveſaid uſurped power over our conſciences. And ſince it is abundantly evident that, our former ſufferings would have been greater from the rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party here than they were, if it had not been for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſtraints from the Britiſh court; and as it is alſo certrin that attempts have been made from thence to prevent our un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing now with our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try againſt their invaſions, how can thoſe who ſtill incline to oppreſs us ever expect to proſper, if they view the matter either in a natural, or a judicial light?—Conſidered in a natural light; when we know and can prove that ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars worth of eſtates have been wraſted from us on religious accounts, ſince the preſent conteſt for civil liberty commenced, with what heart can we obey or ſupport the power which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015240_0570_0FA372D0CAF2EEC8"/>ſtill denies us equal liberty of conſcience with themſelves. And conſidering things judicially, let ſuch read the warnings their fathers had, with their effects, p. 261—265, 390—395, 517—521, and then venture on further in that way if they dare.</p>
            <p>IT is to be noted, that a very large number of our country-men of various denominations are for the equal liberty we ſpeak of; and I deſire all to act in the caſe by the rule Mr. Robinſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes p. 12, 13. and ſhall cloſe with the words of the aforeſaid Mr. Goddard, viz.</p>
