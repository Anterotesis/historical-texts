                  <note>The inscription "Americans! Bear in remembrance the horrid massacre!" is printed in the left hand column and headed by a relief cut (Reilly 1009) of the Boston Massacre, identified as one used by Isaiah Thomas in 1771. A typographically similar copy of the inscription was also printed in the March 5, 1772 issue of Thomas' Massachusetts spy.</note>

                  <note>Below title in the right hand column are thirty-two lines of verse reflecting public sentiment towards Ebenezer Richardson, who was convicted and later pardoned for the murder of Christopher Seider during one of the smaller riots which led to the Boston Massacre; first line: Awake my drowsy thoughts! Awake my muse!</note>

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

BEAR IN REMEMBRANCE<lb/>
The HORRID MASSACRE!<lb/>
Perpetrated in King-Street, Boston,<lb/>
New-England,<lb/>
On the Evening of March the Fifth, 1770.<lb/>
When FIVE of your fellow countrymen,<lb/>
GRAY, MAVERICK, CALDWELL, ATTUCKS,<lb/>
and CARR,<lb/>
Lay wallowing in their Gore!<lb/>
Being <hi>basely,</hi> and most <hi>inhumanly</hi>
                  <lb/>
MURDERED!<lb/>
And SIX others badly WOUNDED!<lb/>
By a Party of the XXIXth Regiment,<lb/>
Under the command of Capt. Tho. Preston.<lb/>
REMEMBER!<lb/>
That Two of the MURDERERS<lb/>
Were convicted of MANSLAUGHTER!<lb/>
By a Jury, of whom I shall say<lb/>
NOTHING,<lb/>
Branded in the hand!<lb/>
And <hi>dismissed,</hi>
                  <lb/>
The others were ACQUITTED,<lb/>
And their Caption PENSIONED!<lb/>
Also,<lb/>
BEAR IN REMEMBRANCE<lb/>
That on the 22d Day of February, 1770.<lb/>
The infamous<lb/>
EBENEZER RICHARDSON, Informer,<lb/>
And tool to Ministerial hirelings,<lb/>
Most <hi>barbarously</hi>
                  <lb/>
MURDERED<lb/>
CHRISTOPHER SEIDER,<lb/>
An innocent youth!<lb/>
Of which crime he was found guilty<lb/>
By his Country<lb/>
On Friday April 20th, 1770;<lb/>
But remained <hi>Unsentenced</hi>
                  <lb/>
On Saturday the 22d Day of February, 1772.<lb/>
When the GRAND INQUEST<lb/>
For Suffolk county,<lb/>
Were informed, at request,<lb/>
By the Judges of the Superior Court,<lb/>
That EBENEZER RICHARDSON'S <hi>Case<lb/>
Then lay before his</hi> MAJESTY.<lb/>
Therefore said <hi>Richardson</hi>
                  <lb/>
This day, MARCH FIFTH! 1772,<lb/>
Remains UNHANGED!!!<lb/>
Let THESE things be told to Posterity!<lb/>
And handed down<lb/>
From Generation to Generation,<lb/>
'Till Time shall be no more!<lb/>
Forever may AMERICA be preserved,<lb/>
From weak and wicked monarchs,<lb/>
Tyrannical Ministers,<lb/>
Abandoned Governors,<lb/>
Their Underlings and Hirelings!<lb/>
And may the<lb/>
Machinations of artful, <hi>designing</hi> wretches,<lb/>
who would ENSLAVE THIS People,<lb/>
Come to an end,<lb/>
Let their NAMES and MEMORIES<lb/>
Be buried in eternal oblivion,<lb/>
And the PRESS,<lb/>
For a <hi>SCOURGE</hi> to Tyrannical Rulers,<lb/>
Remain FREE.</p>
