         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>FEDERALISM OF PETER PORCUPINE.</head>
            <p>Perſonally appeared before me, the ſubſcriber, one of the juſtices of the peace for the county of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, John Pearce, of the city of Philadelphia, who being duly ſworn, depoſeth and ſaith, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſome time ago with William Cobbett, the editor of Porcupine's Gazette, on the ſubject of the depredations committed on the American commerce by the veſſels of the French republic, this deponent, in reply to William Cobbett's remarks, obſerved, that the Britiſh were alſo capturing American veſſels. "Damn them (the Americans), ſaid William Cobbett, no curſe bad enough can happen to them, for their infamous declaration of independence; but I hope ſoon to ſee the two countries united together again." On this declaration, the deponent remarked, that as he (the deponent) had taken an oath of allegiance and had ſworn to ſupport the independence of the United States, he, William Cobbett, muſt expect that ſuch expreſſions would be hurtful to the deponent's feelings. On which William Cobbett damned this deponent for an Engliſh rebel. Witneſs his hand, this 3d-day of July, 1798.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>Before you enter on the body of this pamphlet, reader, I requeſt you to obſerve, that I do not deprecate your criticiſm reſpecting the execution of it. On that you may paſs ſuch ſentence as pleaſes you.</p>
            <p>That it is extremely imperfect, I acknowledge—and ſo, neceſſarily, muſt every work be, written in ſuch haſte, and under ſo many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions as I have experienced in this. That it has not coſt me more than forty-eight hours application, is a fact, of which I give you the moſt ſolemn aſſurance.</p>
            <p>But there are two circumſtances which I wiſh you to bear in mind, during the peruſal. One is, that againſt ſuch a fiend as Cobbett, alone, would I write in ſuch a ſtyle. My maxim on this ſubject is, that to hope to overcome a blackguard, you muſt fight him with his own weapons. This maxim I have long held—and it does not appear probable, that I ſhall ever renounce it. If any one denies the juſtice of it, and, through affected delicacy, reprobates the language I have uſed, I wiſh him no other puniſhment, than to be aſſailed by a ruffian, with a cart-full of brickbats, and to have nothing but a ſmall ſword to defend himſelf with. No ſmall ſword for me! I ſhall give brick bat for brick bat, to Cobbett, and every ſuch ſcoundrel as may drive me into the field. When I enter the liſts with a gentleman, he and the public ſhall find I know how to treat him as ſuch.</p>
            <p>The other circumſtance, which I wiſh impreſſed on your mind, is, that it was hardly poſſible to make greater or more ſincere exertions<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not wonderful that I exerted myſelf to avoid an open rupture with Cobbett. A former controverſy had well nigh coſt me my life—and actually deprived me for fifteen months of the uſe of one of my limbs.</note> than I have uſed to avoid the preſent appeal. I could not, <hi>a priori,</hi> have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed I would have ſo long borne with the abuſe of ſuch a vulgar, upſtart, impudent, rancorous villain.</p>
            <p>If you pay due attention to theſe circumſtances, in every other reſpect I cheerfully reſign myſelf into your hands, perfectly indifferent what may be the fate of the PLUMB PUDDING—whether you decree it to the fire after peruſal, or give the little ſtranger a cordial welcome into your library, and there aſſign it a permanent ſtation.</p>

            <head>DEDICATION. TO WILLIAM COBBETT.</head>
            <p>HOW proud muſt you feel to have arrived at the honour of having a book dedicated to you! You will ſurely add a new feather to the Egotiſt's Cap, whoſe nodding plumes adorn your head, and write home again to your father to acquaint him with the further diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which you have arrived.<note place="bottom">See Porcupine's Works, Vol. ii. p. 299.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, the ſtile of this dedication is ſomewhat uncommon. I have not beſtowed quite ſo much incenſe upon you, as ſome other dedicators. But the novelty of it ought to recommend it ſufficiently to a man of your underſtanding.</p>
            <p>"Out upon you, beggarly varlet!" you proclaim a feaſt—invite a number of hungry gueſts, and after they ſit down to table, you throw them <hi>"A Bone to gnaw."</hi> When they complain of your ſcanty fare, you give them <hi>"A Kick"</hi> on the ſhins. This, even from a Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, is harſh treatment.</p>
            <p>Not ſo do I ſerve you. Behold, with true Iriſh hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, I ſet before you a plentiful diſh—and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite one in your own country. The ſtores whence it has been drawn, are abundantly ſufficient to furniſh you with entertainment for a long time. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the feaſt depends on yourſelf and friend, mr. <hi>"Mania Reformatio."</hi> You and he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that I do not mean either of the perſons alluded to in my letter of the 22d December.</p>
            <p>In this pamphlet I have proceeded upon the ground of your being the writer of the ribaldry you publiſh. You, and mr. Mania, and I, know better. I have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated the thin diſguiſe under which he covered himſelf. And if you drive me to it, I ſwear by your ugly ſelf, I ſhall drag him forward, covered with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and diſhonour. His —, and his —, and his —, ſhall ſhine forth in pamphlets and caricatures, till his exiſtence ſhall become a burden.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.</head>
               <p>IT has been my fortune to addreſs my fellow citizens, more frequently than could poſſibly have been acceptable to them— certainly much more ſo than has been agreeable to me. Few men have a ſtronger averſion to a wanton obtruſion of private cares or controverſies on the public, of whom each individual has enough of his own affairs to occupy his attention.—Unleſs there are ſtrong reaſons to juſtify ſuch appeals, they are vain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. But I conceive when a public attack is made on an individual, he has a right, and in moſt caſes ought to exerciſe that right, to inſiſt on a candid hearing, and a deciſion according to the evidence he brings forward. The preſent caſe, I humbly conceive to be one of this kind.</p>
               <p>Peace and retirement I prize, and have ſought moſt earneſtly, as I think will be freely allowed by any one who has patience to peruſe theſe pages. I have frequently made large ſacrifices to ſecure them. But highly as I value them, I deſpiſe paying ſo
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035272_0006_1001BA63E72FDC40"/>
high a price for them as a diſhonourable ſubmiſſion to any blackguard or ruſſian that may aſſail me with his tongue, his pen, his cudgel, or his fiſt. While GOD preſerves my life, I ſhall defend myſelf againſt every attack, in ſuch mode and by ſuch means, as the nature of the grievance, the character of the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, or other circumſtances of the caſe may require.</p>
               <p>Some faſtidious or prejudiced readers, before they proceed thus far, will probably exclaim,—"Who is this Carey?—what is he? —why obtrude his complaints on the public, for the ſcurrility and abuſe of a wretch, who has, with the utmoſt impunity, abuſed many of the moſt exalted characters in the country, and who ſeems privileged to dart his arrows around, at friend or foe, without a poſſibility of redreſs? Why ſhould an obſcure indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, like Carey, whom hardly any body knows out of his own diſtrict, affect ſuch a keen ſenſibility reſpecting outrages, to which men ſo far his ſuperiors in wealth, influence and rank, are obliged to ſubmit?"</p>
               <p>Another claſs of readers will ſay, as I have been told an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, "Cobbett is a wretch ſo far ſunk in infamy, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, deſpiſed, and abhorred, by all thoſe whoſe good opinion can reflect honour, that it is madneſs and folly to enter the liſts with him. His abuſe is regarded by none. What is to be gained in a controverſy with a ſcoundrel, whom no lie, ever ſo barefaced, can ſhame; who has taken out his diploma by the unanimous vote of the college of blackguards; and who circulates two thouſand papers daily, to people whom he calls his ſubſcribers, but of whom many have in vain tried every means to have their names effaced from that regiſter of diſgrace, his ſubſcription liſt."</p>
               <p>To the firſt claſs of objectors I ſhall briefly anſwer, if the moſt exalted characters chooſe to ſubmit to the inſolence of a low-bred, cowardly alien, whoſe unparalleled effrontery has induced him frequently to glory in ſcorning to become a citizen of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in whoſe affairs he ſo arrogantly dares to interfere, and on which his blackguardiſm entails ſuch diſgrace—I feel no diſpoſition to imitate a conduct, which I have always regarded as highly reprehenſible and pernicious. If they do not nail his forfeit ears to the pillory of his own counter, give him a new taſte of the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o'nine-tails, gently admoniſh him with a good cow-ſkin, have him dragged through the kennels, or at leaſt apply for redreſs to thoſe laws to which he offers daily outrage, they are, I contend, deficient in their duty to themſelves and their country. Had any of thoſe with whom the miſcreant began, dragged him forward to public and condign puniſhment, the world would not have been loſt in aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment whether to aſcribe the indulgence the ruſſian has met with to the patience or puſillanimity of the United States—to the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035272_0007_1001BA65B3E8D950"/>
higheſt degree of magnanimity or to the oppoſite extreme. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that there is not a parallel inſtance to be found in the records of any nation, of an alien ſuffered to aſſume a more dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatorial air than the firſt magiſtrate of the country; for I aſſert, without the ſmalleſt fear of contradiction, that this reptile dictates to the government in a ſtyle infinitely more authoritative than that of either the laſt or preſent preſident of the United States. More of this anon.</p>
               <p>What! ſhall it be regarded as a public duty, to hunt out and bring to juſtice an incendiary who puts a torch to my houſe—or a petty villain who ſtops me on the highway, and robs me of a few dollars, to protract a wretched exiſtence, perhaps to ſave a ſick wiſe and helpleſs children from ſtarvation—and by what lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic can it be proved to be otherwiſe than criminal, to paſs over the diurnal attacks of an unprincipled raſcal, who hardly prints a ſingle paper void of the vileſt abuſe and ſcurrility? Certainly if Shakeſpeare wrote correctly, and that he did, no man will deny, when he declared, that

there is an incalculable difference between the villany of ſuch a miſcreant as Cobbett, and that of hundreds who have forfeited their lives to the ſanguinary penal codes of Europe, or who are by the mild American ſyſtem devoted to beating of hemp and ſawing of marble. If theſe poſitions be true, and that they are, every man of rectitude will agree, it muſt be the incumbent duty of all good citizens to uſe their endeavours to erect ſome mound to oppoſe that overwhelming torrent of malignity, defamation and blackguardiſm, that threatens to deſtroy all diſtinction between right and wrong, and to involve in one indiſcriminate maſs the upright and ſcoundrelly part of the community.</p>
               <p>To the other claſs of objectors I reply, that no man living entertains a more contemptible opinion of Cobbett than I do. To ſay that he is a diſgrace to human nature, as has been already ſaid, is a very faint expreſſion of my idea. I can ſafely declare, and appeal to Heaven for the truth of the aſſertion, that of all the villains that ever poſſeſſed a printing preſs, I never knew or ever
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035272_0008_1001A1765DE7E240"/>
heard of more than one or two that could in any degree be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to him. I have conſidered his conduct and character with attention, and I have not been able to diſcover the appearance of more than one good quality in him—and that is, a certain kind of candour (perhaps I ſhould rather ſay, impudence), which makes him ſcorn to maſk the atrocity and villany of his views.</p>
               <p>However, baſe and contemptible as he indubitably is, were he infinitely more ſo—but heaven knows that is impoſſible—I never could agree with thoſe who aſſert that his attacks are altogether unworthy of notice. A man who circulates two thouſand papers daily, may impair the reputation and reſpectability of the moſt excellent of the ſons of men. It is a trite obſervation, but too much a-propos to be omitted here, that inceſſant dropping of water will wear away the hardeſt ſtone. In like manner, inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, unrepelled ſcurrility, buffoonery, and detraction, ſuch as Cobbett uſes, muſt inſenſibly wear away the hard-earned fame of the beſt ſpent life. If he has readers, they cannot reſiſt the impreſſion, whether or not, to borrow one of his own elegant figures, they pay for his "dirty diſh clout."</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations inſpired me with an abhorrence of any warfare with the miſcreant. That I uſed many and ſincere efforts to avoid it, will appear in the ſequel, to the ſatisfaction of his warmeſt friends and partiſans, if he has any left. But let no man do me the injuſtice to ſuppoſe I feared it. I knew the ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel too well. I either groſſly undervalue Cobbett, or overrate myſelf, if I am not able to meet him on any ground whatever. Diveſt his ribald writings of their falſehoods and Billingſgate, and you rob them of life and ſoul—you leave behind but a wretched caput mortuum, that would lull a Cerberus to ſleep. The abuſive language he uſes, ſuch as raſcal, ſcoundrel, blackguard and ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian, can be eaſily acquired. I think before the fellow has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thus far, he will freely allow, that although I have newly opened ſtore, and have not received my ſupplies from a camp or the purlieus of St. Giles's, my ſtock is, nevertheleſs, as copious and inexhauſtible as his own. I have taken him for my model, and pride myſelf on being a rapid proficient: and expect to make much greater progreſs. As to the boaſted circulation of his paper, if I am driven, by a continuance of his teazing abuſe, to eſtabliſh one, which appears at preſent not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, I pledge myſelf to uſe ſuch induſtry in the circulation of it, as to make it, within half a year, at leaſt co-extenſive with Porcupine's Gazette. If I am provoked to take this ſtep, may Otway's whole collection of curſes, "Pride, poverty, ſhame, and the name of villain," light on me, if I ever quit my grapple of him, till I render his inſam co-equal with his guilt, and make
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035272_0009_1001BA6A6C20E000"/>
him curſe the hour in which he aſſailed a man who never offered him provocation. Before two months from this date, the 7th of January, 1799, I pledge myſelf to forfeit five hundred dollars, if he does not confeſs that I am a tolerable adept in the art of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing pamphlets. This ſhall be read in every city, town, village, and hamlet, in the United States, to which there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance by ſtage, by mail, by waggon, or by cart.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>TO enable the reader to underſtand the nature of the controverſy in which I find myſelf engaged, with the moſt execrable wretch that heaven in its wrath ever allowed to infeſt a country, and arm citizen againſt citizen, it is neceſſary for me to aſcend to the publication of what the miſcreant calls his Life, in other words, the romance which he publiſhed under the pompous title of "The Life and Adventures of Peter Porcupine, with a full and fair Account of his authoring Tranſactions." In pp. 36, 7, he has the following paragraph—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I addreſſed myſelf to Mr. Carey. This was, to make uſe of a culinary figure, jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire. Mr. Carey received me as bookſellers generally receive authors (I mean authors whom they hope to get but little by): he looked at the title from top to bottom, and then at me from head to foot.—"No, <hi>my lad,</hi>" ſays he, "I don't think it will ſuit."—<hi>My lad!</hi>—God in heaven forgive me! I believe that, at that moment, I wiſhed for another yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever to ſtrike the city; not to deſtroy the inhabitants, but to furniſh me too with <hi>the ſubject of a pamphlet,</hi> that might make me rich.—Mr. Carey has ſold hundreds of the <hi>Obſervations</hi> ſince that time, and therefore, I dare ſay he highly approved of them, when he came to a peruſal. At any rate I muſt not forget to ſay, that he behaved honourably in the buſineſs; for, he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035272_0010_1001BA6BF96F04A8"/>
promiſed not to make known the author, and he certainly kept his word, or the diſcovery would not have been reſerved for the month of June, 1796. This circumſtance, conſidering Mr. Carey's politics, is greatly to his honour, and has almoſt wiped from my memory that contumelious "<hi>my lad."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is almoſt irrelevant to the ſubject of this pamphlet, but I muſt be pardoned for obſerving, that this very minute detail is a tiſſue of falſehood, from beginning to end, except that the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet in queſtion was offered me to print, and refuſed. I read only the title-page. It was ſcurrilous. I concluded the contents to be of the ſame complexion, and refuſed to be the publiſher. But if ever I could depend on my memory, in any tranſaction in the whole courſe of my life, Cobbett did not appear with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript. It was brought me by a child. It follows, that all the very high degree of merit aſcribed to me, for ſo honourably keeping the ſecret, was one of Cobbett's waking dreams.</p>
               <p>Some explanation is here neceſſary. A few weeks after I had refuſed to print the pamphlet, it was advertiſed by Mr. Bradford, and became a frequent ſubject of converſation. I recollected the title, and endeavoured alſo to recollect the bearer. As the tranſaction had made a very ſlight impreſſion on my mind, I found it not eaſy at firſt to aſcertain the perſon. But the reſult of my endeavours was a conviction that it had been a child. And I am now ready to ſwear, if neceſſary, that to the beſt of my knowledge, judgment; belief, and recollection, the "Modern Tartuffe," as it was originally ſtiled, was not offered to me by William Cobbett, but by a child, apparently about twelve or thirteen years of age. I knew not the wretched, raſcally writer. I never ſaw him, to my knowledge, till he called at my ſtore in January 1797, to purchaſe a map, to pay for which he had not money in his pocket; and on telling me he would ſend it, I aſked his name—He ſaid, William Cobbett. I gazed at him— and the moment he went out of the door, called my family to look after him, as I ſhould have done at a leopard, an elephant, or any other ſtrange animal. Thoſe who know him, will judge whether a man who has once ſeen his carotty head and Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canſir face, could ever forget him.</p>
               <p>Of the Grub-ſtreet production, a worthy harbinger of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture labours of his "muddy brain," the ſcribbler ſays, I "ſold hundreds." To what numberleſs detections and what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces will a liar expoſe himſelf! Referring to the account current of Mr. Bradford, from whom alone they were to be had, I find I ſold ſixty copies; neither more nor leſs. Thoſe who may doubt whether Cobbett would ſo palpably run the riſque of

               <p>Let it be not ſaid, that he would not tell a lie in ſo plain a caſe, and to anſwer no conceivable purpoſe. Inveterate habits are not to be overcome: A liar muſt and will tell lies—if they only keep him in practice, 'tis well—if any point is to be gained by it, ſo much the better.</p>
               <p>The ſucceſs of his anonymous publications induced him to creep forth from his den, and ruſh into the glare of day, which he had ſhunned with as much ſolicitude as the midnight robber or aſſaſſin.—In June 1796, he avowed himſelf, took a ſtore, and openly ſet thoſe whom he had injured, at defiance. He was immediately attacked by a hoſt of anonymous writers, who ſeemed determined to embroil him and me in a quarrel.—They aſſumed it as a fact, that fear was the ſole reaſon why he had made ſuch honourable mention of me. It was their wiſh to oblige Cobbett to abuſe me, in order to evince that he was not a coward. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I did not deem it very kind of thoſe gentlemen, whoever they were, to place ſuch a foul-mouthed ſcoundrel in ſo very unpleaſant a dilemma. I felt on the occaſion as a man would with a good ſuit of clothes on, if he perceived an outrageous ſcavenger with a cart full of filth, and a ſhovel, dealing it forth on every ſide —Cobbett was the ſcavenger. I wiſhed ſincerely to avoid his ſhovel. I knew that the bruſh of public enquiry would rub out the ſtains. But I did not wiſh to put them or myſelf to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of uſing that bruſh. I was ſatisfied with the ſtation I held in the eſtimation of my fellow citizens. I had lived twelve years among them, and had never ſoiled my hands or my character by any of the various ſchemes or ſpeculations that have produced ſuch fraud, diſgrace and ruin. I had, during the whole period, purſued with unremitting induſtry a uſeful and honourable buſineſs. For ſix years of the time, under an extreme degree of difficulty and embarraſſment, I had carried on the American Muſeum, a work to which enlightened foreigners and citizens of equal reſpectability had been ſo partial as to declare that it reflected honour on the country which afforded its editor an aſylum. During the remainder of the time, I had printed a number of works equally valuable<note n="*" place="bottom">The proceeds of two of theſe works alone were above 60,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Of Guthrie's Geography I printed 2500, and of Goldſmith's Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated Nature, 3000. The former ſells for ſixteen and the latter for nine dollars. At this rate they would produce 67,000 dollars; but as part of them were diſpoſed of to ſubſcribers, at a lower price, I take the above round ſum.</note>—and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035272_0012_1001BA71830E3A00"/>
done buſineſs to the amount of 300,000 dollars, with men of various nations and parties— and among the whole there was not one of real reſpectability of character from whom, if need were, I could not procure the moſt flattering teſtimonials. I had frequently given employment, for months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to at leaſt one hundred and fifty perſons, in the various departments of paper-making, printing, engraving, binding, &amp;c. &amp;c. and I can with pride and pleaſure declare, that I cannot at this moment recollect the name of one decent, deſerving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom I ever employed, that would not gladly work for me again. I had a large and growing family to maintain—and was engaged in an extenſive buſineſs which demanded my whole time and moſt unceaſing attention. I had not therefore time to ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on appeals, explanations, rejoinders and replies. All theſe reaſons, and numerous others, combined to render me anxious to eſcape Cobbett's abuſe, which I thus early reſolved to take every prudent meaſure to avert. But ſhould it prove unavoidable, I as early reſolved to carry on the war with all the powers which God and nature, education and obſervation had beſtowed on me. From this determination I have not ſwerved one moment ſince that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, and to it is owing the preſent publication.</p>
               <p>I hope no part of the preceding paragraph will be aſcribed to vanity or egotiſm. Both I heartily deſpiſe. But there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain occaſions, and the preſent I believe is one of them, in which it is allowable for a man to urge what he can fairly advance in his own defence.</p>
               <p>My ſolicitude was conſiderably augmented by a report ſpread with ſome induſtry, that I was the writer of one of the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets againſt Cobbett. I therefore ſent him a letter, of which the following is a copy:

                  <q>The O'Careys, on the contrary, are guilty of every mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that intereſted ſervility can invent.

                        <p>The averſion I formerly expreſſed to this warfare, has not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed. On the contrary, it is ſtronger than ever. I therefore make this one more effort to avoid it. Should we be engaged in it, I am determined to be able to exculpate myſelf from its conſequences, whatever they may be.</p>
                        <p>I have merited no ill treatment at your hands, except for the ſin of differing from you, <hi>toto coelo,</hi> in political opinions. I have done you no injury. In the account of your Life, you profeſſed your gratitude towards me; what has cancelled this debt?</p>
                        <p>I have, you muſt acknowledge, taken no common pains to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape a conteſt with you. To me it would be irkſome, as can well be conceived. For if you ſlander and abuſe me, what am I to do? Very unfortunately, in bodily ſtrength I am far your inferior. Were I, as, in my humble opinion, every man ought in ſuch a caſe, to attempt to procure redreſs by the cudgel, for the injuries of the pen, it is more than probable I ſhould only meet with an aggravation of the injury. But it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon becauſe I am weaker than you, that I am therefore to be ſubject to your unprovoked attacks.</p>
                        <p>Shall I return ſlander for ſlander, abuſe for abuſe? In this line I am unpractiſed. I deſpiſe a recurrence to theſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. Beſides, the utmoſt of my ingenuity could deviſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to add to what has been written againſt you ineffectually. I ſcorn to borrow ſcurrility from any man. I hope there is no vanity in the declaration, that in fair, open, gentlemanly controverſy, there lives not a man from whom I ſhould ſhrink —but abuſe I have never employed, and never ſhall willingly.</p>
                        <p>Should I ſue you for damages?—Poor ſatisfaction to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from dancing attendance in courts, to have perhaps a few hundred dollars damages decreed, after an expence of time worth probably double the amount!</p>
                        <p>What other alternative remains? You fight no duels. In this latter mode, the inequality ariſing from a diſparity of ſtrength and ſize, and from my lameneſs, is done away. But to this <hi>ultima ratio</hi> there are ſtrong objections. Arms have been your trade for years: I have never drawn but two triggers in my life. Here, therefore, the inequality returns, though not in ſo great a degree. But this is not my only objection. I have a wife and four ſmall children to ſupport. On my induſtry they depend. I owe it to them to incur no honourably-avoidable
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035272_0016_1001A18836F50BC8"/>
riſque: this motive, and a decent regard for the laws of the ſtate, induce me to take every ſtep that can be taken with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, to avert a commencement of hoſtilities. But powerful as theſe motives are, and powerful they muſt ſurely be allowed, no man ſhall abuſe or inſult me with impunity.</p>
                        <p>I once more, ſir, in the ſame ſpirit as dictated my former letter, declare, that I have never written or publiſhed a line or ſentence againſt you. I have long done writing on politics. I have no concern in nor control over the Daily Advertiſer; and cannot, therefore, be reſponſible for its contents. In fact, although I regard it as extremely well conducted in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, yet articles have appeared in it, which I diſapprove as much as any thing that has ever appeared in your paper.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould be extremely ſorry to have this letter aſcribed, on the one hand, to a deſire of intimidating you, or, on the other, to any fear of you. They are both equally remote from my heart. My wiſh is peace. I have done nothing to provoke hoſtility. As long as in my power, I ſhall avoid it—when it comes, I ſhall know how to meet it.</p>
                        <p>This letter, like my former, is intended for your own peruſal. The other, contrary to my wiſhes, was divulged. Some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous miſcreant ſcoundrel, whom perhaps I may diſcover and repay, ſtated it to be a deprecation of your wrath, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries I had offered. Heaven and hell are not more oppoſed to each other, than this idea is to truth.</p>

               <p>In this letter I ſtudied to ſteer a middle courſe between the appearance of apprehenſion on the one hand, and of threatening on the other. How far I ſucceeded, the reader muſt decide. I was prepared for peace or war—but infinitely more deſirous of the former than the latter. I ſtill hoped, notwithſtanding the notorious baſeneſs of the miſcreant, that as there was little to be gained by attacking me, and as he ſoared to ſuch higher game, I might eſcape. But I had utterly miſtaken Cobbett. I had drawn my inferences from the generality of mankind—not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that the Porcupine was a ſort of luſus naturae, a ſui generis hurled into exiſtence to belie all general rules. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, after forty-five hours ſtudy, I received on Monday morning, (though dated on Saturday) the following reply, which ſuch an inſolent raſcal as Cobbett alone could have penned, and ſuch a brutal ruſſian as Cobbett could have ſent.</p>

time that you have peſtered me with your <hi>hoſtile</hi> profeſſions of a deſire to live in peace with me.—If your wiſhes are really pacific, your conduct is very unaccountable.

               <p>The ruffian ſays "This is the third time I have been peſtered with your hoſtile profeſſions of a deſire to live in peace with me." I had a few minutes' converſation with him in his own ſtore at one time, and wrote him the two preceding letters.—They are now fairly before the reader. Let him determine whether they are 'impertinent or uncalled for;' or whether they could have ariſen from any motive but a deſire of peace.

But if the inſolent expreſſions above quoted from his paper of the 5th of May, did not juſtify the contents of that letter, then it muſt certainly ariſe from ſomething ſacred in the perſon or character of Cobbett, that gives him a privilege beyond any other perſon in the community.</p>

                  <p>Law Suit. Liberty of the Preſs. Important Scheme, PRO BONO PUBLICO.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOME time afterwards, there appeared in the Grub-ſtreet Gazette, a libel, calculated to injure me in my buſineſs. This was proper ground of action. I felt it therefore a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on me, to bring the queſtion fully and fairly before a court of juſtice, whether any vagabond, ſcoundrel, miſcreant, or ruffian, who could raiſe one or two hundred dollars, to purchaſe a printing preſs and a few types, ſhould, with his preſs and his types, likewiſe purchaſe the very important privilege of blackening the fair fame, diſturbing the peace, or deſtroying the intereſts and proſpects of any one whom he or ſuch lurking aſſaſſins as he might employ, or as might employ him, ſhould mark out as objects of their wrath, their malice, their envy, or for the alleviation of their poverty.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035272_0019_1001BA81B9DCD208"/>
For it is to be obſerved, that as many men are defamed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled libellers, to keep beggary and ſtarvation from the door, as from motives of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Here let me beg the reader to make a ſolemn pauſe. Let him not be led aſtray by names. Let him aſk himſelf, whether this is not the real queſtion in all caſes of this kind, ſo far as reſpects attacks on individuals in private life, and, let me add, on the private character of public men.—I prize, as ineſtimable, the liberty of the preſs—the liberty I mean, of fairly and boldly, but candidly and decently, diſcuſſing the public conduct of public men of all ranks, and likewiſe of all parties—But the more inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable is the liberty, the more deteſtable is the licentiouſneſs of the preſs. So far are they, in fact, from being inſeparably connected, as the ſcoundrels who live by the diſhonourable trade of ſurrility pretend, that the exuberance of the one has a direct tendency to deſtroy the other. What would be thought, were a farmer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that it was neceſſary to cheriſh the tares and weeds that were choaking up the good grain, in order to promote the growth of that very grain? Surely that he was a fit candidate for a mad-houſe. His claim is equally ſtrong, who advocates the licentiouſneſs, for fear of impairing the liberty of the preſs.</p>
               <p>The queſtion thus brought before the courts of juſtice, is of importance to two large claſſes or deſcriptions of men—the good and the bad. The former, ſhould there be no legal redreſs to be had, will find themſelves, ſo far as reſpects this matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a ſtate of nature. They will therefore be under the neceſſity of aſſociating for ſelf protection, to ſupply the defects of the law. An aſſociation of this kind would awe into ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for decency, cowardly bullies, ſuch as Cobbett, who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to proceed in their villainous career by the impunity they experience through the contempt, fear, indolence or other miſtaken motives of the perſons whom they offer up as ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>That the bad are equally intereſted in the iſſue of this queſtion, will admit of no doubt. Should the deciſion be in favour of the quill drivers, and printers, what a glorious field is opened for the exerciſe of talents hitherto lying concealed or buried in obſcurity! What father, who has an athletic ſon, ſuch as Cobbett, will be ſo unjuſt as to deſtine him to trundle a wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrow, ſaw wood, or carry a hod for a bricklayer, when he can make ſo much more comfortable proviſion for him by procuring him a few types, a preſs, and enabling him to eſtabliſh a blackguard newſpaper? Inſtead of living and dying, as unkind fate would otherwiſe have obliged him, at the bottom of the wheel, he will riſe, at the ſubject of this pamphlet has done, to the ſummit, enjoy all the good things of this world, be careſſed by

the great, and, in fine, may hope to dictate laws to a riſing empire. 'Tis no objection to this idea, that the perſon has not the talents of a writer; there never will be wanting men whoſe cowardice equals their malignity, and who will be happy to have a ruffian to ſtand forward between them and the correction or puniſhment which their villainy deſerves. There is no arguing againſt facts: and the moſt incredulous muſt coincide in opinion with me, when they conſider what Cobbett has been, what he now is, and the wealth and influence he has acquired.</p>

                  <p>Mr. John Ward Fenno. United Iriſhmen. Plots, Combinations, and Conſpiracies. Explanation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT here becomes neceſſary to introduce on the ſtage another perſonage, who has been the means of involving me in the preſent diſpute. This gentleman is Mr. John Ward Fenno, editor and proprietor of the Gazette of the United States. For many weeks he had terrified the public with reports of plots, combinations, and conſpiracies, of United Iriſhmen. Thoſe who read his paper might have been ſurpriſed at the ſupineneſs of the government of the United States, and their culpable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the Caſſandra's voice that warned them of the impending and tremendous danger.</p>
               <p>This intrepid young man was not to be deterred from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his duty by the inattention which his admonitions experienced. With truly Roman greatneſs of ſoul he iſſued the following public ſpirited and undaunted declaration, in his paper of the 26th November laſt:</p>
               <p>"I have a liſt of members of the ſociety—to this I ſhall always be happy to receive additions.—Facts, alſo, identifying the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip of any individual whatever, will be uſeful and neceſſary. When as complete as I can make it, the names of the whole of them ſhall be publiſhed, from the gloomy, cloſe-working, cut-throat-looking ſon of Galen, to the <hi>fatuitous and ſputtering book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller,</hi> though the knives of the whole bloody gang were at my breaſt. Similar liſts ſhould be collected every where, and the villains dragged forth to light. For light to them is death."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:035272_0021_1001BA87EC16B670"/>I read this paragraph, and was at a loſs to aſcertain who was the <hi>"fatuitous ſputtering bookſeller?"</hi> Although I never had a very extraordinary opinion of my own talents, yet (pardon my vanity, reader) my modeſty never went ſo far as to conſign me to the claſs of <hi>fatui,</hi> or fools. I took the cap, tried it, thought it did not fit, and threw it among the reſt of the Iriſh bookſellers, of whom there are four in this city. Had I ſuſpected the fool's cap to be intended for me, I think it more than probable I ſhould have ſaved Mr. Fenno ſome of the uneaſineſs which this affair has cauſed him, myſelf the trouble of writing, and the public that of wading through this pamphlet. But the fates otherwiſe decreed.</p>
               <p>At length, after the expectations of the public had been raiſed to the higheſt pitch, when every body looked forward to ſee liſts of hundreds of thouſands of thoſe Cannibals, the blood-thirſty United Iriſhmen, the mountain was heard to groan, and after many hard throes, the mouſe crept out. This mouſe, courteous reader, was a liſt of ſeventeen names, prefaced by the following obſervations, in the United States Gazette of Tueſday the 18th of December laſt.</p>
               <p>"All ages and all forms of government, have abounded in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies: and if theſe have ſometimes produced beneficial reſults, they have never been derived from the calculations of the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators. But our own has been remarkably fertile in the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſpiracies of the worſt kind, carried on by the worſt agents, and promoted by the worſt of means—ſo that it may juſtly be called the <hi>age of inſurrection;</hi> unhappily it muſt be added, they have of late experienced a too uniform ſucceſs. Whether our country is to be immolated on this ſanguinary altar, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly on our timely and vigorous exertion. An exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of uncommon nerve can alone preſerve us from uncommon evils; that conſpiracy, once ripened and matured, our nerve and our energy will rivet ſtronger our chains.</p>
               <p>"We have read of empires, aſſailed and overthrown by conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who ſprang up like muſhrooms in the night; fellows of yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, unknown, unthought of. But leſt conviction be withheld from this evidence, let us turn from what we read, to what we have <hi>ſeen.</hi> We have ſeen the firſt empire in the world ſhattered to a maſs of ruins, its forms deſtroyed, its inſtitutions reverſed, its language overrun with barbarous and jargonic terms, its man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners debauched, its religion deſtroyed, its conſequence annihilated, and its very name rendered a loathſome reproach; have we not ſeen them brought about by a ſet of men contemptible in their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, character, and at firſt in number, and do we, after all this, imagine ourſelves unaſſailable to the United Iriſhmen? Think you, the victims of St. Bartholomew's day imagined, an hour before their fate, the terrible ſtroke which awaited them?</p>
               <p>"While, in the emphatic language of the Roman orator, many

are found exclaiming of each of theſe murderers, <hi>"tamen hic vivit,"</hi> others, ſunk in beſtial ſlothfulneſs and inanity, cry, "What a fuſs is making about the United Iriſhmen!

Believe me, theſe conſpirators, while they are ſecret as the grave, will be found daring as death, when their plot ripens to exploſion.</p>
               <p>"What is an <hi>United Iriſhman?</hi> May not Iriſhmen unite as well as we? Look to Ireland for its character, and behold it written in <hi>blood!</hi> From the time of earl Strongbow, the Iriſh have borne a character, our conceptions of which it is hard to find words to do juſtice to. From being almoſt the ſole depoſitaries of ſcience, the maſs has degenerated into the moſt brutal ignorance, whilſt from that extremity of oppoſition in their character, which diſtinguiſhes them in a peculiar manner from all the reſt of the word, their iſle has contributed beyond her proportion, in men of eminence, as ſoldiers, poets, orators, ſtateſmen and divines. An Iriſh <hi>gentleman</hi> is one of the fineſt characters in nature. The reſt of the nation is repreſented by the bulk of thoſe who come to this country—ſuch men as Burke, Lyon, Reynolds, old Findley, Smiley and Duane, the bare mention of whom is ſufficient, without the trouble of elucidation.</p>
               <p>"Imagine a whole nation of ſuch men as theſe, and figure to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a congregation of every noxious, every venomous propenſity.</p>
               <p>"Behold their deeds, and behold deeds worthy ſuch authors. <hi>Wild,</hi> and untameable, they wage inceſſant war with one another, and Ireland has been a Golgotha from the earlieſt period of hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.

This character has driven them thence. Are they then of a different caſt here? No: coelum non animum mutant.

               <p>"The various affiliated ſocieties of United Iriſhmen in this country, form one intimate, cloſely connected band—the whole being only ſo many ramifications of the mother ſociety, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending guidance of which they are directed, and with which they keep up a conſtant correſpondence as well as with each other. Thus, it is evident, the gang in America is altogether ſubordinate to that of Ireland: Its views, it appears, are equally ſo.</p>

They had nevertheleſs marked the ramifications of a revolutionary form, which was to have been inſtituted in order the better to prolong thoſe diſorders which it was their firſt object to excite. They coaleſced with the jacobins (moſt of the leaders of whom have actually been admitted within the pale of the ſociety) ſo far as regarded the ſtalking-horſe, behind the ſanction of whoſe <hi>philoſophical</hi> fame, all this miſchief was to be brewed.

He is now (though a <hi>ſalary man</hi>) abſenting himſelf from that poſt which he fills and defiles, to forward the plans of his myrmidons by writing inflammatory reſolutions againſt the alien and ſedition bills, and ſtirring up the people to inſurrection. This tall, aukward figure (I do not mean the noted <hi>tory</hi> and man of laurel) imagines, that under the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of philoſophical retirement, he ſufficiently cloaks thoſe daring machinations, which will nevertheleſs drag him one day, a trembling criminal, to the bar of juſtice.—Imitating a certain fooliſh bird, he runs his head into Helvetius, and imagines himſelf concealed, becauſe he does not ſee that he is ſeen.</p>
               <p>"Having uſed this great man 'till their purpoſes had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently advanced, he would have been laid on the ſhelf, or perhaps decently interred. He would have given way to men of greater daring—ſtronger nerve—better qualified to ſail on the "tempeſtuous ſea of liberty." Reynolds would ſucceed to the directorſhip: for a Talleyrand, in body as well as mind, we need not look beyond his moſt impudent and meddleſome aſſociate.</p>

               <p>"Do I hear ſome one cry, "Name them!" "Name them!" Lend me your patience and I will.

Do you not ſee that they poſſeſs all the qualities of a body? do they not ſee? do they not read, do they not hear, do they not feel? or how is it that the fears we have excited have repreſſed their daring, and ſuſpended their appeal to the populace? <hi>"Conſul vidit."</hi>

                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:035272_0025_1001BA950DA27E68"/>But it ſeems I was unacquainted with the extent of Mr. Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no's kindneſs. He had deſtined the foolſcap for my head, to keep it comfortably warm during the approaching winter. I here beg leave to preſent him my ſincere acknowledgments, which I hope he will not modeſtly refuſe to accept. Let me, however, incidentally obſerve, that I have known <hi>"fatuitous"</hi> printers—men who fancied themſelves poſſeſſed of immenſe powers, but to whom the public, were it put to vote, would award the foolſcap. Take notice, reader, I proteſt againſt any miſconſtruction of my meaning. I do not aſſert that Mr. John Ward Fenno, editor, proprietor, printer, and publiſher of the Gazette of the United States, or Philadelphia Daily Advertiſer, belongs to this claſs. No, no, that would be an inſult, and prove my want of diſcernment. But ſhould the public, after a full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of this alarmiſt buſineſs, be pretty unanimouſly of opinion, that it has been very <hi>"fatuitouſly"</hi> managed, and, as a certain very ancient and induſtrious perſonage, nicknamed Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub, is reported to have declared, when he caught a hog, and ſheared him, that there has been "great <hi>cry and little wool,</hi>" am I to blame, Mr. Fenno? Surely not.</p>
               <p>This is rather digreſſive. Let me reſume the thread of my diſcourſe. The Gazette of the United States eſcaped my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on Tueſday evening. A neighbour had borrowed, and neglected to return it. On Wedneſday, about dinner time, I was informed, that there was in it, a liſt of United Iriſhmen, and that among them my name was introduced. I ſent for the paper; and the reader may readily conceive my aſtoniſhment at the <hi>"fatuitous"</hi> denouëment of a plot, which had threatened the exiſtence of the government, nay the very independence of the United States. It appeared that on the 26th of November, Mr. Fenno had had <hi>"a liſt"</hi> of the conſpirators—that he had ſince that time repeatedly and with a loud voice called for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther communications—and lo! after three weeks corrections, additions, and emendations, the promiſed liſt made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, on the 18th of December, when there were brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, only

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035272_0026_1001BA97A9D89DB0"/>
theſe muſt be! every man of them at leaſt a Guy Faux! The cellars under Congreſs Hall, if any there be, ought to be carefully examined, left they be filled with combuſtible matters —perhaps, as Bob Acres judiciouſly expreſſes it, with <hi>"double barreled ſwords and cut-and-thruſt piſtols."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be ſerious; other conſiderations ſoon aroſe in my mind. I found myſelf held up to the world as <hi>"a Guy Faux,"</hi> a conſpirator, "ripe for rapine and ſpoil," by a young man to whom I never had given any cauſe of offence, and with whom I had had a long, though far from an intimate acquaintance. If at ſuch a moment, I felt diſpoſed to beſtow ſome harſh epithets on him who had acted ſo very unkindly towards me, I believe much cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure would not attach to me. It would require a greater degree of patience than has fallen to the ſhare of the <hi>"ſputtering, fatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous Bookſeller"</hi> not to vent his indignation in pretty expreſſive terms.</p>
               <p>To a man ambitious of being brought forward into public no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice—of being conſpicuous, the ſituation in which I was placed, might not be diſagreeable. But I was no Eroſtratus. The hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſequeſtered vale ſuited me better. I therefore reſolved to wait upon Mr. Fenno, to inveſtigate the affair, and called upon a much-reſpected friend to accompany me, and be witneſs of what might occur.</p>
               <p>Mr. F. was at home. I told him how ſurprized and mortified I had been, to find my name introduced into his paper the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding evening ſo very indecently and unjuſtly. He replied, he was not certain that my name was there. It is not neceſſary for me to expreſs what I felt at this ſubterfuge, which muſt have reference to the quaint and new-found deſignation of <hi>"Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Ditto,"</hi> which certainly was not Mathew Carey, although intended to convey and actually conveying thoſe names to the reader. This quibble was not eaſily reconciled to the gratuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unaſked for proffer of the neck to the murderers' knives, on the 26th of November. It is not my buſineſs to render them conſiſtent.</p>
               <p>When I had ſcouted this idea, Mr. Fenno informed me he had acted in the affair merely as Editor, and, in the performance of his duty as ſuch, "he could not anſwer whom <hi>he might fall foul of.</hi>" I replied he ought ſurely to be very careful whom he <hi>fell foul of,</hi> in violation of truth and juſtice; that in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there was an equal diſregard of both; that I was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per game for a newſpaper, being a private citizen, and wholly abſtracted from politics; that ſhould I ever become a ſuitable object of the ſcrutiny of newſpaper Editors, I would not have any objection to be brought forward, being able and willing to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035272_0027_1001BA9A54527038"/>
defend myſelf; and in fine, after a <hi>lengthy</hi> converſation (excuſe me, Mr. Cobbett, for the uſe of this word) I told him that his informant, whoever he might be, was a liar and a ſcoundrel; and that if theſe terms required any explanation, it might be ſought for and had at No. 118, Market Street.</p>
               <p>I next day waited on Mr. Fenno with the following lines, which were publiſhed in his paper of Thurſday the 20th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember:</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>IN your paper of yeſterday, after a column of virulent abuſe againſt United Iriſhmen, you have introduced my name among thoſe of ſundry perſons, who, your readers are given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, are members of that aſſociation; and thus, with equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, truth, and juſtice, you make me a participator of the abuſe you ſo freely beſtow. I am willing, Sir, to take your word, that you were not the compiler of the liſt, and that in the inſertion of it, you acted merely as Editor, without pretending to vouch for its authenticity. But, Sir, let me aſk you, how can you recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile to your duty, as publiſher of a paper, to attack the character, attempt to injure the intereſt, and diſturb the peace of a fellow-citizen, without fully and ſatisfactorily aſcertaining the truth of the allegations you bring forward? From the very been ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity you formerly diſplayed, reſpecting ſome ſtrictures upon your father, I ſhould have expected more tenderneſs for the feelings of others, than you have exerciſed on this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>To cloſe this lengthy exordium, I now declare unequivocally, that whoever informed you I am a Member of the Society of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Iriſhmen, is a liar, undeſerving of confidence. If I do not apply any harſher epithets, it is not becauſe the writer does not richly deſerve them—but becauſe I think a decent regard for the public ſhould forbid the uſe in a newſpaper of ſuch terms as his conduct merits. If the epithet I uſe, is too hard of digeſtion, he knows where to apply for a remedy. I never in the whole courſe of my life attended a meeting of United Iriſhmen but once, and that was about eighteen months ago.</p>

               <p>I might here diſmiſs the ſubject, ſo far as reſpects the Gazette of the United States. But two facts, connected with it, force themſelves ſo ſtrongly on my mind, that I think it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely unjuſt and improper to omit them.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that the obſervations immediately preceding the liſt, are delivered in the firſt perſon ſingular, the ſtile generally adopted by newſpaper Editors, when they deliver their own ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deciſions. "<hi>I</hi> requeſted Communications"—"Thoſe <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:035272_0028_1001BA9C097B46D0"/>
have received"—"Why ſhould <hi>I</hi> publiſh a dozen of names?"— "<hi>I</hi> ſay, why ſhould <hi>I</hi> inſert in MY paper?" Even the very ſlender covering of <hi>"a Correſpondent obſerves"</hi>—in Italic—or "COMMUNICATION," in capitals—uſed by printers, when they chooſe to ſhift the reſponſibility off their own ſhoulders, was not in this inſtance deemed neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The other fact is, that two of the parties accuſed, John Black and Samuel Park, having in the Gazette of the United States, of the 25th of December, publiſhed a contradiction of the charge of being United Iriſhmen, the former in a well writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten addreſs, and the latter under ſolemn affidavit, Mr. Fenno ſubjoined to their publication the following lines, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conſidered as a complete refutation of all they had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I hurl back in the teeth of theſe fellows every item of their abuſe. <hi>I have called neither of them an United Iriſhman.</hi> If I had, nothing they can ſay or do, would alter my opinions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting them, their principles, or their purpoſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not aſk here—how can the ſtile of the introductory pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphs be reconciled to the idea of mere editorſhip?—nor, if Mr. Fenno <hi>did not</hi> charge thoſe people with being United Iriſhmen, what charge <hi>did</hi> he bring againſt them, or for what conceivable purpoſe did he introduce their names into his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?—Theſe and many other queſtions might be aſked, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious comments added. But I truſt I ſhall have very few read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who will not admit, that the facts themſelves ſcorn the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of comment, illuſtration, or argument.</p>
               <p>I ſent Mr. Fenno a billet, inſiſting on a diſavowal of the charge againſt me. To this he had not the decency to reply. Perhaps he did not know, or at leaſt conſider at the moment, that few things can reflect more honour on a gentleman, than apology for injury, or retractation of error. Irritated by his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and neglect, I was diſpoſed to make application to a lawyer, and ſue him for damages. But diſliking the trouble attendant on it, and conſidering that one affair of the kind at a time, was enough on my hands, I abandoned the idea.</p>
               <p>The reader who has honoured me with his attention thus far, muſt have perceived, that I treat Mr. Fenno in a very different ſtile from Cobbett. The reaſons are obvious. The former has but once attempted to injure me—and the attempt, though a very flagrant one, might have ariſen from miſinformation. He is moreover young and inexperienced. At his age, it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ſomewhat excuſable to carry more ſail than ballaſt— to be more under the dominion of imagination, zeal, and enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, than that of prudence and caution. The latter are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035272_0029_1001BAA1F4A6C280"/>
the fruits of age and experience. Circumſtances, indeed, often accelerate their growth, previous to the cuſtomary period of maturity. And the preſent affair, trivial as it is, may afford Mr. Fenno, an uſeful leſſon, which is not to be deſpiſed, that an overweening zeal, when not duly attempered by prudence, may ſometimes lead him into unpleaſant ſituations, from which it may be very difficult to eſcape, without making a very <hi>"fotuitous"</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the eyes of obſervers. He might have gone on for months with virulent and declamatory paragraphs againſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Iriſhmen, their "Golgothas," their "maſſacres," their "car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, plunder, ravage, and throat-cuttings," till he had rendered them ſo horrible, as to anſwer the ſame very uſeful purpoſe for American nurſes, that the dreadful Malbrouk did for thoſe uſeful ladies in France. But after ſo many weeks of <hi>"dreadful note,"</hi> to bring forward a liſt of <hi>ſeventeen perſons,</hi> and perſons too in ſuch humble walks of life, was worſe than even Edmund Burke's ſublime dagger ſcene in the Houſe of Commons. This ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous liſt, among its other inconveniences, has furniſhed him with the comforts of a ſnug ſuit for damages, commenced by one of the parties, who, by the way, I am informed, is ſtrongly antigallican in his politics, and as much oppoſed as Mr. Fenno, to United Iriſhmen.</p>
               <p>But with Cobbett—with the infamous—with the abandoned Cobbett, who has been teizing me occaſionally ſince the 5th of May 1797, and whom I have borne with a degree of patience that muſt aſtoniſh the reader, as it does myſelf at preſent, what meaſures could I be expected to obſerve? Where find terms of reproach, of opprobrium, adequate to his turpitude, but by ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacking his own abominable works? Never, reader, never, ſhould I have been able to collect the terms of vituperation I have uſed, had I not engaged in a review of the publications of that black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard.</p>

                           <p>I applaud Mr. Fenno's generous zeal in the cauſe of his country; but when he publiſhed his liſt, I looked upon it as <hi>premature,</hi> for certain reaſons which no one could know but myſelf. I therefore did not copy his liſt into my paper; but, ſince <hi>threats</hi> have been thrown out againſt him, and ſince he has been actually <hi>aſſaulted,</hi> for this publication, I am determined to ſhow the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratic crew, that there is at leaſt one man beſides Mr. Fenno, who dares openly to eſpouſe the cauſe of a good government, in ſpite of all the hell of Jacobiniſm.</p>
                           <p>This liſt, trifling as it is, and though it does not charge any man with being an <hi>United Iriſhman,</hi> [what a lying villain!] threw the whole camp into confuſion and uproar. The <hi>Careys</hi> have come forward with a denial, as will be ſeen by the following letters,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                                 <p>James Carey publiſhed in the Gazette of the United States, on the 20th of December, the following letter:—

                                          <p>I ſolemnly declare that I never was a member of the ſociety of United Iriſhmen, either in Ireland or this country; neither was I ever preſent at any of their meetings, nor even propoſed as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to my knowlege. I think it neceſſary, however, to mention that I do not make this declaration to remove any ſuppoſed odium which may be thought to attach to the members of that ſociety; for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the motives and views of that aſſociation to be equally laudable and virtuous—ſo much ſo, that I ſhould not be deterred from becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a member, nor from continuing if I had been one, by all the torrents of abuſe with which they have lately been honored. My principal view is to ſhew the public how falſe your information is with reſpect to that ſociety, even in what occurs almoſt under your very noſe; it is therefore reaſonable to conclude that your ſtatements of the objects and proceedings of remote branches of that aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt, at leaſt, be equally erroneous—much more, it appears, they could not be.</p>

It is well known (from the conſtitution of this ſociety) that its objects are, to aid the rebels in Ireland, or (which is moſt probable) to aid the French, if occaſion ſhould ſerve, againſt the government of the United States; Each of theſe objects is equally hoſtile to the United States; and yet the Careys have the impudence to ſay that Mr. Fenno's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is falſe, when he claſſes them amongſt the <hi>diſaffected Iriſh!!</hi>

                              <hi>"Matthew Ditto"</hi> (I have laughed at this a hundred times) Mathew Ditto ſays that he only <hi>attended</hi> a ſociety of United Iriſhmen. By a peruſal of their <hi>teſt</hi> and rules, it will appear, that he could not <hi>attend</hi> without being a member; and it will alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, from the ſame peruſal, that he could not ceaſe to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, without breaking the ſhocking oath of ſecrecy. The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the compact are eſſentially the ſame as thoſe of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſonry. The horrid oath muſt be broken, or the initiated ſtill remains a United Iriſhman.</p>
                           <p>I have little inclination to <hi>criticiſe</hi> on a production of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Carey's; but, methinks, that <hi>an author</hi> ſhould know how to diſtinguiſh the parts of ſpeech to which his words belong. Mathew firſt calls the word <hi>liar</hi> an <hi>epithet,</hi> and in the next member of the ſentence he calls it a <hi>term.</hi> Yet this man <hi>has been a vamper of geographies</hi> and a grinder of <hi>"Trifles in Proſe."</hi> Theſe poor trifles were the moſt unfortunate in the world; for, though the fineſt attempt at the proſaic bathos that I recollect to have ſeen, I do not believe that ten copies of them were ever ſold. <hi>(The ſcrubby raſcal tells a falſehood. The whole edition is ſold except about ten copies.)</hi> The diminutive volume, like a premature chicken, periſhed with the ſhell on its head.</p>

But the impudence of a Democrat is to be meaſured by his malignity.</p>
                           <p>By the concluſion of Mathew's letter, he is, it ſeems, as uſual, <hi>full of fight.</hi> As it appears to be his intention to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, Mr. Fenno will have a right to chooſe weapons: and, if I were Fenno, I would fight him with a <hi>pen.</hi> Then we ſhall all enjoy the combat.

                     <p>"But, wretch as you are, accurſed by God, and hated by man, the moſt tremendous ſcourge that hell ever vomited forth to curſe a people, by ſowing diſcord among them, I deſire not the honour or credit of being abuſed or vilified by you.

               <p>Part of the preceding letter is omitted. Some of it related to individuals, who are, by common fame, reported to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with Cobbett. Not having reduced to a certainty the information I received on the ſubject, I thought it would be unjuſt and cruel to bring them forward till the fact was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained.</p>
               <p>This letter completely threw away the ſcabbard. It was not eaſy to foreſee what courſe Cobbett would determine to ſteer. Two plans ſtruck my mind, as likely to perplex him conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly which to purſue. One was, to publiſh the letter, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it with a diſcharge of all the ſtink pots, and other fetid and noiſome matter that he could collect.—And of his powerful talents in this line, the world has had many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proofs. The other was, ſneakingly to pocket the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and remain ſilent. When I conſidered the infernal rage and violence of his temper, with his native ſtock of unbluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035272_0035_1001BAB0B607CD68"/>
impudence, I was led to ſuſpect the former. But on the other hand, the ſhocking meanneſs, baſeneſs and cowardice, he had ſo frequently diſplayed, inclined me to look for the latter.</p>
               <p>When I wrote this letter, I was nearly reſolved, if ever he again introduced my name into his Gazette, to publiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals directly for a paper, one main purpoſe of which ſhould be to <q>hang up him and his aſſociates on the tenterhooks of infamy,</q> as a ſort of <hi>monſtra horrenda, in terrorem</hi> to other villains like him, if any ſuch can be found. But after mature conſideration, I felt a ſtrong diſinclination to recur to this ſtep, <hi>except as a dernier reſort.</hi> I thought it better to defer it as long as poſſible, determined it ſhould be forced on me, like the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent appeal. Whenever it happens, it will not be a matter of choice. But the later it comes, abandoned profligate. Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett! the more ſignal will be its effects upon you. This is but a trifling ſpecimen of what you are to receive.</p>
               <p>The trouble and anxiety attendant on a paper are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable—its interference with my other buſineſs would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce very great inconvenience.—There is, moreover, a ſtrong objection to a newſpaper, as many newſpapers are carried on in this country, which renders the editorſhip of one, a ſevere and painful taſk to a man of any liberality of mind.— In England, Ireland, and Scotland, the editors of newſpapers, conſider and treat each other, reciprocally as gentlemen.— Although the colliſion of political opinions there is at leaſt equal to what prevails here, and although the printers and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſupport the parties they eſpouſe with the utmoſt ardour, ſtill, like the gentlemen of the bar, they obſerve, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the rules of decorum and decency towards their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. The deviations from this rule are few, and entail diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour on thoſe who are guilty of them. In fact, the printers are ſeldom the ſubject of attack. Opinions, principles, and ſyſtems are oppoſed and defamed, or ſupported and defended; but, rarely, if ever, does it occur that the publiſhers of thoſe opinions, principles, or ſyſtems, are vilified and abuſed. We fondly copy from England. Would to heaven, for ſake of the national character, that this decent, this honourable, this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanly cuſtom was tranſplanted among us. Here, the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard's vocabulary is exhauſted to collect terms of reproach to heap upon editors, printers, and publiſhers. And, <q>O ſhame! where is thy bluſh!</q> even when the editorſhip of a Gazette devolves, by the death of a huſband, on a helpleſs widow, beings who call themſelves men, and who feel proud of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the name, forgetful of that reſpect for the ſex, which the untutored Indian in ſome degree feels, aſſail, with coarſe
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035272_0036_1001BAB2D7E16F10"/>
and obſcene abuſe, women, incapable of defence! On this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I could bring forward facts, which would, if ſtated in their full deformity, crimſon the cheeks and corrode the breaſts of the guilty. But I ſhall let them paſs for the preſent. A foreigner who reads our papers, muſt form an unfavourable opinion of the taſte and even of the morals of a public, who permit, nay, who countenance ſuch a diſgraceful and atrocious practice.</p>
               <p>To return to Cobbett. As I had preſuppoſed, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed what to do. What a treat it would have been to ſee him raging and ſtorming, curſing and ſwearing, and venting his fury on every perſon dependent on him, after the peruſal of the letter! He did not, however, chooſe either of the plans I had anticipated. In his paper of Monday the 24th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he took no notice of my letter, and had not a line reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, except the following paragraph:</p>
               <p>"No man will doubt that the objects of the combination [of the United Iriſhmen] are of the moſt wicked, and bloody nature; but if any one were inclined to doubt this, I think the fierceneſs with which the Careys came forward to repel what they conſider as a charge of belonging to the ſociety, muſt produce conviction in the minds of the moſt incredulous; for how ſeditious, how dangerous, how deteſtable muſt be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and views of a ſociety, which a fellow of Mathew Carey's politics thinks it neceſſary to forſwear."</p>
               <p>This teizing kind of attack rendered it difficult for me to decide what ground to aſſume. I was unwilling to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a ſuite of appeals, replies, &amp;c. ſuch as would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow any public notice of the ruffian. I therefore paſſed the preceding lines by in ſilence, as but a flight return for the copious doſe ſent him on Sunday.</p>

Since his removal to this city, he has rendered himſelf notoriouſly infamous by a degree of ſcurrility, abuſe, malignity, falſehood, and obſcenity, of which neither the American annals, nor even the records of Grub-ſtreet, can produce any parallel. It was generally believed he had ſunk to the loweſt abyſs of infamy; but, as his exalted friend, Edmund Burke, ſays, <q>in the loweſt hell there was ſtill a lower, and in he leaped:</q> for being ſome time ſince challenged for his blackguardiſm, he proved himſelf, in the face of America, A COWARD as well as A RASCAL; having recourſe to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to ſecure him from the vengeance he had ſo richly earned.</p>

                  <p>Curſory Obſervations, on the cauſe of Cobbet's Spite and Malice. Iriſhmen. National Prejudices. Liberality.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>It has frequently ſtruck me with ſurpriſe, wherefore has the villain Cobbett, manifeſted ſuch an infuriate hatred againſt me. I have exerted myſelf to aſcertain the motive, and believe I have at length diſcovered it. I am by birth an Iriſhman. And feeling the prejudices which the vulgar and low bred among his countrymen entertain for the people of other countries, he can never forgive me the ſin of being a native of Ireland. That Engliſhmen of education are above this diſgraceful prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, I am proud to acknowledge. But they muſt confeſs, and many of them have done ſo to me, that the canaille of their countrymen, ſuch as Cobbett, are more under the influence of it, than the canaille of any other country whatever.</p>
               <p>Yes, I am an Iriſhman by birth—although I am a citizen of the United States, by reſidence and by a full compliance with all the regulations and conditions deviſed for the purpoſe. The former title I deem as valuable as the latter. I ſee nothing in the hiſtory of my country to render me aſhamed of her—
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035272_0039_1001BAB755BF6200"/>
and I truſt ſhe ſhall never be aſhamed of me. Ireland! Ireland! country eminently bleſt by nature with almoſt every advantage that heaven in its utmoſt kindneſs could beſtow, of ſituation, rivers, bays, inſularity, robuſtneſs of natives, fertility of ſoil, and mildneſs of climate, but, for centuries, curſed with the hardeſt fortune, when I forget or deſpiſe thee, when I ceaſe to rejoice in your ſucceſſes, and weep over your miſeries,
<q>
                     <l>"Let me be branded for the public ſcorn,</l>
                     <l>"Turn'd forth, and driven to wander like a beggar;</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Let vulgar, illiberal ſouls, whether they "ſtrut in ermine or brocade"—or are <hi>"ſtuck o'er with titles,"</hi> diſgrace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by caſting national reflections on the natives of Ireland. [Nothing can add to the meanneſs and baſeneſs of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, except its being, as it is ſometimes, practiſed by children of Iriſhmen.] Let them, to anſwer their contracted purpoſes, forget or pretend to forget that honour, virtue, truth and honeſty, are "of no country"—that <q>in every country, he that worketh righteouſneſs is accepted of God</q> and ought to be equally ſo of man—Let them mark their preferences and attachments, as well as their rejections and hatreds, by the "geographical diſtinctions of birth"—and with 'microſcopic eye' trace the map to aſcertain whether a man is upright or wicked.</p>

                  <l>"Like a ſtrong mountain, or ſome ſtately tree,</l>
                  <l>"My ſoul grows firm, upright,</l>
                  <l>"And as I ſtand, and as I go,</l>
                  <l>"It keeps my body ſo."</l>
               </q>
               <p>If Cobbett was not a baſe hind, the attachment an Iriſhman feels for his country, would excite his eſteem. He is an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman. For England he feels, or affects to feel an enthuſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic affection. Why ſhould he not ſuffer Iriſhmen to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the ſame motives? Why ſhall a line of conduct, on which he ſo highly prides himſelf, be diſreputable or diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in another man?</p>
               <p>His ſordid, wretched mind, incapable of appreciating the force of thoſe liberal motives, purſues the Iriſh nation with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal malice. Whenever he introduces them into his abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable paper, he ſeems to labour to invent new terms of reproach to appeaſe his direful rage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:035272_0040_1001A193D2ED0050"/>There is one circumſtance alone, which has made me almoſt aſhamed of being an Iriſhman—That is, the tameneſs and puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity with which ſo many of my countrymen have ſubmitted to the abuſe of the vagabond! How many of them are in this city, at leaſt equally ſtrong and powerful with this ruffian! Where is their reſolution, where their courage, to allow him to paſs with impunity! Could they perform a greater act of juſtice, or render a more acceptable ſervice to their inſulted country, than by promoting the circulation of his blood with a good doſe of ſhillelah, adminiſtered with due vigour? A vuarter of the ſpirit that many of them have diſplayed in their own country to procure ſatisfaction for ſome imaginary offence, would have been ſufficient, to ſtrike a damp into his inmoſt ſoul—and made
<q>
                     <l>"A deadly fear o'er all his vitals reign,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But there is one thing more infamous, if poſſible, than the patience with which the abuſe of the ſcoundrel is borne. That is, that there are Iriſhmen degenerate enough to be found among the ſubſcribers of a blackguard ruſſian, whoſe chief ſtudy ſeems to be, to heap abuſe and infamy on their country.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Petite guerre on the part of Cobbett—A very valuable hint to increaſe the revenue ariſing from the poſt-office.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>It is obvious, that the intercourſe between Cobbett and me, as ſtated in Chap. V. appeared in the eyes of the world to give him the advantage. It is true, I was pouring red-hot balls into his works, which were rapidly demoliſhing them, and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he only kept up a ſmall fire of muſketry, of little importance. But there was this difference in his favour—my cannonade was unperceived by the public—while his was daily ſpread abroad in his <hi>"dirty diſh-clout."</hi> Affairs could not long remain in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. My patience, ſo often tried, was nearly exhauſted. I had made ſacrifices enough for ſake of quiet. I felt humbled to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo long to a wretch—the vileſt of the vile. The cup of my indignation and reſentment was brimful. A ſingle drop would make it overflow. Still it required further provocation to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the extreme reluctance I felt to treſpaſs on the public.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035272_0041_1001BAC0876B6DE8"/>
The miſcreant, meaſuring me by himſelf, miſtook my motives. He thought, after what I had borne, that he might continue his <hi>petite guerre</hi> with impunity. This would lead any perſon to whom I might ſhew the letters I ſent him, to ſuppoſe he had gained the victory.</p>
               <p>In his paper of Saturday the 5th of June, he publiſhed the following paragraph, which, though not ſo atrocious as ſome he had previouſly printed, was the over-flowing drop.—</p>
               <p>"The Sans-culottes, in general, are moſt mortally grieved at the news lately come to had. But, what muſt be the ſhame, the confuſion, the infernal torments, of the <hi>Sans-culotte Iriſh!</hi> I would not exchange ſituations with ſuch a man as <hi>Reynolds</hi> or <hi>Clytus Carey</hi> for only one hour, for all the riches of the world; for I am ſure I ſhould become my own executioner before half the hour were out."</p>
               <p>The latter part of this paragraph demands a few obſervations. It proves, if any further proof were neceſſary, that Cobbett is either a liar or a hypocrite, or both. His papers almoſt daily abound with the moſt pious and ſolemn profeſſious of his veneration for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. To read ſome of theſe phariſaical effuſions, any perſon, who did not know what a villain he was, would be tempted to think him a ſaint, preſerved in exiſtence to reclaim a ſinful world from its wicked ways. But in what part of the Bible, or in what part of the conduct of Jeſus Chriſt, does he find any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for the horrid crime of ſuicide—ſelf-murder?—<hi>"I ſhould become my own executioner before half the hour were out."</hi> Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, there is no ſuch happineſs in ſtore for mankind. It is not to be hoped or expected that he will ſpare the hangman an office, which he has owed him theſe four years. The craven coward would not have nerve enough to perform this act of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the only reparation he can make for his manifold crimes.</p>
               <p>The term "Clytus Carey," may require a little explanation, Cobbett, in the efferveſcence of his inſolence and impudence, had attempted to cover with his ſlime Mr. Hopkinſon, a lawyer, whoſe politics are highly, federal. This attack, with that on General Marſhall, and other federaliſts, irritated ſeveral gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had been his patrons, and been highly ſatisfied, while he vented his abuſe on their political enemies alone. But as ſoon as he began to vilify their friends, they ſhrewdly found our, what had appeared obvious enough long before, that he was a ſcoundrel. Accordingly a writer in the Philadelphia Gazette, under the ſignature of Clytus, bombarded the poor devil ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely as to make him repent his temerity. Here he proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as complete a raſcal as he had ever done before. A friend
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035272_0042_1001A1710E5E0638"/>
ſtepped in to defend him, and was in conſequence ſeverely han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by Clytus. Cobbett, like a ſneaking, paltry fellow, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him to Clytus, and never dared reply, either to defend that friend or himſelf.</p>
               <p>Mark the artifice of the villain. To diſarm the writings of "Clytus" of their force with federaliſts, he inſinuates that they were written by me, an avowed enemy of his politics! Poor, miſerable ſubterfuge, worthy of ſuch a poor miſerable ſcoundrell On Mr. Brown, printer of the Philadelphia Gazette, I call to teſtify that I never wrote a line or word of Clytus.</p>
               <p>As many perſons have in vain ordered Cobbett to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue the papers he ſends them, I take this opportunity to furniſh them gratis with an infallible receipt to oblige him to keep his "diſh-clout" at home, and to increaſe the poſt office revenues. Let them fold up his papers carefully, put them under cover of a large and heavy ſheet of writing paper, direct them to William Cobbett, Philadelphia, and put them into the poſt-office. They will be decently brought back to him as letters —and coſt him a quarter dollar, half a dollar, or three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters each, according to the diſtance. He will then reſcue them from the diſgrace of receiving the paper, in order to ſave the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of poſtage. <hi>Probatum eſt.</hi>

                  <p>Cobbett's literary frauds. Beauties of Porcupine. Concluſion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>That Cobbett is an unprincipled villain, is too well known to require any illuſtration or enforcement. But how groſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous are his miſrepreſentations, few people know, as very few readers of newſpapers take the trouble of comparing quotations and extracts with the originals whence they are pretended to be drawn. But the following inſtance will ſatisfy every man, how ſuperlative a ſcoundrel he is.</p>
               <p>In the Commercial Advertiſer, publiſhed by Mr. Noah Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, of New-York, there appeared on the 8th of July 1798, a <hi>"lengthy"</hi> paragraph, which Cobbett republiſhed on the 11th of the ſame month.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Porcupine's Gazette, No. 419, page 3, column 1.</note> Part of it follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It would ſeem as if <hi>England</hi> and France could never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us, for being an independent and a happy people; and as
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035272_0043_1001BAC414A21AC0"/>
we may preſume that Providence is on our ſide, we defy all <hi>their</hi> impotent and impious attempts to check his views, to lead us kindly by the hand to a ſtate of inevitable proſperity and happineſs as yet unknown on earth. Previous to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, <hi>the Britiſh inſulted us</hi> by emptying all their <hi>condemned convicts</hi> on our ſhores—We ſupplicated in vain to prevent it; but mark the finger of Heaven—<hi>moſt of theſe very men entered into the American army and the greater part of them periſhed fighting valiantly for the liberty of America.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Two days afterwards, the 13th of that month,<note n="†" place="bottom">See Porcupine's Gazette, No. 421, page 2, column 3.</note> Cobbett vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited forth againſt Mr. Webſter, a torrent of the fouleſt abuſe: and, unparalleled effrontery! in quoting his words, he ſtates them as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Noah Webſter inſiſts that the heroes who fell in defence of American freedom, were, in great part, compoſed of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victs whom Great-Britain emptied on theſe ſhores.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, to whatever party or country you belong, whether you are Engliſhman or Iriſhman, Scotchman or Dutchman, fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt or antifederaliſt, ariſtocrat or democrat, if you are an honeſt man, lay your hand on your heart, and pronounce ſentence on this fraud. Mark well the difference between the idea convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Webſter and that forced on him by his vile commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator. The former is correct. Many men, convicted in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of ſlight offences, and tranſported to this country, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their lives, (and, great a raſcal as Cobbett is, even he may reform) and become uſeful and exemplary citizens. Some of the firſt offices in this country, when its purity of morals and manners was equal to that of any country under the canopy of heaven, have been filled by ſuch men. Of this no man, but an ignoramus, can pretend to doubt. And the ſtatement of the fact could give no offence to any rational American.</p>
               <p>But Cobbett's infamous poſition, <q>that the heroes who fell in defence of American freedom, were in great part compoſed of the convicts whom Great Britain emptied on theſe ſhores,</q> is a moſt monſtrous and abominable falſhood; and had Mr. Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or any other man, made ſuch a declaration, he would have merited to be ſent out of New-York, as I hope to ſee Cobbett ſent out of Philadelphia, with diſgrace and diſhonour.</p>
               <p>I have not done with this infamous buſineſs. Cobbett's "diſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clout" is the ſole vehicle to convey intelligence to many parts of the union. On his pages hundreds of citizens depend ſolely for information. What precious information it muſt be, paſſing through ſuch a foul, corrupted channel, and from ſuch a raſcally ſource! Will any man be <hi>"fatuitous"</hi> and mad enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035272_0044_1001BAC6A7259370"/>
upon the foreign intelligence of a villain who miſquotes, <hi>in two days,</hi> articles republiſhed <hi>in his own paper!</hi> In fact, there is no correct news to be had from Porcupine's Gazette. The quantity of domeſtic lies and ſcurrility he publiſhes, leaves little room for foreign information. What he does introduce, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo garbled, and ſo intermingled with his own diſguſting comments, that without the aſſiſtance of ſome other paper, no man can conceive a correct idea of the real ſtate of affairs.</p>
               <p>Some months ſince, a veſſel arrived at Norfolk, which brought recent intelligence from Europe. The Norfolk printers publiſhed a ſupplement of near a column in length, which was brought to this city on Sunday morning. Cobbett received a copy of it. Short as it was, the whole did not ſuit his views. He omitted about a third—that is to ſay, all that he wiſhed not to be true. Mr. Bradford likewiſe received a copy, and publiſhed it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. The fraud was diſcovered—and the villain ſtood confeſſed.</p>
               <p>Now, reader, I do not pretend that two news-printers are to be expected to make the ſame ſelection from the ſame file of papers. By no means. The extreme diverſity of talents, views, and wiſhes, will inevitably lead them to vary their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. While ſuch a wretch as Cobbett, fills his columns, with unmeaning chit-chat from the London papers, and other matter, equally unintereſting to his readers, an intelligent, enlightened editor will ſelect thoſe important articles calculated to inform the public of the ſtate of affairs, at this momentous criſis. For ſelections ſo trivial as I have ſtated, I blame not Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet. That he is unqualified for the weighty, important, and very influential office of editor of a gazette, in his misfortune and that of the public—but is no crime. But I aſſert confidently, that no man but an arrant raſcal, who ought to be branded, and expelled from the commonwealth of letters, would be guilty of the miſquotation I have ſtated of Mr. Webſter's words, and of the ſuppreſſion of part of the Norfolk news. The raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality of the former tranſaction can only be equalled by its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and contempt of the public, whom the blackguard moſt have ſuppoſed incapable of detecting his impoſture.</p>

               <p>Reader, I have turned four commas at the beginning of each line of the above paragraph, in order to prove to you that it is an extract from the works of William Cobbett, ex-corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in his Britannic majeſty's ſervice. It is none of my manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture; it is to be found in the firſt volume of the works of that learned gentleman, beating the following lines in the title page—
<q>PHILADELPHIA, <hi>Printed by WILLIAM YOUNG, for</hi> WILLIAM COBBETT OPPOSITE CHRIST'S CHURCH, —1797.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>This title page, take notice, is at page 89 of the volume —and the extract, above emphatically marked with four com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, about the Engliſh—and their iſland—truth—and the devil —and all the reſt of it, is to be found in page 155—which, being interpreted, means, in the vulgar tongue, one hundred and fifty-five.</p>
               <p>The following quotations are unfit for female eyes to ſee, or female ears to hear. I therefore print them in hieroglyphics, which the ladies, if any deign to read theſe pages, cannot, I hope, decypher.</p>

               <p>A perſon brought forward on oath a heinous charge againſt Cobbett, who refuted the whole by the following logical proof of his innocence: <q>The vagabond, at this moment, looks like a carcaſs newly dropped from the gallows. He is ragged, dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, louſy-looking, and ſtinking. He is a walking dunghill; a naſty compound of all hues; in his perſon; and, in his character, he is a rebel, a ſponge-paying debtor, and a ſcape-gallows.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I will not debaſe myſelf by oppoſing my <hi>bare word</hi> to the oath of ſuch a villain as this is. To ſay who and what he is, and who are his connexions, is enough. Thoſe who want more from me, are informed that I deſpiſe their opinions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>* * * * * * *</p>
               <p>I have juſt learned, as this laſt half ſheet is going to preſs, that Cobbett threatens to aſſault me in the ſtreets, for the libel which, he ſays, I am about to publiſh, and of which ſome of his ſpies have gained information, by pimping in the printing office employed on the work. So then! the villain who has for years blackguarded whom he pleaſed, and when remonſtrated with, inſiſted on his right to exerciſe the liberty of the preſs, winces at the <hi>lex talionis</hi>—and wiſhes to debar <hi>me</hi> of what he calls the liberty <hi>of the preſs.</hi> Very good, maſter Cobbett, very good! So you can feel, as well as your neighbours! This is charming. You ſhall, like <hi>Perillus,</hi> try the tortures you have ſo long impudently and wickedly inflicted. It has been amuſement to you, to <hi>raſcal and ſcoundrel</hi> every body whom you diſliked—but you do not find it very amuſing to be <hi>raſcalled and ſcoundreled</hi> in turn. You muſt, as the blackguards, your aſſociates, ſay, <hi>grin and bear it.</hi> Do not, however, get into a paſſion too ſoon. Wait a little, till you and your ſcoundrelly prompter ſee what a rod is in ſoke for you both. Then be angry as ſoon as you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Cowards and raſcals are dangerous enemies. I would, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> rather have a conteſt of any ſort whatever, with ten gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, than with one Cobbett. But ſhould he aſſume courage enough to attempt to put his threats into execution, I ſhall
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035272_0048_1001BAD18499F2B0"/>
be prepared for the villain, and "by the beard of Pharaoh" I ſhall give him as warm a reception as in my power. Should there be, on the ſettlement of accounts, any balance in his favour, which I cannot myſelf pay, if I can for one hundred dollars procure as great a ruffian, ſcoundrel and blackguard as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, [and though it will be difficult to find his equal, yet it is not impoſſible] to diſcharge the debt with a good ſmart hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kory ſtick, may diſgrace and infamy be my portion, if I do not chearfully pay the ſum, and riſk the conſequences.</p>

               <p>An old rancorous wretch, Cobbett's pimp and pander, talks too of law-ſuits. If I am ſued for any thing contained in this pamphlet, I ſhall make no other defence, than to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judge and jury the provocations I have experienced. I ſhall not inſult Philadelphia by ſuppoſing it poſſible to find in it a jury capable of granting a verdict for a libel in favour of this prince of libellers and ſlanderers.</p>
               <p>Let this ſanctified ſinner beware. He knows that I am in his debt, and as able as willing to pay. He may purchaſe an exemption by crawling within his hole, and remaining in obſcurity. But if he provokes me to drag him forward, <q>like Cucus from his den</q> [old gentleman, don't you remember this?] he may reſt aſſured, that he will rival Porcupine in celebrity in a very ſhort time.</p>
