            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOU are requeſted to meet at the city of Annapolis, on Monday the 16th inſtant, to nominate deputies to attend, on behalf of this county, at the next provincial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and to chuſe a committee of obſervation; permit me to offer to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the reaſons, which induce me to ſolicit your attendance on that day. The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience ariſing from the ſeaſon of the year, I am ſatisfied, will not prevent you, if convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that your duty to your country requires your attendance. You have always diſtinguiſhed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> cauſe of liberty, and never been exceeded by any county, in zeal and public ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Your liberty and happineſs, and that of your poſterity, depend on the event of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtruggle with the Britiſh miniſtry: they ſeem determined to make you ſlaves, you are reſolved to be free: the American congreſs has pointed out the means of preſerving free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: a ſuſpenſion of your trade;—and the neceſſary preparations to enable you to repel force by force, if that ſhould be employed to ſubvert your rights and liberties: theſe are the means recommended by the united opinion and advice of America. The freedom of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, the political ſalvation of all Britiſh America, can only be ſecured by executing with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and reſolution the advice of the congreſs.</p>
            <p>A ſtrict compliance with the aſſociation and reſolves of our late provincial convention, d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends in great meaſure on a prudent and wiſe choice of your committee of obſervation: I would recommend it to conſiſt of a conſiderable number of gentlemen of the beſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fortune, and influence in the county, without any regard to profeſſion, religion, or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; men able to ſpeak your ſenſe on any queſtion, and to whoſe reſolutions you would wiſh to give that weight, which their utility, and the public good might require.</p>
            <p>The appointment of deputies, to repreſent this county, at the next convention, in April; which will not be held, if American grievances ſhould in the mean time be redreſſed, appears to me of the greateſt conſequence, and to demand your moſt deliberate attention: If the Britiſh miniſtry ſhould continue deaf to our complaints, and to the voice of reaſon, of policy, and juſtice, and and ſhould determine to enforce, at all events, its arbitrary decrees, how dreadful would be our ſituation, in the midſt of all the horrors and calamities of civil war! We ſcorn, we reject with contempt, the baſe humiliating conditions of ſlavery—We are determined to reſiſt even unto death, to ſave our country, or bravely periſh in her ruins. If American griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ſhould not be redreſſed (and I fear they will not) queſtions of ſuch a magnitude and difficulty <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ariſe, as to require the united wiſdom, knowledge, and fortitude of this province. Your virtue will then be put to a ſevere trial—Conſider then with attention, the nature and importance of the truſt, and to whom you delegate your power at this very critical and alarming criſis of your affairs.—You never were called on to exerciſe your great conſtitutional right of electing your repreſentatives, at a time which required more judgment in your choice. I would recommend but one <hi>TEST—an honeſt man with ability and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>—</p>
            <p>"The Congreſs thought themſelves bound in duty to obſerve to the colonies, that the ſchemes agitated againſt them had been ſo conducted as to render it prudent, <hi>that they ſhould extend their views to the moſt unhappy events, and be in all reſpects prepared for every contingency.</hi>" The neceſſary means of preparation were left to each province, as beſt acquainted with their own peculiar circumſtances.—Your deputies met in provincial convention were of opinion, that a well regulated militia is the natural ſtrength and only ſtable ſecurity of a free government, and <hi>unanimouſly</hi> recommended to the freemen of this province to form themſelves into companies, chuſe their officers, learn the military exerciſe, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with arms and ammunition, in readineſs to act on any emergency, and to raiſe money for the purchaſe of arms and ammunition: They entreated, they conjured every man by his duty to God, his country, and his poſterity, cordially to unite in defence of our common rights and liberties. I want no argument to convince me of the immediate neceſſity of putting this province in a poſture of defence. If any one ſhould object to the meaſure, I would anſwer, THE CONGRESS ADVISED IT:—<hi>The deputies of all the counties of this province unanimouſly recommended it</hi>: The firſt with me is ſufficient, the latter concluſive: The deputies were gentlemen of the firſt fortunes, ability, and knowledge, well acquainted with our circumſtances, and undoubtedly ſpoke the ſenſe of the whole province. The private opinions of ſome few indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> reſpectable for integrity of character, ſoundneſs of judgement, and their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the cauſe of America, ought to have little weight in oppoſition to the advice of the continental congreſs, and the recommendation of your own provincial convention.</p>
            <p>I have not the leaſt doubt that this county will inviolably obſerve and execute the aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the reſolves of the province: I queſtion not but a very great majority of you will form yourſelves into a militia, and liberally contribute for the purchaſe of arms and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Every man is bound to ſerve his country; all are obliged, or none. Every man is bound to contribute his endeavours to advance and ſecure the general good. This county is called
<pb facs="unknown:013816_0002_0F91EC5B0D11DEF8"/>
on by the province to raiſe £. 866, for the purchaſe of arms and ammunition. Every man then in this county is bound to contribute in ſome proportion to the property which he holds, and the more his property is worth, the more he ought to pay for the ſecurity of it. But there are a few among you (I rejoice but a few) who, in this time of public danger and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſeparate themſelves from their country, and though bleſſed with very ample fortunes, refuſe, or decline, to contribute any part thereof, to the ſupport of the public cauſe, or to unite in defence of our common rights and liberties.—Our convention in June recommended contributions for the ſupport of our diſtreſſed brethren in Boſton; not one farth<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> was given by the ſame gentlemen; a congreſs was deemed proper to collect the ſenſe of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſame perſons did not contribute to the ſupport of your delegates: the congreſs <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the colonies to arm in defence of their liberties; your late convention <hi>unanimouſly</hi> recommended a militia, and ſubſcriptions to raiſe money for the purchaſe of arms and ammunition; the ſame men, perſevering in the ſame line of conduct, have declined to comply with either of the requiſitions; they withdraw their perſons and their fortunes from the ſervice of their country: but they are as much intereſted, and have as deep a ſtake to loſe as any other men in the province; they, and their poſterity are to enjoy, with you, all advantages ariſing from the ſucceſs of the preſent conteſt with Great-Britain; they muſt be involved with you in all the conſequences of a ſlaviſh ſubjection; liberty procured by you will be equally enjoyed by them; ſlavery fixed on you will be equally intailed on them and their poſterity.—If ſuch indeed was their ſituation, it would be difficult to account for their conduct.—In truth, if Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ſucceeds, they will be benefitted as much as any men in the province, without contributing any part of their property, without any riſque of forfeitures, and with ſafety to their perſons; their preſent behaviour may entitle them to the protection of the miniſtry. If we fail, they will poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs their eſtates, and enjoy their offices; promotion may reward their preſent conduct, and their reſentment may be gratified by ſeeing ſome of your beſt and firmeſt friends, executed as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and traitors.—Such is the double, crafty, and, in their opinion, ſecure game played by ſome few among you. Place, therefore, no confidence in ſuch men, view them as foes to the rights of Britiſh America, let their names be publiſhed to the world, that they may be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally contemned, as the enemies of American liberty; let them be the object of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but let them not feel the force of your reſentment.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude without once more earneſtly requeſting a full meeting of the county: numbers will command reſpect, and give weight to your reſolutions.</p>
