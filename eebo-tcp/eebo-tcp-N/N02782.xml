            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Job II. vii.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>So went Satan forth from the Preſence of the Lord, and ſmote <hi>Job</hi> with ſore Boils, from the ſole of his Foot unto his Crown.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHEN the Enemy of Mankind was firſt permitted to tempt the Faith and Patience of holy <hi>Job,</hi> his Eſtate and Family only were made liable to his Power, with an expreſs Command not to touch his Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003315_0003_0FF02743804273B8"/>This I look upon to have been almoſt as great a Temptation as the ſpoiling of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or the ſlaughter of his Children, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the common Opinion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath uſually eſteemed the ſurvival of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Misfortune, to be the greater Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of the two.</p>
            <p>Under ſuch Afflictions 'tis very hard for a Man to moderate his Paſſion; for Grief is natural, and the exceſs of it eaſily run into: But to reſtrain and curb it, and not ſuffer it to exceed its juſt Limits, to feel Sorrow as a Man, and to aſſwage it from proper Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations as a wiſe Man, is a ſtrain above Nature, and properly conſtitutes that paſſive Vertue, which we call <hi>Patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus our Hero, being plundered of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and bereaved of his Children, reduced from Affluence to Beggary, and in danger that his Name, in the preſent <hi>Generation fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,</hi> ſhould in the next be <hi>clean put out</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 109. 12.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhewing a juſt Reſentment of theſe ſevere Diſpenſations, by rending his Clothes, and other his Country Tokens of Diſtreſs; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the Hand that ſmote him, reſolves all into the good Pleaſure of that Providence,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003315_0004_0FF027450A3111E0"/>
which was about to reſume what it had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto lent; and dutifully reſigns what he had thankfully received, and wiſely uſed as a Steward only, without arrogating to himſelf the Right of a Proprietor. <hi>Naked,</hi> ſays he, <hi>came I out of my Mother's Womb, and naked ſhall I return thither: The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job 1. 21.</note>!</p>
            <p>The ſuddain Fall of this great Man may ſerve to ſhew us, how unable all human Means are of themſelves to ſupport us, when it ſhall pleaſe God to withdraw the Bleſſing of his Protection: That we cannot be ſecure againſt the <hi>Changes and Chances of this Mortal Life,</hi> in any Acquiſition of Power, or Riches, or Reputation, no not in <hi>keeping Innocency,</hi> and <hi>taking heed to the thing that is right,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Concurrence of Divine Providence: That God many times may afflict without forſaking his Servants. And when it ſhall ſeem good to him to call us forth, into the rough Paths of Suffering; if He ſhall pleaſe to <hi>miniſh</hi> and <hi>bring us low</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 107. 39.</note>; the Example of our Text will teach us, not to behave unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or <hi>charge God fooliſhly</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Job 2. 22.</note>, but with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Meekneſs, and Reſignation, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003315_0005_0FEFDA0525594398"/>
Contentedneſs, take what <hi>He</hi> lays upon us, whoſe is the <hi>Kingdom and the Power,</hi> and to whom for that very Reaſon we ſhould give, even in ſuch Circumſtances, <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Attempt of the Devil being thus baffled, and the Sincerity of the Holy Man found to be eſtabliſhed upon more ſolid Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, than what the Accuſer had urged to his own, as well as <hi>Job</hi> his Diſadvantage; he next inſinuates that <hi>Job</hi> was a Man of ſo mean a Spirit, as to be glad of Life upon any Terms; and ſo prevailing was this Paſſion in him above all other, that it was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſideration that kept him in his Duty to God; for fear of being <hi>cut off from the Land of the Living: Put forth now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>thine Hand, and touch his Bone, and his Fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy Face</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job 2. 5.</note>. That is, afflict him in his Body, let ſome painful, ſome acute Diſtemper make his Life burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, without any hope of Recovery, and his Hypocriſy will diſplay it ſelf, and you will find he will throw off all the Regard he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to have for God, and will openly arraign and blaſpheme his Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003315_0006_0FEFDA0748BFCEA0"/>Upon this Inſinuation, the Devil obtains Permiſſion a ſecond Time to try our Man of Fortitude, what Impreſſion bodily Pain, and loſs of Health would make upon him, whoſe Vertue under the Loſſes he had lately ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſtood ſtill fix'd and impregnable.</p>
            <p>Indeed his Malice was limited, and the good Man's Life was to be ſecured, but that was more than <hi>Job</hi> knew: So that the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi> had all the real Advantages againſt him, that he could poſſibly deſire.</p>
            <p>According to his uſual Way, after being once defeated, he returns to the Aſſault, with freſh Vigour and additional Strength. Temptations like Waves break in upon us, one upon the neck of another, and commonly the laſt is the biggeſt, and goes the fartheſt. 'Twas hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Job</hi> to be deprived of his worldly Goods, harder to be bereaved of his Children, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all when theſe were gone, to be yet worſe handled, buried as it were alive, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Corruption</hi> before his Time, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of a ſore noiſome Diſtemper, which excluded him the Society of Mankind, and even then his <hi>Reputation,</hi> the only <hi>uninfected</hi> thing left, as inhumanly treated as his Body.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003315_0007_0FF02746F39A9628"/>
And ſo we are come to the Words of our Text, <hi>So went Satan forth from the Preſence of the Lord, and ſmote</hi> Job <hi>with ſore Boils, from the ſole of his Foot unto his Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Silence of Scripture hath given Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters Occaſion of gueſſing at the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which the Devil here inflicted upon <hi>Job</hi>: But among them all, it appears not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what it was. I will therefore deſire to give an Opinion, equally I think true, with any that hath yet been taken Notice of: It is this, That the Devil by ſome <hi>venemous Infuſion</hi> into the Body of <hi>Job,</hi> might raiſe his Blood to ſuch a Ferment, as threw out a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi> of <hi>inflammatory Puſtules</hi> all over him from Head to Foot: That is, his Diſtemper might be what is now incident to moſt Men, and perhaps conveyed to him by ſome ſuch Way as that of <hi>Inoculation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not at preſent ſee what can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to invalidate this Suppoſition, which I look upon to be as tenable as any that is extant about this Matter: Having this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Advantage, that the Scene of Action lies in thoſe parts of the World, whence this Practice is <hi>confeſſedly</hi> derived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003315_0008_0FF0274ACB53CF90"/>The Tempter's Aim was ſtill the ſame as before; to make his <hi>Patient</hi> let go his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, throw off his Dependance upon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and renounce that Allegiance which is juſtly due to him, as Creator and Governour of the World: To perſuade him, that if any thing, he was the worſe for his conſtant Obedience to God, who made him ſo ſevere Returns for his faithful Services; and ſo by Conſequence, comparing his paſt Deſerts and preſent Treatment together, to infer, that God was a <hi>hard Maſter,</hi> or that he neglected to ſuperintend human Affairs; on rather to ask <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>Who is the Lord</hi>? and ſo, lay in his Misfortune a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for Infidelity.</p>
            <p>How in all theſe Deſigns the Devil was diſappointed, it may be well worth our Pains to enquire: In order to do this, it is not at all improbable to ſuppoſe that the holy Man might duly conſider theſe two Points.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For what Cauſes Diſeaſes are ſent amongſt Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who it is that has the Power of inflicting them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003315_0009_0FF0274D5828FB78"/>Let us then accompany him in the firſt Place, in finding out the Cauſes why Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are ſent amongſt Mankind.</p>
            <p>I take them to be principally two: Either for the Trial of our Faith, or for the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Sins.</p>

            <p>Some Sins it pleaſes God to ſtrike immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in a more remarkable Manner, as he did <hi>Herod</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts 12. 23.</note>; while others do naturally and by degrees, advance to the Puniſhment they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: Thus habitual Drunkenneſs and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, will ruin Health, and impair Eſtates, and induce a diſtempered old Age as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſequence of a riotous youthful one.

Virtuous through fear of the Conſequences, even when Inclination has gotten the better of his Duty.

So that we ſee the worſt of evils have their Uſe, and in this Senſe, and by proper Reflections, we may make a Moral of the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>Should all Reſtraints of this Sort be taken away, were there no fear of Puniſhment in this Life, nor belief of any in the next; ſhould Iniquity and Reputation be join'd together, and Health be Handmaid to Uncleanneſs; we may conjecture from preſent Diſorders, how mightily they would encreaſe, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably be eſtabliſhed; ſo that we have good Reaſon to bleſs and praiſe Almighty God for the wholeſome Severities ordained for Offenders, without which, the World would be a much more uncomfortable Place to live in, than it is at preſent. And this brings me to the ſecond Conſideration, which is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who it is that hath the Power of inflicting Diſeaſes upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003315_0014_0FF0275D88561820"/>Our Text indeed aſcribes <hi>Job</hi>'s Diſtemper to the Power of the <hi>Devil</hi>; but the foregoing Verſe ſhews <hi>that Power</hi> to have been deliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and limited by Almighty God, who alone being Omnipotent, the Powers that be, whether <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Political</hi>), muſt all be derived from him. 'Tis true, he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated ſeveral Parts of his Sovereignty to the Sons of Men, but ſtill the Exerciſe of it will ultimately be reſolved into his Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And it is as true, that there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Branches of Authority, which he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to himſelf, in diſplaying of which, he acts upon Prerogative, and without human Intervention. I chuſe to Inſtance in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of Diſeaſes, which I will attempt to prove are utterly unlawful to be inflicted by any who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed where the Doctrines of Salvation are not known, and a regular Dependance upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is poſtponed to the abſurd belief of a <hi>Fatality</hi>; there it is no wonder to ſee Men give into impious or unreaſonable Practices: But in a Country where better Principles are <hi>eſtabliſhed,</hi> where God's Government of the World is for the moſt Part undiſputed, and ſlaviſh implicit Belief happily ſuperſeded by rational Enquiries; in ſuch a Place, methinks,

Men cannot eaſily be reconciled to a <hi>Practice,</hi> which abuſes their <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> as well as inſults their <hi>Religion</hi>; and if the received Notions of God's Providence be juſt, has its Foundation in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (if at all) by <hi>Preſumption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Holy Scriptures give us frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of God's giving Power unto Men to <hi>heal Diſeaſes</hi>; and by his Bleſſing a Power is ſtill continued: But that one was ever grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>inflict Diſeaſes,</hi> will I think hardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; unleſs in the Caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> with the <hi>Egyptians</hi>

Set of <hi>adventurous Practitioners</hi> have of late pretended to aſſume.</p>
            <p>It will eaſily be granted, therefore, that ſuch a Procedure, for want of a <hi>competent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> is unlawful: That if Diſeaſes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned, are ſent unto us for the <hi>Trial of our Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Puniſhment of our Sins</hi>; He alone to whom our Faith muſt <hi>approve it</hi> ſelf, and our <hi>Sins are manifeſt,</hi> has <hi>properly</hi> the Power of inflicting them.</p>
            <p>Remembring then our Text, I ſhall not ſcruple to call that a <hi>Diabolical Operation,</hi> which uſurps an Authority founded neither in the Laws of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> which tends in this Caſe to anticipate and baniſh <hi>Providence</hi> out of the World, and promotes the encreaſe of Vice and Immorality.</p>
            <p>That a modern Practice has a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to all this, I offer the following Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to evince.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Phyſical</hi> Power does not always infer a <hi>Moral</hi> one: That is to ſay, a Man cannot <hi>lawfully</hi> do every Thing that is in his <hi>Power</hi> to do. Thus we abſtain from Acts of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, although
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003315_0017_0FEFDA01265FFD68"/>
they may be gainful to our ſelves, out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Morals,</hi> notwithſtanding they lie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Compaſs of our Abilities. Thus the Apoſtle adviſeth us, <hi>Not to let our Good be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſpoken of</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 14. 16.</note>; that is, not to do any unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Action, for the ſake of any ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Benefit: Becauſe the end, however good <hi>intentionally,</hi> can never <hi>juſtify</hi> in Law, nor <hi>ſanctify</hi> in Religion, the uſe of Means that are bad, to come at it: But on the contrary, the uſe of bad Means deſignedly, corrupts the Morality of the intended Good: For to make an Action Good, 'tis neceſſary that <hi>all its Parts,</hi> be Lawful, Innocent, and Good alſo; whereas the Depravity of <hi>any One,</hi> is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to denominate that <hi>whole Action,</hi> Evil: Now the Apoſtle forbids us to do <hi>Evil,</hi> tho' <hi>Good ſhould come of it</hi>

Tho' the Homicide be caſual, yet if the Cauſe of it be criminal, ſurely it will be no Excuſe for it, for it is obſerved, That although the Effect which follows (if mortal) is beſide the <hi>Intention,</hi> yet the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it being not ſo, is ſufficient to make a Man guilty before God: Men being juſtly chargeable with thoſe <hi>Effects,</hi> which are the <hi>natural</hi> Reſults of thoſe <hi>inordinate</hi> Actions, from whence they proceed.</p>

But there is this of Good attending, that the Fear of it is an <hi>happy Reſtraint</hi> upon many People, who ſeem not ſo ſenſible of ſuperiour Obligations, to keep themſelves in Temperance and Sobriety, and want no other Encouragement to give a Looſe to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, than to be free from Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this <hi>uncertain Viſitor.</hi> Moſt Mens Acquaintance, I am apt to think, will furniſh them with Inſtances of Perſons who would gladly give into the Extravagance of theſe <hi>licentious Cities,</hi> to the apparent hazard of

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Num. 22. 31.</note>, or keep them at a ſafe Diſtance, in Health, Wealth, and Innocence. However ugly Sin may be in it ſelf, rightly conſidered, 'tis the fear of ſome ſuch Conſequence <hi>as this,</hi> that frequently hinders the Commiſſion of it, in ſpight of all the prevailing Invitations of <hi>Faſhion,</hi> Place and Opportunity. We ought then to look upon this, and all other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to Sin, with a thankful Eye, and bleſs that wiſe Providence which has mercifully ſet ſuch Checks upon Iniquity, that we may not run ſmoothly on unadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to our Ruin. Could then theſe <hi>bold Practitioners</hi> leſſen the Severity of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; could they entirely ſecure Men from Danger under it, could they ſay to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, as Almighty God does to the proud Waves of the Sea, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no farther</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Job 38. 11.</note>; could they, I ſay, do all this, I do not ſee what Good Mankind would get in the main; they would, 'tis true, have one Danger leſs to fear, but that would be no real Kindneſs; foraſmuch as it would be the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their running into a great many

            <p>If Security would make Men more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in their Callings, more juſt and honeſt in their Dealings; or if they would look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a Mercy, and be thankful to God for the Enjoyment of it; I could wiſh the Generations of the World were more healthy and ſtrong; But the Negligence of Men in theſe Particulars, even with all their Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities about them, makes it evident to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that theſe good Effects would not follow: If Danger ſhould be removed, we ſhould be the leſs upon our Guard, and lie more open to other Aſſaults of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and give more eaſily into the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of many Sins, which then would alſo more eaſily <hi>beſet us.</hi> In a confirmed State of Health, we are not ſo apt to conſider our latter End: Or if we do, the Conſideration does not ſo much affect, becauſe of its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Diſtance: But when we find it by any Indiſpoſition, or the fear of any, making nearer Approaches, when the Pleaſures of Health are abated, and human Enjoyments have loſt their Reliſh, when a Man's Spirits begin to ſink, and his Body decay; this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening

Call is much more perſuaſive than the Voice of Eloquence, or Force of Reaſon, to make a Man improve the Thoughts of his Diſſolution to the beſt Advantage. I have before obſerved, that Life it ſelf may not always be a Bleſſing: For that depends entirely on the good Uſe that is made of it: It had been better for them, if ſome Men had never been born; if others had died in their Infancy. No Doubt but Providence has a good and beneficial Deſign in all thoſe Deaths, which we improperly call untimely; either the Good is taken to his Reward, or the Wicked hindred from increaſing his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. What Reaſon then for this ſaving, this anti-providential Project, this pretended Art of Preſerving, which thus tends in a great Meaſure to prevent that religious Watchfulneſs, which Chriſtianity, as a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, requires? Should we not rather, with the ſame Mind, endure our preſent Eſtate, whatſoever it be, as we paſs through a hard Winter, or a Time of foul Weather, taking it for ſeaſonable and fit, becauſe the wiſe Author of Nature has ſo ordered and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it?</p>
            <p>And now upon the whole, what is all this Diſcourſe, but a Perſuaſive to depend upon
