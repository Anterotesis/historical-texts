            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE painful circumſtances in which numbers are involved, when aged, or deprived of that, or thoſe, on whom their ſupport chiefly depended, are too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to require a recital. But that ſame Divine Wiſdom, which allows and orders the exiſtence of theſe calamities, has mercifully, and in proof of his providence, ſo directed its manner, as to admit of their being greatly alleviated, by the joint endeavours of mankind. Caſualties, decays and death cannot be prevented, and ſeparately conſidered appear to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no particular regulation; and yet, when viewed collectively, are in a certain proportion, as has been confirmed by long and repeated obſervation; ſo that many, by co-operating with each other, may ſecure individuals from thoſe hardſhips they muſt otherwiſe experience; and that, on terms with which a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and humane perſon will readily comply, for the relief it muſt afford him to recollect, that he and his family are thereby inſured, tho' in the other way they ſhould never be benefited. An attention to theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars has given riſe to various Societies in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> which within a few years have multiplied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, chiefly in <hi>London.</hi> Though ſuch Societies have been formed with a good deſign, yet having in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gone upon miſtaken principles, they muſt at length, if not ſpeedily regulated, be productive of much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment and calamity.</p>
            <p>A benevolent deſire of informing the public what calculations might be depended upon, and of averting that diſtreſs which was otherwiſe to be expected, has induced the Rev. Dr. <hi>Price,</hi> an eminent Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to publiſh Obſervations on Reverſionary Payments
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:012406_0003_0F897774545F5118"/>
on ſchemes for providing Annuities, for Widows, and for perſons in Old Age, &amp;c. Being poſſeſt of this help, a manuſcript copy of the whole Conſtitution of the <hi>London</hi> Annuity Society, eſtabliſhed by deed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in 1765, to make annual proviſion for widows; and a printed Abſtract of the Deed of Settlement of the Laudable Society, for the benefit of widows, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in 1761—underſtanding, that there were no general Societies of this nature in <hi>America,</hi> and that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ſuch was wiſhed for by many—and having a deſire of contributing my mite towards the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Coloniſts, more eſpecially ſince a perſonal acquaintance with and numerous obligations to them, have here collected together, and do preſent to the public, materials for forming ſuch Societies, wiſhing that the ſame may prove of extenſive ſervice, at leaſt hoping that they will meet with a favourable recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>firſt</hi> part contains the plan for the erection, continuance and government of the Society, with the various reaſons: the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the payments to be made by each member, according to his reſpective age, and the advantages he propoſes to obtain. The ſcheme is larger than thoſe of the <hi>London</hi> Societies, as it admits of the purchaſing annuities to be enjoyed, either by the purchaſer after ſuch a period, or by another after his death in caſe of ſurvivorſhip; and, notwithſtanding difference of age, upon proper allowance—affords parents the opportunity of purchaſing for their children, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for their ſiſters and the like—does not exclude females from becoming purchaſers—nor debar military and ſea-faring perſons, from ſecuring annuities to be enjoyed by them after ſuch an age, though from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing annuities for others after their own deceaſe.</p>
            <p>Should ſuch a Society be attempted and formed, ſhall chearfully afford it what further aſſiſtance may at
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:012406_0004_0F897774EE89A688"/>
any time be in my power; and, that none may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by errors in any ſpurious edition of this pamphlet, ſhall ſubſcribe my name to every copy.</p>
            <p>Many might decline forming themſelves, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their deſires, of having ſuch a Society eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of belonging thereto, from an apprehenſion of their being too few. To obviate ſo plauſible an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, let it be noted, that the <hi>London Annuity So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> when it firſt formed, the beginning of 1765, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of no more than twenty-one members. The beginning of this year it conſiſted of 335. Would not with to begin ſuch a Society with more than forty, or fifty perſons at moſt, as it will probably be far more eaſy for that number, than a much greater, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late every matter, to be concluded upon at its forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The honeſt fears of ſome, and the intereſted views of others, may lead many to aſſert that a Society of this nature cannot be carried on without the immediate aſſiſtance of able mathematicians; eſpecially as Dr. <hi>Price</hi> thus expreſſes himſelf, p. 131, ſpeaking of the Society for equitable Aſſurances on Lives, viz. <q>I would obſerve, that it is of great importance to the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch a Society, that its affairs ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſpection of able mathematicians. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy experience ſhews, that none but mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians are qualified for forming and <hi>conducting</hi> ſchemes of this kind.</q> 'Tis indiſputable, that this paſſage was haſtily worded, and that the Doctor had forgot for a moment what he himſelf had been doing, for in p. 133, he ſays, <q>I have, with a particular view to this Society, given <hi>rules,</hi> by which may be formed <hi>every</hi> Table it can want, for ſhewing the values of aſſurances on the <hi>whole duration,</hi> or any <hi>terms,</hi> of any <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> lives, in all poſſible caſes;
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012406_0005_0F897775AF6E9018"/>
and nothing but care and attention can be neceſſary to enable any good arithmetician to calculate from them.</q> By the Doctor's own rules any ſuch arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician may try the calculations in this performance, may correct any miſtakes, may ſupply all defects, and may adopt other terms at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>It may be agreeable to the reader of Dr. <hi>Price</hi>'s work, to be told, that after its publication the laſt year, ſeveral gentlemen of <hi>London</hi> were engaged in obtaining information as to the duration of life, both in men and women; and found that men in <hi>London,</hi> of good common health and expoſed to no particular dangers, from twenty-four to the extremity of old age, die at the rate of one in thirty-one annually; and that, according to the regiſters of the Million Bank, widows may live eighteen years; according to thoſe of the Mercer's Company (which in the year 1690 adopted a ſcheme for paying annuities to widows) twenty-one years on an average.</p>
            <p>Such Societies, beſides being ſerviceable to individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, will, after a while, prove of great public utility; not only by encouraging matrimony, but by furniſhing large ſums of money to be loaned out; through the help of which, young induſtrious planters may puſh their improvements to the further enrichment of the community; others may be aſſiſted in large and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable undertakings; and intereſt may be reduced to a more moderate ſtate, or the exacting uſerer's methods of increaſing it beyond what is legal, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p>It being a public advantage, that there ſhould be a full ſupply of money to loan out; and the nature of the country (comparatively, but little ſettled) not allowing the thought of a redundancy, it may be prudent to extend the limits, comprehending the members of the
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:012406_0006_0F8977766F30EAD8"/>
Society, beyond the bounds of a particular Colony, as far as an equal degree of healthineſs and ſafety will admit, that ſo the caſh of individuals, in thoſe provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where ſuch Societies do not exiſt, may centre where they do.</p>
            <p>Tho' foreign to the preſent purpoſe, yet as it may be pleaſing to the generality of readers, who may have no opportunity of ſeeing Dr. <hi>Price</hi>'s performance, the following particulars are added.</p>
            <p>The Doctor writes, p. 204, 205. <q>The original number of perſons, who in 1643, had ſettled in <hi>New-England</hi> was 21,200. Ever ſince it is reckoned, that more have left them than have gone to them. In the year 1760, they were increaſed to half a million. They, have, therefore, all along doubled their own number in twenty-five years. And if they continue to increaſe in the ſame rate, they will, ſeventy years hence, in <hi>New-England</hi> alone, be four millions; and in all <hi>North-America,</hi> above twice the number of inhabitants in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
               </q> The Doctor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins in a note, <q>Since writing the above—I have ſeen a particular account, grounded chiefly on ſurveys lately taken with a view to taxation and for other purpoſes, of the number of males between 16 and 60, in the four provinces. According to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acount, the number of ſuch males is 218,000. The whole number of people therefore between 16 and 60, muſt be nearly 436,000. In order to be more ſure of avoiding exceſs, I will call them only 400,000.</q> The Doctor proceeds, and upon a moderated calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion infers that—<hi>the whole number of people will be</hi> 720,000. But ſuppoſing that there was this number when the ſurveys were made, and that the inhabitants double in the time ſpecified, they will be more than four millions in <hi>New-England</hi> in leſs than 60 years:
<pb n="vi"
                   facs="unknown:012406_0007_0F89777730D36F78"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in fifty, the Coloniſts of all <hi>North-America,</hi> what by internal population and ſettlers from <hi>Europe,</hi> will <hi>probably</hi> be more than double to the <hi>then</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> For it appears from Dr. <hi>Price</hi>'s Supplement, lately publiſhed, that <hi>Old-England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> are depopulating apace, and that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are now <hi>a million and a half</hi> fewer than in the year 1690, ſee p. 21. He further ſays, p. 60, <q>the number of houſes in the kingdom (meaning <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi>) in 1766 was 980,692. Call them however a million, and the number of people in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> will be four millions and a half, allowing 4 ½ to a houſe; and five millions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing five to a houſe. The former is <hi>probably</hi> too large an allowance; but the latter is <hi>certainly</hi> ſo. The number of people in the kingdom may, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be ſtated as <hi>probably</hi> not more than four milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and a half; but <hi>certainly</hi> not five millions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the Coloniſts ſhall have become thus numerous, and ſhall ſo far exceed in people the mother country, they muſt either be eaſy and happy, in the ſecure and confirmed enjoyment of their reſpective liberties, being cloſely united in one common cauſe; or be miſerable in object ſlavery, thro' diviſions and cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; or be convulſed in dangerous ſtruggles. The period is ſo nigh, that the parent may look upon his new born infant, as a future actual partaker in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or miſery thereof; and muſt therefore be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in exerting his ſeveral powers, that ſo it may be a day of joy and gladneſs.</p>

him ſome credit for the ſame, by reckoning as though they began to be made on his commencing a member, inſtead of a year after.</p>
               <p>In calculating the value of the additional 10<hi>l.</hi> the reckoning goes upon nine years inſtead of ten, as it will be but nine years after the 20<hi>l.</hi> has been ſecured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the right to that addition will be obtained; by this means the purchaſer is charged ſomewhat more than had it went upon ten years; but far leſs than is allowed for, by reckoning the annual payment as tho' made when he becomes a member. Should it be thought that in juſtice the calculation ſhould have gone upon ten inſtead of nine years, it is only deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that he ſhall not pay for the additional 10<hi>l.</hi> till he has paſſed through his probation year; which may be more agreeable than the paying for the whole to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>The tables ſuppoſe that the money is put out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, accumulates continually by an uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed compound intereſt, is never loſt, nor diminiſhed in value; now, as in fact it muſt often lie by, cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate at that rate, and will be ſubject to a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution through loſſes, failure of intereſt and the like, it may be moſt adviſeable to reckon upon no more than 4 ½ per cent, certain compound continued intereſt, and therefore Table II. goes only upon that eſtimate. They, who are otherwiſe minded from conſidering the height of legal intereſt, may be convinced upon reading the following quotations from Dr. <hi>Price, viz.</hi> p. 8. <q>In equal ages the mortality of males has been found to be greater than the mortality of females. P. 271, 272, <hi>the greater mortality of males</hi> appears on the whole to be a fact well eſtabliſhed. P. 106. The iſſue of the beſt ſchemes of this kind muſt be in
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012406_0036_0F897364B36370F8"/>
ſome degree uncertain. For want of proper obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, it is not poſſible to determine what allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ought to be made, on account of the higher probabilities of life among females than males. No prudence can prevent all loſſes in the improvement of monies; nor can any care guard againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies to ſuch ſchemes, which muſt ariſe from thoſe perſons being moſt ready to fly to them, who, by reaſon of concealed diſorders, feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt likely to want the benefit of them. 'Tis vain to form ſuch eſtabliſhments with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeeing their fate determined ſoon by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. P. 107. No experiments of this ſort ſhould be tried haſtily. An unſucceſsful one muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of very pernicious effects. All inadequate ſchemes lay the foundation of <hi>preſent</hi> relief on <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> calamity, and afford aſſiſtance to a <hi>few</hi> by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointing and oppreſſing <hi>multitudes.</hi> P. 111. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Society that means to be a permanent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the public, ought always to take higher rather than lower values, for the ſake of rendering it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more ſecure, and gaining ſome <hi>profits</hi> to balance <hi>loſſes</hi> and expences. P. 129. In matters of chance, it is impoſſible to ſay, that an unfavourable run of events will not come, which may hurt the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived ſcheme. The calculations only determine probabilities; and, agreeably to theſe, it may be depended on, that events will happen on the whole. But at particular periods, and in particular inſtances, great deviations will often happen; and theſe devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations at the commencement of a ſcheme, muſt prove either very favourable, or very unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</q>

               <p>'Tis of importance, in calculating annuities, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether the lives of females are <hi>univerſally</hi> better than thoſe of males; and <hi>how much</hi> better: And his Honour, the Lieutenant Governor, having ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obligingly communicated to me, ſome manuſcripts containing an account of the number of inhabitants, &amp;c. in <hi>Maſſachuſett's-Bay,</hi> taken by order in 1764, the reſult was ſuch as induced me at firſt ſight to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in this colony, as in many other places, the lives of females were better than thoſe of males: For it appeared from them, that there were 33438 houſes; 41110 families; 59090 white males above 16 years old, and 64755 females, making together 123845; —and that there were 58390 white males under 16, and 55945 females, in all 114335. The whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of males and females was 238180. Though the males under 16 exceeded the females by 2445, yet the females above 16 exceeded the males by 5665. The number of towns that ſent in accounts was 196: ſome few declined, or neglected doing it. In 46 of theſe towns the males above, as well as under 16, exceeded the females. In 47 of them the females exceeded the males under as well as above 16. In 18 of them the males above 16 exceeded the females, and the females under 16 exceeded the males. In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder the males under 16 exceeded the females, and the females above 16 exceeded the males. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this appearance in ſupport of the better lives of females <hi>here</hi> as well as elſewhere, when infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation had been obtained—that the order appeared

myſterious, occaſioned an alarm in many places, was diſagreeable to multitudes, was not enforced by any penalty, and was not carefully complied with—that different towns purpoſely took ſuch looſe accounts, as ſhould prevent its being known how numerous they were—that it was highly probable that the return of the males was lower than the truth, and that all who were at ſea, amounting to ſome hundreds from vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ports, were left out of the account—and that the colony had loſt full five, if not near ten thouſand men by the war immediately preceding—could not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, on further thought, that the full number of the white inhabitants was not to be determined from the return, and that the males in the <hi>Maſſachuſett's</hi> were not only more, but better lives, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Since writing the above, have been confirmed in my concluſion, by what Dr. <hi>Price</hi> mentions in his <hi>Supplement,</hi> p. 15, 16, 17. <q>There is a difference between the mortality of males and females.—I muſt however obſerve, that it may be doubted, whether this difference ſo unfavourable to males, is <hi>natural;</hi> and the following facts will prove, that I have reaſon for ſuch doubts.</q>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>It appears, from ſeveral regiſters in <hi>Suſmilch</hi>'s works, that this difference is much leſs in the <hi>country pariſhes</hi> and <hi>villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of BRANDENBURGH, than in the <hi>towns.</hi> And, agreeable to this, it appears likewiſe, from the accounts of the ſame curious writer, that the number of males in the country comes much nearer to the number of females.</p>
                        <p>At the time the accounts were taken of the inhabitants in the province of NEW-JERSEY in AMERICA, they were diſtinguiſhed particularly into <hi>males</hi> and females under and above ſixteen.</p>
                        <p>In 1738, the number of <hi>males</hi> under 16 was, 10639; fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males. 9700: males above 16—11631; females 10725. In 1745, theſe numbers were, males under 16—14523; females 13754: males above 16—15087; females 13704.</p>
                        <p>The inference is obvious; that human life in males is more brittle than in females, only in conſequence of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious cauſes, or of ſome particular debility, that takes place in poliſhed and luxurious Societies, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in great towns.</p>
                     </q>

The number of negroes returned, was, males 3020, females 2226; the diſproportion between the ſexes may be accounted for, upon the far greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of males. The Indians were 728 males, 953 females; but nothing deciſive can be gathered from hence, unleſs it could be known, whether any, and how many males had periſhed by the war; whether numbers might not be abſent upon hunting, fiſhing or other engagements, who were not in the account; and what was the diſproportion between the ſexes, of thoſe that had periſhed by the exceſſive drinking of that artificial American poiſon—Rum. There was no taking the ages of either Negroes or Indians.</p>
               <p>Much exactneſs, and an attention to every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, are requiſite in communicating accounts, that may be uſed by other's as a foundation for calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or the whole may be extremely erroneous. Thus Dr. <hi>Price</hi> concludes, p. 198, that, <q>at <hi>Boſton</hi> the inhabitants would decreaſe were there no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from the country; if the account given in the <hi>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> of 1753, p. 413, from 1731 to 1752, of births and burials in the town was juſt; ſeeing that the burials all along exceeded the births.</q> Have examined the <hi>Magazine,</hi> and obſerve, that it is not an account of <hi>births</hi> and burials, but of <hi>baptiſms</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:012406_0040_0F897367B3241E08"/>
and burials—that the number of burials in the time ſpecified was 13384; of <hi>baptiſms</hi> 11850;—that the <hi>baptiſms</hi> were therefore leſs than the burials by 1534 —and that in the burials were included 2011 blacks, ſo that the number of whites buried was only 11<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>73. Now it muſt be noted, that theſe accounts of burials and baptiſms were moſt probably taken from the news-papers—that little ſtreſs is to be laid upon their authority in this matter, as it's notorious to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that their liſts, eſpecially in the article of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, are very imperfect and below the truth, though likely to be much more correct in the other—that great numbers are born, who from various cauſes are not <hi>baptized</hi>—and that the marriages and births a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the negroes, cannot, by reaſon of their peculiar circumſtances, bear the ſame proportion with their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials to thoſe of the inhabitants. Nothing poſitive concerning the decreaſe of the inhabitants at <hi>Boſton,</hi> can then be concluded upon, from the accounts given in the <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s <hi>Magazine.</hi>
