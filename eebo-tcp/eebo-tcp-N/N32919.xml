            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall dwell for ever, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from generation to generation. For I will cleanſe their blood that I have not cleanſed; for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>NEXT to the acknowledgement of the exiſtence of a Deity, there is no one principle of greater importance in religion, than a realizing belief of the divine government and providence, as ſuperintending the affairs of the univerſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately concerned in whatever happens to mankind, both as nations and kingdoms, and as individuals.</p>
            <p>Deeply to be impreſſed with a ſenſe of the divine providence, to realize that GOD is Govornor among the nations, that his government is wiſe and juſt, and that all our times and changes are in his hands, and at his diſpoſal, will have the happieſt tendency to excite the moſt grateful acknowledgements of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in proſperity, the moſt cordial reſignation to his paternal diſcipline in adverſity, and the moſt placid compoſure and equanimity of mind in all the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcenes of life. Inſpired with this divine principle, we ſhall contemplate, with grateful wonder and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:043231_0004_101CD950BAD441C8"/>
the goodneſs of God in proſperous events, and devoutly acknowledge and adore his ſovereign hand in days of darkneſs and perplexity, and when the greateſt difficulties preſs. This will be a ſource of comfort and ſupport under private afflictions and trials, and this ſhall encourage our hope in God and truſt in his name, under public calamities and judgments.— Yea, however dark and myſterious the ways of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence may appear; yet nothing ſhall overwhelm the mind, or deſtroy the truſt and hope of thoſe, that realize the government of heaven,—that realize, that an alwiſe God is ſeated on the throne, and that all things are well appointed for his choſen people,—for them that fear him.</p>
            <p>This principle and theſe ſentiments therefore, being of ſo great uſe and importance in religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the various diſpenſations of providence, one great deſign of the preſent diſcourſe, is to rouſe and excite us to a religious acknowledgment of the hand of God, in thoſe diſtreſſing ſcenes of MURDER, BLOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHED and WAR, we are met to commemorate, upon this ſolemn occaſion</p>
            <p>The paſſage before us, it is humbly conceived, is well ſuited to confirm our faith, to excite our truſt, and encourage our hope, under ſuch awful diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as it points out the method of God's govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the courſe of his providence towards the enemies and oppreſſors of his people, and the fate of thoſe that ſhed <hi>innocent blood;</hi> and at the ſame time, repreſents his peculiar care of his church and choſen, and the aſſurance they have, when under oppreſſion, of reſtoration and eſtabliſhment,—and that <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> will plead their cauſe and both <hi>cleanſe</hi> and <hi>avenge</hi> their <hi>innocent blood. "Egypt</hi> ſhall be a deſolation, and <hi>Edom</hi> ſhall be a deſolate wilderneſs, for the <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> againſt the <hi>children of Judah,</hi> becauſe they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:043231_0005_101CD953D00ABC38"/>
have ſhed <hi>INNOCENT BLOOD in their land.</hi> But <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall dwell forever, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from generation to generation. For <hi>I will cleanſe their blood,</hi> that I have not cleanſed; for the LORD dwelleth in Zion."</p>
            <p>It is not neceſſary to enquire as to the immediate occaſion, or literal fulfilment of the prephecy before us, with reſpect to the particular nations, or kingdoms here mentioned. It is ſufficient to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to obſerve, that <hi>Egypt</hi> was early noted, in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hiſtory, for oppreſſing God's people, and cauſing them to ſerve with <hi>cruel bondage. Edom</hi> alſo is mentioned as guilty of <hi>violence</hi> towards them, and expreſſing a moſt imbittered hatred and revenge againſt them; and from the expreſſions in the text, it is natural to ſuppoſe, that there had been ſome, if not many inſtances of their ſhedding <hi>innocent blood</hi> in their land.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Pſal. cxxxvii. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God's choſen people, had often ſuffered violence, from both theſe ſtates: So that we have good reaſon to ſuppoſe, that both <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> in the language of ſcripture prophecy, in the text and other paſſages, may intend not <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Edom</hi> only, but (proverbially) in a more general ſenſe, enemies, perſecutors or oppreſſors of God's people, who violated their rights and liberties, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and civil, and by the ſword of perſecution or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſhed <hi>innocent blood</hi> in their land.</p>
            <p>Prophecies, eſpecially thoſe that are, or may be, of general uſe to the people of God, are but ſeldom literal, either in prediction or fulfilment. They are rather of uſe to foreſhew great and intereſting events, as taking place in the world, in ſuch time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and upon ſuch perſons, ſocieties, nations, or kingdoms, as ſhall diſplay the juſtice and equity of divine government, and the peculiar care which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:043231_0006_101CD95564FA1C38"/>
Heaven takes of the church and people of God, for their correction, inſtruction, preſervation or eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment. Agreeably St. Peter ſpeaks ſtrongly for this method of explaining and improving ſcripture prophecies, where he ſays expreſsly, that "no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the ſcripture is of any private interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on."<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. i. 20.</note> It is, therefore, rational to ſuppoſe, that though prophecies may have ſpecial or immediate reference to particular perſons, ſocieties, nations or kingdoms, and to events in which they may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately intereſted; yet they may be fitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as having a further and more important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, which may be of general uſe for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and edification of God's church and people, in all ages, to the end. In this general ſenſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you will permit me to conſider the prophecy in the paſſage before us: and thus underſtood, it is eaſy to ſee ſeveral things ſuggeſted in it, worthy our moſt ſerious attention and religious improvement, upon ſuch an occaſion as this.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, it is admitted, that for wiſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, a juſt God may permit powerful enemies, or oppreſſors, to injure, do violence unto and diſtreſs his people, and to carry their meaſures of violence and oppreſſion to ſuch lengths among them, as to ſtrike at their life and "ſhed <hi>innocent blood</hi> in their land."</p>
            <p>As God is the Sovereign of the world, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes his government for the glory of his name, in the good of the whole, ſo he hath a paternal concern for the ſpecial benefit and improvement of his church and people. All creatures are his ſervants: and God accompliſheth his deſigns and carries his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to effect, by what means and inſtruments he pleaſes. It is with him alone, 'who is wonderful in counſel
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:043231_0007_101CD95C59245EF0"/>
and excellent in working," to bring good out of evil. When God deſigns the re roof and correction of his people, he can exerciſe this holy diſcipline in various ways and by various means, as ſhall beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the purpoſes of his government. This holy diſcipline is accordingly exerciſed, ſometimes by the immediate hand of providence: as in waſting ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs parching drought, awful and deſolating earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, or other judgments, which are immediately from God himſelf. Or this may be done more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, by the inſtrumentality of his creatures; and even the wicked, and thoſe that love the wages of unrighteouſneſs, that delight in oppreſſion, waſte and ſpoil, or thirſt for <hi>innocent blood,</hi> may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the rod in his hand to correct, or puniſh the ſins of his people. With this view the oppreſſor is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to injure, inſult, oppreſs and lay waſte in a land; and to carry his meaſures to the ſhedding of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood. With the ſame deſign does a ſovereign God give the enemy a commiſſion, in war, with fire and ſword, to diſtreſs and deſtroy.</p>
            <p>In ſuch public calamities, it is true, it often comes to paſs, that as individuals, the innocent are involved and ſuffer with the guilty; and ſometimes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent alone. But however unjuſt, or cruel the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, and thoſe that thirſt for blood may be, in contriving and carrying into execution their wicked, opprſſieve, or <hi>bloody</hi> deſigns, they are no other than inſtruments in providence and the rod in the hand of the great Governor of the world, for the reproof and correction of his people. Theſe things happen not by accident, or chance, but by the direction, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of that God, who is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works.

            <p>It matters not, therefore, who are the immediate inſtruments of violence and oppreſſion, or by whoſe hands the blood of innocent perſons is ſhed, or their ſubſtance waſted and habitations deſtroyed; nor yet from what motives, or views ſuch acts of oppreſſion and cruelty are perpetrated, with reſpect to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious improvement, that GOD expects us, or any people, to make of ſuch heavy diſpenſations. 'Tis GOD, and his hand—'tis GOD and his providence, which we are firſt of all concerned to notice, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and improve. However unjuſt our ſufferings may be from man; yet, when we realize the hand of GOD, the great and wiſe Governor of the world, as concerned herein, ſilence and ſubmiſſion is our indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty, and no murmer, or complaint ought ever to be heard, but with reverence and humility it becomes us to bow before the LORD, and adoring his ſovereignty, aſcribe righteouſneſs to our GOD. Neither the inſults of oppreſſors, nor the flames of our once delightful habitations, nor even the <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood</hi> of our <hi>brethren ſlain,</hi> ſhould move to a murmuring word or an angry thought, againſt GOD,

his government, or providence.—"Shall we receive good at the hand of GOD, and ſhall we not receive evil?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Job ii. 10.</note>—And "ſhall not the Judge of all the earth do right!"<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. xviii. 25.</note> The more grievouſly we are ſmitten, the more deeply we are affected, the more carefully ſhould we endeavour to realize our dependence upon GOD, the more religiouſly acknowledge his hand, and the more earneſtly return to him that ſmites. This is the leſſon of inſtruction, which GOD expects we ſhould learn, by ſuch bitter diſpenſations, and this the improvement he looks for, in us and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in order to the reſtoration of his favour and our redemption from enemies and oppreſſors, who threaten to lay waſte and deſtroy. May theſe things, then, be deeply impreſſed on each of our hearts.—But I paſs</p>
            <p>Secondly, To obſerve the fate of oppreſſors, and the ſentence of heaven againſt thoſe, that do violence to GOD'S people and ſhed <hi>innocent blood</hi> in their land. <hi>Egypt ſhall be a deſolation, and Edom ſhall be a deſolate wilderneſs, for the violence againſt the children of Judah, becauſe they have ſhed innocent blood in their land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However juſt it may be in GOD to correct his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and whatever right is aſcribed to him of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wicked, as the rod in his hand to correct, or the ſword to puniſh them; yet this alters not the nature of their oppreſſive deſigns, neither does it abate their guilt, or alleviate their crime, in theſe meaſures of injuſtice, violence or cruelty, by which the people of GOD are diſtreſſed.</p>
            <p>Thus GOD ſpeaks of the Aſſyrian king, a prince noted in hiſtory for his avarice and ambition, cruelty and oppreſſion, (and in him, of the <hi>Aſſyrian ſtate,</hi> whoſe character was included in that of its king) ſaying—"O Aſſyrian, the rod of mine anger, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:043231_0010_101CD9640FE9F980"/>
the ſtaff in their hand is mine indignation. I will ſend him to an hypocritical nation; and againſt the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the ſpoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the ſtreets. Howbeit, he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo, but it is in his heart to deſtroy. Wherefore it ſhall come to paſs, that when the LORD hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion, and on Jeruſalem, I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the king of Aſſyria, and the glory of his high looks."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. x. 5.—12.</note> And ſo it came to paſs: For this power, that with ſuch a mighty hand, and for ſo long a time, oppreſſed GOD'S people and other nations, in GOD'S due time, felt the weight of the iron yoke and received double for all the injuſtice, oppreſſion and cruelty it had exerciſed towards others.</p>
            <p>In this, and many other circumſtances, with which hiſtory abounds, it is eaſy to ſee the fate of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of GOD'S people and oppreſſors of mankind.— But we need not go from the text, for ſatisfaction in this matter. In the words of the prophecy before us, we have the ſentence of heaven againſt the oppreſſors of GOD'S people and the doom of thoſe common enemies of mankind, pronounced, and the reaſon thereof aſſigned, in the cleareſt terms. <hi>Egypt ſhall be a deſolation, Edom ſhall be a deſolate wilderneſs, for the violence againſt the children of Judas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ſhed innocent blood in their land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The LORD is a GOD, that loveth righteouſneſs and hateth iniquity, in whatever ſhape, or character it appears. Injuſtice, oppreſſion and violence (much leſs the ſhedding of innocent blood) ſhall not paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, by the juſt Governor of the world. Sooner, or later, a juſt recompence will be made upon ſuch workers of iniquity.—Yea, though hand join in hand,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:043231_0011_101CD968ADC08E10"/>
in meaſures of oppreſſion and violence, againſt GOD'S people; and though their avarice, ambition, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thirſt for power and domination, may carry them on, 'till their ſteps ſhall be marked with <hi>innocent blood;</hi> yet, certain it is, they ſhall not, finally, go unpuniſhed. For a time, indeed, and but for a ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, ſuch workers of unrighteouſneſs, ſuch deſtroyers of mankind may practiſe and proſper; but 'vengeance ſlow, is vengeance ſure.' Their ways are marked before GOD. Their puniſhment and deſtruction are ſealed in his preſence: And the time is haſtning, when deſtruction, without remedy, ſhall be their portion.</p>
            <p>The truth of theſe ſentiments hath often been verified in providence, and the proud princes and the moſt powerful ſtates have been taught, by ſevere, by fatal experience, that deſolation from the LORD awaits the impiety of thoſe, that do v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olence to his people and 'ſhed <hi>innocent blood</hi> in their land.'</p>
            <p>Here then we may ſee the light in which that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or nation, are to be conſidered, that walk in the ways of oppreſſion, and that thirſt for and ſhed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood. Here we may alſo ſee the ruin to which they are haſtning, the awful judgments that await them, and the great reaſon they have to fear the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of heaven, denounced againſt them, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy before us, and its literal fulfilment upon them. Which naturally leads in the laſt place.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To obſerve, in the prophecy before us, the peculiar care GOD takes of his church and people, and the aſſurance they have, even when actually ſuffering violence and under the cruel hand of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, of redemption, reſtoration and eſtabliſhment; and that GOD himſelf will plead their cauſe, and both <hi>cleanſe</hi> and <hi>avenge</hi> their innocent blood. Nothing can be more directly expreſſive of this ſentiment, or
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:043231_0012_101CD96A4208A910"/>
a firmer ground of aſſurance, for the confirmation of the faith and hope of God's choſen people in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it, than the promiſe and prephecy, concerning Judah and Jeruſalem in the text. While <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> while the enemies and oppreſſiors of God's people, are doomed to that deſolation, they ſo juſtly deſerve, the ſtrongeſt aſſurances are given, "that <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall dwell forever, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation For I, ſaith God, will cleanſe their blood, that I have not cleanſed: For the Lord dwelleth in Zion." The words are plain, and need no comment. They ſpeak the language of ſcripture, fact and experience, for the confirmation of the faith and hope of God's church and choſen, in days of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and darkneſs and when actually under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, violence and cruelty of inveterate enemies, or <hi>blood thirſty</hi> oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>Here are two things, for the inducement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the faith and hope of God's church and people, in ſuch times of darkneſs and diſtreſs, which are well worthy ſerious notice and attention.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God's word and promiſe, in which he aſſures his people, that notwithſtanding the violence of their enemies againſt them, and the diſtreſs and ſorrow their oppreſſors may have cauſed them, by ſhedding <hi>innocent blood</hi> among them; yet they ſhall never avail to overthrow, or deſtroy them; but they ſhall aſſuredly be redeemed and delivered out of their hands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and eſtabliſhed, as his church and people, in a flouriſhing ſtate.</p>
            <p>And then, ſecondly, To leave no doubt upon their minds, as to the fulfilment of this bleſſed promiſe, a gracious God condeſcends to explain him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf in the cleareſt terms poſſible, and to ſatisfy them, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould fail of all that he had promiſed, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them that he would take the work into his own
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:043231_0013_101CD96BD18CCC40"/>
hands, and ſee to the accompliſhment of it himſelf; that thus it might appear to them and to the world of mankind, that the Lord was with them and dwelt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the midſt of them. "Judah ſhall dwell forever, and Jeruſalem from generation to generation: For <hi>I</hi> will cleanſe their blood, that I have not cleanſed; for <hi>the Lord dwelleth in Zion.</hi>"—Words well ſuited to chear and comfort the ſinking ſpirits of God's afflicted, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed people: and words which might rouſe the faith, and give a ſpring to the hope of the moſt feeble and faint-hearted, among God's people, in the depths of diſtreſs. For 'God is not a man that he ſhould lie, nor the ſon of man that he ſhould repent.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. 1. Sam. 15.29.</note>— 'Hath he promiſed, and ſhall he not perform?— Hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not bring it to paſs?'—</p>
            <p>Blood is ſaid to be cleanſed, or avenged, when juſtice hath taken place, and the murderer is puniſhed. God may be ſaid to cleanſe the innocent blood, which may have been ſhed among his people, by the ſword of oppreſſors, or enemies, when in providence he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes for them, avenges their blood upon them that ſlew them, and reduces them to reaſon or ruin.</p>
            <p>The ſword is an appeal to heaven,—when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the arms of a people are eventually ſucceſsful, or by the immedate interpoſition of providence, their enemies and oppreſſors are ſubdued or deſtroyed.— When a people are reinſtated in peace, upon equitable terms, and eſtabliſhed in the enjoyment of all their juſt rights and liberties, both civil and ſacred: then may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t be ſaid, that the Lord hath cleanſed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, and then will it be manifeſtly evident, that their God is with them and dwelleth in the midſt of them.</p>
            <p>Now of this God hath given his people the ſtrongeſt aſſurances, in the prophecy before us: and theſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:043231_0014_101CD96EECFDBEF8"/>
aſſurances are conformed by the word of God, to his people, throughout the ſacred ſcriptures. So that, though for their ſins and the multitude of their tranſgreſſions, a righteous God may juſtly afflict and correct his people, by the hand of oppreſſors, and permit their moſt important rights to be violated, their ſubſtance deſtroyed, their habitations to be laid waſte, or even the <hi>innocent blood</hi> of their brethren to be wantonly ſhed in their land; yet ſtill he is their God, in the midſt of them, and will readily appear for their help, when they return from their evil ways, acknowledge his hand and implore his mercy and aſſiſtance. This holy diſciple is no more than what God hath given his people to expect, as a reproof of their declenſions, and as a means of bringing them to a ſenſe of their dependence upon him. Such diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, are ſo far from being an evidence, that God hath forſaken his people, given them up, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to be gracious, that they are rather to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as demonſtrations of his paternal care and faithfulneſs towards them. Agreeably, in his coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with his ſervant David and his houſe, this method of conduct is expreſsly ſtipulated, as a token of his ſpecial care and faithfulneſs, and of the remembrance of the covenant he had made. "If his children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my law, and walk not in my judgments:—Then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod and their iniquity with ſtripes. Nevertheleſs, my loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal lxxxix. 30.31.32. and 33.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In ſuch viſitations, God evidently intends the beſt good of his people; not their deſtruction, but their reformation: and if they ſee his hand, humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under it and ſeek him aright, God will not
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:043231_0015_101CD974988A8438"/>
fail to remember his covenant and his promiſes for them, and in his due time appear, in his power and glory, for their relief.—Yea the bowels of his mercy will be moved at their diſtreſſes, and his language will be the ſame as unto his people of old, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Egyptian yoke,</hi> they were cauſed to ſerve with cruel bondage—"I have ſeen, I have ſeen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them."<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts vii. 34.</note> And to encourage his ſaints and people, to truſt on his name and hope in his mercy, a gracious God hath moſt explicitly promiſed them his preſence, direction and aſſiſtance, in all their diſtreſſes, be they ever ſo numerous, ever ſo great. His language is merciful, condeſcending and endearing—eſpecially when by the prophet Iſaiah, he ſays to his afflicted people—"When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee: When thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt; neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the holy One of Iſrael, thy Saviour."<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. xliii 2.3.</note> From theſe paſſages of ſacred writ, it appears, that as God in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom, ſees fit to exerciſe his people with trials and afflictions; and ſometimes to call them to paſs through the depths of adverſity: ſo he hath provided for their ſupport, and given them the greateſt reaſon to hope for his preſence and aſſiſtance, and the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aſſurances, that they ſhall be carried through all, and in the end rejoice in God, <hi>as the holy One of Iſrael, their SAVIOUR.</hi>—In ſhort, nothing can be more expreſſive of God's care of his people in diſtreſs, and of the ſolid ground they have to hope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and ſalvation, in his way and time, which are always the beſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:043231_0016_101CD9761E142E18"/>We may add, that further to confirm our faith and encourage our hope, in thoſe bleſſed aſſurances of God's preſence with his people, even in their heavieſt trials and greateſt perplexities, we might ſafely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the experience of his choſen, in every age, from the beginning to the preſent time. This will ſhow how eaſy it is, with an infinitely wiſe God, to bring good out of evil, and by the over-ruling hand of Providence, to cauſe the councils and meaſures of perſecutors and oppreſſors, to haſten the redemption and eſtabliſhment of the injured and oppreſſed, as well as to bring upon themſelves, that confuſion and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they ſo juſtly deſerve.—And this will alſo prove, how truly applicable the words of the prophet are, to God's choſen people in their diſtreſſes, in every age, when ſpeaking of the large experience Iſrael had had, of the tender love and faithful care of a merciful God exerciſed towards them, he ſays, that, "In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his preſence ſaved them: In his love and in his pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. vi. 3.9.</note>"</p>
            <p>Nothing is more evident from hiſtory and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than God's care of his people, and the wiſdom of his providence, in cauſing the violence and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their enemies, to operate for their advantage, and promote their more ſpeedy deliverance. This appears too plain, from various inſtances, to admit of diſpute.</p>
            <p>The <hi>children of Iſrael</hi> would not have been, ſo early, perſuaded to have left the gardens of <hi>Egypt</hi> or the fertile fields of the land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and in the face of every danger, attempted to free themſelves from the <hi>Egyptian yoke,</hi> had not their burdens been increaſed to an unreaſonable degree, by the violence

much leſs to have attempted independence of that kingdom, had they not been effectually convinced, by a long ſeries of injuries and oppreſſion, and number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs violations of their moſt ſacred rights, that there was no other remedy.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is worthy of remark, that when the <hi>Spaniſh court</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the ſubjugation of the <hi>Dutch provinces in the Netherlands, Spain</hi> was in the moſt reſpectable ſtate, it had been for a long time; having juſt concluded a victorious war, and being then at peace with all the world.

            <p>At the cloſe of the laſt war, we arrived at that happy period, to which our anceſtors looked, with earneſt expectation as the utmoſt of their wiſhes, as the anſwer of their prayers, and the reward of all their toils and ſufferings.

and anxieties of different kind, which by degrees have increaſed, 'till they are become more ſerious, dangerous and diſtreſſing, than any ever yet felt, by God's people, in this <hi>once</hi> happy land.</p>
            <p>Through the crafty inſinuations, falſe repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and diabolical counſels, of the enemies of God's people and the common rights of mankind, in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> and <hi>Britain, acts of oppreſſion</hi> are made by the <hi>Parliament of England,</hi> in which we are not repreſented, which deeply affect our moſt valuable priviledges.

The luſt of domination appears no longer in diſguiſe, but with open face.—The <hi>ſtarving Port-Bill</hi> comes forth— <hi>Gage</hi> arrives with his forces by ſea and land, to carry it into execution, with vigour and ſeverity.—And to compleat the ſcene, and at once, to make thorough work of oppreſſion and tyranny, immediately follow <hi>the Bills,</hi> that ſubvert the conſtitution, vacate our <hi>charter,</hi> abridge us of the right of trial by juries of the vicinity, in divers ſpecified capital caſes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to be ſeized, contrary to the laws of the land, and carried to <hi>England</hi> to be tried for our lives!— As alſo <hi>the Bill</hi> for eſtabliſhing the <hi>popiſh</hi> religion in <hi>Canada,</hi> contrary to the faith of the crown and the ſtatutes of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Add to theſe things, the people are treated, in various inſtances, with indignity, ſeverity and even cruelty And, notwithſtanding every poſſible expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a peaceful diſpoſition, in this people, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with a determined reſolution and chriſtian firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in defence of their rights and liberties, which they held dearer than life, their property is frequently and violently ſeized, and even their perſons and lives are threatened.

            <p>How far the prophecy before us, may be applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, upon this ſolemn occaſion, and with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of truth, or probability, it may be predicted, in conſequence of the preſent unjuſt and unnatural war, "that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſhall be a deſolation, and <hi>England</hi> be a deſolate wilderneſs, for the <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> againſt the children of <hi>America,</hi> becauſe they have ſhed <hi>INNOCENT BLOOD</hi> in their land: But <hi>America</hi> ſhall dwell forever, and <hi>this people</hi> from generation to generation.

               <hi>A NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</hi> As it was not conſiſtent with the limits of a ſingle diſcourſe, to give a full account of the particulars of this <hi>moſt ſavage</hi> and murderous affair; the following <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>faithful narrative of facts,</hi> as they appeared to us in this place, may be matter of ſatisfaction.</head>
            <p>ON the evening of the <hi>eighteenth</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1775, we received two meſſages; the firſt verbal, the other <hi>by expreſs, in writing,</hi> from the <hi>committee of ſafety,</hi> who were then ſitting in the weſterly part of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> directed to the Honorable JOHN HANCOCK, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (who, with the Honorable SAMUEL ADAMS, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was then providentially with us) informing, "that <hi>eight</hi> or <hi>nine officers</hi> of the <hi>king's troops</hi> were ſeen, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night, paſſing the road towards <hi>Lexington,</hi> in a <hi>muſing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative</hi> poſture; and it was ſuſpected they were out upon ſome evil deſign."</p>
            <p>As both theſe gentlemen had been frequently and even <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly,</hi> threatened, by the enemies of <hi>this people,</hi> both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> with the <hi>vengeance</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh adminiſtration:</hi>— And as Mr. <hi>Hancock</hi> in particular had been, more than once, <hi>perſonally inſulted,</hi> by ſome officers of the troops, in Boſton; it was not without ſome juſt grounds ſuppoſed, that under cover of the darkneſs, <hi>ſudden arreſt,</hi> if not <hi>aſſaſſination</hi> might be attempted, by theſe <hi>inſtruments of tyranny!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prevent any thing of this kind, <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twelve</hi> men were immediately collected, in arms, to guard my houſe, through the night.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, ſaid <hi>officers</hi> paſſed through this town, on the road towards <hi>Concord:</hi> It was therefore thought expedient to watch their motions, and if poſſible make ſome diſcovery of their intentions. Accordingly, about 10 o'clock in the evening, three men, on horſes, were diſpatched for this purpoſe. As they were <hi>peaceably</hi> paſſing the road towards <hi>Concord,</hi> in the borders of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> they were ſuddenly ſtopped by <hi>ſaid officers,</hi> who rode up to them, and putting piſtols to their breaſts and ſeizing their horſes bridles, <hi>ſwore, if they ſtirred another ſtep, they ſhould be all dead men!</hi>—The officers detained them ſeveral hours, as <hi>priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> examined, ſearched, abuſed and inſulted them; and in their haſty return (ſuppoſing themſelves diſcovered) they left them in Lexington.—Said officers alſo took into cuſtody, abuſed and <hi>threatened with their lives</hi> ſeveral other perſons; ſome of whom they met peaceably paſſing on the road, others even at the doors of their dwellings, without the leaſt provocation, on the part of the inhabitants, or ſo much as a queſtion aſked by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:043231_0031_101CD9A2EDBB65C0"/>Between the hours of <hi>twelve</hi> and <hi>one,</hi> on the morning of the NINETEENTH OF APRIL, we received intelligence, by expreſs, from the Honorable JOSEPH WARREN, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> at <hi>Boſton,</hi> "that a large body of the <hi>king's troops</hi> (ſuppoſed to be a brigade of about 12, or 1500) were embarked in boats from <hi>Boſton,</hi> and gone over to land on <hi>Lech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere's-Point</hi> (ſo called) in <hi>Cambridge:</hi> And that it was ſhrewdly ſuſpected, that they were ordered to ſeize and deſtroy the <hi>ſtores, belonging to the colony <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <p>Upon this intelligence, as alſo upon information of the conduct of the officers as above-mentioned, the <hi>militia</hi> of this town were alarmed, and ordered to meet on the uſual place of parade; not with any deſign of <hi>commencing hoſtilities</hi> upon the <hi>king's troops,</hi> but to conſult what might be done for our own and the people's ſafety: And alſo to be ready for whatever ſervice provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might call us out to, upon this alarming occaſion, in caſe <hi>overt-acts</hi> of <hi>violence,</hi> or <hi>open hoſtilities</hi> ſhould be committed by this <hi>mercenary band of armed and blood-thirſty oppreſſors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the ſame time, two perſons were ſent expreſs to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> if poſſible, to gain intelligence of the motions of the troops, and what rout they took.</p>
            <p>The <hi>militia</hi> met according to order; and waited the return of the meſſengers, that they might order their meaſures as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould require. Between 3 and 4 o'clock, one of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes returned, informing, that there was no appearance of the troops, on the roads, either from <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Charleſtown;</hi> and that it was ſuppoſed that the <hi>movements in the army</hi> the evening before, were only <hi>a feint</hi> to alarm the people. Upon this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the <hi>militia company</hi> were diſmiſſed for the preſent, but with orders to be within call of the drum,—waiting the return of the other meſſenger, who was expected in about an hour, or ſooner, if any diſcovery ſhould be made of the motions of the troops.— But he was prevented by their ſilent and ſudden arrival at the place where he was, waiting for intelligence. So that, after all this precaution, we had no notice of their approach, 'till the <hi>brigade</hi> was <hi>actually in the town,</hi> and upon a quick march within about a mile and a quarter of the <hi>meeting houſe</hi> and <hi>place of parade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, the commanding officer thought beſt to call the company together,—not with any deſign of oppoſing ſo ſuperior a force, <hi>much leſs of commencing hoſtilities;</hi> but only with a view to determine what to do, when and where to meet, and to diſmiſs and diſperſe.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, about half an hour after four o'clock, <hi>alarm guns were fired, and the drums beat to arms;</hi> and the <hi>militia</hi> were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:043231_0032_101CD9A475E3A398"/>
together.—Some, to the number of about 50, or 60, or poſſibly more, were on the parade, others were coming towards it.—In the mean time, the troops, having thus ſtolen a march upon us, and to prevent any intelligence of their approach, having ſeized and held priſoners ſeveral perſons whom they met <hi>unarmed</hi> upon the road, ſeemed to come <hi>determined for MURDER</hi> and <hi>BLOODSHED;</hi> and that whether provoked to it, or not!— When within about half a quarter of a mile of the <hi>meeting-houſe,</hi> they halted, and the command was given to <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>load;</hi> which being done, they marched on 'till they came up to the eaſt end of ſaid meeting-houſe, in ſight of our <hi>militia</hi> (collecting as aforeſaid) who were about 12, or 13 rods diſtant.—Immediately upon their appearing <hi>ſo ſuddenly,</hi> and <hi>ſo nigh,</hi> Capt. <hi>Parker,</hi> who commanded the <hi>militia company,</hi> ordered the men to diſperſe, and take care of themſelves; and <hi>not to fire.</hi>—Upon this, our men diſperſed;—but, many of them, not ſo ſpeedily as they might have done, not having the moſt diſtant idea of ſuch <hi>brutal barbarity</hi> and more than <hi>ſavage CRUELTY,</hi> from the troops of a <hi>Britiſh KING,</hi> as they immediately experienced!—!—For, no ſooner did they come in ſight of our company, but one of them, ſuppoſed to be an officer of rank, was heard to ſay to the troops, <hi>"Damn them; we will have them!"</hi>—Upon which the troops ſhouted aloud, huzza'd, and ruſhed furiouſly towards our men.—About the ſame time, three officers (ſuppoſed to be Col. <hi>Smith,</hi> Major <hi>Pitcaira</hi> and another officer) advanced, on horſe back, to the front of the body, and coming within 5 or 6 rods of the <hi>militia,</hi> one of them cried out, <hi>"ye villains, ye Rebels, diſperſe; Damn you, diſperſe!"</hi>—or words to this effect. One of them (whether the ſame, or not, is not eaſily determined) ſaid, <hi>"Lay down your arms; Damn you, why don't you lay down your arms!"</hi>—The ſecond of theſe officers, about this time, fired a piſtol towards the <hi>militia,</hi> as they were diſperſing.—The foremoſt, who was within a few yards of our men, brandiſhing his ſword, and then pointing towards them, with a loud voice ſaid, to the troops, "Fire!—By God, fire!"—which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly followed by a diſcharge of arms from the ſaid troops, ſucceeded by a very heavy and cloſe fire upon our party, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing, ſo long as any of them were within reach.—<hi>Eight were left dead upon the ground!</hi>

               <hi>Ten were wounded.</hi>—The reſt of the company, through divine goodneſs, were (to a miracle) preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unhurt in this <hi>murderous</hi> action!—</p>
            <p>As to the queſtion, 'Who fired firſt?'—if it can be a queſtion with any; we may obſerve, that though <hi>General Gage</hi> hath been pleaſed to tell the world, in his account of this <hi>ſavage tranſaction,</hi> "that the troops were fired upon by <hi>the rebels</hi> out of the <hi>meeting-houſe,</hi>

            <p>To ſay nothing of the abſurdity of the ſuppoſition, 'that 50, 60, or even 70 men, ſhould, in the <hi>open field, commence hoſtilities</hi> with 12, or 1500, of the beſt troops of <hi>Britain,</hi>

               <note n="‡" place="bottom">See narrative and depoſitions, publiſhed by authority.</note>—And I think, we may ſafely add, without the leaſt reaſon or provocation.—Nor was there oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity given, for our men to have ſaved themſelves, either by laying down their arms, or diſperſing, as directed, had they been diſpoſed to; as the command to fire upon them was given almoſt at the ſame inſtant, that they were ordered, by the <hi>Britiſh officers,</hi> to <hi>diſperſe,</hi> to <hi>lay down their arms,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, ſo far from <hi>firing firſt</hi> upon the king's troops; upon the moſt careful enquiry, it appears, that but very few of our people fired at all; and even <hi>they</hi> did not fire till after being fired upon by the troops, they were wounded themſelves, or ſaw others killed, or wounded by them, and looked upon it next to impoſſible for them to eſcape.</p>
            <p>As to any firing from the <hi>meeting-houſe,</hi> as <hi>Gage</hi> repreſents; it is certain, that there were but <hi>four men</hi> in the meeting houſe, when the troops came up: and they were then getting ſome am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, from the town ſtock, and had not ſo much as loaded their guns (except one, who never diſcharged it) when the troops fired upon the <hi>militia.</hi> And as to the <hi>neighbouring houſes,</hi> it is equally certain, that there was no firing from them, unleſs, after the diſperſion of our men, ſome, who had fled to them for ſhelter, might fire from them upon the troops.</p>
            <p>One circumſtance more, before the brigade quitted Lexington, I beg leave to mention, as what may give a further ſpecimen of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>character,</hi> of the officers and men, of this body of troops.—After the <hi>militia company</hi> were diſperſed and the firing

ceaſed, the troops drew up and formed, in a body on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>fired a volley</hi> and <hi>gave three huzzas,</hi> by way of <hi>triumph,</hi> and as expreſſive of the <hi>joy of VICTORY</hi> and <hi>glory of CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUEST!</hi>—!—Of this tranſaction, I was a witneſs, having, at that time, a fair view of their motions, and being at the diſtance of not more than 70 or 80 rods from them.</p>
            <p>Whether this ſtep was <hi>honorary</hi> to the detachment, or agreeable to the rules of war—or how far it was expreſſive of <hi>bravery, heroiſm</hi> and <hi>true military glory,</hi> for 800 diſciplined troops of <hi>Great-Briain,</hi> without notice or provocation, to fall upon 60, or 70, undiſciplined <hi>Americans,</hi> who neither oppoſed nor moleſted them, and <hi>murder</hi> ſome and diſperſe the reſt, and then to <hi>give the ſhout</hi> and <hi>make the triumph of victory,</hi> is not for me to determine; but muſt be ſubmitted to the impartial world to judge.—That "there is a God with whom is the power, and the glory, and the victory," is certain: but whether he will <hi>ſet his ſeal</hi> to the triumph, made upon this moſt <hi>peculiar</hi> occaſion, by following it with further ſucceſſes, and finally giving up <hi>this people</hi> into the hands of thoſe, that have thus <hi>cruelly</hi> commenced hoſtilities againſt them, muſt be left to time to diſcover.—But to return from this digreſſion, if it may be called a diſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>Having thus <hi>vanquiſhed the party</hi> in <hi>Lexington,</hi> the troops marched on for <hi>Concord,</hi> to execute their orders, in deſtroying the ſtores belonging to the colony, depoſited there—They met with no interruption in their march to <hi>Concord.</hi>—But by ſome means or other, the people of <hi>Concord</hi> had notice of their approach and deſigns, and were alarmed about break of day; and collecting as ſoon, and as many as poſſible, improved the time they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the troops came upon them, to the beſt advantage, both for concealing and ſecuring as many of the public ſtores as they could, and in preparing for defence. —By the ſtop of the troops at Lexington, many thouſands were ſaved to the colony, and they were, in a great meaſure, fruſtrated in their deſign.</p>
            <p>When the troops made their approach to the eaſterly part of the town, the provincials of <hi>Concord</hi> and ſome neighbouring towns, were collected and collecting in an advantageous poſt, on a hill, a little diſtance from the <hi>meeting-houſe,</hi> north of the road, to the number of about 150, or 200: but finding the troops to be more than three times as many, they wiſely retreated, firſt to a hill about 80 rods further north, and then over, the <hi>north-bridge</hi> (ſo called) about a mile from the town: and there they waited the coming of the <hi>militia</hi> of the towns adjacent, to their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Britiſh detachment marched into the center of the town. A party of about 200, was ordered to take poſſeſſion of ſaid bridge, other parties were diſpatched to various
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:043231_0035_101CD9AB2C195650"/>
parts of the town, in ſearch of public ſtores, while the remainder were employed in ſeizing and deſtroying, whatever they could find in the <hi>town-houſe,</hi> and other places, where ſtores had been lodged.—But before they had accompliſhed their deſign, they were interrupted by a diſcharge of arms, at <hi>ſaid bridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems, that of the party above-mentioned, as ordered to take poſſeſſion of the bridge, one half were marched on about two miles, in ſearch of ſtores, at Col. <hi>Barret's</hi> and that part of the town: while the other half, conſiſting of towards 100 men, under Capt. <hi>Lawrie,</hi> were left to guard the bridge. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials, who were in ſight of the bridge, obſerving the troops attempting to take up the planks of ſaid bridge, thought it neceſſary to diſlodge them, and gain poſſeſſion of the bridge.— They accordingly marched, but with expreſs orders not to fire, unleſs firſt fired upon by the king's troops. Upon their approach towards the bridge, Capt. <hi>Lawrie's</hi> party fired upon them, killed Capt. <hi>Davis</hi> and another man dead upon the ſpot, and wounded ſeveral others. Upon this our <hi>militia</hi> ruſhed on, with a ſpirit becoming <hi>free-born Americans,</hi> returned the fire upon the enemy, killed 2, wounded ſeveral and drove them from the bridge, and purſued them towards the town, 'till they were covered by a reinforcement from the main body. The provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials then took poſt on a hill, at ſome diſtance, north of the town: and as their numbers were continually increaſing, they were preparing to give the troops a <hi>proper diſcharge,</hi> on their departure from the town.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the king's troops collected; and having dreſſed their wounded, deſtroyed what ſtores they could find, and inſulted and plundered a number of the inhabitants, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for a retreat.</p>
            <p>"While at <hi>Concord,</hi> the troops diſabled two 24 pounders; deſtroyed their 2 carriages, and ſeven wheels for the ſame, with their limbers. Sixteen wheels for braſs 3 pounders, and 2 carriages with limber and wheels for two 4 pounders. They threw into the river, wells, &amp;c. about 500 weight of ball: and ſtove about 60 barrels of flour; but not having time to perfect their work, one half of the flour was afterwards ſaved."<note n="*" place="bottom">See Rev. Mr. Gordon's account.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The troops began a haſty retreat about the middle of the day: and were no ſooner out of the town, but they began to meet the effects of the juſt reſentments of this injured people. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials fired upon them from various quarters, and purſued them (though without any military order) with a firmneſs and intrepidity, beyond what could have been expected, on the firſt onſet, and in ſuch a day of confuſion and diſtreſs!—The fire was returned, for a time, with great fury, by the troops as they

retreated, though (through divine goodneſs) with but little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.—This ſcene continued, with but little intermiſſion, till they returned to Lexington; when it was evident, that, having loſt numbers in killed, wounded, and priſoners that fell into our hands, they began to be, not only fatigued, but greatly diſheartened. And it is ſuppoſed they muſt have ſoon ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at diſcretion, had they not been reinforced.—But <hi>Lord Percy's</hi> arrival with another brigade, of about 1000 men, and 2 field pieces, about half a mile from Lexington <hi>meeting-houſe,</hi> towards <hi>Cambridge,</hi> gave them a ſeaſonable reſpite.</p>
            <p>The coming of the reinforcement, with <hi>the cannon,</hi> (which our people were not ſo well acquainted with then, as they have been ſince) put the provincials alſo to a pauſe, for a time.—But no ſooner were the <hi>king's troops</hi> in motion, but our men renewed the purſuit with equal, and even greater ardor and intrepidity than before, and the firing on both ſides continued, with but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, to the cloſe of the day, when the troops entered <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> where the <hi>provincials</hi> could not follow them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing the worthy inhabitants of that <hi>truly patriotic town,</hi> to their rage and revenge.—That night and the next day, they were conveyed in boats, over <hi>Charles-River</hi> to <hi>Boſton,</hi> glad to ſecure themſelves, under the cover of the ſhipping, and by ſtrengthning and perfecting the fortifications, at every part, againſt the further attacks of a juſtly incenſed people, who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intelligence of the <hi>murderous tranſactions</hi> of this fatal day, were collecting in arms, round the town, in great numbers, and from every quarter.</p>
            <p>In the retreat of the king's troops from <hi>Concord</hi> to <hi>Lexington,</hi> they ravaged and plundered, as they had opportunity, more or leſs, in moſt of the houſes that were upon the road.—But after they were joined by <hi>Piercy's brigade,</hi> in Lexington, it ſeemed as if <hi>all the little remains</hi> of humanity had left them; and rage and revenge had taken the reins. and knew no bounds!—<hi>Cloathing, furniture, proviſions, goods, plundered, broken, carried off, or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!—Buildings (eſpecially dwelling houſes) abuſed, defaced, battered, ſhattered and almoſt ruined!—And as if this had not been enough, numbers of them doomed to the flames!—Three dwelling houſes, two ſhops and a barn, were laid in aſhes, in Lexington</hi>

            <p>Our loſs, in the ſeveral actions of that day, was 49 killed, 34 wounded and 5 miſſing, who were taken priſoners, and have ſince been exchanged. The enemy's loſs, according to the beſt accounts, in killed, wounded and miſſing, about 300.</p>
            <p>As the war was thus began with <hi>ſavage cruelty,</hi> in the aggreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; ſo it has been carried on with the ſame temper and ſpirit, by the enemy in but too many inſtances.

But as events which have taken place ſince the <hi>ever memorable nineteenth of April,</hi> 1775. do not properly come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of this narrative, they muſt be left for ſome abler pen to relate.</p>
