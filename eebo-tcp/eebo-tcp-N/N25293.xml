            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I KNOW it has been thought, that <hi>I was afraid</hi> to publiſh an account of the proſecution car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on againſt me by the State Government of Pennſylvania, at the inſtance of the Spaniſh Miniſter. I can readily excuſe people for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining this opinion, becauſe the American preſs is become the moſt tame, the moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the moſt abject upon the face of the earth; and becauſe I count it no diſhonour not to be thought a match for the dangers to which I am expoſed. The opinion will, however, be found to be eroneous. I have, in the following ſheets, exhibited this unparalleled proceeding to the world in its true colours; and I take this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of declaring my fixed determination to perſevere in rendering equally notorious, every fact, of which ſuch like proceedings ſhall put me in poſſeſſion.—My daily occupations leave me but little time for undertakings of this ſort; but my juſt reſentment, though ſlow in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſhall not be leſs ſure in its effects.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>JUDGE M'KEAN, the Chief Juſtice of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, in his charge to the Grand Jury (of which the reader will ſee enough by-and-by), obſerved, that
<q>
                  <hi>the liberty of the press</hi> was a phraſe much uſed, but little underſtood.</q>
This, in a <hi>public servant,</hi> as all the democratic officers call themſelves, is making pretty free with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the ſovereign people, and of a people too whom the Congreſs have declared <hi>free</hi> and <hi>enlightened,</hi> and would have declared the "<hi>free-est</hi> and moſt <hi>enlightened in the world,</hi>" had it not been for their deſire
<q>to avoid all <hi>cause of offence</hi>
               </q>
towards the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>enlightened</hi> French.<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Cenſor</hi> for December, 1796, for a full account of this humiliating buſineſs.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Judge was certainly wrong. No people underſtand what the liberty of the preſs means better than the Americans do. No one knows ſo well how to appreciate the value of a thing, as he who has long enjoyed, and then loſt it.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033523_0004_0FF771CE843A6D90"/>
Had the Judge called the liberty of the preſs a thing much talked about, much boaſted of, and <hi>very little enjoyed,</hi> I would moſt readily have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to his aſſertion; for, of all the countries under the Sun, where <hi>unlicensed</hi> preſſes are tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated, I am bold to declare, and the contents of this pamphlet will eſtabliſh the truth of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that none ever enjoyed leſs <hi>real</hi> liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the preſs than America has for ſome years paſt.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay, that this liberty has been abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any poſitive law; on the contrary, I know well, that ſeveral of the State Conſtitutions hold out a ſomething (not very intelligible to be ſure) that would ſeem to extend the liberty of printing beyond the limits preſcribed by the Engliſh law. Nor do I pretend, that this dangerous abridgment of American freedom is to be attributed to tho change, which the revolution has produced in the name and nature of the government. I will not, for a moment, be ſaid to inſinuate, that the preſs is become not free, merely becauſe the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is become <hi>republican.</hi> No; I think, the people, when they adopted this form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, expected, as they certainly <hi>were led to expect,</hi> an extention of this, and every other important branch of their liberties. What I contend for, is, that, ſome how or other, this liberty has been abridged; the exerciſe of it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by popular prejudice, by the influence of party, the fear of mobiſh violence, or of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental tyranny, has been, and yet is, moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and diſgracefully <hi>restrained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:033523_0005_0FF771D2A69814C8"/>To enter into the cauſes, which have produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this fatal effect, would be to revive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what I wiſh may ever remain buried in oblivion. I will therefore content myſelf with <hi>proving the fact;</hi> and to do this to the ſatisfaction of every candid mind, I need go no farther back than my own times.</p>
            <p>When I firſt came to Philadelphia, I was charmed with the literary liberty, which its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſeemed to enjoy. I ſaw pamphlets in every window, and news-papers in every hand. I was, indeed rather ſurpriſed to find, that thoſe pamphlets, and theſe news-papers were, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like <hi>a certain Judge</hi> that I had heard of, <hi>all on one side:</hi> but, ſaid I to myſelf, this muſt be the fault of the authors and editors; and it leaves, the more room for ſuch as have a mind to write on the other ſide. With this agreeable but deluſive notion in my brain, I ſat down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented under the calamity of reading daily, in common with my poor fellow citizens, about eighteen or twenty long columns of the vileſt and moſt inſipid traſh that ever was ſtamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paper.</p>
            <p>Long did I hope, and expect, to ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a manly and effectual oppoſition to this flood of falshood and partiality; but I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and expected in vain. At laſt, it was <hi>my</hi> fate to enter the field. I had long felt a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming indignation at the atrocious ſlander that was continually vomitted forth againſt Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and the malignancy of Prieſtley and his addreſſers at New-York brought it into action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:033523_0006_0FF771D57AC067C0"/>The OBSERVATIONS on the emigration of this reſtleſs and ambitious demagogue contain, as I have elſewhere remarked,
<q>not one untruth, one anarchical, indecent, immoral, or irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expreſſion</q>;
yet, when I came to offer it for the preſs, the bookſeller was afraid it was not <hi>popular enough.</hi> He was far, as he ſaid, from diſapproving of the work; but it was <hi>too much in favour of Great Britain,</hi> and on this account he thought it would endanger his <hi>windows,</hi> if not his <hi>person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This mans fears ſeemed to me perfectly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. The pamphlet ſaid not a word in praiſe of Great Britain, generally. Indeed, policy had led me to ſpeak rather harſhly of that nation in one paſſage or two; and ſo evident was this, that the <hi>Britiſh Critics,</hi> though they pay the author compliments far beyond his merit, cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to lament, they ſay, that ſo enlightened a mind ſhould ſtill harbour <hi>a rancour so implacable.</hi> Theſe people, though certainly not leſs pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating than GOOSY TOM in the common affairs of literature, would have laughed at the idea of broken windows and baſted carcaſſes.</p>
            <p>However, notwithſtanding the ridicule, which this remark of the BRITISH CRITICS is calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to throw on the apprehenſions of my book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, now the <hi>worthy partner</hi> of LLOYD, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent events have proved, that thoſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions were not entirely groundleſs: for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he did publiſh ſeveral ſucceeding pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets from the ſame pen, without incurring a penalty of any kind, yet no ſooner was the <hi>real author</hi> known, than he began to ſee, and to feel
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033523_0007_0FF771D824A18870"/>
too, that BRADFORD underſtood the <hi>American liberty of the press</hi> far better than he did.</p>
            <p>During the publication of the reſt of the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets that iſſued from BRADFORD's, I had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to contend with his ſcruples and his fears. In particular, I remember, that my calling the French miniſter ADET, no <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> was very hard to be ſurmounted. The French had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt blaſphemously <hi>aboliſhed the Chriſtian religion</hi>; and the Convention, who had ſent out this embaſſador, had even formally <hi>denied the being of a God</hi>; yet, ſo high was this bookſeller's notions of the <hi>liberty of the press,</hi> that he was afraid to publiſh a ſentence, in which the French miniſter was ſaid <hi>not to be a Chriſtian</hi>! If as much had been ſaid of the Engliſh miniſter, though falſe, he would, I am pretty confident have had no ſcruples at all.</p>
            <p>It was no ſooner diſcovered that I was PETER PORCUPINE, and that I had taken the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent houſe and ſhop, that I now occupy, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to carry on the printing and bookſelling buſineſs, than the French faction began to muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their forces and put themſelves in battle array. Several infamous publications appeared in BACHE's paper, declaring me to be a <hi>deserter,</hi> a <hi>felon,</hi> a <hi>thief</hi> who had fled from the <hi>gallows,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Strong in my innocence I ſteadily purſued my courſe, and, thank God, my ſteadineſs was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſucceſs. Stung at the contempt with which I treated theſe abominable attempts on my character, another mode of injuring me
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033523_0008_0FF771DADDCECC60"/>
was fallen upon. A <hi>threatning letter</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed under the door of my landlord, the baſe object of which the letter itſelf will beſt explain. It is a performance that ſhould ever find a place in a work that treats of the
<q>unreſtrained liberty of the preſs.</q>
Here it is.</p>

            <p>It will be remembered, that I inſtantly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed this letter, accompanied with comments, in which I ſet the authors (for they were many) at defiance; but I did not mention then a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that it is proper I ſhould mention now.

            <p>The American who can read this without bluſhing is an object of contempt, of ſcorn; a neutralized animal that has no idea of national honour, and that would ſell his country, were it in his power, for a ſingle Louis d'or. Yet ſuch there are, and in abundance too.</p>
            <p>A publication like this, the direct and avowed object of which was, to inſtigate the <hi>free</hi> men to devaſtation and <hi>murder,</hi> ſhould, one would think, have been noticed by the magiſtrates, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly under the eye of a <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> whom we ſhall by-and-by ſee ſo zealous and ſo watchful. But, no. It attracted the attention of no one, or at leaſt no one took any meaſures

to prevent the intended aſſault. My houſe and my family might have been burnt to aſhes; we might all have been dragged into the ſtreet and murdered, and, I ſincerely believe, not ſo much as a conſtable would have held up his ſtaff to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the aſſaſſins We were, however, prepared for their reception. We ſhould not have fallen unrevenged. Some of their ſouls would have taken their departure from my door-way on their journey to hell.</p>
            <p>It is here that I ought, and that I do with pleaſure, acknowledge the generoſity of ſeveral gentlemen of the city (many of whom I never ſaw), who I was afterwards aſſured, had formed the reſolution to ſummon the magiſtrates, and to come to my aid in perſon. One gentleman in particular, whom I did not then know even by name, went in diſguiſe among the groups of <hi>free</hi> men to endeavour to find out their intention. I wiſh I <hi>durst</hi> name him now; but my <hi>gratitude</hi> to him forbids me to do it. When <hi>liberty</hi> comes to this pitch, I think it ought to aſſume ſome other name.</p>
            <p>But, what was the moſt ſhameful, and what is moſt directly to the point before us, was, this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious, this cut-throat attack on the liberty of the preſs, was ſuffered to paſs unnoticed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by all the other preſſes in this city, but by all the preſſes in the continent. There are, perhaps, two or three hundred news-papers publiſhed in the United States, and not one of them have ever whiſpered a word in condemnation of it, from that day to this.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:033523_0012_0FF771E65926A4F8"/>If, however, it was proper to deſtroy me; if "<hi>Justice, honour,</hi> and <hi>national gratitude</hi>" de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my blood for exerciſing the liberty of the preſs, that ſame "<hi>Justice, honour</hi> and <hi>nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gratitude</hi>" did, it ſeems, require my enemies to exerciſe that liberty in <hi>perfect safety.</hi> No leſs than ſeven pamphlets were, in this city, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt me in the ſpace of ten days. It is a pity they cannot now be found above ground. Had they lived, they would have been a laſting honour to the country that gave them birth, and particularly to the <hi>equal</hi> laws and <hi>impartial judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary</hi> that tolerated them. They were, all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a compoſition of brutality, ſlander, and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy of every ſort and deſcription, that would have diſgraced hell itſelf. The anonymous ſcoundrels who wrote them vied with each other in baſeneſs and atrocity; and one of them, who ſeemed reſolved to have the pre-eminence in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, and for whom everlaſting damnation is too mild a puniſhment, inſinuated <hi>that my wife was a whore!</hi>—And all this, only becauſe I had written with ſucceſs againſt a nefarious French faction.

            <p>I ſhall wind up this ſeries of injuries, of baſe machinations and brutal autrage, that have been attempted againſt me, with an anecdote, which cannot fail to give the reader a high opinion of the decency, candour and juſtice to be met with in Pennſylvania.—A great beef-headed purblind creature, that calls itſelf a young lawyer, and whoſe pleading bears an infinite reſemblance to the bleating of an overgrown calf, obſerved to * * * * * juſt before the court ſat, that it was quite wrong to honour me with a <hi>legal</hi> puniſhment; and that, if I had cenſured him, as I had done ſome other of the <hi>patriots,</hi> he would have clapped a piſtol to my <hi>breast</hi> and blowed my <hi>brains</hi> out!—There now, leaving the <hi>bull</hi> aſide, is a noble ſentiment for you! What ſort of juſtice has a man to expect, where ſuch language can, <hi>in ſuch company,</hi> be held with impunity?—However, I will never fly to the law to ſhelter me from the vengence of this bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing animal, who, inſtead of ſtanding erect before the bench, ought to be placed on all fours before a rack and manger. I will never fly to the law, or to any thing elſe, to ſhelter me from the ſoft horns of this half-grown, blink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bloated cornuto.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now enter into a recital of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, of various ſorts, which other printers, not devoted to the French, have experienced; but this would lead me too far.

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:033523_0015_0FF771EF306A4980"/>This extract is taken from BACHE'S paper, No. 1044; and the circumſtances of the baſe tranſaction that it recounts were pretty exactly as it deſcribes them. This printer was exhibited as a <hi>rogue</hi> that merited to be <hi>hung</hi> and <hi>burnt</hi>; and his author if found, would have actually ſuffered this ignominious fate: and all this for writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and publiſhing—what?—A ſenſible eſſay, adviſing the people not to make themſelves appear like fools and madmen, by adopting the fantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical fopperies, or rather by ranging themſelves under the colours, of a <hi>foreign nation!</hi>—Will any one pretend to ſay, that, in a country where ſuch unjuſt, tyrannical, and inhuman proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings could take place, and paſs unpuniſhed and unnoticed by the civil power; will any one have the effrontery to ſay, that, in ſuch a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there is any thing worthy of being called, <hi>the liberty of the press</hi>?—But, no more. It is mere mockery to talk of it.</p>
            <p>Now, in anſwer to all this, ſome precious vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, deep leaned in the jargon of the <hi>Rights of Man</hi>; or ſome temporizing drivler from the canting ſchool of <hi>modern republicanism</hi>: ſome infamous BACHE or trimming NOAH WEBSTER, will tell me that nothing which I have here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, tends to prove the preſs to be in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They will ſay, that ſo long as it remains unſhackled by <hi>the law</hi>! ſo long as <hi>the law</hi> does not invade its liberty, it is <hi>free.</hi>—No; it is not ſo.

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033523_0016_0FF771F0B401ACC8"/>
that "<hi>the printing presses shall be free,</hi>" pledges the faith and honour of the nation to <hi>protect them in the exercise of their freedom</hi>; and to fail in yielding them this protection, is as much a breach of the national ſaith as is an actual inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this freedom by the law; for, where is the difference to the printer, whether the law itſelf reſtrain his preſs, or ſuffer it to be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? I think I hate <hi>a tyrant</hi> (and I think <hi>I have reason</hi>) as much as moſt men do! but I would much rather a tyrant ſhould order my rights to be ſurpreſſed, than have them rifled from me by his tools, a brutal and ferocious mob</p>
            <p>For want of this ſo neceſſary protection it is, that the infernal French faction have, aided by certain men in power in moſt of the State Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, got the <hi>real</hi> liberty of the preſs into their poſſeſſion, to the almoſt general excluſion of their opponents. For want of this protection it is, that the friends of the Federal Government have been abaſhed, humbled, ſilenced, and, in many inſtances, induced to <hi>change sides</hi>: and, it is for want of this protection, that we at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſee ſuch numbers of inſipid, tame and trimming papers, which, under the cowardly guiſe of <hi>impartiality,</hi> are a diſgrace to literature, a diſhonour to the country, a clog to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and a curſe to the people.</p>
            <p>I have now, I think, and in pretty plain language too, proved, that, ſome way or other, the liberty of the American preſs has been moſt ſcandalouſly attacked and reſtrained, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>law</hi> declares, <hi>it shall be perfectly free.</hi> What the law itſelf, and thoſe who admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter

            <p>WHEN I undertook the publiſhing of a daily paper, it was with the intention of annihilating, if poſſible, the intriguing, wicked, and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable faction, which the French had formed in this country. I was fully aware of the arduouſneſs of the taſk, and of the inconvenience and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to which it would expoſe both me and mine. I was prepared to meet the rancorous vengence of enemies in the hour of their triumph, and the coolneſs of friends in the hour of my peril: in ſhort, to acquire riches ſeemed to me quite uncertain, and to be ſtripped of every farthing of my property ſeemed extremely probable; but let what would happen, I was reſolved to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the contemplated object, as long as there remained the moſt diſtant probability of ſucceſs.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:033523_0019_0FF771FF5DFD5E40"/>Among the dangers, which preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to me, thoſe to be apprehended from the ſeverity of the law appeared the moſt formidable; more eſpecially as I happened to be ſituated <hi>in the State of Pennsylvania,</hi> where the government, generally ſpeaking, was in the hands of thoſe, who had (and ſometimes with great indecency) manifeſted an uniform partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for the ſans-culotte French, and as unifom an oppoſition to the miniſters and meaſures of the Federal Government. Theſe perſons I knew I had offended by the promulgation of diſagreeable truths; and, therefore, it was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, that I ſhould ſeek for ſome ſtandard as a ſafe rule for my conduct with reſpect to <hi>the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my press.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſet about the ſtudy of the law of <hi>libels,</hi> to wade through fifty volumes of myſterious tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, was what I had neither time nor patience to do. The Engliſh preſs was ſaid to be <hi>ensla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>; but, when I came to conſult the practice of this enſlaved preſs, I found it ſtill to be far <hi>too free</hi> for me to attempt to follow its example. Finally, it appeared to me to be the ſafeſt way, to form to myſelf ſome rule founded on the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exerciſed by the <hi>American press.</hi> I conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I might, without danger, go as great lengths in attacking the enemies of the country as others went in attacking its friends: that as much zeal might be ſhown in defending the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Government and adminiſtration as in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing and traducing them: and that as great warmth would be admiſſible in the cauſe of virtue, order, and religion, as had long been tolerated in the wicked cauſe of villainy,

inſurrection, and blaſphemy. What ever ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour might be harboured againſt me in the breaſts of particular perſons, I depended on <hi>shame</hi> to reſtrain the arm of power: I thought no officer or officers of ſtate, would, in this country, dare to deal towards an honeſt man with a rigour which had never been experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the vileſt of miſcreants. Alas!
<q>all this I thought, and all I thought was wrong;</q>
as the following ſheets will moſt clearly evince.</p>
            <p>Before I enter on the account of the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs proſecution which this Pennſylvania ſtate government has compelled me to ſuſtain, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to notice ſome ſteps that were taken by my enemies previouſly thereto.</p>
            <p>Some time in the month of Auguſt laſt, the Spaniſh Miniſter Don Carlos Martinez de'Yru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jo, applied to the Federal Government to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute me for certain matters publiſhed in my Gazette, againſt himſelf and that poor unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and humbled mortal, Charles the fourth, King of Spain. The government conſented, and I was accordingly bound over, before the Honourble Judge Peters, to appear in the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral diſtrict court, which will meet next April.</p>
            <p>Of this preparatory ſtep to <hi>a fair and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> trial the Don was informed. But, it would ſeem, the information was far from being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to him; for, he delivered in a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Federal Government, requeſting (for what reaſon I leave the reader to determine) that the trial might come on before the Supreme Court of Pennſylvania, of which court <hi>M'Kean is Chief Juſtice.</hi>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:033523_0021_0FF7D494A531E190"/>Thus foiled in the grand object, a new ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny was, without much regard to decency, ſet on foot; new pretended libels were hunted out; and, an application to proſecute me was made to the government of Pennſylvania. It is hardly neceſſary to ſay that conſent was ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained. A bill of indictment was prepared by the attorney General of the ſtate, and a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, of which the following is a copy was iſſued to ſieze me.</p>

            <p>If I did not well know, that all inſtruments of this kind, coming from under the hand and ſeal of a <hi>Judge,</hi> are, by privilege immemorial, exempted from the laſh of criticiſm, I ſhould moſt certainly be tempted to try my hand on the warrant.—For inſtance: the Commonwealth is called US, and this may be proper enough, as the Commonwealth, in the modern ſtile, means the <hi>citizens thereof.</hi> But, what ſhall we make of the paſſage, where it is ſaid, that I endeavoured to alienate the affections of the Spaniards from the citizens of the United States <hi>and of</hi> US; that is, from the citizens of the United States, <hi>and from the citizens of</hi> US; and this laſt ſentence means, <hi>from the citizens of the citizens of the Commonwealth</hi>! In the name of mercy what is all this! Is the form intended to convey a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the citizens of Pennſylvania have <hi>other citizens</hi> under their controul and government; or that the citizens of the Commonwealth are
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033523_0023_0FF7D491A1B8CC18"/>
               <hi>their own citizens,</hi> and that WE govern US?— A projector ſome few years ago received a <hi>prize medal</hi> from the philoſophical ſociety of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, for having invented an <hi>American language.</hi> I wonder if this warrant be a ſpecimen of it?</p>
            <p>But, let <hi>us</hi> return to more ſolid matter.</p>
            <p>The trifling circumſtances attending an arreſt and giving bail are ſcarcely worth relating; but, ſometimes, trifling circumſtances ſerve to convey a more correct idea of the character of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned in a tranſaction, and to guide the reader to a more juſt appreciation of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, than the longeſt and moſt laboured gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral account of their conduct.</p>
            <p>The Sheriff (whoſe civility and candour I have every reaſon to applaud) came to my houſe, for <hi>the first time,</hi> at twelve o'clock; and he was ordered to have me before the Judge <hi>at half past one.</hi> Thank God, I am not verſed in arreſts; but, I believe, this is the firſt time, that ever a man, proſecuted for a libel, was pinned down to the ſhort ſpace of <hi>an hour and a half</hi> to prepare for going out and to procure himſelf bail. The Engliſh reader (for this pamphlet ſhall be read in England) will obſerve, that this government of Pennſylvania, is that which is everlaſtingly boaſting of the <hi>mildness</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> of its laws.</p>
            <p>I was not ſo deſtitute of friends as, perhaps, the Judge expected I was. Bail was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and we were before him at the appointed time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:033523_0024_0FF7D498A2CE7238"/>He aſked us to ſit down. I ſeated myſelf on one ſide of the fire, and he on the other. After he had talked on for ſome time to very little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (at leaſt as to the effect his talk produced on me), he ſhewed me certain newſpapers, and aſked me if <hi>I had printed and published them.</hi> To this I replied, <hi>that the law did not require me to answer any questions in that stage of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that, therefore, I should not do it.</hi> At this reply, though a very prudent and a very proper one, "he waxed exceeding wroth." He inſtantly ordered me to get off my chair and ſtand up before him, though he himſelf had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to ſit down. This ſpecies of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo becoming in a <hi>Judge,</hi> excited in my mind no other ſentiments than that which I dare ſay it has already excited in the mind of the reader.</p>
            <p>The next document, which follows in due courſe, is THE BILL OF INDICTMENT; the IGNORAMUS Bill of Indictment.—Go over it with attention, I beſeech thee, reader; or elſe, take my word for it, you will be juſt as wiſe when you have done, as you are now. You muſt have your eyes well about you; keep a ſharp look out for parentheſiſes and quotations; and, above all you muſt <hi>hold your breath to the bottom of a paragraph</hi>; if you can't do this, you will no more underſtand it than you would the croaking of a frog or the cakling of a gooſe.— Therefore, again I ſay, attention!</p>

            <p>THIS Bill of Indictment, however inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant it may be in itſelf, has already made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable noiſe in the world, and it will yet make a great deal more. Papers of this ſort generally travel from the court to the clerk's office; and there they lodge in eternal ſleep. But this Bill is certainly deſtined to another fate. Neptune will lend his waves and Aeolus his winds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct it over the deep. It will ſee climes that the inventors of it never ſaw, nor ever will ſee. Little did they imagine, that they were becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>authors,</hi> and authors of ſuch celebrity too, as, if it pleaſe God, I will render them.</p>
            <p>The identical copy of this precious document of liberty, which I received from the clerk's office, ſtamped with the arms of poor Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, I ſhall ſend to London by the next pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, addreſſed to MR. REEVES'S loyal ſociety of the Crown and Anchor. When they are infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>reformists,</hi> or any other noiſy gang
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033523_0029_0FF77217D33680B8"/>
of <hi>liberty men,</hi> they will have nothing to do but ſhow them this Bill, and ſay:
<q>Here, you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented dogs, is this what you are barking after? If it be, go to that <hi>free</hi> country, Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</q>
I am much miſtaken if the bare ſight of it would not make more converts to their cauſe than all the means, that their talents and their laudable zeal have hitherto invented or employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is a ſample of the liberty which the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected in Britain are ſighing after; and they would exclaim with the old miller in the fable, "if ſuch is the <hi>sample,</hi> what muſt be the <hi>sack</hi>!"</p>
            <p>The charges contained in the Bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lie buried in ſuch a multitude of words which mean nothing, or at leaſt nothing to the purpoſe, that they are very difficult to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Some one ſays of a man extremely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſe in his converſation, that "his wit is like three grains of wheat in a buſhel of chaff;" and exactly the ſame may with truth be ſaid of the meaning of this Bill. The <hi>three libels,</hi> as they are called, may all be contained in a quarter of a page, whereas the Bill is ſwelled out to three or four pages. Let us, then, ſift out the <hi>three grains of wheat,</hi> leaving the chaff behind.</p>
            <p>The beſt way of doing this, and of enabling the reader to form a correct judgment both as to their import and their tendency, will be to lay before him the three publications (in which they are to be found) entire and undiſtorted, marking the pretended libellous parts in <hi>it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>that now looks ſo bright, will ſoon be darkened by clouds, heavier than any that has yet hung over you. Your government will be torn by civil factions, and you will be toſſed to and fro, like a tennis-ball, by the contending na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe. France, which you now hug as an ally and equal, will corrupt your citizens, and ſoment diviſions among them; by which your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will be ſo weakened that it will not dare to oppoſe her ambitions deſigns. She can never forget her being expelled from this country with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, nor will ſhe fail to improve the firſt opportunity to recover ſome part of it.</q>
—This is almoſt fulfilled in the preſent unfortunate ſtate of things, but the caſe is not without a remedy, if prompt deciſſion and firmneſs is adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the part of government and its influential friends. To theſe the great body of the well-affected citizens look for an example. They feel the wounds of their country, they reſent them, and if properly led would ſpeedily avenge them. They fear neither the foreign enemy, nor the daſtardly traitors among themſelves, but would rejoice in an opportunity of ſacrificing to both their much injured and inſulted country.—In what conſiſts the principal ſtrength of France. It is in the poiſon of her principles among the mob, and corruption of her money among rebels and parricides. Theſe have been the baſe diabolical arts, by which ſhe has done as much as by her arms; and miſerable has been the fate of all thoſe countries, where they have been not ſeaſonably and vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly oppoſed. If after ſo many examples to teach us, we continue to fold our arms, and wrap ourſelves up in an imagined ſecurity, our turn will come next: and we ſhall add one more to the gloomy catalogue of the tributatries of France.— Therefore let the friends of their country and its government aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate at this critical juncture, to ſupport the conſtituted authorities, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their enemies by ſpirited and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe, reader, are the three publications, for which, under the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> government of Pennſylvania. I have been harraſſed with a <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> proſecution; for which (beſides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence inſeperable from all law concerns) I have been ſubjected to the infamy of an arreſt, and have been dragged from my home, to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my affairs and the great alarm of my wife and family.</p>
            <p>I would not inſult the reſpectable gentlemen, who compoſed the majority of the Grand Jury,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:033523_0034_0FF77224F6DBEA30"/>
or the good ſenſe of the reader, by any attempt of mine to prove that nothing contained in theſe publications is of a libellous nature. If theſe are libels, there is no book ſacred or profane, which might not be conſtrued into a libel. Every hiſtory contains libel upon libel againſt kings, queens and miniſters. If theſe are libels, who is ſafe? In ſuch a ſtate of things a man may draw down <hi>the punishment of a murderer</hi> on himſelf while he is ſaying his prayers or ſinging of pſalms.</p>
            <p>Of the three publications, the two firſt only <hi>originated</hi> in my Gazette: the other was taken from the <hi>Gazette of the United States,</hi> publiſhed by Mr. Fenno. Of this latter circumſtance I ſhall ſpeak more fully, when I come to the Chief Judge's charge.</p>
            <p>The two publications, which made their firſt appearance through my means, I have not the honour to be the writer of. They were both written by gentlemen of this city; <hi>native</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, men who were determined <hi>whigs</hi> during the war for independence, republicans in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and firmly attached to the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of theſe two publications, though there is certainly nothing libellous, I am ready to confeſs there is a great deal of <hi>warmth;</hi> and if the admiſſion of an eſſay extraordinarily warm, abounding in ſtrong expreſſions of reſentment and indignation, were ever juſtifiable, they moſt aſſuredly were on ſuch an occaſion. The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033523_0035_0FF772278553D0B8"/>
of the OLD SOLDIER was ſent me at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the city of Philadelphia, juſt quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the <hi>appeal</hi> of the French Miniſter Adet,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Cenſor for November, 1796</note> rang with the daring, the degrading, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous inſult, which the Spaniard Yrujo had offered to the government of America and to every individual living under it.</p>
            <p>He had publiſhed a moſt audacious letter to Mr. Pickering, the Secretary of State, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſummary of all that is inſolent. This let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been handed and hawked about the city; and had, by his ſecretary, been ſent to every public print for inſertion. It was gone forth to the univerſe; and, that it tended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade and defame America, we need no other proof than the following paragraph from the London Gazette of the 14th of September.—
<q>The Americans are, according to our laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices from New-York, paying dear for their <hi>independence.</hi> The French take all their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, block up their very rivers, puniſh their ſeamen like malefactors, and actually make them pay for the ſhot they fire at them; while the Spaniſh Miniſter, with impunity, inſults and braves their poor enfeebled government. He has written to Timothy Pickering, Eſq. their firſt Secretary of State (ſee our Gazette of yeſterday) in a language that Buonaparte would not venture to aſſume to his Ciſalpinc convention, or citizen Noel to the fallen and degraded Dutch: and what very much aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the inſult, he has, without, permiſſion from the Preſident of the general Congreſs,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033523_0036_0FF77229074FBFF8"/>
communicated this letter to the people, as a ſort of manifeſto, or appeal, to them from their government. Nothing of this kind, we believe, ever before paſſed <hi>unresented,</hi> except in a conquered or invaded country; and we cannot help lamenting, that ſo very little ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould be found in any people, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in a people, who boaſt their origin from Britons.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This paragraph, or at leaſt the ſubſtance of it, I have ſeen in three London papers and in one Dublin paper; ſo that, it may be fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, its currency is by this time general, not only in the Britiſh dominions, but all over Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.—And, I pray, was no one to attempt to wipe away the ſtigma? Though the public pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers had been made ſubſervient to the ſpreading of this deep ſhame and diſgrace abroad, was no printer to admit any thing that ſerved to mark the ſtrong indignation it inſpired at home? Was the preſs to be free for the Spaniard alone? Was he to be allowed to taunt and threaten and deſpiſe; and were the poor Americans to ſew up their lips, or only mutter their impotent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ſecret? If this be ſo; if no man, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming a bold, an indignant, and retaliating tone, was to make an effort to reſcue his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and himſelf from diſhonour, without being harraſſed with a proſecution, without hazarding <hi>the punishment of a murderer,</hi> ours is a fallen ſtate indeed! If this be liberty and independence, or whatever elſe it may be called, God grant me the enjoyment of its oppoſite. If this be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, may I be a bondſman, yea a very ſlave, to the end of my days.</p>

            <p>I ſhall now come to Judge M'Kean's Charge to the Grand Jury; and ſhall, without going out of court, take upon me to decide on its merits.</p>
            <p>It was a charming thing this, for me to get hold of. I had long wiſhed to poſſeſs ſome ſuch proof, ſome ſuch convincing proof, of the <hi>superiority</hi> of the American liberty of the preſs over that enjoyed in the "<hi>Insular Bastile,</hi>" Great Britain; and it is to the deſire that I have of giving it a portable and durable ſituation, and to that alone, that this pamphlet is to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for which kind intention I humbly hope his <hi>Honour</hi> will feel inclined to pardon my paſt miſdoings. His pretty <hi>works</hi> will now be read with admiration, in countries where, I am ſure, had it not been for me, his name would never have once been articulated.</p>
            <p>When this Charge, garniſhed with my ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and good-natured comments, comes to be ſerved up in Britain, it will be a diſh for a king. The royaliſts will lick their lips, and the republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans will cry, God bleſs us! The emigration for <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty's sake</hi> will ceaſe, and we ſhall have nothing but the pure unadulterated dregs of Newgate and the Fleet; the candidates for Tyburn and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany Bay. Bleſſed cargo! All <hi>patriots</hi> to the back-bone: true philanthropiſts and univerſal citizens; fit for any place but England in this world, and for heaven in the next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:033523_0038_0FF77236317F3FD8"/>The famous charge, which is to produce theſe excellent effects, was delivered to the Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the Court of Oyer and Terminer, above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned in the Bill of Indictment. I ſhall not fill up my pages in copying the former part of it, which the reader will, I am perſuaded, readily excuſe when he has read the latter. Like two uncouth booriſh viſitants, the preſence of the one renders all apology unneceſſary for the abſence of the other.</p>
            <p>The Judge began, as, I believe, is uſual, with a definition of the ſeveral crimes, which general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall under the cognizance of ſuch a court: as, treaſon, ſodomy, rape, forgery, murder, &amp;c. &amp;c. But theſe his <hi>Honour</hi> touched ſlightly upon. He bruſhed them over as light and trifling of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; or rather he blew them aſide as the chaff of the criminal code, in order to come at the more ſolid and ſubſtantial ſin of LIBELLING.</p>
            <p>The weight, or rather the meaſure, that his Honour gave to this crime above all others, on this particular occaſion, I ſhall prove—not by ratiocination, but by arithmetic; by meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the aid of a Carpenter's two-foot rule; as thus:</p>
            <p>The Charge contains ſeparate definitions of 32 crimes, the whole of which, in the columns of the Gazette, occupy 5 F. 8 Inches, running meaſure; of which that of LIBELLING alone oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupies 3 F. 1 In. 6 P. On theſe dimenſions I ſtate the following</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:033523_0039_0FF77237B316FEA8"/>
               <label>PROBLEM.</label>
If 32 Crimes occupy 5 F. 8 In. and 1 crime occupies 3 F. 1 In. 6 P. of how much greater magnitude ought this 1 crime to be than any 1 of the remaining 31.</p>
            <p>
               <label>SOLUTION—18 <hi>Times.</hi>
               </label>
Thus, then, if we are to judge from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the Chief Juſtice of Pennſylvania's charge, <hi>Libelling</hi> is eighteen times worſe, more dangerous and more heinous, than robbery, forgery, treaſon, ſodomy, or murder!</p>
            <p>The fact is, the Charge ſeemed ſtudied to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a horror of no crime but that of libelling; the court ſeemed met for the puniſhment of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, and I ſeemed to be the ſole object of that puniſhment. Of this the reader will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by a peruſal of the Charge itſelf; and <hi>the cause</hi> he will find explained in the ſubſequent remarks.</p>
            <p>
               <label>CHARGE.</label> 
The Chief Judge (M'KEAN), after having, as was before obſerved, juſt touched on the nature and puniſhment of other crimes, proceeds, with reſpect to LIBELS, thus:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Before I conclude, <hi>I am ſorry</hi> to have occaſion to mention, that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crime, that peculiarly concerns the judges of the ſupreme come to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to correct, it is that of LIBELLING. I will deſcribe it at large.</p>
               <p>Libels or libelli famoſi, taken in the moſt extenſive ſenſe, ſignify any writings, pictures, or the like, of an <hi>immoral</hi> or illegal tendency; but in the ſenſe we are now to conſider them, are malicious defamations of any perſon, and eſpecially of a magiſtrate, made public either by writing, printing, ſigns or pictures, in order to provoke him to wrath, or to expoſe him to public hatred, contempt or ridicule.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:033523_0040_0FF7723ACB2EE270"/>The direct tendency of theſe libels is the breach of the public peace, by ſtirring up the objects of them, their families and friends to acts of revenge, and perhaps of bloodſhed; which it would be impoſſible to reſtrain by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt laws, were there no redreſs from public juſtice for injuries of this kind, which, of all others, are moſt ſenſibly felt; and which, being entered upon with coolneſs and deliberation receive a greater aggravation than any other ſcandal or defamation, continue longer, and are propagated wider and farther. <hi>And where libels are printed againſt perſons employed in a public capacity, they receive an aggravation, as they tend to ſcandalize the government,</hi> by reflecting on thoſe who are entruſted with the adminiſtration of public affairs, and thereby not only endanger the public peace, as all others do, by ſtirring up the parties immediately concerned to acts of revenge, but have alſo a direct tendency to breed in the people a diſlike of their governors, and incline them to faction and ſedition.</p>
               <p>Not only charges of a heinous nature, and which reflect a moral turpitude on the party, are libellous, but alſo ſuch as ſet him in <hi>a ſcurrilous ignominious light:</hi> For every perſon <hi>deſires to appear agreeable in life,</hi> and muſt be highly provoked by ſuch ridiculous repreſentations of him, as tend to leſſen him in the eſteem of the world, and take away his reputation, which to ſome men is more dear than life itſelf, for theſe equally create ill-blood, and provoke the parties to acts of revenge, and breaches of the peace.</p>
               <p>A defamatory writing expreſſing <hi>only one or two letters of a name,</hi> or uſing <hi>ſuch deſcriptions and circumſtances, feigned names</hi> or <hi>circumſtances,</hi> in ſuch a manner, that <hi>from what goes before,</hi> and <hi>follows after,</hi> it muſt needs be <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi> to ſignify ſuch a perſon in the plain, obvious and natural <hi>conſtruction</hi> of the whole, is as properly a libel, as if it had expreſſed the whole name at large: for it brings the utmoſt contempt upon the law, to ſuffer it's juſtice to be eluded by ſuch trifling evaſions; and it is a ridiculous abſurdity to ſay, that a writing, which is underſtood by every the meaneſt capacity, cannot poſſibly be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the courts and juries.</p>
               <p>It is equally ridiculous and abſurd to ſuppoſe that if a man ſpeaks ſlanderous or defamatory words of another, he may be ſuch, and ample damages recovered for the injury, but if the ſame words are put in writing or printed, no puniſhment can be inflicted. Such a doctrine may gratify the wiſhes of envious and <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious cowards and aſſaſſins,</hi> but muſt be deteſted by all ſenſible and good men.</p>
               <p>Theſe offences are puniſhable either by indictment, information or civil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But there are ſome inſtances where they can be puniſhed by a criminal proſecution only; as where the United States in congreſs aſſembled, the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, judges of the ſupreme court, or civil magiſtrates in general are charged with corruption, moral turpitude, baſe partiality, and the like, when no one in particular is named.</p>
               <p>By the law of the twelve tables at Rome, libels which affected the reputation of another, were made capital offences: But before the reign of Auguſtus, the puniſhment became corporeal only. Order the emperor <hi>Valentinian, it was again made capital,</hi> not only to wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but to publiſh, or even <hi>to omit deſtroying them.</hi> But by the laws of Pennſylvania, the authors, printers, and publiſhers of a libel are puniſhable <hi>by fine,</hi> and alſo a limited <hi>impriſonment at hard labour,</hi> and <hi>ſolitary confinement in goal,</hi> or <hi>impriſonment only,</hi> or <hi>one of them,</hi> as to the court in diſcretion ſhall ſeem proper, according to the heinouſneſs of the crime, and the quality and circumſtances of the offender.</p>
               <p>Any libeller, or perſon even ſpeaking words of contempt againſt an inferior magiſtrate, as a juſtice of the peace or mayor perſonally, though he be not then in the actual execution of his office, or of an inferior officer of juſtice, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and ſuch like, being in the actual execution of his office, may be bound to his good behaviour by a ſingle juſtice of the peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:033523_0041_0FF7723C503A30A8"/>By this law and theſe puniſhments, the liberty of the preſs (<hi>a phraſe much uſed but little underſtood</hi>) is by no means infringed or violated. The liberty of the preſs is indeed eſſential to the nature of a free ſtate; but this conſiſts in laying <hi>no previous reſtraints</hi> upon publications, and not in freedom from cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for criminal matter, when publiſhed Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what ſentiments he pleaſes before the public; to forbid this, is to deſtroy the freedom of the preſs; but if he publiſhes what is improper, miſchievous or illegal, he muſt take the conſequences of his temerity. To puniſh dangerous or offenſive writings which, when publiſhed, ſhall on a fair and impartial trial, be adjudged of a pernicious tendency, is neceſſary for the preſervation of peace and good order, of government and religion; the only ſolid foundation of civil liberty. Thus the will of individuals is ſtill left free, the abuſe only of that free-will is the object of legal puniſhment. Our preſſes in Pennſylvania are thus free. The common law, with reſpect to this, <hi>is confirmed and eſtabliſhed by the conſtitution itſelf.</hi> By the 7th ſect. of the declaration of the principles of a free government, &amp;c. it is aſcertained, "that the printing-preſſes ſhall be free to every perſon, who undertakes to examine the proceedings of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or any part of government." Men, therefore, have only to take care in their publications, that they are decent, candid and true; that they are for the purpoſe of reformation, and not of defamation; and that they have an eye ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the public good. Publications of this kind are not only lawful but lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But if they are made to gratify envy or malice, and contain perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, low ſcurrility, or ſlanderous charges; they can anſwer no good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for the community, but on the contrary, muſt deſtroy the very ends of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety —Were theſe to eſcape with impunity, youth would not be ſafe in it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, nor venerable old age in it's wiſdom, gravity, and virtue; dignity and ſtation would become a reproach; and the faireſt and beſt characters, that this or any other country ever produced, would be vilified and blaſted, if not ruined.</p>

               <p>We are ſorry to find that our endeavours in this way have not been attended with all the good effects that were expected from them; however we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to purſue the prevailing vice of the times with zeal and indignation, that crimes may no longer appear leſs odious for being faſhionable, nor the more ſecure from puniſhment for being popular.</p>
               <p>The criminal law of this ſtate is ſo <hi>pregnant with juſtice,</hi> ſo agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo full of equity and clemency, that even thoſe who ſuffer, by it cannot charge it with rigor. It is ſo adapted to the common good as to ſuffer no folly to go unpuniſhed, which that requires to be reſtrained; and yet ſo tender of the infirmities of human nature, and of the wives and children of even the greateſt offenders, as to refuſe no indulgence which the ſafety of the public will permit. It gives the rulers no power but of doing good, and deprives the people of no liberty out of doing evil. We are now (thank God) in the peaceable and full enjoyment of our laws, of the free adminiſtration of juſtice, and in complete poſſeſſion of religious, civil and political liberty. May the Divine Governor of the world continue theſe bleſſings to us, and impreſs it as a duty which we owe to ourſelves who enjoy them; to thoſe virtuous men, who, under God, have been chiefly inſtrumental in procuring them; and to our poſterity who will claim at our hands this nobleſt inheritance, to maintain and defend them at every hazard of life and fortune.</p>

Chief Juſtice of Pennſylvania, as appeared not only from his Charge, but alſo from what he hinted repecting the Jury, the day after the Bill was returned.<note n="*" place="bottom">The day after the Bill was returned IGNORAMUS, the Chief Juſtice, on the trial of Mr Humphreys for beating Bache, told the priſoner, that, if he had thought himſelf agrieved by the <hi>preſs,</hi> he ſhould have appealed to the law; and added; "you may ſay, indeed, that GAND JURIES will not do <hi>their duty:</hi> we have had a <hi>recent inſtance of that.</hi>"—On this reflection on the Grand Jury, it is not my duty to comment. But, had I been one of the gentlemen who compoſed it, I think I ſhould have made an attempt, at leaſt, to defo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d my conduct and character.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So pointed, ſo perſonal a charge, I am bold to ſay, was never before delivered from the Bench in any country, that has the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to civil liberty. If it be foreſeen, that a particular caſe, rather novel, is to come before a Grand Jury, it is the cuſtom for Judges, as it certainly is their duty, to explain its nature, its tendency, and the law reſpecting it fully and minutely; but never, till the 27th day of laſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, did a Judge, preſiding to adminiſter juſtice according to the mild and impartial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Common Law of England, ſo far forget the genuine ſpirit of that law as to point directly at a ſingle offender, and to employ all the perſuaſion in his power to bring down chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement on his head.</p>
            <p>The Charge contains every thing calculated to awaken the apprehenſions of the Grand Jury as to the effects of my conduct, and to prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs their minds againſt my perſon. In every thing but elegance and animation, it was more like the zealous and impaſſioned pleadings of an advocate, than the calm, dignified, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033523_0044_0FF7724426801058"/>
accents that ever ſhould breathe in the language from the Bench.</p>
            <p>And, what was there, I pray, either in my character, in the particular caſe before the Grand Jury, or in the general tenor of my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, to warrant this odious departure from the excellent rules, which had their origin in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and candour, and which have been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſacred by the practice of our fore-fathers? A ſtranger, had there been one in court, would naturally have concluded me to be a notorious defamer of innocence, a ſeditious and turbulent troubler of the government, a ſworn enemy of morality and religion; in three words, a profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, a rebel, and a blaſphemer.</p>
            <p>It hardly ever becomes a man to ſay much of his private character and concerns; but, on this occaſion, I truſt I ſhall be indulged for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I will ſay, and I will make that ſaying good againſt whoever ſhall oppoſe it, that I have never attacked any one, whoſe private charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not, in every light which it can poſſibly be viewed, as far beneath mine as infamy is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath honour.—Nay; I defy the city of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, populous as it is, and reſpectable as are its inhabitants in general, to produce me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man, who is more ſober, induſtrious or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; who is a kinder huſband, a tenderer father, a better maſter, a ſounder friend, or (though laſt not leaſt) a more zealous and faithful ſubject.</p>
            <p>Moſt certainly it is unſeemly in any one to ſay thus much of himſelf, unleſs compelledt it by ſome public outrage on his character; but,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033523_0045_0FF7715F635D0250"/>
when the accuſation is thus made notorious, ſo ought the defence. And I do again and again repeat, that I fear not a compariſon between my character and that of any man in the city: no, not even with that of the very Judge, who held me up as the worſt of miſcreants. His Honour is welcome, if he pleaſe, to carry this compariſon into <hi>all</hi> the actions of our lives, public and <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestic,</hi> and to extend it beyond ourſelves to <hi>every branch of our families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to my writings; I never did ſlander any one, if the promulgation of uſeful truths be not ſlander. Innocence and virtue I have often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to defend, but I never defamed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I have, indeed, ſtripped the cloſe-drawn veil off hypocricy; I have ridiculed the follies and laſhed the vices of thouſands, and have done it ſometimes, perhaps, with a rude and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hand. But, theſe are not the days for gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and mercy. Such as is the temper of the foe, ſuch muſt be that of his opponent. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf publiſhed for a rogue <hi>and my wife for a whore;</hi> being preſecuted with ſuch infamous, ſuch baſe and helliſh calumny in the <hi>philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic</hi> city of Philadelphia, merely for aſſerting <hi>the truth</hi> reſpecting others, was not calculated, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, to ſweeten my temper and turn my ink into honey-dew.</p>
            <p>My attachment to order and good government nothing but the impudence of Jacobiniſm could deny. The object, not only of all my own pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, but alſo of all thoſe which I have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced or encouraged, from the firſt moment that I appeared on the public ſeene to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033523_0046_0FF7724E819551B8"/>
day, has been, to lend ſome aid in ſtemming the torrent of anarchy and confuſion. To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the miſguided, by tearing the maſk from the artful and ferocious villains, who, owing to the infatuation of the poor and the ſupineneſs of the rich, have made ſuch a fearful progreſs in the deſtruction of all that is amiable and good and ſacred among men. To the government of this country, in particular, it has been my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtudy to yield all the ſupport in my power. When either that government, or the worthy men who adminiſter it, have been traduced and vilified, I have ſtood forward in their defence; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d that too, in times when even its friends were ſome of them locked up in ſilence, and others giving way to the audacious violence of its foes.—Not that I am ſo fooliſhly vain as to attribute to my illiterate pen a thouſandth part of the merit that my friends are inclined to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. As I wrote the other day to a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had paid me ſome compliments on this ſcore,
<q>I ſhould never look at my family with a dry eye, if I did not hope to outlive my works.</q>
They are mere tranſitory beings, to which the revolutionary ſtorm has given life, and which with that ſtorm will expire.—But, what I contend for, and what nobody can deny, I have done all that laid in my power: all I was able by any means to accompliſh, in order to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract the nefarious efforts of the enemies of the American government and nation.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to religion, though Mr. M'Kean was pleaſed to number it among the things that were in danger from the licentiouſneſs of the preſs, and, of courſe, from poor ME, I think it
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033523_0047_0FF77250044AA5E8"/>
would puzzel the devil himſelf to produce, from my writings, a ſingle paſſage, which could, by all the powers of perverſion, be twiſted into an attack on it. But, it would, on the contrary, be extremely eaſy to prove, that I have, at all times when an opportunity offered, repelled the attacks of its enemies, the abominable battalions of Deiſts and Atheiſts, with all my heart, with all my mind, with all my ſoul, and with all my ſtrength. The bittereſt drop in my pen has ever been beſtowed on them; becauſe, of all the foes of the human race, I look upon them, after the Devil, as being the greateſt and moſt dreadful. Not a ſacrilegious plunderer, from Henry VIII to Condorcet, and from Condorcet to the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sans-Culottes of Virginia, has eſcaped my cenſure. All thoſe who have attempted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade religion, whether by open inſults and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties to the Clergy, by blaſphemous publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or by the more dangerous poiſon of the malignant modern phiſophy, I have ranked amongſt the moſt infamous of mankind, and have treated them accordingly.</p>
            <p>After this ſummary defence of my character and writings, the neceſſity of which I ſincerely regret, juſtice demands that I ſhould enter into an expoſition of the unparalleled partiality that has been exerciſed towards me: and when I have done that, I pledge myſelf to prove, in contradiction to all the boaſtings which we have heard, that the preſs is free-er in Great Britain than in America.</p>
            <p>To read the Chief Judge's famous Charge, one would inevitably be led to imagine, that no
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033523_0048_0FF77251B6A17940"/>
perſon in this country, except PETER PORCU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PINE, ever attempted to exerciſe the Liberty of the preſs, or even that pitiful portion of it which his Honour had the mercy to leave in our hands. All the other printers, one would think, had been poor paſſive devils, and that their ſheets had contained nought but vapid ſongs of liberty, lying eulogies on departed raſcallity, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome flattery of villains in power. But, to do juſtice to my brother printers, to myſelf, and to Judge M'Kean, I am compelled to prove that this was not the caſe.</p>
            <p>There are certain news-printers in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who may be counted as a ſort of blanks: creatures that have nothing of humanity about them but the mere exterior form and motion, and that are, in every other reſpect, as perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly logs as if they had been cut out of a piece of timber. I will not degrade myſelf by a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between my conduct and that of theſe dull, ſenſeleſs, inanimate beings. Let me have the ſame privileges as other living active creatures, and I am content.</p>
            <p>The reader has ſeen all that could be conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up againſt me in the Bill of Indictment, which he may ſafely ſet down among the moſt virulent of my publications; for lawyers and judges know very well how to ſingle the tares from the wheat. But, I am willing to allow him a ſcrutiny into every ſentence I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or publiſhed, to which the Chief Judge's Charge can poſſibly be made to apply, and then I will leave him to compare my "nefarious publications" with the

true</q>
ones, which I am now about to produce from the preſſes that have, and ſtill do, eſpouſe the cauſe of the enemies of this country.</p>
            <p>As libels againſt <hi>religion</hi> are certainly more heinous in their nature, as well as more deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in their conſequences, than any that can be publiſhed againſt men, however eſtimable their characters or exalted their rank, I ſhall firſt take notice of a publication or two of this ſort, which have eſcaped the notice of the <hi>vigilent</hi> Chief Juſtice of Pennſylvania: and this, I think, ſeems the more neceſſary, as the Judge included <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> among the objects endangered by the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of the preſs.</p>
            <p>In the Summer of 1796, a work was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one STEPHENS (an Iriſh Patriot, who has ſince ſpunged his creditors), entitled: "<hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity contrasted with Deism</hi>:" And, by a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-piece of baſeneſs, before unheard of among the moſt infamous of ſcribblers, my aſſumed name, PETER PORCUPINE, was inſerted in the title page, in order to give currency to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious production.</p>
            <p>This pamphlet abounded with the moſt daring impiety; and, though I will not take upon me to ſay that the Chief Juſtice ever <hi>saw</hi> it, he muſt have heard of its exiſtence; for it was not only advertiſed for ſale but there were alſo a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of paragraphs reſpecting it, both in BACHE's and MR. FENNO's paper.</p>
            <p>As to the AGE OF REASON, its publication, by BACHE and others, is too notorious a fact to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033523_0050_0FF77160E78854B0"/>
be for a moment dwelt upon. This blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous work has been ſpread all over the ſtate, and through this city in particular.</p>
            <p>BACHE has, for years paſt, and does now, publiſh and ſell, what is called the
<q>Republican Calendar;</q>
in which the <hi>Christian Aera</hi> is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by that of the degrading Atheiſtical Decadery of France.</p>
            <p>All theſe publications, and many more that might be mentioned, have been, and yet are, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Pennſylvania. Their evident and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable tendency, is, to corrupt the young, miſlead the ignorant, abaſh the timid, degrade the prieſt-hood, and, finally, to ſubvert and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, root and branch, the Chriſtian Religion and all its ineſtimable bleſſings.</p>
            <p>I have the ſame opinion of the Judge's law knowledge that moſt people have; but he muſt certainly know, that <hi>Christianity</hi> is part of <hi>the law of the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd</hi>; that to deride and blaſpheme it is puniſhable by the common law; and that it is the duty of all magiſtrates, more particularly Judges, to make the law, in this reſpect known, and to ſee it executed.</p>
            <p>Yet, in the ſtate of Pennſylvania, under ſo watchful a Chief Juſtice, this ſalutary law, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to preſerve from indignity the religion of our forefathers; to enforce a reſpect for the laws of God, and to promote our eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has been ſuffered to ſleep in oblivion; while the ſanguinary <hi>Twelve Tables of Rome</hi> have been reſorted to, in order to enhance the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033523_0051_0FF771626A2CD060"/>
magnitude of <hi>the crime of satirizing the Spanish king and his minister</hi>!—Gracious God! can the deſcendants of Britons ever approve of this violence on <hi>the common law of England</hi>?</p>
            <p>The Judge tells us that, with reſpect to libels, the <hi>common law</hi> is <hi>confirmed</hi> by the <hi>constitution of Pennsylvania;</hi> and every one knows, that the common law of America is neither more nor leſs than the common law of England.—Now, it is well known, that the publiſher of Paine's Age of Reaſon has been proſecuted in England; that LORD KENYON termed it a
<q>nefarious publication, intended for the moſt malignant purpoſes;</q>
and that the jury inſtantly found the defendant GUILTY.—But England is, in this reſpect, no more fit to be compared with America than LORD KENYON is to be compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Judge</hi> M'KEAN.</p>
            <p>I have been told, indeed, that the article of the conſtitution, which provides for an entire freedom as to religious worſhip and opinions, forbids any reſtraint on the preſs where ſubjects of this ſort are agitated. If this be true, and if M'KEAN's doctrine of libels be alſo true, all that the American preſs has gained by the "Glorious Revolution," is, the horrid liberty of blaſpheming the Almighty!</p>
            <p>Quitting libels againſt <hi>religion,</hi> let us come to thoſe of a leſs horrid, though not leſs odious nature.</p>

            <p>I have before obſerved, and I repeat it again and again, that <hi>innocence</hi> or <hi>virtue</hi> was never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by me; and hence it is impoſſible that I can ever have brought a <hi>stain</hi> on a family. Whether others have done this in Philadelphia, I leave the reader to judge from the following paſſages of a pamphlet, publiſhed here about two years and a half ago.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of the author's cenſure, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in Congreſs. After calling one member an <hi>Ass</hi> and another a <hi>Snap-Turtle,</hi> he comes to a Gentleman of New-Jerſey, who now fills an office of great truſt under the Federal Government, of whom and of whoſe family he ſpeaks thus:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From members of Congreſs and their wives, the author comes to the Clergy and theirs. Few

people have forgotten, that, in 1795, a Sermon on National Gratitude was preached in this city, by a leraned Divine, then at the head of Princeton College. In the courſe of this much admired ſermon, the preacher took occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cenſure the <hi>Age of Reason</hi>; and this it was that brought on him, from our <hi>decent</hi> writer, the following attack:
<q>Notwithſtanding his conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he does not forget to bullyrag Tom Paine. Forty two miles did he trudge through thick and thin, Jonah like, to ſave this our Nineveh by reading a ſermon, and may hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven reward his labours!

            </p>
            <p>Is this "<hi>decent, candid,</hi> and <hi>true</hi>"? And, if it be not, how came it to

How came it not to attract the attention of the Supreme Court of Pennſylvania, whoſe

<q>againſt perſons in a <hi>public capacity,</hi> they receive an <hi>aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as they tend to ſcandalzie the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This doctrine, by-the-bye, I believe few men, except thoſe in a public capacity will reliſh. It is exactly contrary to the ſpirit, as well as the letter, of the little pamphlet, entitled, "The Conſtitution of Pennſylvania."—In that ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable performance, there is one Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a liſt of what are there called "the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential principles of liberty," which are poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to be excepted out of the general powers of government, and fixed on for ever to remain inviolate.—Among the precious things thus carefully preſerved, is, <hi>the liberty of the press</hi>; and it is ſaid, that no law ſhall be made to reſtrain any perſon,
<q>who undertakes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the proceedings of the legiſlature <hi>or any branch of government.</hi>
               </q>
And again it ſays, that,
<q>in proſecutions for the publication
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:033523_0055_0FF771804D34F758"/>
of any papers, inveſtigating the official con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of officers, or <hi>men in a public capacity,</hi> the truth thereof may be given in evidence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, you ſee, this pamphlet of Pennſylvania holds out to the world, that men in a public ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity are more open to the cenſure of the preſs than the ſovereign citizens are, which is, indeed, no more than reaſonable; but this Judge, this <hi>learned</hi> expoſitor of the law and conſtitution, tells us, that cenſorious writings receive an <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation,</hi> when written againſt perſons in a <hi>public capacity</hi>!</p>
            <p>However, be it ſo. Let us prefer the Judge's aſſertion to the declaration of the ſovereign people of Pennſylvania. Let us, for a moment, look upon their conſtitution as merely intended to amuſe them and the world; and then let us ſee what this State Government, and this ſame Judge, have permitted to paſs unreproved and unnoticed, in writers inimical to the Federal Government, and notoriouſly in the pay of France.</p>
            <p>I could here produce volumes of the moſt attrocious calumny againſt the Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and its officers individually; but, beſides my want of room, I am prevented by the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the fact. Every one in America knows what I have here generally ſtated, to be true; and it is therefore neceſſary to introduce only a few inſtances for the information of foreigners.</p>
            <p>BACHE, in his paper, No. 1037, after load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Executive of the United States with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033523_0056_0FF77183DDDFEB30"/>
falſe and infamous charges, ſays:
<q>And are we ſo corrupted and debaſed as to give up this precious jewel (Independence) to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of <hi>rascals</hi> and <hi>traitors,</hi> who are about to <hi>sell themselves and their country</hi>?</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is pretty well for the Executive. Now let us hear what CALLENDER (in his
<q>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the United States for 1796</q>)
ſays of the Congreſs in a lump—"If a man," ſays he,
<q>was to be kept a twelve month in irons, and then to be hanged for ſtealing <hi>one</hi> horſe, what ought to be done with the Congreſs and their agents, who <hi>forcibly pilfered</hi> ſo many that are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid for?</q>
—I muſt leave JUDGE M'KEAN to anſwer this queſtion; for he was, I believe, one of the Congreſs that Callender alludes to. However, leſt any offender ſhould ſlip him, the <hi>Historian</hi> takes care to include in his cenſure, the ſecond, the third, and the fourth Congreſs.</p>
            <p>From the Government in general we will now come to particular members of it.—The Judge tells us, if publications,
<q>containing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal invectives, low ſcurrillity, and ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous charges, were to eſcape with impunity, the <hi>fairest</hi> and <hi>best characters,</hi> that this or any other country ever produced, would be vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and blaſted, if not ruined.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, let us hear BACHE again; the mouth-piece of the French faction, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the companion of the Chief Juſtice at Civic Feſtivals.—This atrocious wretch, in his paper of the 9th of July, 1795, has the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paragraph:—"The day" [the 4th of July]
<q>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:033523_0057_0FF77185CF6519E0"/>was cloſed by the exhibition of a tranſparent painting, with the figure of <hi>John Jay</hi> upon it. The figure was in full ſtature, holding in his right hand a pair of ſcales, containing in one ſcale, <hi>American liberty and Independence,</hi> kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beam; in the other, <hi>British Gold,</hi> in extreme preponderance. In his left hand a Treaty, which he extended to a group of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, who were grinning with pleaſure and graſping at the Treaty. From the mouth of the figure iſſued theſe words: <hi>come up to my price, and I will sell you my country.</hi> The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure was burned at Kenſington amidſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of hundreds of citizens. Thus terminated the anniverſary of American In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This recalls to our minds two valuable facts: 1ſt, that this infamous libel did
<q>eſcape with impunity!</q>
and 2d, that the exhibition and actions which it records, did alſo
<q>eſcape with impunity;</q>
and that too in this city, under the eye of this very Judge M'Kean And, what is more, a gentleman, who, like a good citizen, turned out of his bed to endeavour to put a ſtop to the ſcandalous and diſgraceful proceſſion, was aſſaulted in a moſt cowardly and cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and never obtained the leaſt ſatisfaction. Not one of the rabble, nor of the ring-leaders, nor of the printers, who ſtimulated them to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and who recorded their atrocities as honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deeds, was ever puniſhed, or "<hi>bound over,</hi>" or even reprimanded!—But this was a riot and a libel againſt a <hi>worthy man,</hi> an officer of the <hi>Federal Government,</hi> and <hi>no tool of France</hi>; and
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033523_0058_0FF77188D3A0A498"/>
theſe circumſtances muſt account for what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be accounted for.</p>
            <p>BACHE, in his paper, No. 1460, calls the Honourable John Jay, then Chief Juſtice of the United States of America, and now Governor of the State of New-York: he calls this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "that <hi>damned arch traitor</hi> JOHN JAY."— And yet he was never "<hi>bound over</hi>;" and yet he never was <hi>personally attacked from the Bench;</hi> but, on the contrary, has often, ſince that time as well as before, ſat at the ſame board with the Chief Juſtice!</p>
            <p>I could here name at leaſt one hundred of the greateſt and beſt men, that this country ever produced, who have been vilified by this repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate deſcendant of Old Franklin; but, for the reaſons before mentioned, I ſhall forbear the enumeration, and content myſelf with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or two of his attacks on the character of GENERAL WASHINGTON, for which every good man, in every part of the world, muſt and will execrate the libeller and his ſupporters.</p>
            <p>He publiſhed PAINE's letter to the GENERAL; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f which he claimed an excluſive copy-right, and which he boaſted of having received from Paris for the purpoſe of publication. In this work, GENERAL WASHINGTON and the CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, are both the objects of obloquy and reproach. The worthy old veteran and ſtateſman, whoſe endeavours have ſo eminently contributed to the greatneſs and proſperity of his country, is called,
<q>the <hi>patron</hi> of <hi>fraud,</hi>
               </q>
—
<q>an <hi>imposter,</hi> or an <hi>apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</hi>
               </q>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:033523_0059_0FF7718EB492B998"/>
—Yet the vile printer was never
<q>bound over.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was the city of Philadelphia diſgraced. Thus did the Chief Juſtice of Pennſylvania qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly look on, and obſerve the propagation of a libel, that has excited univerſal indignation in the breaſts of unconcerned foreigners, and for which both the writer and the printer are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by their very partizans.</p>
            <p>But, this was not the laſt ſtab that the literary aſſaſſin had in reſerve for the character of this great and good man, and for the honour of America.</p>
            <p>The day that the GENERAL cloſed his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic labours (the 4th of March, 1797,) BACHE, after announcing his retirement from the Office of Preſident, ſays:
<q>If there ever was a period for rejoicing this is the moment—every heart, in unifon with the freedom and happineſs of the people, ought to beat high with exultation, that the name of WASHINGTON from <hi>this day ceases to give currency to political iniquity,</hi> and to <hi>legalize corruption.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, we are not at the worſt: for, on the 13th of March, 1797, this viperous Grand Son of Old Franklin, accuſed the ſame eminent perſon of <hi>murder</hi>! brought forward a long, formal, and circumſtantial charge of cool, deliberate <hi>aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
               <q>committed by <hi>GEORGE WASHINGTON,</hi> late President of the United States.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:033523_0060_0FF7719037594BD8"/>The Chief Juſtice has <hi>not forgotten,</hi> I dare ſay, that I was the only printer in the United States (with ſhame be it ſpoken) who had the zeal and the induſtry to ſearch for the documents relative to the affair alluded to (which took place in 1753); to expoſe the falacy of the charge, and to hold the vile inſtrument of France up to univerſal abhorrence.</p>
            <p>One would have thought, whatever might be the ſecret diſpoſitions of the Chief Juſtice of Pennſylvania, that outward appearances, common decency, would have led them to take ſome little notice of theſe outrages or a public and private character, reſpected, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, and revered by the wiſe and the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all nations. More eſpecially one would have expected this from a Judge, who now ſeems to be ſo anxious to preſerve the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of "<hi>youth</hi> in its <hi>innocence,</hi>" and of "<hi>old age</hi> in its <hi>gravity</hi> and <hi>wisdom;</hi>" who now, in order to excite a horror againſt libelling, goes back to that cruel code, the <hi>Twelve Tables of Rome,</hi> and the no leſs ſanguinary laws of <hi>Valentinian</hi>; who, in his zeal to make an example, does not think it derogatory to his honourable ſtation to point at a particular man, and call on the Jury, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, for their "<hi>aid</hi>" in his puniſhment; and finally, who expreſſes his determination to purſue the vice of libelling with "zeal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation." From ſuch a Judge, who would not have expected an interference; who does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, who does not know, and does not ſay, that he ſhould have been "<hi>impressed with the duties of his station,</hi>" when the reputation of the Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government was daily and hourly attacked in
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033523_0061_0FF77191C7E604B8"/>
his preſence; when the fame and character of GENERAL WASHINGTON were bleeding at every pore, and when the French printer BACHE and his coadjutors were purſuing the Aged Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran to his domeſtic retreat with all the helliſh malignity of Pariſian cannibals?—Yes, this was the time for him to be "<hi>impressed with the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his station.</hi>" This was the time for him to exert his authority of <hi>binding over;</hi> to unfold and enforce <hi>the severity of the law,</hi> and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his character for <hi>impartiality</hi>:—but, this time is paſt.</p>
            <p>Thus have we ſeen the Chief Juſtice of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania wink at the moſt daring and wicked libels, againſt God and againſt man, that a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can conceive or a printer can print. But, we are not yet come to what may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>a case in point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was proſecuted for publications levelled againſt a foreign prince, government, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; to form therefore a juſt eſtimation of the conduct and motives of thoſe who urged the proſecution, we muſt take a ſketch (and a very ſlight one will ſerve) of what other printers have publiſhed, <hi>with impunity,</hi> againſt other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nations, and princes.</p>
            <p>But, before I enter on this ſubject, I think myſelf called on to make a few remarks on that part of the Judge's Charge, which dwells, with ſuch emphaſis and ſeeming dread, on the danger of offending foreign nations and potentates, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>tender-hearted</hi> rulers of France and the king of the country of the <hi>Inquisition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:033523_0062_0FF77194A59A6B48"/>After telling the Grand Jury, that I had
<q>ranſacked our language for terms of reproach and inſult againſt every <hi>disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>guiſhed</hi> character in <hi>France and Spain,</hi>
               </q>
he tells them, that, "without their aid," my conduct cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and concludes by obſerving, that
<q>the government that will not diſcountenance, may be thought to adopt it, and be deemed <hi>justly chargeable with all the conſequences.</hi>
               </q>
—Then follow an inſtance of the great danger of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreign nations in this way: the Judge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to hiſtory above a hundred years back, and very gravely tells the Grand Jury, that
<q>Some medals and dull jeſts are mentioned and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a ground of quarrel between the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and Dutch in 1672, and likewiſe cauſed Lewis the 14th to make an expedition into the United Provinces of the Netherlands in the ſame year, and nearly ruined that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was an example <hi>in terrorem,</hi> and was evidently cited for the purpoſe of impreſſing on the minds of the Jury, the peril that their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try might be placed in from ſuffering me to "eſcape with impunity." But, granting for a moment, that laying a reſtraint on the preſs, <hi>for fear the effects of its freedom should offend foreign powers</hi>; allowing that ſuch an act is not to the laſt degree ſhameful and debaſing, and only ſuited to a country in the moſt abject ſtate of vaſſalage; allowing this, let us ſee if the Judge's quotation was quite correct and candid.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſay, and every one of the moſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial reading knows, that the <hi>medals</hi> and <hi>dull
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033523_0063_0FF7719958B04060"/>
jests</hi> alluded to, never were, nor are they any where (except in this learned Charge)
<q>
                  <hi>mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>represented</hi> as a ground of quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween the Engliſh and Dutch in 1672,</q>
nor at any other period. HUME, who, it will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denied, is at leaſt as good an authority as Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania's Chief Judge, does indeed ſay, that
<q>certain medals and pictures were made the <hi>miserable pretext</hi> of a moſt ſcandalous breach of faith,</q>
on the part of the profligate Charles II; but he tells us that the <hi>real grounds</hi> of the war, were, the inordinate ambition of Lewis XIV, and the thirſt for riches and arbitrary power of the corrupted miniſtry of England, well known by the name of the CABAL.</p>
            <p>Beſides had medals and dull jeſts really been, as they were not, the grounds of the war, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour ſhould have led the Judge to continue his reference to hiſtory a little further, and to tell the Grand Jury <hi>how that war terminated,</hi> and how the <hi>nearly ruined Commonwealth behaved</hi> with reſpect to the medals and dull jeſts.</p>
            <p>Lewis XIV did, indeed, make a devaſtating and cruel expedition into the Netherlands, and reduced the Dutch to the laſt extremity by land, while the combined fleets of England and France nearly blocked up their ports and ruined their commerce. In this awful ſtate of their affairs, the two unprincipled Monarchs made known to them their pretenſions, which, among many other humiliating terms, ſpecified, that
<q>all perſons guilty of writing <hi>seditious libels</hi> againſt them, ſhould, on complaint, be baniſhed for ever from the States.</q>
—The Commonwealth, though,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033523_0064_0FF771F8E5C547F0"/>
as the Judge ſays, <hi>nearly ruined,</hi> ſcorned the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent pretenſions; and, following the example of the PRINCE OF ORANGE (afterwards our WILLIAM III, of glorious memory) nobly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<q>to reſiſt the haughty victors, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thoſe laſt remains of their native ſoil, of which neither the irruptions of Lewis, nor the inundation of waters, had as yet bereaved them. Should even the ground fail them on which they might combat, they were ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to yield the generous ſtrife; but, flying to their ſettlements in the Indies, erect a new empire in thoſe remote regions, and preſerve alive, even in the climates of ſlavery, that liberty of which Europe was become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is what Mr. M'Kean ſhould have told the Grand Jury; and, he ſhould have told them beſides, that this brave reſolution of the Dutch met with a glorious reward; that a few months ſaw their gallant fleet a match for thoſe of the two monarchs united, and that the haughty king of France, driven by the PRINCE OF ORANGE from fortreſs to fortreſs and from Province to Province, at laſt entered his vain and frivolous capital covered with defeat and diſgrace, before the triumphal arch of St. Dennis, erected for the celebration of his conqueſts, was completely out of the hands of the architect!</p>
            <p>This is the paſſage of hiſtory, which, above all others, the republican car dwells on with pleaſure; this is what the Chief Judge ſhould have related to the jury; but, this would not have anſwered his purpoſe. Such an example
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033523_0065_0FF771FA68E9D0E0"/>
of republican fortitude and heroiſm would have ſounded well from the lips of his Honour; but, the Grand Jury of Philadelphia ſhowed by their righteous deciſion, that they ſtood not in need of examples from hiſtory to ſtimulate them to act agreeably to the dictates of their conſcience, and to reject with diſdain every idea of fear, that their acquitting an innocent man might bring down on themſelves and their country the chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of foreign nations.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude my remarks on this part of the Charge, I cannot refrain from noticing the very odious impreſſion it is calculated to give the world with reſpect to the government, and the character of the American nation.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that, at the time when the paragraphs againſt Spain and France were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and when the charge was delivered, the former nation was in the open violation of their treaty with this country, which had juſt then been groſsly inſulted by their miniſter; and that the latter were plundering its commerce in every part of the world, blocking up its rivers, laſhing its ſea-faring citizens like convicts, and driving its humble negociators from their capital with ſcorn and reproach. Theſe circumſtances ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into conſideration, what muſt foreigners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Charge? Will they not ſay, and very juſtly too:
<q>ſuch is your <hi>liberty of the press,</hi> ſuch your <hi>boaſted independence,</hi> that, let a nation trample on your rights, deride, inſult, rob, and torture you, and your government ever ſtands ready to inflict <hi>the punishment of a murderer</hi> on the firſt man, who, in reſenting
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:033523_0066_0FF77258880F6290"/>
your injuries, ſhall ſtep one inch beſide the line of the labyrinthian law of <hi>conſtructive libels</hi>; and this cruelty it condeſcends to, leſt its lenity to its friends and ſupporters ſhould give umbrage to an inſolent and perfidious foe!</q>
—Yes; this will they ſay; and if there be an American, who can patiently bear the diſgraceful imputation; I admire his Chriſtian humility; but I envy him not his <hi>liberty,</hi> his <hi>independence,</hi> or his <hi>republicanism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, allowing that America is ſo beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in means and ſo humbled in ſpirit; allowing theſe <hi>independent</hi> ſtates to be already reduced to a pitch of general vaſſalage, that renders ſuch a ſacrifice to the pride and inſolence of foreign nations prudent and neceſſary; allowing that the Judge made all this appear to be true, let us return, and ſee what the printers <hi>of the French faction</hi> have publiſhed againſt other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nations, and princes, without his feeling himſelf
<q>impreſſed with the duties of his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</q>
to <hi>bind them over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, reader, prepare yourſelf for a catalogue of the moſt indecent, blackeſt, and moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly libellous expreſſions, that ever dropped from the lips or pen of mortal man. The French language is very weak and ſteril com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ours, particularly in terms of reproach and abuſe. Their raſcals ſpend their breath for half an hour in noiſy volubility, to produce a faint idea of what ours can expreſs in one ſhort grind of the teeth. But, all this bitterneſs, all the force and fury, of this our dear mother tongue, the crafty Gaul has, we are now about to
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:033523_0067_0FF77435B95FB6B0"/>
ſee, had the addreſs to bring over into his own ſervice.</p>
            <p>To begin with CALIENDER: this little rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, who, from outward appearances ſeems to have been born for a Chimney ſweep, and to be now following the ſooty trade, made his eſcape from the hands of Juſtice in Scotland, in the year 1793, after being apprehended as the author of a libellous pamphlet, entitled
<q>The Political Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of Britain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This work, which is of conſiderable bulk, is nothing but a ſtring of falſhoods, interſperſed with the moſt audacious libels on the Britiſh miniſtry, and every branch of the Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which latter the author calls, the
<q>ruffian race of British Kings.</q>
—In one place he calls the Right Honourable William Pitt, a <hi>hardened Swindler,</hi> and in an other, he calls His Royal Highneſs the Prince of Wales <hi>a murderer.</hi> He, in one ſhort ſentence, conſigns to infamy both the Royal Family and the people at large. "Since the Norman Conqueſt," ſays he,
<q>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land has been governed by thirty-three ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns; and, of theſe, two thirds were, each of them by an hundred different actions, <hi>deserving of the gibbet;</hi> and <hi>the people</hi> ſeem to have been as perfectly diveſted of every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable feeling, <hi>as Majesty itself.</hi>
               </q>

by the government or the Chief Juſtice. Nay CALLENDER ſays, in his preface, that <hi>certain gentlemen,</hi> and particularly <hi>Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferson,</hi> the Vice Preſident of the United States, had <hi>encouraged him</hi> to give an American edition of this infamous performance!</p>
            <p>I have a dozen ſources to which I could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for libels againſt foreign princes and ſtates. BROWN has been guilty of crimes of this kind without number, and ſo have DUNLAP and his ſucceſſors.

            <p>There is not a prince or power of Europe, who has diſcovered the leaſt inclination to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the French, or diſcredit their infamous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whom this caitiff printer and his ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have not libelled in the moſt outrageous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.—The Emperor of Germany and his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals have been called <hi>thieves</hi> and <hi>scoundrels</hi> a thouſand times; the King of Pruſſia, <hi>before his defection,</hi> was called a <hi>Sharper;</hi> the Empreſs of Ruſſia, in No. 1361, is called a <hi>She-Bear.</hi> But, the Britiſh nation, government, and king, have been the conſtant objects of their moſt wicked calumnies. Mr. SMITH of Baltimore, in open Congreſs, called the King of Great Britain,
<q>a monſter; <hi>a</hi> king of sea-robbers.</q>
His <hi>decent</hi> ſpeech was publiſhed in all the papers of that

day. BACHE, in his paper, No. 1036, ſays of Britain, that
<q>dishonour <hi>mark her</hi> councils and her actions.</q>
In 1041, he calls the Britiſh a "<hi>perfidious nation.</hi>" In 1081, he calls Britain, "that proud tyrannical and <hi>infamous</hi> kingdom." In 1083, he calls the people of Great Britain, "the <hi>bloody savage islanders.</hi>" The government, in various papers, he calls,
<q>
                  <hi>that</hi> corrupt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</q>
—"that <hi>corrupt government,</hi>"—

               </q>
—In the letters of Franklin, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his paper, he calls Admiral Murry

               </q>
—In 1033, he calls His Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic Majeſty, "a <hi>prince of robbers.</hi>" In 1048, he calls him,
<q>that prince of <hi>land and sea rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> GEORGE III.</q>
In 1031, he ſays, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Great Britain,
<q>I pledge you my word, that I ſhould heartily rejoice, if <hi>the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> were <hi>all decently guillotined.</hi>
               </q>
And, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to tire my readers with the abominations of this atrocious miſcreant, he puts a <hi>mock speech</hi> into the mouth of the king of Great Britain, and makes him conclude, as <hi>under the gallows at Tyburn</hi>!</p>

            <p>Was there ever ſuch abominable outrage as this offered to mortal man any where but in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica? No; ſince the art of writing was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, there never were ſuch libels tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt any human being, whether friend or enemy. Yet, neither the government of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, nor the Chief Juſtice, nor any other perſon in authority, ever interfered. No one, amongſt all theſe libellers, was ever proſecuted or <hi>bound over.</hi> Their <hi>politics were perfectly French,</hi> and all went ſmoothly on.</p>
            <p>Let us for a moment ſuppoſe (which, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we have no right to do), that the ſtupid and
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033523_0071_0FF7725ED4A88360"/>
ungenerous prejudice prevailing againſt Great Britain, formed ſome triſling excuſe for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsneſs (to give it the mildeſt term) of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive and judiciary of the ſtate. Still, this could not apply to the libels publiſhed againſt other nations and princes; ſome of which had, and now have, <hi>treaties af amity</hi> with this country, and others were not, nor ever had been, its foes.</p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe nations there is one, the libels againſt which I have reſerved for this place: I mean <hi>Spain.</hi> For three long years the King of Spain, his government and miniſtry, were the ſubject of conſtant abuſe and defamation. BACHE, in No. 1028 of his vile paper, ſays,
<q>the <hi>ſlaves of Madrid</hi> will ſoon ſhrink from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querers of Toulon.</q>
And in No. 1044, he has, ſpeaking of Spain, theſe words:
<q>
                  <hi>The</hi> most cowardly of the human race;</q>
—
<q>
                  <hi>the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh slaves;</q>
—
<q>the ignorant ſoldiery of the <hi>infamous tyrant of Castille.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, this is the very ſame Prince, and the ſame people, that I have been proſecuted for libelling. Compare what I have ſaid, or rather what I have publiſhed, concerning them; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the paſſages in the Bill of Indictment with thoſe here quoted, and then praiſe the impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and juſtice <hi>of the free and equal government of Pennsylvania<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Don Yrujo</hi> never thought the honour of his Maſter, when called an <hi>infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tyrant,</hi> merited his zeal to defend it; nay, the very printer, who thus defamed him, the DON has employed as the printer of his <hi>insolent letter to Mr.</hi> PICKERING! This man's conduct
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033523_0072_0FF7716922ECCFA8"/>
is hardly worth notice; but how ſhall we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the conduct of the Chief Judge of Pennſylvania? Surely the king of Spain's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ought to have been an object of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>then</hi> as well as <hi>now;</hi> unleſs we are willing to allow, that no character is under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laws of Pennſylvania, unleſs it be of <hi>persons devoted to the will of France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, before I conclude this compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what I have been moſt rigorouſly proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for doing, and what others have done with impunity, I ſhall give the reader a ſpecimen or two of the conduct of the officers of this Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania Government <hi>(not excluding the Chief Judge himself),</hi> towards foreign nations and princes.</p>

            <p>M'KEAN dwells with great ſtreſs on the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be apprehended from inſulting foreign nations, more eſpecially thoſe with which we have <hi>negociations pending,</hi> and the <hi>persons with whom we are to treat.</hi> Well then, all the libels that I have here produced, againſt His Britannic Majeſty, his miniſters, and his people; and this "<hi>decent</hi>" conduct on the part of "the CHIEFS, <hi>civil and military,</hi> of Pennſylvania," and on the part of the Governor himſelf; all theſe libels were publiſhed, and this conduct took place, <hi>at the very time, when</hi> MR.

            <p>The Chief Juſtice, would, I dare ſay, be very angry not to be thought included among

<q>Succeſs to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Irishmen,</q>
then in open rebellion againſt their king; but, theſe would not, in point of time be quite to my purpoſe: I ſhall, therefore, come to one inſtance of his conduct that is ſo. It is a ſort of companion piece to his Charge, and it ſhall, for that reaſon, be put exactly upon a parallel with it.</p>

            <p>I have amply proved, that the pretended li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, for which I have been proſecuted, are to the real ones, publiſhed by others, what the glare of a taper is to a city in flames. I have proved that the very monarch, whom I termed a
<q>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate prince,</q>
has been, by others, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed as "an infamous tyrant." But, there was yet one fact wanting to render this ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous proſecution complete; and that fact is at hand.</p>
            <p>The reader, by turning back to page 36, will perceive, that one of my
<q>falſe, ſcandalous, and malicious libels,</q>
as they are moſt falſly and ſcandalouſly called, did not originate with me, nor in my paper. It was copied from Mr. FEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NO's paper <hi>of an anterior date.</hi> This material circumſtance was, very cautiouſly and <hi>candidly,</hi> kept <hi>out of the Bill of Indictment,</hi> though the heads and titles of the other two publications were mentioned; and there is every reaſon to believe, that it eſcaped the attention of the Grand Jury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:033523_0078_0FF7726F028D7528"/>The Indictment, as is uſual, concludes with ſtating the tendency of the crime, part of which is,
<q>the <hi>evil example</hi> of all others in the like caſe offending.</q>
This is moſt certainly very proper: for, to prevent the effects of <hi>evil exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> is, or ought to be, the principle object of all puniſhments. But, how could I be ſaid to ſet the <hi>evil example,</hi> when it was notorious that I had been far ſurpaſſed by others, who had never been called to account, and when the very pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, for which I was proſecuted, I had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, word for word, from another printer, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the country, and living in the ſame city with myſelf? Mr. FENNO has never been <hi>bound over.</hi> He has never been arreſted: nor has he been even ſpoken to on the ſubject. He has heard of my being proſecuted; but he little imagines it was for his crimes.</p>
            <p>Thus, in the capital of America, amidſt all its <hi>vaunted liberty of the preſs,</hi> and under the "<hi>equal</hi>" and "<hi>humane</hi>" laws of Pennſylvania, another man has been allowed to print and publiſh, not only with impunity, but without reproof, a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, for the re-publiſhing of which, I have been ſeized as a criminal, expoſed to the danger of a heavy fine, of impriſonment at hard labour, of being crammed in a dungeon, and <hi>of suffering the punishment of a murderer</hi>!</p>
            <p>Is this your <hi>republican</hi> juſtice! Is this the bleſſed fruit of that <hi>liberty,</hi> to obtain which all the horrors of a revolution are to be encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, kings are to be hurled from their thrones, and nations deluged in blood! Was it for this that America maintained a ten years deſolating
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:033523_0079_0FF772743743C420"/>
war; that all the ties of intereſt, of allegiance, of friendſhip, and of nature were rent aſſunder, and that a hundred thouſand of her ſons were ſtretched dead on the plain!—Talk not to me of your ſovereign people, and your univerſal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferage; of your political liberty and your equal rights: they are empty ſounds, which I regard not. Give me ſecurity for my perſon and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; or, at leaſt, let me ſhare the fate of my neighbour.
<q>Send us (ſaid the Iſraelites of old); Send us, O Lord, a king, that he may render us <hi>juſtice.</hi>
               </q>
To enſure this laſt mentioned ineſtimable bleſſing, is the end of civil ſociety, and ought to be the great object of all political inſtitutions. <hi>Juſtice</hi> is the ſoul of freedom, as <hi>impartiality</hi> is the ſoul of juſtice; and, without theſe, <hi>liberty</hi> is an impoſtor and <hi>law</hi> is a farce.</p>
            <p>I ſhould here bid the reader adieu, leaving him to pour out his ſoul, like Judge M'Kean, in hoſannahs for the
<q>temporal bleſſings of the Repreſentative Democracy, which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, <hi>in his great mercy,</hi> has vouchſafed unto us;</q>
but I have pledged myſelf to prove, that <hi>the British press is much free-er than that of America;</hi> and, notwithſtanding
<q>the bleſſings, in great mercy, vouchſafed unto us,</q>
I fear not, that, with the indulgence of the reader, I ſhall make good my promiſe. For the motives from which I do this I am reſponſible to no one: if, however, an apology is thought neceſſary, let it be ſought for in the abominable treatment I have experienced.</p>

here, and every democratic one in Great Britain, has held the liberty of the American preſs up in triumphant exaltation over that of the preſs of Great Britain. How many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes might be filled up with inſtances of this fort! How many thouſand times is the vain boaſt repeated in the courſe of each revolving ſun! To refer to particular publications is like ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for proofs of daylight or of darkneſs: but, there is one that I muſt refer to, becauſe it ſo aptly anſwers my purpoſe. It is a letter of the arch ſectarian PRIESTLEY, who, not content without companions in his fallen ſtate, has ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no pains to inveigle his countrymen hither. He tells the people of England, in this letter, ſent there to be publiſhed, that "<hi>Here</hi> (in <hi>italicks</hi> to mark the contraſt)
<q>
                  <hi>Here</hi> the preſs is free. <hi>Here</hi> truth is not a libel.</q>
This ſatanic letter contains many other aſſertions equally <hi>false,</hi> which I may one day or other expoſe; but, at preſent, I notice only what appertains to my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>The poor Doctor was always a bold aſſerter; but, in the caſe before us, I muſt confeſs, a more ſcrupulous man might have been led into the adoption of a falſhood. The peal has been ſo inceſſantly rung in our ears. We have been ſo bored with it in all ſeaſons, at all hours, eating, drinking and ſleeping time not excepted, that it required a degree of incredulity rarely to be met with to reſiſt the temptation to belief. The aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, nevertheleſs falſe; and it is a falſhood too, which the ſafety of every one (particularly <hi>a foreigner</hi>), who touches pen or types, requires to be clearly and fully expoſed.</p>

               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:033523_0081_0FF77279BA42CF68"/>
               <hi>That</hi> TRUTH <hi>may be a libel in Great Britain, and that it cannot be a libel here,</hi> is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and is thought to conſtitute the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the laws of the two countries, on this head. But this is no more than a vulgar notion, taken up from ignorance, and propagated from vanity and envy. I defy any man to produce me a ſingle law, or a ſingle conſtitution (for, "thank God," as the Judge ſays, we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny); I defy him to cite me a clauſe or ſentence, that ſays, or that leaves room to ſuppoſe, that <hi>truth</hi> may not be deemed a libel, here as well as in England. The United States, and the individual States of Maſſachuſetts, New Hampſhire, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Maryland, North Carolina, and Kentuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, each of them ſay, that
<q>
                  <hi>the</hi> press ought to be free,</q>
in a ſhort vague ſentence, of which any lawyer of a common capacity would give as many different interpretations as there can be rung changes upon twelve bells, which are ſaid to amount to ſome millions. Pennſylvania and Tenneſee ſay the ſame, and more. They ſay, with the other States, and with the laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that <hi>the press shall be free;</hi> and they add, that
<q>in proſecutions for the publication of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, inveſtigating the <hi>official</hi> conduct of <hi>officers,</hi> or where the matter publiſhed is <hi>proper for public information,</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> thereof may be given in evidence.</q>
Connecticut, New York, New Jerſey, Delaware, Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia, have had the prudence to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all about the matter; and, as to Rhode Iſland, its conſtitution is neither more nor leſs than a new edition of the Charter granted them by
<q>the abundant grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion</q>
of King Charles II. Thus it
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:033523_0082_0FF7727CCB7A9558"/>
ſtands, bound up with the other ſixteen conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without the addition or excluſion of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle word. And, all the other States, without one exception, have taken ſpecial care to bind down their rulers <hi>never to deprive them of the common law of England,</hi> but to preſerve it inviolate to them and their children. Amidſt all their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies, when they were ſtark ſtaring drunk with revolutionary triumph, they had the good ſenſe, the ſaving grace, to cling faſt round this old trunk of ſolid and ſubſtantial liberty. Long may they hold by it, and never ſuffer it to be chipped away by quibbling ſtatutes and partial Judges!</p>
            <p>Hence then, it happens, very luckily for me, that, if there be any State, in which the common law of England, reſpecting libels, is departed from, it is poor Pennſylvania. And, what is the mighty "bleſſing" ſhe has had
<q>vouchſafed unto her?</q>
Why,
<q>in proſecutions for the publication of papers inveſtigating the <hi>official</hi> conduct of <hi>officers,</hi> or where the matter pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed is <hi>proper for public information,</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> may be <hi>given in evidence.</hi>
               </q>
So that, you will pleaſe to obſerve, Meſſieurs authors and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that, firſt, the perſon about whom you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh muſt be <hi>an officer;</hi> and next, you muſt touch upon nothing but his <hi>official</hi> conduct. Precious privilege! It is a mere net to catch the unwary: it leaves not the leaſt ſcope for cenſuring any public man whatſoever, but ſeems, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, intended to ſhelter his faults and his crimes from the laſh of the preſs. By declaring that the <hi>truth</hi> ſhall be admitted as evidence as to ſuch publications only as touch his <hi>official</hi> conduct, his private character and conduct are held up as ſacred and inviolable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:033523_0083_0FF77280191F32B8"/>But, the Judge, the expoſitor of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, goes ſtill further. He tells us, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, reſpecting the <hi>official</hi> conduct of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, muſt not only be <hi>true,</hi> but "<hi>candid</hi>" and "<hi>decent</hi>" alſo. This is a maxim laid down in his charge, and every one will agree, that he was ready to put it in practice. Comfortable writing and publiſhing it muſt be, thus penned up with vague and indefinite epithets! <hi>Truth</hi> may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and aſcertained, but what publication is there, which, by ſome quirk or other, might not be repreſented as <hi>uncandid</hi> or <hi>indecent</hi>?—Yet, as if this left the preſs ſtill <hi>too free.</hi> The Judge tells us, that ſuch publications, muſt not only be <hi>decent, candid,</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> but, beſides all this, they muſt "have an eye <hi>ſolely</hi> to the <hi>public good.</hi>— Here is a pretty latitude for quibble and conteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation!

            <p>One would now think that the officers of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania were ſafely enough fortified againſt the attacks of the preſs; but the Chief Juſtice was reſolved to guard them at every point; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after throwing up baſtions in abundance and out-works upon out-works, he ſurrounds the whole with a line of contravalation, thus:
<q>Where libels are printed againſt <hi>perſons employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a public capacity,</hi> they receive an <hi>aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as they tend to <hi>scandali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e the government.</hi>
               </q>
Charming liberty of the preſs! Againſt men thus defended, what devil of a printer is there, who will ever dare to fire a ſingle ſhot? Suppoſe, for
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:033523_0084_0FF7728336F74618"/>
inſtance, that a Judge were to be guilty of ſome moſt vile and infamous offence: ſuppoſe he were <hi>to thieve;</hi> one would think that a free preſs ſhould take ſome little notice of it; but you muſt not do it, becauſe thieving is not (or, at leaſt, I am ſure, it ought not to be) the <hi>official</hi> conduct of a Judge, and therefore the truth cannot be given in evidence; and becauſe the libel would "receive an aggravation," as it would moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly "tend to <hi>scandalize the government.</hi>"— Thus is the preſs of Pennſylvania nailed down; but if ſuch a thing had happened in England, or in France previous to the revolution, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would have blazoned it from one end of the empire, nay, from one end of the world to the other; and if they could have found a convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Moon, thither it would have went. It is right to curb ſuch "licentious" fellows. Their blabbing ought to be prevented; and for doing this give me not a mighty kingdom with ſtanding armies and letters de cachet, but give me a little ſang "Repreſentative Democracy," armed with the power of <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>As to the latter proviſion of the clauſe above quoted, that the <hi>truths</hi> publiſhed muſt be <hi>proper for public information,</hi> it is far worſe than nothing; for, what is <hi>proper for public information</hi> is no libel according to the common law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no <hi>truth,</hi> nor any evidence whatſoever, is neceſſary to juſtify its publication, in the eye of that law; but, according to the new maxim, what is very proper for public information may be a libel, if the truth of every word of it cannot be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:033523_0085_0FF77284C462FC60"/>I think I have now ſatisfied the reader, that, in point of law, the American preſs has gained nothing over that of Great Britain. But, the Chief Juſtice, as if he really intended to aid my undertaking, and to do away every doubt on the ſubject, took good care to tell the Grand Jury, that, <hi>with respect to libels, the common law was confirmed and established by the Constitution itself.</hi> Where then is the advantage derived from the new order of things? If the conſtitution of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, which is, according to the modern ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the word, the free-eſt in America; if this conſtitution has done <hi>no more</hi> than confirm and eſtabliſh the common law of England, with reſpect to the liberty of the preſs, how can any man have the impudence to boaſt of that liberty being greater here than it is in England, where that ſame common law ſtill exiſts in all its pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and purity, and is adminiſtered by men the moſt learned, independent and righteous in the world?</p>
            <p>Thus far then, the liberty of the preſs, is, in the eye <hi>the law,</hi> the ſame in both countries; but this does not prove, that there exiſt no circumſtances in America, peculiar to it, which render the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this liberty unſafe, and of courſe reſtrains its operations. It is not only the principles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in a country, that we are to look to, but alſo the <hi>practice</hi> of that country. The thing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the conſtitution of France, for example, ſays that the <hi>free use</hi> of the preſs is a right <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>inviolable;</hi> but this does not prevent the tyrants from ſeizing the printers by ſcores, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them without a trial and without a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:033523_0086_0FF7728646C5F2A0"/>The preſs has been, and ſtill is, reſtrained in this country, 1ſt, by the notion, which has been, for evident motives, inculcated by artful men, that no <hi>private character</hi> ought to be publickly cenſured. 2nd, by the very dangerous privilege, which <hi>foreign agents</hi> poſſeſs, in having <hi>a choice of governments,</hi> under which to bring their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions. And, 3rd, by the terror, neceſſarily excited in every printer, by the <hi>disgraceful and cruel punishment,</hi> to which he is liable.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe reſtraints, nothing can give us a better idea of the extent to which it is carried, than the bold aſſertions contained in the Chief Judge's Charge. He tells us, that though a publication may not reflect any moral turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude on the party, it may yet be libelious, if it <hi>thwarts the said party's desire of appearing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in life.</hi> This is a very comfortable doctrine to every <hi>scoundrel,</hi> and particularly to every <hi>whore,</hi> for you will not find one of either deſcription, who does not deſire <hi>to appear agreeable in life.</hi> The reaſonableneſs of this doctrine his Honour ſupports by telling us, that if any man does wrong, recourſe may be had to the courts of juſtice, and that there can be no neceſſity, <hi>nor reason,</hi> for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the people in <hi>news-papers</hi> or <hi>pamphlets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, you ſee, if his Honour ſhuts up the preſs, he has the goodneſs to open his court to us. But, if I were to ſee one officer of government go ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering drunk through the ſtreet, on his return from a civic feſtival; or another from the ſame cauſe, reeling into his ſeat, muſt I hold my tongue, or go to law with them? If a ſwindler, a man of the baſeſt character, the moſt treacherous and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:033523_0087_0FF7728C74790778"/>
of mortals, were to propoſe himſelf as a candidate for a ſeat in the Legiſlature, muſt I ſay nothing about him; muſt I not throw out even a hint to the people to warn them of their danger? If a Judge, or any other awful character, were to be detected in ſhop-lifting, or in the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any ſuch baſe and infamous crime; or if a lady were to chooſe, now and then, to relieve her huſband by retiring a few months to the arms of a friend, muſt I ſew up my lips, and muſt my preſs be as tame and contented as the cuckold himſelf?</p>
            <p>Such may, indeed, be the practice of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican preſs; but is it that of the preſs of Great Britain. Only compare one of the London papers with an American paper, and you will ſoon ſee which comes from the free-eſt preſs. Is there a crime, is there a fault or a folly, which the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and print-ſellers in London do not laſh? They dive into every aſſembly and every houſe; they ſpare characters neither public nor private; neither the people, the gentry, the clergy, the nobility nor the royal family itſelf, is ſheltered from their ridicule or their cenſure. Let any American but open PETER PINDAR's works and the LONDON MORNING CHRONICLE; then let him read Judge M'Kean's Charge, and bluſh at the boaſt that has been ſo often made about the liberty of the preſs.</p>
            <p>I am far from approving of all, or of hardly any thing, contained in the works of Pindar and the Morning Chronicle: the Chronicle is the devoted tool of an infamous Jacobin faction, and the far greater part of Pindar's monotonous
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:033523_0088_0FF7728E66AF1B50"/>
odes are an outrage on decency, on truth, and on every principle, moral and religious, by which a man of learning and talents ought to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But, becauſe public cenſure and ridicule, when grounded on <hi>falshood,</hi> is unjuſtifiable, it by no means follows, that the preſs is to exerciſe no ſort of cenſorſhip at all; that it is not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord evil as well as righteous deeds; that it is not to check the follies and vices of the times; that it is not to exert its wholeſome and mighty influence in ſociety, but become the mere echo of the bench and the bar. No; this does not follow; yet, this is the practice of the American preſs.</p>
            <p>Come to my office, reader, and look over (if you have patience) the leaden ſheets that are hither dragged from every quarter of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. If they have one ſingle ſhaft of ſatire, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be on the old hackneyed ſubject of king-craft and prieſt-craft, I will ſuffer you to ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate me by reading me their contents.—And what is the reaſon of this? Is it that this bleſſed
<q>Repreſentative Democracy, which, <hi>in great mercy,</hi> has been vouchſafed unto us,</q>
preſerves us unſuſceptible of folly or vice? Is it that we are all wiſe, moral, religious, and pure as the driven ſnow? Is it, my God! that we know of no ſuch thing as drunkenneſs, adultery, ſwind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, corruption, or blaſphemy? Or is it that we wiſh to keep theſe things hidden from the world?—If this could be done, and if ſilence would produce a reformation. I would willingly conſent,—not to become as tame and inſipid as my brethren, but to throw my preſs into the river. But, this is impoſſible; ſince whatever exiſts, is,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:033523_0089_0FF7728FE95373D8"/>
and muſt be, known; and ſince wickedneſs the longer it remains unchaſtiſed, the more inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate it becomes; ſince this is the caſe, the moſt rigid cenſorſhip in the preſs is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to check, in time, that which, if ſuffered to paſs unnoticed, will moſt certainly, ſooner or later, end in general degradation and ruin.</p>
            <p>Yet, this timely check; this ſalutary and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs chaſtiſement, muſt remain a uſeleſs inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our hands, becauſe, forſooth, the villain and the ſtrumpet
<q>desire to appear agreeable in life,</q>
and becauſe an expoſure of their turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will "<hi>ſtain the honour of their families!</hi>" For this cogent reaſon, the good and the bad, the upright ſtateſman and the traitor, the man of integrity and the rogue, the virtuous matron and the whore, are all to be jumbled to-gether, and the world is to take us in the lump, or nor at all.</p>
            <p>But, may it pleaſe your Honour, this will not do. We know well, that the world is very ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured, and that, when it judges in the lump, it very ſeldom looks at the beſt ſide. Men of reputation, therefore, do not approve of this jumbling work. They wiſh to be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that have none. This can be done only by the detecting of vice, and expoſing it to public cenſure; and I beg your Honour's leave to add one concluding obſervation of my own, which is this; <hi>that I never yet know a single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, man or woman, extremely anxious to restrain the liberty of the press, in this respect, who had not very sufficient reasons for so doing.</hi>

               <hi>foreign agents</hi> poſſeſs, in having <hi>a choice of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,</hi> under which to bring their proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>I have already, in the former part of this pamphlet, ſaid how the preſs, in various parts of the country, has been kept in ſlavery by the unpuniſhed violences of the domineering French faction; and, in the relation of the treatment I have met with, I have clearly proved what every printer, of any independence of ſpirit has to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from another quarter. This ſituation of things, however, has been produced by a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſingular circumſtances, and it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably wear away as thoſe circumſtances change. But, the evil, of which I have now to complain, is of a nature not to be worn away by the hand of time alone. It is built on law and conſtitution, or, at leaſt, it operates as if it were, and admits of no remedy, except by ſome poſitive act of a convention or the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>It was hoped (though, it muſt be confeſſed, with very little reaſon), that America, when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Great Britain, would never more be affected by the quarrels of European nations. PAINE told the people, that they would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but grow rich, while other nations ſhould be at war. "Our commerce," ſays he,
<q>will always ſecure us the <hi>peace and friendſhip</hi> of all Europe.</q>
This, by woeful experience, we find to have been like all the reſt of ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Paine's predictions. But this is not the worſt. Not only does America feel the preſſure of European wars, in a degree equal to that felt by the people of Great Britain at this moment;
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:033523_0091_0FF7742E51C1B338"/>
but ſhe is curſed with a foreign faction in her boſom, by which ſhe is continually curbed, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed, injured, inſulted, and betrayed.</p>
            <p>The politics of the country are become ſo connected, ſo interwoven, with the politics of other nations, France in particular, that they are never ſpoken of in any other than a relative light. I verily believe, and indeed I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that, as to numbers, men are more equally divided, at this time, between the Federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the French, than they were in the year 1778, between the Congreſs and the King of England.</p>
            <p>Nor does this pernicious diviſion ſtop here. The State governments have their ſides. One State is called a <hi>Federal State</hi> and another an <hi>Antifederal State:</hi> and it is notorious, that the politics of the perſons, who adminiſter theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altern governments, are generally fixed and uniform on one ſide or the other.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a ſtate of things, only think of the danger of allowing foreign miniſters and agents <hi>to choose the government, under which to bring their prosecutions!</hi> Poſſeſſing this dreadful pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, will not every foreign agent take good care to inſtitute his proſecutions under that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to which the party proſecuted has, by his politics, rendered himſelf obnoxious? And, where this can be done, what ſort of chance, I pray, is there for a man who meddles with the preſs, and who happens to be ſituated in a State, where he muſt of neceſſity be obnoxious to one of the two governments, under which he lives?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:033523_0092_0FF77430F21CB088"/>My own caſe is a ſtriking exemplification of the danger of this privilege. Yrujo the Spaniard applied firſt to the Federal Government to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute me, and was informed that it would be done in the Federal courts. But, this he remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt, and requeſted that it might be done in the courts of Pennſylvania; in which courts M'Kean is Chief Judge.—Now, why this requeſt? Why prefer one juriſdiction to another? The courts are held at the ſame place, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the ſame time. The Judges of the Federal court are men famous for their learning and their integrity; and, I am ſure, ordering the trial in this court ought to have been looked upon as a mark of reſpect to the Spaniſh King. How, then, are we to account for this extraordinary requeſt?</p>
            <p>Leaving the reader to account for it in his own way, I ſhall tell him that the requeſt was refuſed; and that, then, a new proſecution was ſet on foot under the government of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. The matter contained in the above bill of Indictment was hunted out; and, let it be well remembered, that every pretended libel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this bill, was publiſhed <hi>before I was bound over on the first complaint.</hi> In poſſeſſion of this fact, the reader will be able to gueſs what the hopes of the proſecutor were founded on.</p>
            <p>The matter in the bill of indictment, if libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, was ſurely ſo before I was bound over the firſt time. How comes it then, that it was not included in the firſt complaint? This puzzled the Grand Jury. The thing appeared ſo unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to them, that they ſent for the two Attorneys
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:033523_0093_0FF774336A9A6710"/>
General to explain the myſtery; when it was found, that they had taken care, in drawing their indictments, to ſteer clear of each other; in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I, by-the-bye, do not mean to hint, that either of theſe gentlemen did any more than his duty.</p>
            <p>Thus was ſeen the ſingular phenomenon of a printer proſecuted by <hi>two governments,</hi> at one and the ſame time, for different parts of one and the ſame offence! And this is <hi>American liberty of the press!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did Engliſhmen ever hear of any thing of this kind before? No; they have <hi>one</hi> Government, <hi>one</hi> law, and <hi>one</hi> conſtitution for all. In their country, neither foreigner nor native, plaintiff nor defendant, has a choice of juriſdictions, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, or judges. Where the offence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there muſt it be tried. They have no claſhing of governments of oppoſite politics, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which every printer is in hourly danger, from the intrigues of foreign agents, and is obliged to tack and ſhift, like a polacre with contending winds between Sylla and Charibdis. No; in England, all is fair and free. The path is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: the law is one and the ſame, and is equal in its operations in every place and towards all parties. It is founded in wiſdom and in juſtice, and is adminiſtered with candour, impartiality, and mercy.</p>
            <p>The third reſtraint on the liberty of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican preſs, and the laſt which I ſhall notice, <hi>at this time</hi> is, <hi>the fear which muſt be naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in every writer and printer, by the disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and cruel puniſhment, to which he is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exposed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:033523_0094_0FF7716537E280D8"/>After all that we have heard and ſeen about the <hi>mildness</hi> and <hi>humanity</hi> of the American laws; after all the cant of the <hi>tender-hearted</hi> Briſſot; after all the ſilly enlogiums on the priſons of Philadelphia, ſpread abroad in pamphlets, ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and paragraphs; and after all the ſarcaſtic and acrimonious invective which the American preſs is continually pouring out againſt the <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary</hi> code of Great Britain: bored with all this, I ſay, even to ſurfeiting, my preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint muſt appear very extraordinary. Let it. All that I have to do, is to prove it well founded.</p>
            <p>The liberty of doing any thing, is greater or leſs, in proportion to the puniſhment that the law awards for it. I am, therefore, far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the Americans do not, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, poſſeſs more liberty than the Engliſh. They are in leſs danger, when they ſteal, rob, forge, coin, and murder; for, theſe crimes are here puniſhed with <hi>fine, jail imprisonment, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment at hard labour,</hi> or <hi>solitary confinement</hi>; whereas, in England, they are puniſhed with <hi>death.</hi> But, let thoſe, who have reaſon, boaſt of this ſort of liberty. It is not what I want. I only contend for liberty to write and to print.</p>
            <p>This liberty is a right, ſanctioned by law, as far as a certain line, all beyond which is called libelling. This line reaches, as I have clearly proved, juſt as far in America as it does in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and no farther. All that we have to do then is to ſee, which country inflicts puniſhments the <hi>least severe</hi> on tranſgreſſors; for, in that country the preſs muſt be <hi>most free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:033523_0095_0FF774381726F0E0"/>By only caſting our eyes on the Chief Judge's Charge, we ſhall perceive, that the puniſhments are ten fold more ſevere in America than in England. In England, a tranſgreſſor of the laws of the preſs, or, in other words, a libeller, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by <hi>fine,</hi> by <hi>imprisonment in jail,</hi> by <hi>standing in the pillory</hi>; or by any two, or all three, of them. But, what is his puniſhment in America? Why, in the firſt place, <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>jail imprisonment,</hi> as in England, and to theſe may be added, impriſonment <hi>at hard labour,</hi> and even <hi>solitary confinement in a dungeon,</hi> at the <hi>discretion of the court;</hi> and all this too in a country, where the proſecutor may have <hi>a choice of courts</hi>!</p>
            <p>As far as relates to <hi>fines</hi> and <hi>jail imprisonment,</hi> the code of the two countries is the ſame; but, inſtead of the momentary ſhame of the pillory, the American libeller, whether writer or printer, is liable to the laſting pain and diſgrace of hard labour, and to the more horrid puniſhment of the dungeon. Standing in the pillory, which is the worſt an Engliſh libeller can undergo, is over in a few hours. The ſufferer is then placed in jail, where he is as free as a detention of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will admit of. He can ſee, hear, read and converſe. He is at caſe; can be viſited by his friends; nay, <hi>Callender</hi> (the run-away Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) boaſts, that his aſſociates even ſold their libels in Newgate. What is this puniſhment compared to continual <hi>hard labour</hi>? And what is hard labour, or any thing elſe, compared to being thrown into a cell, and cut off, not only from friends and family, but from every human being?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:033523_0096_0FF7743AC063ABA0"/>But, we muſt not drop the ſubject here. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, as to their influence in ſociety, and conſequently as to their reſtraint on the preſs, muſt be conſidered <hi>relatively;</hi> for, what may be a very light puniſhment in one country, may be a very heavy, and even a very cruel one, in another. In England, for inſtance, robbery, forgery, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp;c. are puniſhed with <hi>death:</hi> in America theſe crimes are puniſhed with <hi>har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> labour,</hi> or <hi>solitary confinement.</hi> So that, to inflict theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhments on a libeller <hi>here,</hi> is exactly as cruel as it would be to inflict death on him in England.</p>
            <p>What were the motives of the rulers, who leſſened the puniſhment for <hi>murder,</hi> and other hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid crimes, while they augmented the puniſhment for <hi>libelling,</hi> I muſt leave thoſe to determine, who boaſt ſo much about the liberty of their preſs; but, this I will undertake to ſay, that it is moſt excellently well calculated to reſtrain, intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, and over awe, every one who has any thing to do with writing and printing. What man will ever dare to communicate his thoughts to the public, while it is probable, or even <hi>poſſible,</hi> that his writing will procure him a place in that "<hi>temple</hi> of <hi>humanity,</hi>" as it has been called, the Philadelphia priſon; where, dreſſed in a jail uniform, penned up amongſt run-away thieving negro ſlaves; amongſt robbers, forgers, ſodom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, and murderers; where, in ſhort, amongſt convicts of every colour and of every crime, he is employed in the polite art of pounding hemp, with the infinite ſatisfaction of being exhibited to travelling <hi>philanthropists</hi> as a
<q>living monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of American <hi>mildness</hi> and <hi>humanity</hi>?</q>—
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:033523_0097_0FF7743DF5B73880"/>
And, if this be too much for a man of reputation and talents to bear, how ſhall he dare to brave the horrors of a cell; to be ſecluded from friends, parents, wife, children, and all that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders life worth poſſeſſing; to be barred up for months, or for years, like a condemned malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and this too at the diſcretion of a court, choſen, perhaps, by his proſecutor?</p>
            <p>Did Engliſhmen . . . . . . . . . . . but, why do I purſue in the odious compariſon?—Did even Frenchmen ever feel a reſtraint like this?—The Baſtile!—it was bad enough, to be ſure; but, a writer confined there, had, at leaſt, the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowing, that he was diſtinguiſhed from felons and murderers. Though far too ſeverely puniſhed, he was not covered with everlaſting diſgrace and infamy. Literature, though the abuſe of it was cruelly chaſtiſed, was not degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was not rendered at once hateful and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable, as it is by the indiſcriminating code of Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>Yet, notwithſtanding all we have ſeen, the Chief Judge has the modeſty to tell the Grand Jury, from the bench, that <q>the criminal law of <hi>this State</hi> is ſo pregnant with <hi>justice,</hi> ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>reaſon,</hi> ſo full of <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>clemency,</hi> that even thoſe who ſuffer by it, <hi>cannot charge it with rigour</hi>
               </q>!!!—This was too much. He might, at any rate, have ſpared us the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liſtening to this. But, it is the faſhion. Almoſt every public harrangue has ſome ſuch vaunting concluſion. It may be good policy, to be ſure, as it tends, to keep the people here in excellent humour, while it excites envy in thoſe
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:033523_0098_0FF7744026FE96F8"/>
of ther nations, makes them diſcontented whit their lot, and invites them to cultivate the deſerts of America; but then, the greateſt care imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhould be taken, not to lay the iron finger on ſuch men as are not formed for paſſive ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>france, and particularly if they are Britons; for they, above all others, will not whiſper their curſes to the winds: they will turn their eyes towards their native land: they will compare what they have loſt with what they have gained; nor will all the terrors of hard labour and a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia dungeon, ever, I truſt, deter them from proclaiming the account to the world.</p>
            <p>I have now accompliſhed my object. I have expoſed the conduct of my enemies, and I have amply proved, that the preſs is more free in Great Britain than it is in America. As to the motives by which I have been actuated, though I frankly confeſs, that had I not been injured, had I not been ſingled out as an object of legal vengeance, no part of this pamphlet would ever have been written or thought of; yet, I am far from wiſhing to throw an odium on the people of theſe States in general, and to repreſent them as a tame degenerate race of mortals. On the contrary, I know that a very great majority of them have felt, and expreſſed, the utmoſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at the treatment I have received. The deciſion of the Grand Jury alone, conſidering the charge that was made to them, is ſufficient to prove, that the ſpirit of true liberty is yet alive on this ſide the Atlantic. That deciſion, and the joy which it excited amongſt all the reſpectable inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia, are freſh in every one's memory, and will, I am ſure, be
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:033523_0099_0FF77441AFFF1048"/>
for ever rivetted in mine. Let it not be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, however, that I ſay this with the baſe motive of procuring or preſerving <hi>patronage,</hi> either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or private. I ſtand in need of none. My good honeſt parents taught me the labours of the field, and, with theſe, they taught me independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mind. It has pleaſed God to bleſs me with health, and with limbs to gain my bread; and, while I am able to do this by the ſpade or the plough, I will never ſeek for wealth nor for eaſe, by fawning for popular favour, or by bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying my injuries in ſilent ſubmiſſion.</p>
