            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF Colonel BOUQUET'S Expedition, Againſt the <hi>Ohio</hi> Indians in the Year 1764.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the preceeding introduction, ſome account hath been given of the ſudden, treacherous and unprovok'd attack, made by the Indians upon the frontiers of Pennſylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, ſoon after the publication of the general Peace, at a time when we were but juſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſpire from our former calamities, and looked for an approach of quiet on every ſide. The principal tranſactions of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign 1763 have likewiſe been briefly recapitulated, and the reader informed by what means the editor became poſſeſs'd of the valuable papers, which have enabled him to bring the hiſtory of this Indian war to a concluſion, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the materials of the following ſheets.</p>
            <p>COLONEL BOUQUET, as before mentioned, not having a ſufficient number of troops to garriſon the different poſts, under his command, and at the ſame time to croſs the Ohio and take advantage of the dejection into which he had thrown the enemy, by the defeat at Buſhy-Run, was obliged to reſtrain his
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:010167_0002_0F7D44A83467CD50"/>
operations to the ſupplying the forts with proviſions, ammunition and other neceſſaries.</p>
            <p>IN the execution of this ſervice, he received no annoyance from the enemy, for they now ſaw themſelves not only forced to give up their deſigns againſt FORT-PITT; but, retreating beyond the Ohio, they deſerted their former towns, and abandoned all the country between Preſque-Iſle and Sanduſki; not thinking themſelves ſafe till they arrived at Muſkingam.</p>
            <p>HERE they began to form new ſettlements, and remained quiet during the winter. But, in the mean time, having ſupplied themſelves with powder &amp;c. from the French traders, (and now flattering themſelves that the great diſtance of their ſettlements would render them inacceſſible to our troops) the enſuing ſpring 1764 preſented theſe ſavage enemies afreſh on our frontiers; ravaging and murdering with their uſual barbarity.</p>
            <p>TO chaſtiſe them for their perfidy, General Gage reſolved to attack them on two different ſides, and to force them from our frontiers; by carrying the war into the heart of their own country. With this view, he deſtined a corps of troops to proceed under Col. Bradſtreet, to act againſt the Wiandots, Ottawas, Chip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was and other nations, living upon or near the lakes; while another corps, under the command of Col. Bouquet ſhould attack the Delawares, Shawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, Mingoes, Mohickons, and other nations, between the Ohio and the lakes.</p>
            <p>THESE two corps were to act in concert; and as that of Col. Bradſtreet could be ready much ſooner than the other, he was to proceed to Detroit, Michili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackinac and other places. On his return, he was to encamp and remain at Sanduſki, to awe, by that poſition, the numerous tribes of weſtern Indians, ſo as to prevent their ſending any aſſiſtance to the Ohio Indians, while Colonel Bouquet ſhould execute his plan of attacking them in the heart of their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>COL. BOUQUET'S expedition was to proceed altogether by land, and was on that account attended with great difficulties. His men were to penetrate thro'
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:010167_0003_0F7D44A942EF7ED0"/>
a continued depth of woods, and a ſavage unexplor'd country; without roads, without poſts, and without a retreat if they failed of ſucceſs. When once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in theſe deſerts, they had no <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, nor any kind of aſſiſtance to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Every thing was to be carried with them — their ammunition, baggage, tools, ſtores, and proviſions neceſſary for the troops during the whole expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And beſides, they were liable to many embarraſments, and difficulties which no prudence could foreſee, ſcarce any caution prevent; ſo that, in this ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>count, ſundry things, which, in the uſual method of conducting military opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might not be thought worthy of a detail, may nevertheleſs be found high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable to thoſe who may afterwards be employed in this ſpecies of war, which is new to Europeans, who muſt ſubmit to be inſtructed in it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and in many articles even by the ſavages themſelves.</p>
            <p>PART of the 42d and 60th regiments were ordered on this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and were to be joined by two hundred friendly Indians, and the troops required of Virginia and Pennſylvania. The Indians never came, and the Virginians pleaded their inability to raiſe men, having already in pay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 700 militia for the defence of their own frontier. In Pennſylvania, a bill for raiſing 1000 men was paſſed May 30th; but, with the utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that could be uſed, the number could not be compleated till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Auguſt.</p>
            <p>ON the 5th of that month, the men being aſſembled at Carliſle, one hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and eighteen miles to the weſtward of Philadelphia, Governor Penn, who had accompanied Col. Bouquet to that place, acquainted the two Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia battalions with the neceſſity we were laid under of chaſtiſing the Indians <q>for their repeated and unprovoked barbarities on the inhabitants of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; a juſt reſentment of which, added to a remembrance of the loyalty and courage of our provincial troops on former occaſions, he did not doubt, would animate them to do honor to their country; and that they could not but hope to be crown'd with ſucceſs, as they were to be united with the ſame regular troops, and under the ſame able commander, who had by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, on that very day, the memorable 5th of Auguſt in the preceeding
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010167_0004_0F7D44A9AE30FF38"/>
year, ſuſtained the repeated attacks of the ſavages, and obtained a compleat victory over them.</q>—He alſo reminded them <q>of the examplary puniſhments that would be inflicted on the grievous crime of deſertion, if any of them were capable of ſo far forgetting their ſolemn oath and duty to their king and country, as to be involved in it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>COL. BOUQUET then aſſumed the command of the regular and provincial troops; and the four following days were ſpent in the neceſſary preparations for their march; the Colonel giving the moſt expreſs orders to the officers and men to obſerve ſtrict diſcipline, and not to commit the leaſt violation of the civil rights or peace of the inhabitants.—He, at the ſame time, made the moſt prudent regulations for a ſafe and commodious carriage of the baggage, taking care to rid himſelf of all unneceſſary incumbrances.</p>
            <p>THE 13th of Auguſt this ſmall army got to Fort Loudoun; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the precautions taken to prevent deſertion, the Pennſylvania troops were now reduced to about 700 men. The Colonel was therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity to apply to the government of that province to enable him to compleat their number to the full complement; which was generouſly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a reſolve of the Governor and Commiſſioners Auguſt 16th; and the army advancing now beyond the ſettled parts of Pennſylvania, he made appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the colony of Virginia, where (under the countenance of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Fauquier) the men wanted were ſoon raiſed, and joined the army at Pittſburg, about the latter end of September.</p>
            <p>NOTHING material happened in their march, from Fort Loudoun to Fort Pitt, (formerly Fort Du Queſne) on the Ohio, three hundred and twenty miles weſt from Philadelphia; at which place Col. Bouquet arrived the 17th, September.</p>
            <p>DURING this interval, ſeveral large convoys were forwarded under ſtrong eſcorts; and tho' the enemy continued their ravages all that time on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010167_0005_0F7D44AE0C6533D8"/>
they durſt not attack any of thoſe convoys, which all arrived ſafe at Fort Pitt.</p>
            <p>WHILE Col. Bouquet was at Fort Loudoun, he received diſpatches by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs from Col. Bradſtreet, dated from Preſque-Iſle Auguſt 14th, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that he (Col. Bradſtreet,) had concluded a peace with the Delawares and Shawaneſe; but Col. Bouquet perceiving clearly that they were not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in their intentions, as they continued their murders and depredations, he determined to proſecute his plan without remiſſion, till he ſhould receive fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtructions from General Gage; who, upon the ſame principles, refuſed to ratify the treaty, and renewed his orders to both armies to attack the enemy.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the time of Col. Bouquet's arrival at Fort Pitt, ten Indians appeared on the north ſide of the Ohio, deſiring a conference; which ſtratagem the ſavages had made uſe of before, to obtain intelligence of our numbers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Three of the party conſented, tho' with apparent reluctance, to come over to the Fort; and as they could give no ſatisfactory reaſon for their viſit, they were detained as ſpies, and their aſſociates fled back to their towns.</p>
            <p>ON the 20th of Sept. Col. Bouquet ſent one of the above three Indians after them with a meſſage, in ſubſtance as follows—<q>I have received an account from Col. Bradſtreet that your nations had begg'd for peace, which he had conſented to grant, upon aſſurance that you had recalled all your warriors from our frontiers; and in conſequence thereof, I would not have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt your towns, if I had not heard that, in open violation of your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, you have ſince murdered ſeveral of our people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>AS ſoon as the reſt of the army joins me, which I expect immediately, I was therefore determined to have attacked you, as a people whoſe promiſes can no more be relied on. But I will put it once more in your power to ſave your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and your families from total deſtruction, by giving us ſatisfaction for the hoſtilities committed againſt us. And firſt you are to leave the path
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010167_0006_0F7D44AF8BAE2C60"/>
open for my expreſſes from hence to Detroit; and as I am now to ſend two men with diſpatches to Col. Bradſtreet who commands on the lakes, I deſire to know whether you will ſend two of your people with them to bring them ſafe back with an anſwer? and if they receive any injury either in going or coming, or if the letters are taken from them, I will immediately put the Indians now in my power to death, and will ſhew no mercy for the future to any of your nations that ſhall fall into my hands. I allow you ten days to have my letters delivered at Detroit, and ten days to bring me back an anſwer.</q>—</p>
            <p>HE added <q>that he had lately had it in his power, while they remained on the other ſide of the river, to have put their whole party to death, which puniſhment they had deſerved by their former treachery; and that if they did not improve the clemency now offered to them, by returning back as ſoon as poſſible with all their priſoners, they might expect to feel the full weight of a juſt vengeance and reſentment.</q>—</p>
            <p>WE have been the more particular in our account of this firſt tranſaction with the Indians; becauſe the Colonel's firm and determined conduct in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the campaign, had happy effects in the proſecution of it, and ſhews by what methods theſe faithleſs ſavages are to be beſt reduced to reaſon.</p>
            <p>ON the 1ſt of October, two of the Six Nation tribes, an Onondago and Oneida Indian, came to Fort Pitt, and under colour of our ancient friendſhip with them, and their pretended regard to the Engliſh, endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the Colonel from proceeding with the army. They told him that his force was not ſufficient to withſtand the power of the numerous nations through whoſe countries he was to paſs, and aſſured him that if he would wait a little, they would all come and make peace with him; at the ſame time recommending it particularly to him to ſend back the two Indians detained as ſpies. Theſe little arts being clearly made uſe of to ſpin out the ſeaſon till the approach of winter ſhould render it impoſſible to proceed, they made but little impreſſion. He told them that he could not depend on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010167_0007_0F7D44B024A38FF8"/>
of the Delawares and Shawaneſe; and was determined to proceed to Tuſcarowas, where, if they had any thing to ſay, he would hear them.</p>
            <p>IN the mean time, he was uſing the utmoſt diligence to prepare for his march, and was obliged to enforce the ſevereſt diſcipline. One woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to each corps, and two nurſes for the general hoſpital, were all that were permitted to follow the army. The other women in the camp, and thoſe unneceſſary in the garriſon, were ordered immediately down the country into the ſettlements. Two ſoldiers were ſhot for deſertion; an example which became abſolutely neceſſary to ſuppreſs a crime which, in ſuch an expedition, would have been attended with fatal conſequences, by weakening an army already too ſmall.</p>
            <p>COL. BOUQUET, having at length, with great difficulty, collected his troops, formed his magazines, and provided for the ſafety of the poſts he was to leave behind him, was ready on the 2d of October to proceed from Fort Pitt, with about 1500 men, including drivers and other neceſſary followers of the army.</p>
            <p>AS a juſt idea of the conduct of this expedition, and the great caution tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to prevent ſurprize, will be beſt obtained from the ORDER OF MARCH, we ſhall here inſert it, with a Copper Plate for the illuſtration of it, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Draught, taken from actual ſurveys, of the road and adjacent country, through which the army paſſed.</p>
            <p>THE Colonel, expreſſing the greateſt confidence in the bravery of the troops, told them, <q>he did not doubt but this war would ſoon be ended, under God, to their own honor, and the future ſafety of their country, provided the men were ſtrictly obedient to orders, and guarded againſt the ſurprizes and ſudden attacks of a treacherous enemy, who never dared to face Britiſh troops in an open field; that the diſtance of the enemy's towns, and the clearing roads to them, muſt neceſſarily require a conſiderable time; that the troops in thoſe deſerts, had no other ſupplies to expect but the ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010167_0008_0F7D44B073559618"/>
and proviſions they carried with them; and that therefore the utmoſt care and frugality would be neceſſary in the uſe of them.</q> He publiſhed the ſevereſt penalties againſt thoſe who ſhould be found guilty of ſtealing or embezzling any part of them, and ordered his March in the following manner.—</p>
            <p>A corps of Virginia <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe were the men raiſed in Virginia to compleat the Pennſylvania troops, and were in the pay of the laſt mentioned province.</note> volunteers advanced before the whole; detaching three ſcouting parties. One of them, furniſhed with a guide, marched in the center path, which the army was to follow. The other two extended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a line a-breaſt, on the right and left of the aforeſaid party, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitre the woods.</p>
            <p>UNDER cover of this corps, the ax-men, conſiſting of all the artificers, and two companies of light infantry, followed in three diviſions, under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the chief engineer, to clear three different paths, in which the the troops and the convoy followed, viz.—</p>
            <p>THE front-face of the ſquare, compoſed of part of the 42d. regiment, marched in a column, two deep, in the center path.</p>
            <p>THE right face of the ſquare, compoſed of the remainder of the 42d. and of the 60th regiment, marched in a ſingle file in the right hand path.</p>
            <p>THE firſt battalion of Pennſylvanians compoſed the left face, marching in like manner in the path to the left of the center.</p>
            <p>THE corps de reſerve, compoſed of two platoons of grenadiers, followed the right and left faces of the ſquare.</p>
            <p>THE 2d battalion of Pennſylvanians formed the rear face of the ſquare, and followed the corps de reſerve, each in a ſingle file, on the right and left
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010167_0009_0F7D44B12EA06E90"/>
hand paths; all theſe troops covering the convoy, which moved in the center path.</p>
            <p>A party of light horſe-men marched behind the rear-face of the ſquare, followed by another corps of Virginia volunteers, forming the rear-guard.</p>
            <p>THE Pennſylvania volunteers, dividing themſelves equally, and marching in a ſingle file, at a proper diſtance, flanked the right and left faces of the ſquare.</p>
            <p>THIS was the general order of March. Nor was leſs attention paid to particular matters of a ſubordinate nature. The ammunition and tools were placed in the rear of the firſt column, or front face of the ſquare, followed by the officer's baggage, and tents. The oxen and ſheep came after the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, in ſeparate droves, properly guarded. The proviſions came next to the baggage, in four diviſions, or brigades of pack-horſes, each conducted by a horſe maſter.</p>
            <p>THE troops were ordered to obſerve the moſt profound ſilence, and the men to march at two yards diſtance from one another. When the line or any part of it halted, the whole were to face outwards; and if attacked on their march, they were to halt immediately, ready to form the ſquare when ordered. The light horſe were then to march into the ſquare, with the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, proviſions, ammunition and baggage. Proper diſpoſitions were likewiſe made in caſe of an attack in the night; and for encampments, guards, communications between the centries, ſignals, and the like.</p>
            <p>THINGS being thus ſettled, the army decamped from Fort-Pitt on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday October 3d, and marched about one mile and an half over a rich level country, with ſtately timber, to camp No. 2. a ſtrong piece of ground, pleaſantly ſituated, with plenty of water and food for cattle.</p>
            <p>THURSDAY October 4th, having proceeded about two miles, they came to the Ohio, at the beginning of the narrows, and from thence followed the courſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010167_0010_0F7D44B1F2788C28"/>
of the river along a flat gravelly beech, about ſix miles and a quarter; with two iſlands on their left, the lowermoſt about ſix miles long, with a riſing ground running acroſs, and gently ſloping on both ſides to its banks, which are high and upright. At the lower end of this iſland, the army left the river, marching thro' good land, broken with ſmall hollows to camp No. 3; this day's march being nine miles and a quarter.—</p>
            <p>FRIDAY October 5th. In this day's march, the army paſs'd thro' Loggs-town, ſituated ſeventeen miles and an half, fifty ſeven perches, by the path, from Fort-Pitt. This place was noted before the laſt war for the great trade carried on there by the Engliſh and French; but its inhabitants, the Shawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe and Delawares, abandoned it in the year 1750. The lower town extended about ſixty perches over a rich bottom to the foot of a low ſteep ridge, on the ſummit of which, near the declivity, ſtood the upper town, commanding a moſt agreeable proſpect over the lower, and quite acroſs the Ohio, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five hundred yards wide here, and by its majeſtic eaſy current adds much to the beauty of the place. Proceeding beyond Loggs-town, thro' a fine country, interſperſed with hills and rich valleys, watered by many rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and covered with ſtately timber, they came to camp No. 4; on a level piece of ground, with a thicket in the rear, a ſmall precipice round the front, with a run of water at the foot, and good food for cattle. This day's march was nine miles, one half, and fifty three perches.</p>
            <p>SATURDAY October 6th, at about three miles diſtance from this camp, they came again to the Ohio, purſuing its courſe half a mile farther, and then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, over a ſteep ridge, they croſs'd big Beaver-creek, which is twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perches wide, the ford ſtony and pretty deep. It runs thro' a rich vale, with a pretty ſtrong current, its banks high, the upland adjoining it very good, the timber tall and young.—About a mile below its confluence with the Ohio, ſtood formerly a large town, on a ſteep bank, built by the French of ſquare logs, with ſtone chimneys, for ſome of the Shawaneſe, Delaware and Mingo tribes, who abandoned it in the year 1758, when the French deſerted Fort Du Queſne. Near the fording of Beaver-creek alſo ſtood about ſeven
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010167_0011_0F7D44B2B8134538"/>
houſes, which were deſerted and deſtroyed by the Indians, after their defeat at Buſhy-run, when they forſook all their remaining ſettlements in this part of the country, as has been mentioned above.</p>
            <p>ABOUT two miles before the army came to Beaver-creek, one of our people who had been made priſoner by ſix Delawares about a week before, near Fort Bedford, having made his eſcape from them, came and informed the Colonel that theſe Indians had the day before fallen in with the army, but kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concealed, being ſurprized at our numbers. Two miles beyond Beaver-creek, by two ſmall ſprings, was ſeen the ſcull of a child, that had been fixed on a pole by the Indians. The Tracts of 15 Indians were this day diſcovered. The camp No. 5 is ſeven miles one quarter and fifty ſeven perches from big Beaver-creek; the whole march of this day being about twelve miles.</p>
            <p>SUNDAY 7th October, paſſing a high ridge, they had a fine proſpect of an extenſive country to the right, which in general appeared level, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of tall timber. The camp No. 6 lies at the foot of a ſteep deſcent, in a rich valley, on a ſtrong ground, three ſides thereof ſurrounded by a hollow, and on the fourth ſide a ſmall hill, which was occupied by a detached guard. This day's march was ſix miles ſixty five perches.</p>
            <p>MONDAY 8th October, the army croſs'd little Beaver-creek, and one of its branches. This creek is eight perches wide, with a good ford, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about it interſperſed with hills, rivulets and rich valleys, like that deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above. Camp No. 7 lies by a ſmall run on the ſide of a hill, commanding the ground about it, and is diſtant eleven miles one quarter and forty nine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the laſt encampment.</p>
            <p>TUESDAY October 9th. In this day's march, the path divided into two branches, that to the ſouthweſt leading to the lower towns upon the Muſking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. In the forks of the path ſtand ſeveral trees painted by the Indians, in a hieroglyphic manner, denoting the number of wars in which they have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, and the particulars of their ſucceſs in priſoners and ſcalps. The camp
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010167_0012_0F7D44B388E22798"/>
No. 8. lies on a run, and level piece of ground, with Yellow-creek cloſe on the left, and a riſing ground near the rear of the right face. The path after the army left the forks was ſo bruſhy and entangled, that they were obliged to cut all the way before them, and alſo to lay ſeveral bridges, in order to make it paſſable for the horſes; ſo that this day they proceeded only five miles, three quarters and ſeventy perches.</p>
            <p>WEDNESDAY 10th. Marched one mile with Yellow-creek on the left at a ſmall diſtance all the way, and croſſed it at a good ford fifty feet wide; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thro' an alternate ſucceſſion of ſmall hills and rich vales, finely wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with rivulets, to camp No. 9. ſeven miles and ſixty perches in the whole.</p>
            <p>THURSDAY 11th. Croſs'd a branch of Muſkingham river about fifty feet wide, the country much the ſame as that deſcribed above, diſcovering a good deal of free ſtone. The camp No. 10. had this branch of the river parallel to its left face, and lies ten miles one quarter and forty perches from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer encampment.</p>
            <p>FRIDAY 12th. Keeping the aforeſaid creek on their left, they marched thro' much fine land, watered with ſmall rivers and ſprings; proceeding likewiſe thro' ſeveral ſavannah's or cleared ſpots, which are by nature extremely beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; the ſecond which they paſſed being, in particular, one continued plain of near two miles, with a fine riſing ground forming a ſemicircle round the right hand ſide, and a pleaſant ſtream of water at about a quarter of a mile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant on the left. The camp No. 11. has the abovementioned branch of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham on the left, and is diſtant ten miles and three quarters from the laſt encampment.</p>
            <p>SATURDAY 13th. Croſs'd Nemenſhehelas-creek, about fifty feet wide, a little above where it empties itſelf into the aforeſaid branch of Muſkingham, having in their way a pleaſant proſpect over a large plain, for near two miles on the left. A little further, they came to another ſmall river which they
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010167_0013_0F7D44B43134E0C8"/>
croſs'd about fifty perches above where it empties into the ſaid branch of Muſkingham. Here a high ridge on the right, and the creek cloſe on the left, form a narrow defile about ſeventy perches long. Paſſing afterwards over a very rich bottom, they came to the main branch of Muſkingham, about ſeventy yards wide, with a good ford. A little below and above the forks of this river is Tuſcarowas, a place exceedingly beautiful by ſituation, the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> rich on both ſides of the river; the country on the northweſt ſide being <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> entire level plain, upwards of five miles in circumference. From the ruined houſes appearing here, the Indians who inhabited the place and are now with the Delawares, are ſuppoſed to have had about one hundred and and fifty warriors. This camp No. 12. is diſtant eight miles nineteen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the former.</p>
            <p>SUNDAY 14th. The army remained in camp; and two men who had been diſpatched by Col. Bouquet from Fort-Pitt, with letters for Col. Bradſtreet, returned and reported—"That, within a few miles of this place, they had been made priſoners by the Delawares, and carried to one of their towns ſixteen miles from hence, where they were kept, till the ſavages, knowing of the arrival of the army here, ſet them at liberty, ordering them to acquaint the Colonel that the head men of the Delawares and Shawaneſe were coming as ſoon as poſſible to treat of peace with him."</p>
            <p>MONDAY 15th. The army moved two miles forty perches further down the Muſkingham to camp No. 13, ſituated on a very high bank, with the river at the foot of it, which is upwards of 100 yards wide at this place, with a fine level country at ſome diſtance from its banks, producing ſtately timber, free from underwood, and plenty of food for cattle.</p>
            <p>THE day following, ſix Indians came to inform the Colonel that all their chiefs were aſſembled about eight miles from the camp, and were ready to treat with him of peace, which they were earneſtly deſirous of obtaining. He returned for anſwer that he would meet them the next day in a bower at ſome
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010167_0014_0F7D44B5008462A0"/>
diſtance from the camp. In the mean time, he ordered a ſmall ſtockaded ſort to be built to depoſit proviſions for the uſe of the troops on their return; and to lighten the convoy.</p>
            <p>AS ſeveral large bodies of Indians were now within a few miles of the camp, whoſe former inſtances of treachery, altho' they now declared they came for peace, made it prudent to truſt nothing to their intentions, the ſtricteſt orders were repeated to prevent a ſurpriſe.</p>
            <p>WEDNESDAY 17th. The Colonel, with moſt of the regular troops, Virginia volunteers and light horſe, marched from the camp to the bower erected for the congreſs. And ſoon after the troops were ſtationed, ſo as to appear to the beſt advantage, the Indians arrived, and were conducted to the bower. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeated, they began, in a ſhort time, to ſmoak their pipe or calumet; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreable to their cuſtom. This ceremony being over, their ſpeakers laid down their pipes, and opened their pouches, wherein were their ſtrings and belts of wampum. The Indians preſent were, <list>
                  <item>SENECAS. Kiyaſhuta, chief with 15 warriors.</item>
                  <item>DELAWARES. Cuſtaloga, chief of the Wolfe-tribe, Beaver, chief of the Turky-tribe, with 20 warriors.</item>
                  <item>SHAWANESE. Keiſſinautchtha, a chief, and 6 warriors.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Kiyaſhuta, Turtle-Heart, Cuſtaloga and Beaver, were the ſpeakers.</p>
            <p>The general ſubſtance of what they had to offer, conſiſted in excuſes for their late treachery and miſconduct, throwing the blame on the raſhneſs of their young men and the nations living to the weſtward of them, ſuing for peace in the moſt abject manner, and promiſing ſeverally to deliver up all their priſoners. After they had concluded, the Colonel promiſed to give them an anſwer the next day, and then diſmiſſed them, the army returning to the camp—The badneſs of the weather, however, prevented his meeting them again till the 20th, when he ſpoke to them in ſubſtance as follows, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THAT their pretences to palliate their guilt by throwing the blame on the weſtern nations, and the raſhneſs of their young men, were weak and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010167_0015_0F7D44B5AF9CB498"/>
as it was in our power to have protected them againſt all theſe nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they had ſollicited our aſſiſtance, and that it was their own duty to have chaſtiſed their young men when they did wrong, and not to ſuffer themſelves to be directed by them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HE recapitulated to them many inſtances of their former perfidy— <q>their killing or captivating the traders who had been ſent among them at their own requeſt, and plundering their effects;—their attacking Fort Pitt, which had been built with their expreſs conſent; their murdering four men that had been ſent on a public meſſage to them, thereby violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cuſtoms held ſacred among all nations, however barbarous; —their attacking the king's troops laſt year in the woods, and after being defeated in that attempt, falling upon our frontiers, where they had continued to murder our people to this day. &amp;c.</q>—</p>
            <p>HE told them how treacherouſly they had violated even their late engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with Col. Bradſtreet, to whom they had promiſed to deliver up their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners by the 10th of September laſt, and to recall all their warriors from the frontiers, which they had been ſo far from complying with, that the priſoners ſtill remained in their cuſtody, and ſome of their people were even now continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their depredations; adding that theſe things which, he had mentioned, were only <q>a ſmall part of their numberleſs murders and breaches of faith; and that their conduct had always been equally perfidious.—You have, ſaid he, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed at every former treaty, as you do now, that you would deliver up all your priſoners, and have received every time, on that account, conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſents, but have never complied with that or any other engagement. I am now to tell you, therefore, that we will be no longer impoſed upon by your promiſes. This army ſhall not leave your country till you have fully complied with every condition that is to precede my treaty with you.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>I have brought with me the relations of the people you have maſſacred, or taken priſoners. They are impatient for revenge; and it is with great difficulty that I can protect you againſt their juſt reſentment, which is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010167_0016_0F7D44B671FA28B0"/>
only reſtrained by the aſſurances given them, that no peace ſhall ever be concluded till you have given us full ſatisfaction.—</p>
               <p>YOUR former allies, the Ottawas, Chipwas, Wyandots, and others, have made their peace with us. The Six Nations have joined us againſt you. We now ſurround you, having poſſeſſion of all the waters of the Ohio, the Miſſiſſippi, the Miamis, and the lakes. All the French living in thoſe parts are now ſubjects to the king of Great-Britain, and dare no longer aſſiſt you. It is therefore in our power totally to extirpate you from being a people—But the Engliſh are a merciful and generous nation, averſe to ſhed the blood, even of their moſt cruel enemies; and if it was poſſible that you could convince us, that you ſincerely repent of your paſt perfidy, and that we could depend on your good behaviour for the future, you might yet hope for mercy and peace—If I find that you faithfully execute the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preliminary conditions, I will not treat you with the ſeverity you deſerve.</p>
               <p>I GIVE you twelve days from this date to deliver into my hands at Waka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamake all the priſoners in your poſſeſſion, without any exception; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen, Frenchmen, women and children; whether adopted in your tribes, married, or living amongſt you under any denomination and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatſoever; together with all negroes. And you are to furniſh the ſaid priſoners with cloathing, proviſions, and horſes, to carry them to Fort Pitt.</p>
               <p>WHEN you have fully complied with theſe conditions, you ſhall then know on what terms you may obtain the peace you ſue for.—</p>
            </q>
            <p>THIS ſpeech made an impreſſion on the minds of the ſavages, which, it is hoped, will not ſoon be eradicated. The firm and determined ſpirit with which the Colonel delivered himſelf, their conſciouſneſs of the aggravated injuries they had done us, and the view of the ſame commander and army that had ſo
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010167_0017_0F7D44B72D89F968"/>
ſeverely chaſtiſed them at Buſhy-Run the preceeding year, now advanced into the very heart of their remote ſettlements, after penetrating thro' wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which they had deemed impaſſible by regular troops—all theſe things contributed to bend the haughty temper of the ſavages to the loweſt degree of abaſement; ſo that even their ſpeeches ſeem to exhibit but few ſpecimens of that ſtrong and ferocious eloquence, which their inflexible ſpirit of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency has on former occaſions inſpired. And tho' it is not to be doubted, if an opportunity had offered, but they would have fallen upon our army with their uſual fierceneſs, yet when they ſaw the vigilance and ſpirit of our troops were ſuch, that they could neither be attacked nor ſurprized with any proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſucceſs, their ſpirits ſeemed to revolt from the one extreme of inſolent boldneſs, to the other of abject timidity. And happy will it be for them and for us, if the inſtances of our humanity and mercy, which they experienced in that critical ſituation, ſhall make as laſting impreſſions on their ſavage diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as it is believed the inſtances of our bravery and power have done; ſo that they may come to unite, with their fear of the latter, a love of the former; and have their minds gradually opened, by ſuch examples, to the mild dictates of peace and civility.</p>
            <p>The reader, it is to be hoped, will readily excuſe this digreſſion if it ſhould be thought one. I now reſume our narrative. The two Delaware chiefs, at the cloſe of their ſpeech on the 17th, delivered 18 white priſoners, and 83 ſmall ſticks, expreſſing the number of other priſoners which they had in their poſſeſſion, and promiſed to bring in as ſoon as poſſible. None of the Shawaneſe kings appeared at the congreſs, and Keiſſinautchtha their deputy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined ſpeaking until the Colonel had anſwered the Delawares, and then with a dejected fullenneſs he promiſed, in behalf of his nation, that they would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the terms preſcribed to the other tribes.</p>
            <p>The Colonel, however, determined to march farther into their country, knowing that the preſence of his army would be the beſt ſecurity for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their promiſes; and required ſome of each nation to attend him in his march.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:010167_0018_0F7D44B7F0149BE8"/>KIYASHUTA addreſſed the ſeveral nations, before their departure, <q>deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be ſtrong in complying with their engagements, that they might wipe away the reproach of their former breach of faith, and convince their brothers the Engliſh that they could ſpeak the truth; adding that he would conduct the army to the place appointed for receiving the priſoners.</q>
            </p>
            <p>MONDAY October 22d. The army attended by the Indian deputies, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nine miles to camp No. 14. croſſing Margaret's creek about fifty feet wide— The day following, they proceeded ſixteen miles one quarter and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſeven perches farther to camp No. 15. and halted there one day.</p>
            <p>THURSDAY 25. They marched ſix miles, one half and ſixteen perches to camp No. 16, ſituated within a mile of the Forks of Muſkingham; and this place was fixed upon inſtead of Wakautamike, as the moſt central and convenient place to receive the priſoners; for the principal Indian towns now lay round them, diſtant from ſeven to twenty miles; excepting only the lower Shawaneſe town ſituated on Scioto river, which was about eighty miles; ſo that from this place the army had it in their power to awe all the enemy's ſettlements and deſtroy their towns, if they ſhould not punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fulfil the engagements they had entered into.—Four redoubts were built here oppoſite to the four angles of the camp; the ground in the front was cleared, a ſtore-houſe for the proviſions erected, and likewiſe a houſe to receive, and treat of peace with, the Indians, when they ſhould return.</p>
            <p>ON Saturday 27th. A meſſenger arrived from king Cuſtaloga, informing that he was on his way with his priſoners, and alſo a meſſenger from the lower Shawaneſe towns of the like import. The Colonel however, having reaſon to ſuſpect the latter nation of backwardneſs, ſent one of their own people, deſiring them—<q>to be punctual as to the time fixed; to provide a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of proviſions to ſubſiſt the priſoners; to bring the letters wrote to him laſt winter by the French commandant at Fort Chartres, which ſome of their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010167_0019_0F7D44B8B4C20310"/>
people had ſtopp'd ever ſince;</q> adding that, <q>as their nation had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſome uneaſineſs at our not ſhaking hands with them, they were to know that the Engliſh never took their enemies by the hand, before peace was finally concluded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE day following, the Shawaneſe meſſenger returned, ſaying that when he had proceeded as far as Wakautamike, the chief of that town undertook to proceed with the meſſage himſelf, and deſired the other to return and acquaint the Engliſh that all his priſoners were ready, and he was going to the lower towns to haſten theirs.</p>
            <p>OCTOBER 28th. Peter the Caughnawaga chief, and 20 Indians of that nation arrived from Sanduſki, with a letter from Colonel Bradſtreet, in anſwer to one which Colonel Bouquet had ſent to him from Fort-Pitt, by two of the Indians who firſt ſpoke to him in favour of the Shawaneſe, as hath been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The ſubſtance of Colonel Bradſtreet's letter was "that he had ſettled nothing with the Shawaneſe and Delawares, nor received any priſoners from them.—That he had acquainted all the Indian nations, as far as the Ilinois, the bay &amp;c. with the inſtructions he had received from General Gage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the peace he had lately made; that he had been in Sanduſki-lake and up the river, as far as navigable for Indian canoes, for near a month; but that he found it impoſſible to ſtay longer in theſe parts; abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity obliging him to turn off the other way, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>COL. BRADSTREET, without doubt, did all which circumſtances would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, in his department; but his not being able to remain at Sanduſki agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the original plan, till matters were finally ſettled with the Ohio Indians, would have been an unfavourable incident, if Colonel Bouquet had not now had the chiefs of ſundry tribes with him, and was ſo far advanced into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian country, that they thought it adviſeable to ſubmit to the conditions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:010167_0020_0F7D44BA798B4AF0"/>THE Caughnawagas reported that the Indians on the lakes had delivered but few of their priſoners; that the Ottawas had killed a great part of theirs, and the other nations had either done the ſame, or elſe kept them.</p>
            <p>FROM this time to November 9th, was chiefly ſpent in ſending and receiving meſſages to and from the Indian towns, relative to the priſoners, who were now coming into the camp one day after another in ſmall parties, as the different nations arrived in whoſe poſſeſſion they had been. The Colonel kept ſo ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this article of having every priſoner delivered, that when the Delaware kings, Beaver and Cuſtaloga, had brought in all their's except twelve which they promiſed to bring in a few days, he refuſed to ſhake-hands or have the laſt talk with them, while a ſingle captive remained among them.</p>
            <p>BY the 9th of November, moſt of the priſoners were arrived that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this ſeaſon, amounting to <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <p>Virginians, Males, 32, Females &amp; Children, 58.</p>
                  <p>Pennſylvanians, Males, 49, Females &amp; Children, 67.</p>
                  <p>In all 206.</p>
               </note> 206 in the whole; beſides about 100 more in poſſeſſion of the Shawaneſe, which they promiſed to deliver the following ſpring. Mr. Smallman, formerly a Major in the Pennſylvania troops, who had been taken laſt ſummer near Detroit by the Wyandots, and delivered to the Shawaneſe, was among the number of thoſe whom they now brought in, and informed the Colonel that the reaſon of their not bringing the remainder of their priſoners, was that many of their principal men, to whom they belonged, were gone to trade with the French, and would not return for ſix weeks; but that every one of their nation who were at home, had either brought or ſent theirs. He further ſaid that, on the army's firſt coming into the country, it had been reported among the Shawaneſe that our intention was to deſtroy them all, on which they had reſolved to kill their priſoners and fight us; that a French trader who was with them, and had many barrels of powder and ball, made them a preſent of the whole, as ſoon as they had come to this reſolution; but that, happily for the poor captives, juſt as the Shawaneſe were preparing to execute this tragedy, they received the Colonel's meſſage, informing them
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010167_0021_0F7D44BB4A80EF30"/>
that his intentions were only to receive the priſoners and to make peace with them on the ſame terms he ſhould give to the Delawares.</p>
            <p>ON this intelligence they ſuſpended their cruel purpoſe, and began to collect as many of the priſoners as they had power to deliver; but hearing immediately afterwards that one of our ſoldiers had been killed near the camp at Muſking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and that ſome of their nation were ſuſpected as guilty of the murder, they again imagined they would fall under our reſentment, and therefore determined once more to ſtand out againſt us. For which purpoſe, after having brought their priſoners as far as Wakautamike, where they heard this news, they collected them all into a field, and were going to kill them, when a ſecond expreſs providentially arrived from Col. Bouquet, who aſſured them that their nation was not even ſupected of having any concern in the aforeſaid murder; upon which they proceeded to the camp to deliver up the captives, who had thus twice ſo narrowly eſcaped becoming the victims of their barbarity.</p>
            <p>ON Friday, November 9th, the Colonel, attended by moſt of the principal officers, went to the conference-houſe. The Senecas and Delawares were firſt treated with. Kiyaſhuta and 10 warriors repreſented the former. Cuſtaloga and 20 warriors the latter.</p>
            <p>KIYASHUTA ſpoke—<q>With this ſtring of wampum, we wipe the tears from your eyes—we deliver you theſe 3 priſoners, which are the laſt of your fleſh and blood that remained among the Senecas and Cuſtaloga's tribe of Delawares we gather together and bury with this belt <note n="†" place="bottom">A belt or ſtring is always delivered when thus mentioned.</note> all the bones of the people that have been killed during this unhappy war, which the Evil Spirit occaſioned among us. We cover the bones that have been buried, that they may be never more remembered—We again cover their place with leaves that it may be no more ſeen.—As we have been long aſtray, and the path between you and us ſtopped, we extend this belt that it may be again cleared, and we may travel in peace to ſee our brethren as our anceſtors formerly did.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010167_0022_0F7D44BBAF8730C8"/>
While you hold it faſt by one end, and we by the other, we ſhall always be able to diſcover any thing that may diſturb our friendſhip.</q>—</p>
            <p>THE Colonel anſwered that <q>he had heard them with pleaſure; that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived theſe 3 laſt priſoners they had to deliver, and joined in burying the bones of thoſe who had fallen in the war, ſo that their place might be no more known. The peace you aſk for, you ſhall now have. The king, my maſter and your father, has appointed me only to make war; but he has other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who are employed in the work of peace. Sir William Johnſon is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered for that purpoſe. To him you are to apply; but before I give you leave to go, two things are to be ſettled.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. As peace cannot be finally concluded here, you will deliver me two hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for the Senecas, and two for Cuſtaloga's tribe, to remain in our hands at Fort Pitt, as a ſecurity, that you ſhall commit no further hoſtilities or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt any of his majeſty's ſubjects; and when the peace is concluded theſe hoſtages ſhall be delivered ſafe back to you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The deputies you are to ſend to Sir William Johnſon, muſt be fully empowered to treat for your tribes, and you ſhall engage to abide by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſtipulate. In that treaty, every thing concerning trade and other matters will be ſettled by Sir William, to render the peace everlaſting; and the deputies you are to ſend to him, as well as the hoſtages to be delivered to me, are to be named and preſented to me for my approbation.—</p>
            </q>
            <p>THE Colonel, after promiſing to deliver back two of their people, Capt. Pipe, and Capt. John, whom he had detained at Port-Pitt, took the chiefs by the hand for the firſt time, which gave them great joy.</p>
            <p>THE next conference was on November 10th, with the Turkey and Turtle tribes of Delawares, King Beaver their chief and 30 warriors repreſenting the former; and Kelappama brother to their <note n="*" place="bottom">The chief of the Turtle tribe, for ſome reaſon choſe to abſent himſelf.</note> chief with 25 warriors the latter.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010167_0023_0F7D44BC6FD0F780"/>
The Senecas and Cuſtaloga's tribe of Delawares were alſo preſent. Their ſpeech and the anſwer given, were much the ſame as above; excepting that the Colonel inſiſted on their delivering up an Engliſhman, who had murdered one of our people on the frontiers and brought the ſcalp to them; and that they ſhould appoint the ſame number of deputies and deliver the ſame number of hoſtages, for each of their tribes, as had been ſtipulated for Cuſtaloga's tribe.</p>
            <p>NOVEMBER 11. King Beaver preſented ſix hoſtages to remain with Col. Bouquet, and five deputies to treat with Sir William Johnſon, who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of. This day he acquainted the chiefs preſent that as he had great reaſon to be diſſatisfied with the conduct of Nettowhatways, the chief of the Turtle tribe who had not appeared, he therefore depoſed him; and that tribe were to chuſe and preſent another for his approbation. This they did a few days afterwards—Smile not reader at this tranſaction; for tho' it may not be attended with ſo many ſplendid and flattering circumſtances to a commander, as the depoſing an Eaſt Indian Nabob or chief; yet to penetrate into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes where thoſe ſtern Weſt Indian Chieftains hold their ſway, and to frown them from their throne, tho' but compoſed of the unhewn log, will be found to require both reſolution and firmneſs; and their ſubmitting to it clearly ſhews to what degree of humiliation they were reduced.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed. The Shawaneſe ſtill remained to be treated with, and tho' this nation law themſelves under the neceſſity of yielding to the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the other tribes, yet there had appeared a dilatorineſs and ſullen haughtineſs in all their conduct, which rendered it very ſuſpicious.</p>
            <p>THE 12th of November was appointed for the conference with them; which was managed on their part by Keiſſinautchtha and Nimwha their chiefs, with the Red Hawke, Laviſſimo, Benſivaſica, Eweecunwee, Keigleighque, and 40 warriors; the Caughnawaga, Seneca and Delaware chiefs, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 60 warriors, being alſo preſent.</p>
            <p>THE Red Hawke was their ſpeaker, and as he delivered himſelf with a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010167_0024_0F7D44C02A667248"/>
ſtrange mixture of fierce pride, and humble ſubmiſſion, I ſhall add a paſſage or two from his ſpeech.</p>
            <p>BROTHER,</p>
            <p>
               <q>You will liſten to us your younger brothers; and as we diſcover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in your eyes that looks diſſatisfaction with us, we now wipe away every thing bad between us that you may clearly ſee—You have heard many bad ſtories of us—We clean your ears that you may hear—We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move every thing bad from your heart, that it may be like the heart of your anceſtors, when they thought of nothing but good.</q> [Here he gave a ſtring.]</p>
            <p>
               <q>BROTHER; when we ſaw you coming this road, you advanced towards us with a Tomahawk in your hand; but we your younger brothers take it out of your hands and throw it up to God <note n="*" place="bottom">Their uſual figure for making peace is burying the hatchet; but as ſuch hatchets may be dug up again, perhaps he thought this new expreſſion of "ſending it up to God, or the Good Spirit," a much ſtronger emblem of the permanency and ſtedfaſtneſs of the peace now to be made.</note> to diſpoſe of as he pleaſes; by which means we hope never to ſee it more. And now brother, we beg leave that you who are a warrior, will take hold of this chain (giving a ſtring) of friendſhip, and receive it from us, who are alſo warriors, and let us think no more of war, in pity to our old men, women and children</q>—Intimating, by this laſt expreſſion, that it was mere compaſſion to them, and not inability to fight, that made their nation deſire peace.</p>
            <p>HE then produced a treaty held with the government of Pennſylvania 1701, and three meſſages or letters from that government of different dates; and concluded thus.—</p>
            <p>
               <q>Now Brother, I beg WE who are warriors may forget our diſputes, and renew the friendſhip which appears by theſe papers to have ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our fathers.</q>—He promiſed, in behalf of the reſt of their nation, who were gone to a great diſtance to hunt, and could not have notice to attend the treaty, that they ſhould certainly come to Fort-Pitt in the ſpring, and bring the remainder of the priſoners with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:010167_0025_0F7D44C035D93F70"/>AS the ſeaſon was far advanced, and the Colonel could not ſtay long in theſe remote parts, he was obliged to reſt ſatisfied with the priſoners the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waneſe had brought; taking hoſtages, and laying them under the ſtrongeſt obligations, for the delivery of the reſt; knowing that no other effectual method could at preſent be purſued.</p>
            <p>HE expoſtulated with them on account of their paſt conduct, and told them—<q>that the ſpeech they had delivered would have been agreeable to him, if their actions had correſponded with their words. You have ſpoken, ſaid he, much of peace, but have neglected to comply with the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, upon which you can obtain it. Keiſſinautchtha, one of your chiefs, met me a month ago at Tuſcarawas, and accepted the ſame terms of peace for your nation, that were preſcribed to the Senecas and Delawares; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing in ten days from that time to meet me here with all your priſoners— After waiting for you till now, you are come at laſt, only with a part of them, and propoſe putting off the delivery of the reſt till the ſpring—What right have you to expect different terms from thoſe granted to the Delawares &amp;c. who have given me entire ſatisfaction by their ready ſubmiſſion to every thing required of them?—But I will cut this matter ſhort with you; and before I explain myſelf further, I inſiſt on your immediate anſwer to the following queſtions.—</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <q>Will you forthwith collect and deliver up all the priſoners yet in your poſſeſſion, and the French living among you, with all the Negroes you have taken from us in this or any other war; and that without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or evaſion whatſoever?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2d. <q>Will you deliver ſix hoſtages into my hands as a ſecurity for your punctual performance of the above article, and that your nations ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no farther hoſtilities againſt the perſons or property of his majeſty's ſubjects?</q>
            </p>
            <p>BENEVISSICO replyed that <q>they agreed to give the hoſtages required, and ſaid that he himſelf would immediately return to their lower towns and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010167_0026_0F7D44C1CE5BD7A0"/>
all our fleſh and blood that remained among them, and that we ſhould ſee them at Fort-Pitt <note n="*" place="bottom">It will appear, by the poſtſcript to this account, that the Shawaneſe have fulfilled this engagement.</note> as ſoon as poſſible.—That, as to the French, they had no power over them. They were ſubjects to the king of England. We might do with them what we pleaſed; tho' he believed they were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned before this time to their own country—</q>
            </p>
            <p>THEY then delivered their hoſtages, and the Colonel told them <q>that tho' he had brought a Tomahawk in his hand, yet as they had now ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he would not let it fall on their heads, but let it drop to the ground, no more to be ſeen. He exhorted them to exerciſe kindneſs to the captives, and look upon them now as brothers and no longer priſoners; adding that he intended to ſend ſome of their relations along with the Indians, to ſee their friends collected and brought to Fort-Pitt. He promiſed to give them letters to Sir William Johnſon, to facilitate a final peace, and deſired them to be ſtrong in performing every thing ſtipulated.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Caughnawagas, the Delawares and Senecas, ſeverally addreſſed the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waneſe, as grand children and nephews, <q>to perform their promiſes, and to be ſtrong in doing good, that this peace might be everlaſting.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND here I am to enter on a ſcene, reſerved on purpoſe for this place, that the thread of the foregoing narrative might not be interrupted—a ſcene, which language indeed can but weakly deſcribe; and to which the Poet or Painter might have repaired to enrich their higheſt colorings of the variety of human paſſions; the Philoſopher to find ample ſubject for his moſt ſerious reflections; and the Man to exerciſe all the tender and ſympathetic feelings of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>THE ſcene, I mean, was the arrival of the priſoners in the camp; where were to be ſeen fathers and mothers recognizing and claſping their once-loſt babes; huſbands hanging round the necks of their newly-recovered wives; ſiſters and brothers unexpectedly meeting together after long ſeparation, ſcarce able to ſpeak the ſame language, or, for ſome time, to be ſure that they were children of the ſame parents! In all theſe interviews, joy and rapture inexpreſſible were
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010167_0027_0F7D44C281F01418"/>
ſeen, while feelings of a very different nature were painted in the looks of others;—flying from place to place in eager enquiries after relatives not found! trembling to receive an anſwer to their queſtions! diſtracted with doubts, hopes and fears, on obtaining no account of thoſe they ſought for! or ſtiffened into living monuments of horror and woe, on learning their unhappy fate!</p>
            <p>THE Indians too, as if wholly forgetting their uſual ſavageneſs, bore a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part in heightning this moſt affecting ſcene. They delivered up their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved captives with the utmoſt reluctance; ſhed torrents of tears over them, recommending them to the care and protection of the commanding officer. Their regard to them continued all the time they remained in camp. They viſited them from day to day; and brought them what corn, ſkins, horſes and other matters, they had beſtowed on them, while in their families; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with other preſents, and all the marks of the moſt ſincere and tender affection. Nay, they did not ſtop here, but, when the army marched, ſome of the Indians ſollicited and obtained leave to accompany their former captives all the way to Fort-Pitt, and employed themſelves in hunting and bringing proviſions for them on the road. A young Mingo carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ſtill further, and gave an inſtance of love which would make a figure even in romance. A young woman of Virginia was among the captives, to whom he had form'd ſo ſtrong an attachment, as to call her his wife. Againſt all remonſtrances of the imminent danger to which he expoſed himſelf by approaching to the frontiers, he perſiſted in following her, at the riſk of being killed by the ſurviving relations of many unfortunate perſons, who had been captivated or ſcalped by thoſe of his nation.</p>
            <p>THOSE qualities in ſavages challenge our juſt eſteem. They ſhould make us charitably conſider their barbarities as the effects of wrong education, and falſe notions of bravery and heroiſm; while we ſhould look on their virtues as ſure marks that nature has made them fit ſubjects of cultivation as well as us; and that we are called by our ſuperior advantages to yield them all the helps we can in this way. Cruel and unmerciful as they are, by habit and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in war, yet whenever they come to give way to the native dictates of humanity, they exerciſe virtues which Chriſtians need not bluſh to imitate.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010167_0028_0F7D44C331EABF60"/>
When they once determine to give life, they give every thing with it, which, in their apprehenſion, belongs to it. From every enquiry that has been made, it appears—that no woman thus ſaved is preſerved from baſe motives, or need fear the violation of her honor. No child is otherwiſe treated by the perſons adopting it than the children of their own body. The perpetual ſlavery of thoſe captivated in war, is a notion which even their barbarity has not yet ſuggeſted to them. Every captive whom their affection, their caprice, or whatever elſe, leads them to be, is ſoon incorporated with them, and fares alike with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>THESE inſtances of Indian tenderneſs and humanity were thought worthy of particular notice. The like inſtances among our own people will not ſeem ſtrange; and therefore I ſhall only mention one, out of a multitude that might be given on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>AMONG the captives, a woman was brought into the camp at Muſkingham, with a babe about three months old at her breaſt. One of the Virginia-volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers ſoon knew her to be his wife, who had been taken by the Indians about ſix months before. She was immediately delivered to her overjoyed huſband. He flew with her to his tent, and cloathed her and his child in proper apparel. But their joy, after the firſt tranſports, was ſoon damped by the reflection that another dear child of about two years old, captivated with the mother, and ſeparated from her, was ſtill miſſing, although many children had been brought in.</p>
            <p>A FEW days afterwards, a number of other priſoners were brought to the camp, among whom were ſeveral more children, The woman was ſent for, and one, ſuppoſed to be hers, was produced to her At firſt ſight ſhe was uncertain, but viewing the child with great earneſtneſs, ſhe ſoon recollected its features; and was ſo overcome with joy, that literally forgetting her ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing child ſhe dropt it from her arms, and catching up the new found child in an extaſy, preſſed it to her breaſt, and burſting into tears carried it off, unable to ſpeak for joy. The father ſeizing up the babe ſhe had let fall, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her in no leſs tranſport and affection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:010167_0029_0F7D44C4149ED2E8"/>AMONG the children who had been carried off young, and had long lived with the Indians, it is not to be expected that any marks of joy would appear on being reſtored to their parents or relatives. Having been accuſtomed to look upon the Indians as the only connexions they had, having been tenderly treated by them, and ſpeaking their language, it is no wonder that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered their new ſtate in the light of a captivity, and parted from the ſavages with tears.</p>
            <p>BUT it muſt not be denied that there were even ſome grown perſons who ſhewed an unwillingneſs to return. The Shawaneſe were obliged to bind ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their priſoners and force them along to the camp; and ſome women, who had been delivered up, afterwards found means to eſcape and run back to the Indian towns. Some, who could not make their eſcape, clung to their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage acquaintance at parting, and continued many days in bitter lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even refuſing ſuſtenance.</p>
            <p>FOR the honor of humanity, we would ſuppoſe thoſe perſons to have been of the loweſt rank, either bred up in ignorance and diſtreſſing penury, or who had lived ſo long with the Indians as to forget all their former connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions. For, eaſy and unconſtrained as the ſavage life is, certainly it could never be put in competiton with the bleſſings of improved life and the light of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by any perſons who have had the happineſs of enjoying, and the capacity of diſcerning, them.</p>
            <p>EVERY thing being now ſettled with the Indians, the army decamped on Sunday 18th November, and marched for Fort-Pitt, where it arrived on the 28th. The regular troops were immediately ſent to garriſon the different poſts on the communication, and the provincial troops, with the captives, to their ſeveral provinces. Here ended this expedition, in which it is remarkable that, notwithſtanding the many difficulties attending it, the troops were never in want of any neceſſaries; continuing perfectly healthy during the whole cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign; in which no life was loſt, except the man mentioned to have been kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Muſkingham.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:010167_0030_0F7D44C4C07A48B0"/>IN the beginning of January 1765, Colonel Bouquet arrived at Philadelphia, receiving, wherever he came, every poſſible mark of gratitude and eſteem from the people in general; and particularly from the overjoyed relations of the captives, whom he had ſo happily, and without bloodſhed, reſtored to their country and friends. Nor was the legiſlative part of the provinces leſs ſenſible of his important ſervices. The aſſembly of Pennſylvania, at their firſt ſitting, unanimouſly voted him the following addreſs.</p>

                  <p>GRATITUDE as well as juſtice demand of me to acknowledge, that the aids granted by the legiſlature of this province, and the conſtant aſſiſtance and ſupport afforded me by the honourable the Governor and Commiſſioners in the late expedition, have enabled me to recover ſo many of his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſubjects from a cruel captivity, and be the happy inſtrument of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring them to freedom and liberty: To you therefore, gentlemen, is the greater ſhare of that merit due, which you are generouſly pleaſed on this occaſion to impute to my ſervices.</p>

            <p>SOON afterwards the Colonel received a very polite and affectionate letter from Governor Fauquier, dated 25th of December, encloſing Reſolves of the honorable members of his Majeſty's Council, and of the houſe of Burgeſſes, for the colony and dominion of Virginia.</p>
            <p>THOSE reſpectable bodies unanimouſly returned their thanks to him for the activity, ſpirit and zeal, with which he had reduced the Indians to terms of peace, and compelled thoſe ſavages to deliver up ſo many of his Majeſty's ſubjects whom they had in captivity. They further requeſted the Governor to recommend him to his Majeſty's miniſters, as an officer of diſtinguiſhed merit, in this and every former ſervice in which he has been engaged.</p>
            <p>THE Colonel, in his anſwer, acknowledged the ready aſſiſtance and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance which he had always received from the Governor and colony of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia in carrying on the King's ſervice; and mentioned his particular obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to Col. LEWIS, for his zeal and good conduct during the campaign.</p>
            <p>THE honors thus beſtowed on him, his own modeſty made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of transfering to the officers and army under his command; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the mutual confidence and harmony ſubſiſting between him and them,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010167_0033_0F7D44C6F1983678"/>
highly redound to the reputation of both. He has taken every occaſion of doing juſtice to the particular merit of Col. REID who was ſecond in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and alſo to all the officers who ſerved in the expedition, regulars as well as <note n="*" place="bottom">The Pennſylvania troops were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Francis, and Lieutenant Colonel Clayton.</note> provincials.</p>
            <p>THE reader will obſerve that the public bodies who preſented theſe addreſſes to the Colonel, not only wiſhed to expreſs their own gratitude, but likewiſe to be inſtrumental in recommending him to the advancement his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices merited. And ſurely it is a happy circumſtance to obtain promotion, not only unenvied, but even with the general approbation and good wiſhes of the public. It ought, however, to be mentioned, that on the firſt account his Majeſty received of this expedition, and long before thoſe teſtimonies could reach England, he was graciouſly pleaſed, of his own royal goodneſs and as a reward of the Colonel's merit, to promote him to the rank of BRIGADIER GENERAL, and to the command of the ſouthern diſtrict of America. And as he is rendered as dear, by his private virtues, to thoſe who have the honour of his more intimate acquaintance, as he is by his military ſervices to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, it is hoped he may long continue among us; where his experienced abilities will enable him, and his love of the Engliſh conſtitution entitle him, to fill any future truſt to which his Majeſty may be pleaſed to call him.—</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was mentioned in the 25th page of this account, that the Shawaneſe brought only a part of their priſoners with them to Col. Bouquet at Muſkingham, in November laſt; and that, as the ſeaſon was far advanced, he was obliged to reſt ſatisfied with taking hoſtages for the delivery of the remainder at Fort-Pitt, in the enſuing ſpring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:010167_0034_0F7D44C7B7D73250"/>THE eſcape of thoſe hoſtages ſoon afterwards, as well as the former equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal conduct of their nation, had given reaſon to doubt the ſincerity of their intentions with reſpect to the performance of their promiſes, But we have the ſatisfaction to find that they punctually have fulfilled them. Ten of their chiefs, and about 50 of their warriors, attended with many of their women and children, met GEORGE CROGHAN, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> deputy agent to Sir WILLIAM JOHNSON, at Fort-Pitt the 9th of laſt May; together with a large body of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawares, Senecas, Sanduſky and Munſy Indians; where they delivered the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their priſoners, brightened the chain of friendſhip, and gave every aſſurance of their firm intentions to preſerve the Peace inviolable for ever.</p>
            <p>THERE is ſomething remarkable in the appellation they gave to the Engliſh on this occaſion; calling them Fathers inſtead of Brethren.</p>
            <p>LAWAUGHQUA, the Shawaneſe ſpeaker, delivered himſelf in the following terms.—</p>
            <q>
               <p>FATHERS, for ſo we will call you henceforward; liſten to what we are going to ſay to you.</p>
               <p>IT gave us great pleaſure yeſterday to be called the children of the great King of England; and convinces us your intentions towards us are upright, as we know a Father will be tender of his children, and they are more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to obey him than a Brother. Therefore we hope our Father will now take better care of his children, than has heretofore been done.—</p>
               <p>YOU put us in mind of our promiſe to Col. Bouquet; which was to bring your fleſh and blood to be delivered at this place. FATHER, you have not ſpoke in vain—you ſee we have brought them with us,—except a few that were out with our hunting parties, which will be brought here as ſoon as they return.</p>
               <p>THEY have been all united to us by adoption; and altho' we now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them up to you, we will always look upon them as our relations, whenever the Great Spirit is pleaſed that we may viſit them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:010167_0035_0F7D44C86F67A2A8"/>FATHER, We have taken as much care of them, as if they were our own fleſh and blood. They are now become unacquainted with your cuſtoms and manners; and therefore, we requeſt you will uſe them tenderly and kindly, which will induce them to live contentedly with you.</p>
               <p>HERE is a belt with the figure of our Father the King of Great-Britain at one end, and the Chief of our nation at the other. It repreſents them holding the chain of friendſhip; and we hope neither ſide will ſlip their hands from it, ſo long as the Sun and Moon give light.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THE reader will further remember that one of the engagements which the different Indian Tribes entered into with Colonel Bouquet, was to ſend de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to conclude a peace with Sir WILLIAM JOHNSON. This has alſo been punctually fulfilled; and we are aſſured that Sir WILLIAM <q>has finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his congreſs greatly to his ſatisfaction, and even beyond his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q> Thus every good conſequence has enſued from this important expedition, which our fondeſt wiſhes could have induced us to expect from the known valor and ſpirit of the able Commander who had the conduct of it; and we now have the pleaſure once more to behold the temple of JANUS ſhut, in this weſtern world!</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE long continued ravages of the Indians on the frontiers of the Britiſh colonies in America, and the fatal overthrows which they have ſometimes given our beſt diſciplined troops, eſpecially in the beginning of the late war, have rendered them an object of our conſideration, even in their military capacity. And as but few officers, who may be employed againſt them, can have opportunities to obſerve the true cauſes of their advantages over European troops in the woods, it is with the utmoſt pleaſure that I now proceed to lay before the public the following valuable papers, which I mentioned <note n="*" place="bottom">See the introduction.</note> to have been communicated to me by an officer of great abilities and long experience, in our wars with the Indians.</p>
            <p>AS ſcarce any thing has yet been publiſhed on a ſubject now become of the higheſt importance <note n="§" place="bottom">It will appear by the account of Indian tribes and towns annexed to theſe papers, that the enemies we have to deal with are neither contemptible in numbers of ſtrength.</note> to our colonies, theſe papers will undoubtedly be an acceptable preſent to the reader; and the remarks contained in them may be more and more improved by the future care and attention of able men, till perhaps a compleat ſyſtem is at length formed for the conduct of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſpecies of war.</p>

               <head>SECTION I. OF THE TEMPER AND GENIUS OF THE INDIANS.</head>
               <p>THE love of liberty is innate in the ſavage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeems the ruling paſſion of the ſtate of nature. His deſires and wants being few are eaſily gratified, and leave him much time to ſpare, which he would ſpend in idleneſs, if hunger did not force him to hunt. That exerciſe makes him ſtrong, active and bold, raiſes his courage, and fits him for war, in which he uſes the ſame ſtratagems and cruelty as againſt the wild beaſts; making no ſcruple to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy treachery and perfidy to vanquiſh his enemy.</p>
               <p>JEALOUS of his independency and of his property, he will not ſuffer the leaſt encroachment on either; and upon the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion, fired with reſentment, he becomes an implacable enemy, and flies to arms to vindicate his right, or revenge an injury.</p>
               <p>THE advantages of theſe ſavages over civilized nations are both natural and acquired. They are tall and well limbed, remarkable for their activity, and have a peircing eye and quick ear, which are of great ſervice to them in the woods.</p>
               <p>LIKE beaſts of prey, they are patient, deceitful, and rendered by habit almoſt inſenſible to the common feelings of humanity. Their barbarous cuſtom of ſcalping their enemies, in the heat of action; the exquiſite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments often inflicted by them on thoſe reſerved for a more deliberate fate; their general ferocity of manners, and the ſucceſſes wherewith they have often been fluſh'd, have conſpired to render their name terrible, and ſome times to ſtrike a pannic even into our braveſt and beſt diſciplined troops.</p>
               <p>THEIR acquired advantages are, that they have been inured to bear the extremes of heat and cold; and from their infancy, in Winter and Summer, to plunge themſelves in cold ſtreams, and to go almoſt naked, expoſed to the ſcorching ſun or nipping froſts, till they arrive to the ſtate of manhood. Some of them deſtroy the ſenſation of the ſkin by ſcratching it with the ſhort and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010167_0038_0F7D44CAB006A998"/>
ſharp teeth of ſome animal, diſpoſed in the form of a curry-comb, which makes them regardleſs of briars and thorns in running thro' thickets. Rivers are no obſtacles to them in their wild excurſions. They either ſwim over, or croſs them on rafts or canoes, of an eaſy and ready conſtruction.</p>
               <p>IN their expeditions they live chiefly by hunting, or on wild fruits and roots, with which the woods ſupply them almoſt every where.</p>
               <p>THEY can bear hunger and thirſt for ſeveral days, without ſlackening, on that account, their perſeverance in any propoſed enterprize.</p>
               <p>BY conſtant practice in hunting, they learn to ſhoot with great ſkill, either with bows, or fire arms; and to ſteal unperceived upon their prey, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the tracts of men and beaſts, which would be imperceptible to an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean. They can run for a whole day without halting, when flying from an enemy, or when ſent on any meſſage. They ſteer, as if by inſtinct, thro' trackleſs woods, and with aſtoniſhing patience can lie whole days motionleſs in ambuſh to ſurprize an enemy, eſteeming no labour or perſeverance too painful to obtain their ends.</p>
               <p>THEY beſmear their bodies with Bear's greaſe, which defends them againſt rains and damps, as well as againſt the ſtings of Muſkitoes and Gnats. It likewiſe ſupples their limbs, and makes them as ſlippery as the antient Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, who could not be held faſt when ſeized in fight.</p>
               <p>PLAIN food, conſtant exerciſe, and living in the open air, preſerve them healthy and vigorous.</p>
               <p>THEY are powerfully excited to war by the cuſtom eſtabliſhed among them, of paying diſtinguiſhed honors to Warriors.</p>
               <p>THEY fight only when they think to have the advantage, but cannot be forced to it, being ſure by their ſpeed to elude the moſt eager purſuit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:010167_0039_0F7D44CB70192FC8"/>THEIR dreſs conſiſt of the ſkins of ſome wild beaſt, or a blanket, a ſhirt either of linen, or of dreſſed ſkins, a breech clout, leggins, reaching half way up the thigh, and faſtened to a belt, with mokawſons on their feet. They uſe no ligatures that might obſtruct the circulation of their blood, or agility of their limbs. They ſhave their head, reſerving only a ſmall tuft of hair on the top; and ſlit the outer part of the ears, to which, by weights, they give a circular form, extending it down to their ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>THEY adorn themſelves with ear and noſe rings, bracelets of ſilver and wampum, and paint their faces with various colours. When they prepare for an engagement they paint themſelves black, and ſight naked.</p>
               <p>THEIR arms are a ſuſil, or rifle, a powder horn, a ſhot pouch, a toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk, and a ſcalping knife hanging to their neck.</p>
               <p>WHEN they are in want of fire arms, they ſupply them by a bow, a ſpear, or a death hammer, which is a ſhort club made of hard wood.</p>
               <p>THEIR uſual utenſils are a kettle, a ſpoon, a looking glaſs, an awl, a ſteel to ſtrike fire, ſome paint, a pipe and tobacco pouch. For want of tobacco, they ſmoke ſome particular leaves, or the bark <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> willow; which is almoſt their continual occupation.</p>
               <p>THUS lightly equiped do the ſavages lie in wait to attack, at ſome difficult paſs, the European ſoldier, heavily accoutred, harraſſed by a tedious march, and encumbered with an unwieldy convoy.</p>
               <p>EXPERIENCE has convinced us that it is not our intereſt to be at war with them; but if after having tried all means to avoid it, they force us to it, (which in all probability will often happen) we ſhould endeavour to ſight them upon more equal terms, and regulate our Manoeuvres upon thoſe of the enemy we are to engage, and the nature of the country we are to act in.</p>
               <p>IT does not appear from our accounts of Indian wars, that the ſavages were as brave formerly as we have found them of late; which muſt be imputed
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:010167_0040_0F7D44CD0EE0DE50"/>
to their unexpected ſucceſſes againſt our troops on ſome occaſions, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in 1755; and from the little reſiſtance they have ſince met with from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs inhabitants.</p>
               <p>IT is certain that even at this day, they ſeldom expoſe their perſons to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and depend entirely upon their dexterity in concealing themſelves during an engagement, never appearing openly, unleſs they have ſtruck their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with terror, and have thereby rendered them incapable of defence.—From whence it may be inferred that, if they were beat two or three times, they would loſe that confidence inſpired by ſucceſs, and be leſs inclined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in wars which might end fatally for them. But this cannot reaſonably be expected, till we have troops trained to fight them in their own way, with the additional advantage of European courage and diſcipline.</p>
               <p>ANY deviation from our eſtabliſhed military ſyſtem would be needleſs, if valor, zeal, order and good conduct, were ſufficient to ſubdue this light-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemy. Theſe qualities are conſpicuous in our troops; but they are too heavy, and indeed too valuable, to be employed alone in a deſtructive ſervice for which they were never intended. They require the aſſiſtance of lighter corps, whoſe dreſs, arms and exerciſes, ſhould be adapted to this new kind of war.</p>
               <p>THIS opinion is ſupported by the example of many warlike nations, of which I beg leave to mention the following.</p>
               <p>THE learned <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Joannis Antonii Valtrini Lbr. de re milit. Vet. Rom.</note> Jeſuit who has obliged the world with a treatiſe on the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary affairs of the ancient Romans, tells us from <note n="§" place="bottom">Neque enim Romanis ſuperbia unquam obſtitit, quo minus aliena inſtituts, ſi modo proba fuiſſent, imitarentur, et quod ubique apud ſocios vel hoſtes idoneum vnum eſſet, cum ſtudio d<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mi exſequerentur—Aliaque ab aliis accepta, ipſi longe facere meliora quae quidem digna ſtatuiſſent.</note> Salluſt that this wiſe nation, our maſters in the art of war, were never hindered even by the pride of empire, from imitating any foreign maxim or inſtitution, provided it was good; and that they carefully adopted into their own practice whatever they found uſeful in that of their allies or enemies; ſo that by receiving ſome things from one, and ſome from another, they greatly improved a ſyſtem even originally excellent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:010167_0041_0F7D44CDDC84A4D8"/>THE defeat of Antony and Craſſus by the Parthians, of Curio by the Numidians, and many other inſtances, convinced the Romans that their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, who had conquered ſo many nations, were not fit to engage light-troops, which, harraſſing them continually, evaded all their endeavours to bring them to a cloſe engagement; and it is probable that if Julius Caeſar had not been aſſaſſinated, when he was preparing to march againſt the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, to wipe off the reproach of the former defeats, he would have added to his legions a greater number of light troops, formed upon the principles and method of that nation, and have left us uſeful leſſons for the conduct of a war againſt our ſavages.</p>
               <p>THAT he did not think the attack of irregular troops contemptible, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears clearly in ſeveral parts of his commentaries, and particularly in the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can war. The various embarraſments he met with from the enemy he had then to deal with, neceſſarily call to our mind many ſimilar circumſtances in the courſe of our wars with the Indians; and the pains he took to inſtruct his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to ſtand and repel the ſkirmiſhes of the nimble Africans, may furniſh inſtruction to us in our military operations againſt the ſavage Americans.</p>
               <p>WE are told that while Caeſar was on his march <q>to Scipio's <note n="*" place="bottom">

His legions forming themſelves, ſoon beat the enemy from the higher ground. And now think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſafe, he begins to purſue his march. But immediately the enemy break forth from the neighbouring hills; and the Numidians, with their
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010167_0042_0F7D44CE6D495A70"/>
light armed foot, who are wonderfully nimble, always mixing and keeping equal pace with the cavalry in charging or retiring, fall afreſh on the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man foot. Thus they frequently renewed the charge, and ſtill retired when he endeavoured to bring them to cloſe engagement. If but two or three of his veterans faced about and caſt their piles with vigor, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the enemy would fly, then returning rally again, making it their buſineſs to harraſs his march, and to preſs upon his rear, following at ſome diſtance and throwing their darts at the legions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>CAESAR, having ſo ſubtil an enemy to deal with, inſtructed his ſoldiers, not like a general who had been victorious in the moſt arduous exploits, but as a <note n="‡" place="bottom">Laniſta, in Latin, is an inſtructor of gladiators, which in Engliſh can only be tranſlated a "Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-maſter."</note> Fencing-Maſter would inſtruct his ſcholars; teaching them with what pace to retreat from the enemy, and how to return to the charge; how far to advance, and how far to retire; and likewiſe in what place and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to caſt their piles. For their light-armed infantry gave him the greateſt uneaſineſs, deterring his troopers from meeting them, by killing their horſes with their javelins, and wearying his legions by their ſwiftneſs. For whenever his heavy-armed foot faced about, and endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn their charge, they quickly avoided the danger by flight.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT without going back to the ancients, we have ſeen this maxim adopted in our days. Marſhal de Saxe finding the French army harraſſed by the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars and other Auſtrian light troops, formed alſo ſeveral corps of them of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds; and the king of Pruſſia in his firſt war introduced them into his army, and has augmented and employed them ever ſince with ſucceſs. We have ourſelves made uſe of them in the two laſt wars in Europe: but the light troops wanted in America muſt be trained upon different principles. The enemies we have to deal with, are infinitely more active and dangerous than the Huſſars and Pandours; or even the Africans abovementioned. For the American ſavages, after their rapid incurſions, retreat to their towns, at a great diſtance from our ſettlements, through thickety woods almoſt impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010167_0043_0F7D44D48D7144D8"/>
to our heavy and unwieldy corps, compoſed of ſoldiers loaded with cloathes, baggage and proviſions, who, when fatigued by a long march, muſt be a very unequal match to engage the nimble ſavage in woods, which are his native element.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER unavoidable incumbrance in our expeditions, ariſes from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and baggage of the army, for which a road muſt be opened, and bridges thrown over rivers and ſwamps. This creates great labour, retards and weakens the line of march, and keeps the troops tied to a convoy which they cannot loſe ſight of, without expoſing it to become a prey to a vigilant enemy, continually hovering about to ſeize every advantage.</p>
               <p>AN European, to be a proper judge of this kind of war, muſt have lived ſometime in the vaſt foreſts of America; otherwiſe he will hardly be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a continuity of woods without end. In ſpite of his endeavours, his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination will betray him into an expectation of open and clear grounds, and he will be apt to calculate his Manoeuvres accordingly, too much upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of war in Europe.</p>
               <p>LET us ſuppoſe a perſon, who is entirely unacquainted with the nature of this ſervice, to be put at the head of an expedition in America. We will further ſuppoſe that he has made the diſpoſitions uſual in Europe for a march, or to receive an enemy; and that he is then attacked by the ſavages. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover them, tho' from every tree, log or buſh, he receives an inceſſant fire, and obſerves that few of their ſhot are loſt. He will not heſitate to charge thoſe inviſible enemies, but he will charge in vain. For they are as cautious to avoid a cloſe engagement, as indefatigable in harraſſing his troops; and notwithſtanding all his endeavours, he will ſtill find himſelf ſurrounded by a circle of fire, which like an artificial horizon follows him every where.</p>
               <p>UNABLE to rid himſelf of an enemy who never ſtands his attacks, and flies when preſſed, only to return upon him again with equal agility and vigor; he will ſee the courage of his heavy troops droop, and their ſtrength at laſt fail them by repeated and ineffectual efforts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:010167_0044_0F7D44D697199EB8"/>HE muſt therefore think of a retreat, unleſs he can force his way through the enemy. But how is this to be effected? his baggage and proviſions are unloaded and ſcattered, part of his horſes and drivers killed, others diſperſed by fear, and his wounded to be carried by ſoldiers already fainting under the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of a long action. The enemy encouraged by his diſtreſs will not fail to encreaſe the diſorder, by preſſing upon him on every ſide, with redoubled fury and ſavage howlings.</p>
               <p>HE will probably form a circle or a ſquare, to keep off ſo daring an enemy, ready at the leaſt opening to fall upon him with the deſtructive Tomahawk: but theſe diſpoſitions, tho' a tolerable ſhift for defence, are neither proper for an attack, nor a march thro' the woods—</p>
               <p>THIS is not an imaginary ſuppoſition, but the true ſtate of an engagement with the Indians, experienced by the troops who have fought againſt them. Neither is there any thing new or extraordinary in this way of fighting, which ſeems to have been common to moſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Caeſ. comm. lib. V de bello Gallico, et lib. II de bello Civili.</note> Barbarians.</p>
               <p>WHAT is then to be done to extricate our little army from impending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>
               <p>THIS is a problem which I do not pretend to reſolve. But as every man would, in ſimilar circumſtances, determine himſelf ſome way or other, I will propoſe my own ſentiments, founded upon ſome obſervations which I believe invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all engagements with ſavages.</p>
               <p>THE firſt, that their general maxim is to ſurround their enemy.</p>
               <p>THE ſecond, that they fight ſcattered, and never in a compact body.</p>
               <p>The third, that they never ſtand their ground when attacked, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately give way, to return to the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:010167_0045_0F7D44D6DF2AED78"/>Theſe principles being admitted, it follows—</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. That the troops deſtined to engage Indians, muſt be lightly cloathed, armed, and accoutred.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. That having no reſiſtance to encounter in the attack or defence, they are not to be drawn up in cloſe order, which would only expoſe them without neceſſity to a greater loſs.</p>
               <p>AND laſtly, that all their evolutions muſt be performed with great rapidity; and the men enabled by exerciſe to purſue the enemy cloſely, when put to flight, and not give them time to rally.</p>
               <p>THESE remarks will explain the reaſons of the alterations propoſed in the formation of a corps of troops, for the ſervice of the woods. It is not, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to be expected that this method will remove all obſtacles, or that thoſe light troops can equal the ſavages in patience, and activity; but, with diſcipline and practice, they may in a great meaſure ſupply the want of theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and by keeping the enemy at a diſtance afford great relief and ſecurity to the main body.</p>

               <p>I ſhall only venture a few notions ſuggeſted by experience upon this ſubject, chiefly with a view to recommend it to the conſideration of perſons capable of propoſing a proper method of forming ſuch an eſtabliſhment: and in order to be better underſtood, I will ſuppoſe a corps of 500 men to be raiſed and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined for the woods, beſides two troops of light horſe, to which a company of artificers might be added. The fitteſt men for that ſervice would be the natives of America bred upon the frontiers, and inliſted between the age of 15 and 20 years, to be diſcharged between 30 and 35.</p>

                  <head>CLOATHING.</head>
                  <p>THE cloathing of a ſoldier for the campaign might conſiſt of a ſhort coat of brown cloth, lappelled, and without plaits; a ſtrong tanned ſhirt, ſhort trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, leggins, mokawſons or ſhoe packs, a ſailors hat, a blanket, a knapſack for proviſions, and oiled <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>The following Watch-coat was contrived by an officer, whoſe name I do not remember. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the oiled linnen to be put under the hat, a cap might perhaps anſwer better. He writes as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, viz.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>As the Indian war will require frequent incurſions into a wild country, where a man ſick or wounded, is in ſeveral reſpects more detrimental to the ſervice than a man killed, every thing that may contribute to the health of the men is of moment.</p>
                           <p>In this view, I propoſe a ſort of ſurtout, to preſerve men in a great meaſure both from wet and cold.</p>
                           <p>Take a large checked ſhirt, of about half a crown ſterling per yard, for it ſhould be pretty fine; cut off the wriſt-bands, and continue the opening of the breaſt down to the bottom; ſew up the ſide; from the guſſets downwards; rip out the gathers in the fore parts of the collar as far as the ſhoulder ſtraps, and reſew it plain to the collar.</p>
                           <p>The ſhirt will then become a ſort of watch coat like a bed gown, with very wide ſleeves.</p>
                           <p>Take a quantity of linſeed oil, and boil it gently till one half is diminiſhed, to which put a ſmall quantity of litharge of gold, and when it is well incorporated with the oil, lay it on with a bruſh upon the watch-coat, ſo that it ſhall be every where equally wet.</p>
                           <p>I ſuppoſe the watch coat, hung in a garret, or other covered place, and ſo ſuſpended by crooked pins and packthreads in the extremities of the ſleeves and edges of the collar, that one part ſhall not touch another. In a ſhort time, if the weather is good, it will be dry; when a ſecond mixture of the ſame kind ſhould be laid on with a bruſh as before. When the ſecond coat of painting is dry, the greaſe will not come off and the ſurtout is an effectual preſervative from rain; it is very light to carry, and being pretty full on the back, will not only keep the man dry, but alſo his pack and ammunition.</p>
                           <p>The ſleves are left long and wide, to receive the but end of a firelock (ſecured) and to cover it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the lock. The coat is double breaſted to be lapped over, according to which ſide the rain drives. A man will be kept dry by one of theſe ſurtouts as far as the knees. If, from the vicinity of the enemy, it is improper to make fires at night, he may place his pack on a ſtone, and ſitting upon it, change his ſhoes and leggins, and, if he pleaſes, wrap his blanket round his legs and feet, then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the watchcoat cloſe to his body, it will keep him warm, as no air can paſs through it, and, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the trunk of a tree, he may paſs a tolerable night, both warm and dry.</p>
                           <p>It would be of ſervice to have a ſmall piece of the ſame oiled linnen to put under the hat or cap to carry the rain down to the watchcoat or ſurtout, otherwiſe whatever wet ſoaks through the hat or cap, will run down the neck, and thereby in ſome meaſure defeat the deſign of the watchcoat.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps it might be uſeful to mix ſome dark or greeniſh colour with the oil of the ſecond coating, to make the watchcoat leſs remarkable in the woods.</p>
                        </q>
                     </note> ſurtout againſt the rain. To this might be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in winter quarters or time of peace, three white ſhirts and ſtocks, with a flannel waiſtcoat.</p>

                  <p>I ſaid that to compleat this eſtabliſhment they ſhould have two troops of light horſe, ſuppoſed of 50 men each, officers included. The men are to perform the ſame exerciſes as the foot, and afterwards be taught to ride, and particularly to be very alert at mounting and diſmounting with their arms in their hands, to gallop through the woods up and down hills, and leap over logs and ditches.</p>
                  <p>THE horſes ought to be bought up on the frontiers, where they are bred and uſed to feed in the woods, and are ſtrong and hardy. They are to be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke, made to ſtand fire, to ſwim over rivers, &amp;c. their ſaddles and accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements very ſimple ſtrong and light. The number of horſes might be reduced to one half, in time of peace, tho' they would be of little expence, as they might be bred and maintained without charge in the military ſettlement. This corps ſhould be equiped as the foot, having only a ſhort rifle in lieu of a fuſil, and a battle ax with a long handle, the only ſort of arms they ſhould make uſe of in the charge.</p>
                  <p>EVERY light horſe man ought to be provided with a Blood-hound, which would be uſeful to find out the enemies ambuſhes, and to follow their tracts; they would ſeize the naked ſavages, or at leaſt give time to the horſe men to come up with them; they would add to the ſafety of the camp at night by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering any attempt to ſurpriſe it.</p>

                  <p>THE military exerciſes muſt ſtill be kept up and practiſed, and great care taken to inculcate and preſerve purity of manners, obedience, order and decency among the men, which will be found much eaſier in the woods than in the neighbourhood of towns.</p>

I may ſafely anſwer for all thoſe who have been employed in that ſervice, that they would prefer them to double the number of the beſt European troops. And when they had ſerved the time limited, namely from their 15th to their 35th year, what vaſt ſatisfaction would it be to pay over to them their ſhare of ſavings from the publick cheſt; and, as a reward of their faithful toils, to veſt them and their heirs with their ſeveral plantations, which they would now be enabled to cultivate as their own? This proſpect would engage many people to enter their ſons, in ſuch corps; and thoſe veterans, when thus diſcharged, would not only be the means of forming and animating others by their example, but in caſe of a war would

                  <p>THIS method would not be as expeditious as the carriage by horſes, and would require more time and attention in cutting the road, and bridging the ſwampy places  but, on the other hand, what an expence would be ſaved! and by killing the oxen in proportion as the flour is uſed, and abandoning the carts, the convoy is daily reduced, and the graſs near the encampment will not be ſo ſoon conſumed, which is not the caſe with horſes, which muſt equally be ſed though unloaded. This is an object of conſequence, particularly near the end of the campaign, when the ſcarcity of fodder obliges to move the camps every day, and to place them in low and diſadvantageous grounds.</p>
                  <p>I WOULD therefore incline for the uſe of carts, and they could be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand by the hunters and their artificers.</p>
                  <p>THE oxen ſhould be bought in the provinces where the farmers make uſe of them in their works. One or two ſoldiers would drive the cart and take charge of the four oxen.</p>

                     <pb n="55" facs="unknown:010167_0054_0F7D44DD71C4D840"/>THERE are few rivers in North-America deep in ſummer, and which theſe carts with high and broad wheels could not ford; but if the contrary ſhould happen, the carts, proviſions and baggage, may be rafted over, or a bridge built. In a country full of timber, and with troops accuſtomed to work, no river will ſtop an army for a long time.</p>
                  <p>BY the above method, 3 or 400 horſes would be ſufficient to carry the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage ammunition, tents, tools &amp;c.</p>

Before the army lay down their arms, the ground is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connoitred, and the guards poſted, who will immediately open a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from one to the other, to relieve the centries, and facilitate the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of rounds.</p>

The hunters take poſt on the moſt advantageous ground on the out ſide, and ſkirmiſh with the enemy, till the ſquare is form'd; when, upon receiving their orders, they retire within the ſquare, where they take their poſt as in Fig. (3)</p>

                     <p>THE eight platoons at the angles are of the ſecond Firing, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the form of the ſquare during the attack.</p>
                     <p>IT is evident that, by this diſpoſition, the convoy is well cover'd, and the light troops, deſtined for the charge, remain concealed; and as all unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed events during an engagement are apt to ſtrike terror, and create confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, among the enemy, it is natural to expect that the ſavages will be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſconcerted at the ſudden and unforeſeen eruption, that will ſoon pour upon them from the inſide of the ſquare; and that, being vigorouſly attacked in front and flank at the ſame time, they will neither be able to reſiſt, nor, when once broke, have time to rally, ſo as to make another ſtand.

The intervals of the two columns who attack in the front, and of thoſe who attack in the rear, will be cloſed by the little parties of rangers (5) poſted at the angles of the ſquare, each attack forming in that manner, three ſides of a parrallelogram. In that order they run to the enemy (X) and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced their way through their circle, fall upon their flanks; by wheeling to their right and left, and charging with impetuoſity. The moment they take the enemy in flank, the Firſt Firing of the regular troops march out briſkly and attack the enemy in front.

            <head>APPENDIX I. CONSTRUCTION OF FORTS AGAINST INDIANS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S we have not to guard here againſt cannon, the ſyſtem of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean fortifications may be laid aſide, as expenſive, and not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the purpoſe. Forts againſt Indians, being commonly remote from our ſettlements, require a great deal of room to lodge a ſufficient quantity of ſtores and proviſions, and at the ſame time ought to be defenſible with one half of their compleat garriſons, in caſe of detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or convoys.</p>
            <p>I am therefore of opinion that a ſquare or pentagon, with a block-houſe of brick or ſtone <note n="*" place="bottom">Experience has demonſtrated that fortifications made of wood decay very ſoon, and are on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of conſiderable expence.</note> at every angle, joined by a wall flanked by the block-houſes, would be the beſt defence againſt ſuch enemies. A ditch from ſeven to eight feet deep might be added, with loop holes in the cellars of the block-houſes ſix feet from the ground, to defend the ditch.</p>
            <p>ALONG the inſide of the curtains the traders might build houſes and ſtores, covered as well as the block-houſes with tiles, or ſlate, to guard againſt fire arrows. There will remain a ſpacious area for free air and uſe, in which as well as in the ditch, gardens might be made and wells dug.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:010167_0060_0F7D44EC255432B8"/>THE powder magazines might be placed in the center of the area, keeping only a ſmall quantity of cartridges in each block-houſe for preſent uſe.</p>
            <p>THE garriſons of ſuch forts would be free from ſurpriſes, even if they had no centries, for nothing can get at them, while the doors are well bolted and barred.</p>
            <div type="reasons">
               <head>SOME REASONS FOR KEEPING POSSESSION OF OUR LARGE FORTS IN THE INDIAN COUNTRY.</head>
               <p>AS theſe forts have been one of the cauſes of the laſt war and area great eye-ſore to the ſavages, they have bent their chief efforts againſt them; and therefore, while thus employed, they have been leſs able to diſtreſs our ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Our forts keep the Indian towns at a great diſtance from us. Fort-Pitt has effectually driven them beyond the Ohio, and made them remove their ſettlements at leaſt 60 miles further weſtward. Was it not for theſe forts, they would ſettle cloſe on our borders, and in time of war infeſt us every day in ſuch numbers as would over-power the thin inhabitants ſcattered on our extenſive frontier. The farmer unable to ſow or reap would ſoon fall back on our chief towns, or quit the country for want of bread. In either caſe, what would be the fate of the large towns burthened with the whole country, and depriv'd of ſubſiſtance and of the materials of trade and export?</p>
               <p>THE deſtruction of theſe forts being, in time of war, the chief aim of the ſavages, they gather about them to diſtreſs the garriſons, and to attack the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys; thereby giving us an opportunity to fight them in a body, and to ſtrike a heavy blow, which otherwiſe they would never put in our power, as their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage lies in ſurprizes, which are beſt effected by ſmall numbers. Experience has convinced them that it is not in their power to break thoſe ſhackles, and therefore it is not probable that they will renew the attempt; and our poſts will continue a check upon them, and ſave the difficulty and expence of taking poſt again in their country. Our ſorts are likewiſe the proper places for trade, which being cloſely inſpected, it will be eaſy for us to limit their
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:010167_0061_0F7D44E531B91870"/>
ſupplies, to ſuch commodities as they cannot turn againſt us, and to put a ſpeedy ſtop to all juſt cauſes of complaints, by giving immediate redreſs.</p>
               <p>A FEW forts, with ſtrong garriſons, I ſhould judge to be of more ſervice than a greater number weakly guarded. In the laſt war we loſt all our ſmall poſts: but our more conſiderable ones, Detroit and Fort-Pitt, reſiſted all the efforts of the ſavages, by the ſtrength of their garriſons.</p>

               <p>THE ſettlement of the Illinois being in 40 degrees of latitude, is 500 leagues from New-Orleans by water and 350 by land.</p>
               <p>THE moſt proper time of the year for going there, is the begining of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary. The waters of the Miſſiſippi are then high, and the country being overflowed, there is leſs to fear from the ſavages, who are hunting in that ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>THE encampments ſhould be on the left of the river, as the enemies are on the right, and cannot have a ſufficient number of crafts to croſs if their party is large.</p>
               <p>THEY generally attack at day-break, or at the time of embarking.</p>
               <p>THE inhabitants of the Illinois might bring proviſions half way, if they were allowed good pay.</p>

There are 52 iſlands between Fort-Pitt and the lower Shawaneſe Town on Scioto; and none of them difficult to paſs in the night, but one at the mouth of Muſkingham, occaſioned by a number of trees lying in the channel. From the lower Shawaneſe Town to the falls, there are but 8 or 9 iſlands. At the falls, the river is very broad, with only one paſſage on the eaſt ſide, in which there is water enough at all ſeaſons of the year to paſs without difficulty. Below the falls, the navigation is every way clear, down to the Miſſiſippi.</p>

               <p>The diſtance from this fort to the Ilinois, is 155 leagues by water. And it may be travelled by land in ſix days.</p>
               <p>THE nation of ſavages living at this poſt is called Pianquicha. It can furniſh 60 warriors.</p>

               <p>I compute that there are about 300 Negroes at the Ilinois.</p>
               <p>THE country of the Ilinois is fertile, producing good wheat and corn. All kinds of European fruits ſucceed there ſurprizingly well, and they have wild grapes with which they make tolerable wine. Their beer is pretty good.</p>
               <p>THERE are mines of lead, and ſome ſalt. They make ſugar of Maple, and there are ſtone quaries.</p>

            <p>N. B. THE places mentioned in the three firſt Routs are delineated in the foregoing map, by an officer who has an actual knowledge of moſt of them, and has long ſerved againſt the Indians. The fourth rout down the Ohio was given by an Indian trader, who has often paſſed from Fort-Pitt to the Falls; and the diſtances he gives of the mouths of the ſeveral rivers that fall into the Ohio may be pretty certainly depended on. Our maps hitherto publiſhed are very erroneous in placing ſome of thoſe rivers.</p>

            <p>THE above liſt conſiſts chiefly of ſuch Indians as the French were connected with in Canada and Louiſiana. Wherever we knew the names by which the different nations are diſtinguiſhed by the Engliſh, we have inſerted them. But the Orthography is yet very unſettled, and the ſeveral nations marked with an * Aſteriſm are unknown to us, and therefore they are left as they ſtand in the original liſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:010167_0069_0F7D44ED372A1200"/>So large a number of fighting men may ſtartle us at firſt ſight; but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſeems no where exaggerated, excepting only that the Catawba nation is now almoſt extinct. In ſome nations which we are acquainted with, the account falls even ſhort of their numbers; and ſome others do not appear to be mentioned at all, or at leaſt not by any name known to us.</p>
            <p>SUCH for inſtance are the Lower Creeks, of whom we have a liſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their towns. In this liſt their warriors or gunſmen are 1180, and their inhabitants about 6000. Thus a comparative judgment may be formed of the nations above-mentioned; the number of whole inhabitants will (in this proportion to their warriors, viz. 5 to 1) be about 283,000.</p>
