            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN it pleaſed the Lord to manifeſt the glorious diſpenſation of his bleſſed Son our Saviour, apoſtles were called and ſent forth in his ſervice; and many believed in his name.</p>
            <p>And in the early times of Chriſtianity, it was found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the apoſtles and believers to meet often together, for the comfort, conſolation and help, one of another; where, purſuant to the glorious deſign of the Goſpel, which breathes Peace on Earth, and Good Will towards men, love and charity greatly abounded; and a care aroſe for the eſtabliſhment and preſervation of the church, that all might be of one mind, and walk by the ſame rule, as became the followers of their holy Lord and Law-giver. And as this love and charity, the eſſence of pure and undefiled religion, was abode in, thoſe meetings were owned, and witneſſed to be times of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the holy Head of the Church.</p>
            <p>But in ſucceſſion of time, the ſimplicity and good purpoſes of thoſe meetings were greatly loſt, by reaſon of the declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and falling away of the profeſſed Chriſtian Churches; and a particular denomination of men, for worldly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ends, aſſuming an authority and exerciſing lordſhip over the flock. Yet after a long and dark night of apoſtacy, it pleaſed the Lord to bring many from under that darkneſs which had overſpread the profeſſors of the Chriſtian religion; and of latter days to gather a people more fully into a ſtate of Goſpel freedom, whereby our predeceſſors witneſſed the prevalence of that primitive Love and Good Will, and were led by Holy direction, to the eſtabliſhment of meetings for the like good purpoſes as in primitive times; and for the
<pb n="iv"
                   facs="unknown:037474_0003_100D12751D2CE710"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
more regular and orderly proceeding in thoſe ſo eſtabliſhed for the diſcipline of the Church, they are ſubordinate one to another, as preparative, conſiſting of friends belonging to one or more meetings for worſhip; monthly, conſiſting of ſo many preparatives as may conveniently compoſe the ſame; quarterly, conſiſting of ſo many monthly meetings as may be judged moſt ſuitable; yearly, conſiſting of ſo many quarterly meetings as may moſt uſefully meet together once a year, for the ſuperintending care and health of the body.</p>
            <p>And in order that theſe purpoſes may be more fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, the following rules and regulations are, on due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, recommended to the obſervance of friends, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers and meetings. And in the exerciſe of which, care, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion and gentle dealing, ought to be our practice, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in love and meekneſs, to bring ſuch as tranſgreſs to a ſenſe of their error. But if any, by our Chriſtian endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, cannot be reclaimed, the extent of our judgment and procedure is, the diſowning ſuch to be of our communion. And as this authority and practice is Chriſtian, ſo is it laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and reaſonable in ſociety: and as it is attended to, in uprightneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, will tend to promote the good and welfare of the Church, and to unite in a care and concern for the overſight one of another, that all may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to walk decently, humbly, and honeſtly, and be of one mind, as becomes the ſervants and followers of our Holy Lord and Law-giver, and to practiſe that commendable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ever neceſſary in the Chriſtian Church, agreeable to that injunction of our bleſſed Lord, Matt. xviii. 15, 16, 17. <q>Moreover, if thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:037474_0004_100D12774E406448"/>
mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; and if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man, and a publican.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo the expreſſions of that eminent apoſtle Paul, in his epiſtle to the Philippians, iv. 8. <q>Finally, brethren, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things.</q> Now, whatſoever appears in any contrary to theſe, may in general be ſaid to come under the notice of friends, overſeers, and meetings.</p>
            <p>And as it hath been experienced, that in thoſe meetings great comfort and ſatisfaction have been received and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, when the members have attended them in awe, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and love, with no other view than the honour of God, and the help and aſſiſtance one of another, this meeting doth, in brotherly love, exhort all friends carefully to gather in uprightneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, ſuitable to our calling, and the dignity of that Power which will preſide and govern in all our meetings, as we meekly abide under its holy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This will diveſt us of partiality and ſtiffneſs of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and all high thoughts of ourſelves, and lead into pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and condeſcenſion, according to that declaration of our bleſſed Lord, <q>He that is greateſt among you, ſhall be your ſervant.</q>

               <pb facs="unknown:037474_0005_100D127966593708"/>IT is to be obſerved, that the dates at the end of ſome of the minutes and advices denote the years in which they were iſſued by the yearly meeting.</p>

            <head>MEETINGS FOR WORSHIP.</head>
            <p>THAT all friends duly and ſeaſonably attend their meetings eſtabliſhed for the ſolemn purpoſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly performing true and acceptable worſhip to the Father of Spirits; and carefully avoid ſuffering any ſlight pretence or worldly buſineſs to occaſion our abſence from thoſe on the middle of the week; or on trivial occaſions leave our children and dependants behind, engaged in our domeſtic concerns; awfully keeping in remembrance, that the ſolemn enquiry will be made, <q>What haſt thou done with thoſe lambs committed to thy care.</q> Happy then for thoſe who feel the ſupporting evidence, that they have endeavoured in preference to all other concerns for their children, and thoſe placed under their care, to train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And when aſſembled, let us be diligent in waiting upon the Lord with fervent deſires, that we may be favoured with the enjoyment of his life-giving preſence; that ſo we may be preſerved from wandering thoughts, and from a drowſy and lukewarm ſpirit; and may demonſtrate that we do indeed worſhip the Father in ſpirit. Thus, by our pious example, tender-hearted enquirers may be encouraged, to come and partake in our ſolemn aſſemblies of that inward and ſpiritual refreſhment, which is at times graciouſly imparted to the ſouls of the humbly devoted: ſome of whom have to acknowledge, that faithfulneſs in thus devoting time, in the attendance of meetings, tends greatly to ſtrengthen in coming up with
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:037474_0008_100D12801FC9D528"/>
more propriety in the duties we owe to God, to our families, and to mankind.</p>
            <p>And let thoſe who frequently neglect, or do not ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably attend our religious meetings, or go out and in unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, or otherwiſe diſturb the meeting, be ſeaſonably cautioned and admoniſhed: And parents, maſters, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, are exhorted to have a godly care over their children and families in thoſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>And when any ſo manifeſt their want of love to God, and the unity of the brethren, as to continue in the apparent neglect of attending our religious meetings, and diſregard the repeated advice and endeavours of friends to ſtir them up to this incumbent duty, they are to be dealt with, by the monthly meeting to which they belong, even to diſownment, if after continued tender labour, the caſe may appear to the meeting to require it.</p>

            <head>MEETINGS FOR DISCIPLINE.</head>

            <p>Theſe meetings are ſubordinate and accountable thus: The preparative to the monthly; the monthly to the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly; and the quarterly to the yearly meeting: So that if at any time the yearly meeting be diſſatisfied with the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of any of the ſaid meetings, or the quarterly with the proceedings of any of the monthly meetings, or the monthly with the proceedings of any of its preparative meetings, ſuch meetings are directed to render a ſatisfactory account when required.</p>
            <p>And if any quarterly meeting have occaſion for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the records or minutes of another quarterly meeting, or one monthly meeting thoſe of another, it is directed, that copies of ſuch minutes or records be accordingly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the meeting ſo requeſting.</p>
            <p>That there be at leaſt two, or a ſufficient number of friends appointed by each monthly meeting to attend the ſervice of the quarterly meeting to which they belong, and to preſent, on behalf and by order of the reſpective month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, what ſhall by the ſaid meeting be given in charge,

which ſhould be in writing; and that there be for the like ſervice, at leaſt four friends appointed by each quarterly meeting, to attend the yearly meeting, in manner as above mentioned; and the names of the friends thus appointed, are to be entered on the records of the meeting they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to attend, and the ſame method to be obſerved by the quarterly and yearly meeting of miniſters and elders.</p>
            <p>That full endeavours be uſed in every monthly meeting, to end all buſineſs that ariſes therein, or is brought thereto, with care and diſpatch; but if they find any buſineſs, or matter, too weighty or difficult for them to determine, they may move the ſame to the next quarterly meeting, and in like manner, after due care and endeavours are uſed to end any matter, the quarterly meeting may remove the ſame to the next yearly meeting, except in ſuch caſes where an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual member may be concerned, or whoſe right to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal may be affected, in ſuch inſtances if a monthly meeting finds a difficulty too great for them to determine, they may inform the quarterly meeting, that a ſubject is before them in which they deſire aſſiſtance, and the quarter is then to appoint ſome Friends to ſet with and aſſiſt the monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the caſe, and report their attendance only, the merits of the caſe not to be hinted at, either in the report, or in the application of the monthly meeting. Thus will the right of appeal to the quarter be preſerved, and the like ſteps may be taken in ſuch other caſes as the monthly meeting may judge proper and neceſſary.</p>

and adviſed, that all friends do carefully attend ſuch meetings and ſervices. And when any friends attend any of ſaid meetings of buſineſs, that they do not withdraw or leave the ſame, until the buſineſs is finiſhed, unleſs they firſt give the meeting a ſatisfactory reaſon for ſo doing. And when any, being appointed to ſervices as above, are prevented at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereto, by ſickneſs, or other extraordinary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they render an account thereof to the meeting.</p>
            <p>That committees of meetings, enter ſeaſonably and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly on the buſineſs of their appointment, and agree on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, to be made by one of their number, the others likewiſe ſtanding to ſhew their concurrence, which nevertheleſs may be in writing, where the caſe appears to the meeting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; and when they report the buſineſs not accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they offer reaſons therefor, that the meeting may be ſatisfied there has been no unprofitable delay.</p>
            <p>That the buſineſs from preparative to monthly, and from monthly to quarterly meetings, be read in the reſpective meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to which they are forwarded, together with the minutes of the preceding monthly or quarterly, and the extracts from ſuperior meetings, at the opening of each meeting.</p>
            <p>That minutes or due entries be made, in every month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and quarterly meeting, of all ſuch matters as come before them and are determined, or that are or may be removed to the quarterly or yearly meeting;</p>
            <p>And that the minutes and reports which go from inferior to ſuperior meetings, be ſigned by their reſpective clerks.</p>
            <p>Where any are under dealing, they are not to be permitted to ſit in any of our meetings for diſcipline, except deſired by ſuch meeting.</p>
            <p>That each monthly meeting appoint a Treaſurer, and have

            <p>And in caſes where it may appear to be not quite ſafe for a preparative meeting to be held, and yet a meeting for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is allowed, it is the ſenſe of this meeting, that in ſuch caſes, it will generally be adviſable, and tend to the help and ſtrength of the members conſtituting the ſame, that a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative meeting be alſo allowed, under the particular ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of a ſuitable committee of men and women friends, to ſit with them in conducting the buſineſs thereof (as often as well may be) and which ought to be at leaſt once in three months.</p>
            <p>That ſuch buſineſs as comes from perſons not of our ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be brought to the preparative meeting by the overſeers.</p>
            <p>And it is the earneſt deſire of this meeting, that our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meetings, in their collective capacity, wait for the ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Spirit of Truth, whereby they may be enabled to adminiſter ſuch advice and aſſiſtance to the monthly meetings as circumſtances may from time to time call for, in order that our Chriſtian Diſcipline may be ſupported agreeably to the deſign of its inſtitution: That the neceſſity of a more cloſe attention to the tenor and ſpirit thereof, may be impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on our monthly meetings, on whoſe care and concern for the ſupport and maintenance of the wholeſome regulations therein recommended, for general uſe and practice, much depends.

            <p>With ſolicitude of heart we deſire to impreſs the minds of all concerned and active members in their ſeveral meetings, to conſider the need there is of faithfulneſs on their parts, in diſcharging the truſt committed to them, with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and circumſpection; for our minds have been ſeized with jealouſy, leſt thoſe who ſhould ſtand as watchmen on the walls, are too much concerned to ſeek their own things, and not the things that are Jeſus Chriſt's; hence weakneſs enſues, and, inſtead of watching and caring for the flock, we fear ſome of thoſe may become as ſtumbling-blocks in the way of others.</p>

            <head>MINISTRY, And travelling in that Service.</head>
            <p>WHEN any friend comes forth in the miniſtry, and the preparative meeting of miniſters and elders, are unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in believing it right to propoſe to the monthly meeting the conſideration of admitting ſuch friend a member of their meeting, they are to inform the quarterly meeting of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and elders thereof, and if that meeting concur in proſpect, they are to return information to the ſelect prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative meeting, who are then to propoſe to the monthly meeting the conſideration of the ſubject; and if the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, after due and weighty conſideration, and the neceſſary and particular attention of a committee appointed thereto, do unite in recommending ſuch friend to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miniſters and elders as a miniſter, they are to inform the ſaid preparative meeting of miniſters and elders thereof; and ſuch friend is then to be conſidered a member of ſuch meeting, and information thereof is to be forwarded to the quarterly meeting of miniſters and elders; previous to which recommendation of the monthly meeting, no friend is to travel abroad in the miniſtry, or appoint meetings.</p>
            <p>But it is not hereby intended to debar a friend not thus recommended, who has the unity and concurrence of the concerned part of the meeting to which he belongs, from accompanying, in a ſmall proſpect, a recommended miniſter, when travelling in the miniſtry, or in an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

proſpect, where a monthly meeting is eaſy with ſuch young miniſter's proceeding therein, carefully avoiding in a minute given to ſuch, mentioning any thing relative to their publick appearance.</p>
            <p>And when any approved miniſter finds his or her mind engaged to travel in truth's ſervice, they are to acquaint the monthly meeting to which they belong thereof, for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and approbation, which may be ſufficient when ſuch proſpect is only to meetings within the quarter to which ſuch miniſter belongs; unleſs ſuch meetings are remote, and in ſuch caſes a minute of ſuch concurrence ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and in ſome caſes where only a few meetings in the quarter is intended, and not far from home, the advice and concurrence of ſome of the elders collectively may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; but if to other parts of the yearly meeting, a certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate or minute of the monthly meeting is to be obtained, unleſs the intended viſit be only to a few meetings in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarter, in which caſe a diſcretionary care is to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by monthly meetings, when ſuch caſes come before them.</p>
            <p>But if the proſpect extends to a pretty general viſit of the meetings, either in the compaſs of Rhode-Iſland year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, or ſouthward or weſtward further than the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, or to any extenſive viſit amongſt thoſe not of our ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, it is expedient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is believed will tend to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and preſervation of the individuals who go forth in this weighty ſervice, to lay the concern before the quarterly meeting, with the certificate of the monthly, for their ſympathy and concurrence, and that if obtained, to be expreſſed by an endorſement on the certificate, and ſigned by the clerk; unleſs ſome peculiar circumſtances ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the monthly meeting to judge that manifeſt inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency

            <p>And in caſes where the intended viſit is to parts beyond ſea—As the moſt weighty, clear, and deliberate evidence ſhould be obtained in the undertaking, it is concluded that ſuch concern, with the certificate of the monthly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſement of the quarterly meeting, ſhould be laid before the yearly meeting of miniſters and elders, for their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if obtained, a certificate thereof be ſigned by the clerk.</p>
            <p>And with reſpect to viſiting families—although it is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that, when performed under right direction, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves uſefully inſtructive and beneficial, yet it requires deliberate and weighty conſideration; therefore, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and ſtrengthening miniſters in right movements therein, it is adviſed, that thoſe who feel it a duty to make a pretty general viſit of this kind, even in the monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which they belong, that they have the concurrence thereof, and if the proſpect extends to the families in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther monthly meeting, the concurrence to be expreſſed by minute.</p>
            <p>And when any woman friend in the miniſtry hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to travel in that ſervice, ſhe is to open the ſame in the women's meeting; and when that meeting is ſo far united therewith as to approve its being laid before the men's meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the friend is then to be encouraged to open the ſame before ſaid meeting for their ſympathy and concurrence; and when approved, a certificate expreſſive thereof is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and ſigned by both meetings. And it is believed that it will afford ſtrength and encouragement to men friends who travel in truth's ſervice, to have the unity and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the women's meeting therein, and that manifeſted

by their certificate, being ſigned by their clerk, or by the members more at large, as the caſe may require.</p>
            <p>It is alſo deſired, that friends be careful not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive friends travelling in the miniſtry without certificates, or other neceſſary recommendation. And that monthly meetings take care, that certificates or minutes given to any friend be, upon the return of ſuch friend, ſeaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
            <p>None are to take upon them publickly to oppoſe any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering friend, whether recommended or not, whilſt in the unity of the body; or in time of prayer keep on the hat, or ſhew any remarkable diſlike: but if any think they have ought againſt what was delivered, they are to ſpeak to them privately, and in doing which, it is adviſed as a ſafe ſtep, where it can conſiſtently be done, that the diſſatisfaction be previouſly opened to one or more of the elders, in order for their advice and aſſiſtance. But as it is poſſible, that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may occur, in which ſuch an improper uſe may be made of this tender care towards thoſe of the miniſtry, that by ſome unauthorized publick appearance, the ſolemnity of the meeting may materially ſuffer; it is therefore judged adviſable that a diſcretionary care be veſted in miniſters and elders, in caſes where it appears there is a neceſſity for it, tenderly to intimate a deſire for the preſervation of quiet, and that a ſuitable opportunity be taken by the elders with ſuch perſon who hath thus given occaſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and advice and counſel be given, as may appear ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. And in this and other caſes where miniſters give cauſe of uneaſineſs or diſſatisfaction to friends, it is deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that elders take due care to admoniſh and adviſe ſuch ſeaſonably, and if their advice has not the deſired effect, that they lay the caſe before the preparative meeting of miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037474_0018_100D129883A27738"/>
and elders, in order that further care, advice and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may, in the wiſdom of truth, be extended; but if the friend ſhould continue in publick appearance to diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch friend, who ſo diſturbs the ſolemnity of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for worſhip, ſhould be dealt with, and if not brought to regard the advice of his or her friends, the monthly meeting is to proceed to diſown ſuch, if the ſtate of the caſe appears to require it.</p>
            <p>As friends, and the meetings belonging to this yearly meeting, are widely extended, and occaſions offer for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of the yearly meeting to viſit the meetings in the different quarters, and that ſome friend of the miniſtry on ſuch appointments, may, when remote from home, have a proſpect of religious duty to appoint ſome meetings in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places, it is therefore concluded that in ſuch caſes, ſuch friend have liberty to diſcloſe the concern to friends of the committee who are in company, and ſuch miniſters and elders, or other concerned friends as are in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood where they are, and with their concurrence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in appointing a few meetings agreeable to ſuch proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>

            <p>IT is deſired that the ſubject of appointing elders engage the weighty care and attention of the preparative meeting of miniſters and elders; and when they apprehend a friend ſo far advanced in religious experience, and qualified for the weighty truſt of an elder in the church, that it may be ſafe and uſeful for ſuch friend to be appointed to that ſtation, that they propoſe the ſame to the conſideration of the monthly meeting, and, if approved by ſaid meeting, ſuch friend to be conſidered a member of the meeting of miniſters and elders, and the quarterly meeting of miniſters and elders is to be informed of ſuch appointment through the ſaid preparative meeting.</p>
            <p>A renewed conſideration of the ſubject reſpecting elders removing, and retaining their ſtation as elders in the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting to which they remove, again engaged the ſolid attention of the meeting, and, after a deliberate review of the ſubject, it is the judgment of this meeting, that the right of appointing in that caſe ſhould not in future conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a friend in that ſtation on his removing into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of another monthly meeting. Y. M. 1789.</p>
            <p>And it is the deſire of this meeting, that preparative meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of miniſters and elders have a watchful care over the members of their meeting. And if it ſhould ſo fall out that any one of them ſhould give cauſe to believe it adviſable for ſuch to be releaſed from their ſtations, they are, after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging a brotherly care therein, to put the caſe in a way to come before the monthly meeting, in order that he or ſhe may be releaſed from being members of the meeting of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and elders, if the monthly meeting ſhould ſee it right.</p>

            <head>DIFFERENCES AND ARBITRATIONS.</head>
            <p>WHERE any differences ariſe between any friends about their intereſt, claims, or properties in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, it is the ſenſe and judgment of this meeting, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient, comely, and chriſtian practice, that at no time brother go to law with brother, except upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and urgent neceſſity, as is hereafter limited and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; but, that all friends proceed in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, viz. the party thinking he hath reaſon of complaint, is himſelf calmly and friendly to ſpeak, or, if he live at a diſtance too great to do it in perſon, write to the party, by whom he thinks himſelf injured, or to be in danger of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in his juſt right, and endeavour, by gentle means in a brotherly manner, to obtain his right, but if that doth not prevail, then let him, or, if they live at a diſtance as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſome friend whom he may write to, and empower on his behalf, take one or more of the overſeers, or other ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious friends, and in like manner make his claim or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; which friends ſo accompanying the complainant, are to uſe their endeavours, and give their utmoſt aſſiſtance, to have the matter juſtly and expeditiouſly ended, either by the parties, or the immediate aſſiſtance of thoſe friends, who, if the matter appear plain and eaſy, or to be an unconteſted debt, againſt which no reaſonable objection is made by the debtor, are to adviſe the party complained of to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, without carrying the matter further, either to arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators or the meeting: but if there do appear to be either unſettled differences in accounts, or reaſon of debate, then if
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037474_0025_100D12A9C73569C8"/>
they cannot perſuade the determination thereof by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themſelves, or procure the ſame by their advice and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, they are to adviſe the parties to chooſe arbitrators for the ſettlement thereof; but if they cannot be ſo prevailed on, ſuch refuſal ought to be repreſented to the preparative meeting by the overſeers, or the complainant, if neglected, of which the other party is to have notice; and if the parties cannot by the meeting's care, be brought to an agreement, or to refer the ſubject to arbitration, the complaint ſhall be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the preparative to the monthly meeting, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious notice thereof to the party complained of, where the firſt enquiry ſhould be, whether the above goſpel order hath been duly obſerved; if not, the complainant is to be referred back thereto, and no notice thereof taken on minute: but if it hath, the monthly meeting is to appoint ſome friends to have a conference with the parties, and conſider whether the ſubject is attended with ſuch circumſtances as to juſtify the monthly meeting in adviſing it to be left to arbitration, and if the friends report that it ſo appears to them, and the monthly meeting concur therewith,—let the parties be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to ſubmit the ſubject to arbitration: and if either of the parties refuſe to comply therewith, or decline nominating or chooſing arbitrators, the meeting, after labouring with the party ſo neglecting, ſhould teſtify their diſunion with ſuch offender. And where a ſubject of difference has been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to arbitration, either by conſent of parties, or been prevailed on by a monthly meeting ſo to do, the award ought to be final, unleſs where it appears notoriouſly evident they have materially erred in their judgment or proceedings, or have not given ſufficient opportunity of producing ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as was neceſſary in the caſe; and where this appears clear to the monthly meeting, they are to inform the quarter
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037474_0026_100D12AB5073E230"/>
that they have a caſe before them in which they deſire aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the quarter is then to appoint ſome friends to ſit with and aſſiſt the monthly meeting in the caſe; and if it ſhould appear on conſideration, that there is cauſe for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, a rehearing is to be granted by the ſame or other arbitrators, and their award to be final.</p>
            <p>And where arbitrators are choſen in any caſe, they ought as ſpeedily as may be, to appoint time and place, and duly attend the buſineſs, by giving the parties and their witneſſes a full and fair hearing, in the preſence of each other, uſing all caution and care to avoid unneceſſary delay, and to make the determination within the time appointed.</p>
            <p>And whereas there may be ſome circumſtances, even in diſputed matters, wherein the foregoing wholeſome method of proceeding cannot conſiſtently be complied with; ſuch as, firſt, the party abſconding or leaving the country, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to defraud his or her creditors; or, ſecondly, when the time it might take up in going through the meeting might be a manifeſt damage to the creditor or claimant, as in caſes of apparent danger of bankruptcy, and the party being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded with debts, and other creditors generally coming on; or, third, that there may be danger of future damage to ſuch as ſubmit thereto, as in the caſe of executors, adminiſtrators, truſtees, or friends who ſtand as ſecurity for thoſe who are not members in ſociety with us; it may therefore be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and it is adviſed that the monthly meeting in theſe caſes do hold excuſed ſuch as ſhall appear to them to be really ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to proceed at law, with this caution, that the parties on both ſides behave towards each other, in brotherly love, decency and moderation, without anger or animoſity, which will be as a becoming teſtimony, even in courts, and ſhew that nothing but the nature of the caſe and our common ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>If any perſon in memberſhip with us ſhall arreſt or ſue at law any other friend, without proceeding in the manner herein before preſcribed, ſuch perſon doth therein deviate from the profeſſion we make, and ought to be dealt with for the ſame, and, unleſs he give ſatisfaction, be diſowned.</p>
            <p>It is adviſed, that perſons differing about worldly affairs do as little as may be chooſe miniſtering friends as arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators.</p>

            <head>MARRIAGES.</head>
            <p>CONCERNING the manner of proceeding in marriage, it is adviſed, that no young perſons, who have parents or guardians, make propoſals of marriage with each other, until the conſent of ſuch parents or guardians be obtained.</p>
            <p>That all, according to our uſual cuſtom, do offer or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their marriage to two monthly meetings, and that the ſecond time be to the next ſucceſſive meeting, unleſs ſickneſs or other material cauſe prevent. At the firſt meeting, if no reaſon appear to the contrary, the appearance would be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuted, and inquiry made concerning conſent of parents or guardians, if either have any, which conſent ought always to be ſignified by ſuch parents or guardians to the monthly meeting, either perſonally or in writing; and if the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſame meeting, two friends are to be then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to inquire into his clearneſs for proceeding in ſuch marriage; and if there is iſſue by a former huſband, to ſee that the children's rights are duly attended to, and make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the next meeting. And the proper care is previouſly to be taken by women friends concerning the woman. And if either of the parties be from another country, or belong to another monthly meeting, let inquiry be then made, for a certificate from ſuch meeting, and where none is produced, let the parties be informed, that the marriage cannot paſs, or be allowed without one, which ſhall certify their clearneſs from all others in reſpect of marriage, or any other engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that way. But if the meeting he belongs to be within ſuch diſtance as that it may probably be obtained, ſo as to
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037474_0033_100D12BB8FBA9898"/>
be produced at the next meeting, and there appears no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, nor any thing elſe to obſtruct, it may then paſs for the firſt time.—At the ſecond meeting, if what is above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed be done, and all appear clear, let an entry be made of their ſecond appearance, and what more is uſual and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and the couple left at their liberty to accompliſh their marriage according to the order uſed among friends, but not on the monthly meeting day, or the firſt day of the week.</p>
            <p>It it further preſſed and adviſed, that the ſaid marriage be accompliſhed decently, gravely and weightily; and that the parties themſelves, their parents, and others concerned, do take care, at the houſes, or places where they go or are after the meeting is over, that no reproach ariſe, or occaſion of offence be given, by any intemperance, or immoderate feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or drinking, or by any unſeemly or wanton diſcourſe or actions; but that all behave with ſuch modeſty and ſobriety as becomes a people fearing God: and in order thereto, and for the aſſiſtance of thoſe immediately concerned, let there be two men and two women friends appointed by the monthly meeting, to attend the marriage both at the meeting and place of entertainment after, who are to take care, as much as in them lies, that all be done, and all behave, as is above adviſed; and that the company retire in ſeaſonable time. And if by them, or any other friend, any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is obſerved, they ought, as ſpeedily as they convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can, to take ſuch aſide, who make any breach upon good order, and, in brotherly love, tenderly admoniſh them to a better behaviour. And that the ſaid friends do make report to the next monthly meeting, whether this advice, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing decency and order, hath been obſerved; and take care that the marriage certificate be handed for recording.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>And when any ſhall or do marry out of the unity of friends, by any other method than the before directed and orderly way uſed amongſt; us, they are to be dealt with, and, unleſs they give ſatisfaction, be diſowned.</p>
            <p>When overſeers, or other friends, know that any intend to offer propoſals of marriage to the monthly meeting, which is manifeſt to them cannot paſs, either for want of a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or any other apparent cauſe, they ought to adviſe them not to give themſelves or the meeting unneceſſary trouble, yet not ſo as to prevent or forbid them, if the parties conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue deſirous notwithſtanding to lay their propoſals before the meeting.</p>
            <p>And it is adviſed, that ſuch men and women friends as do make ſuit, or concern themſelves in propoſals of marriage to one another, do not dwell together in the ſame houſe and family, from the time of making ſuch propoſals, or offers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, until their marriage is accompliſhed. And if they perſiſt in ſo doing, after being adviſed againſt it by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, that they be dealt with as diſorderly perſons.</p>
            <p>And it is concluded, that no friend in future attend the marriages of thoſe that go out from us, as it is a ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in that diſorder; nor any marriage accompliſhed by a prieſt or magiſtrate, or any other perſon; and if any ſhould tranſgreſs herein, that they be dealt with accordingly.</p>
            <p>And when it is diſcovered, that any keep company on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of marriage with one not a member of our ſociety, or where conduct gives reaſon to apprehend, that a connection of that kind is forming, it is earneſtly deſired, and ſhould be conſidered the duty of overſeers and other concerned friends, as ſoon as may be, in a gentle tender manner, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſſuade ſuch therefrom, by pointing out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency, danger and diſadvantage of ſuch connection;
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037474_0035_100D12C1643D38C0"/>
and when any do ſo far diſregard the tender labour and care of their friends, as to go out in marriage with ſuch, and the monthly meeting is ſatisfactorily informed, that the neceſſary care hath been ſeaſonably taken, ſuch ought to be diſowned without further labour,—unleſs it ſhould appear by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the committee to inform ſuch of the concluſion of the meeting to diſown them, that there is a diſpoſition of mind that appears to them deſerving of further care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in which caſe the ſame care is to be obſerved as is directed reſpecting diſowning members under the head Dealing with Offenders. But in caſes where it may appear, that this neceſſary, ſeaſonable and tender care hath not been extended, monthly meetings ought to labour with ſuch as with offenders in other caſes.</p>
            <p>And when any who have married out, do, from a religious ſenſibility, witneſs an exerciſe of mind, that induces a deſire for reconciliation with the body, let no diſcouragements be given, by the requiſition of unneceſſary expreſſions in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that would not accord with that tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the preſervation of harmony, ſo precious and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be preſerved between huſband and wife.</p>
            <p>And it is concluded, if any firſt couſins join in marriage, they are to be diſowned without dealing; yet overſeers and other concerned friends ought to conſider it their duty, when they hear of any ſuch keeping company on that account, or of a conduct likely to lead thereto, timely to treat with them, and endeavour to convince them of the inconſiſtency of ſuch marriages, and the danger there is in going counter to the ſolid ſenſe and judgment of the body.</p>
            <p>And when overſeers, and other concerned friends, know or hear of any keeping company on account of marriage, that are of a degree of kindred nearer than ſecond couſins, but
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037474_0036_100D12C2EC70ADB0"/>
not ſo near as firſt couſins, uſually termed firſt and ſecond couſins, it ought to be conſidered their duty to caution and adviſe againſt it, in the manner directed reſpecting ſuch who keep company with thoſe who are not members of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and they are to be dealt with in like manner if they proceed to marry.</p>
            <p>This meeting, being tender in reſpect to marriages, adviſes that no miſconduct be brought forward againſt any perſon at the time of their propoſing their marriage, or till the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is accompliſhed, as it is out of order, and ought to be diſcouraged; but this is not to affect the report reſpecting the clearneſs from others on account of marriage.</p>
            <p>It is adviſed, that no widower or widow make or admit propoſals of marriage within one year after the deceaſe of huſband or wife; an earlier procedure therein being thought over haſty and unbecoming. And no monthly meeting ought to permit any marriage to be propoſed in ſaid meeting ſooner than a year after the death of huſband or wife.</p>

            <p>FOR the preſervation of friends from wounding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and families, or the body, by injudicious remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, we do adviſe, that, when any friends have thoughts of removing, they be careful not to let wrong motives influence their concluſions; but in a timely manner, (that is, before ſuch ſteps are taken as may cloſe the way to their taking the advice of their friends) acquaint the monthly meeting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they belong, or at leaſt the overſeers of the preparative meeting, and ſuch other friends as the overſeers may aſk to unite with them in counſel in the caſe, in order for their brotherly advice on the propriety of ſuch their propoſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval; for want of which, ſome have ſuffered loſs, both in their temporal and ſpiritual concerns, and we believe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hurt the youth of their families. And if no material objection appear againſt it, they ought to have a certificate of their life, converſation and circumſtances, according to truth and juſtice, to be produced to the monthly meeting where they are going to reſide. And the inquiry reſpecting outward affairs being ſettled, ought not to be confined to the monthly meeting in which the perſon propoſing to remove reſides, if there is reaſon to believe they are not ſettled in other places. And elders, overſeers, and other concerned friends, when they hear of any friend inclining to remove, are to conſider it as their duty, in brotherly love, to adviſe ſuch to obſerve the foregoing directions.</p>
            <p>And when a certificate of removal, from one monthly meeting to another, is received by the meeting to which it
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:037474_0039_100D12C8D16A09D0"/>
is directed, the friend or friends recommended thereby, ſhall be deemed members of the meeting removed to.</p>
            <p>And when apprentices, or perſons under age, are placed in the compaſs of another monthly meeting, that removal certificates be forwarded for ſuch.</p>
            <p>No friend is to gain a ſettlement by marriage certificate or other recommendation, unleſs their removal be expreſſed therein.</p>
            <p>And that all certificates of removal brought by any friend, intending to reſide amongſt us, be lodged in the monthly meeting where the ſame is accepted. And that every meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing keep records of all certificates which they give out.</p>

            <head>TRADE AND COMMERCE.</head>
            <p>IT is evident, that the ſpirit of truth, where it is received, and given way to, brings into ſuch a liberty and freedom of ſpirit, that thoſe who keep under the influence of it, are not in bondage to the ſpirit of this world; an attention to the precious influence thereof, occaſioned our primitive friends to be remarkable for their uprightneſs and honeſty in their commerce and converſe, and very exact in performing their promiſes, without evaſive excuſes.</p>
            <p>And a concern is witneſſed, that friends be earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſeek after divine counſel in all their movements; their temporal concerns will thereby be circumſcribed within the bounds of ſafety; a want of a due and watchful care therein, has been the cauſe of many being drawn from the limits of truth, into a worldly ſpirit and diſpoſition, which hath tended to diſqualify them for thoſe ſervices in ſociety they were graciouſly deſigned for, and they have gradually become barren, and unfruitful of good, and pierced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through with many ſorrows.</p>
            <p>It is therefore adviſed, that friends be very cautious and guarded, how they go from ſuch honeſt and lawful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they well underſtand, and are able to manage. And that they endeavour to content themſelves with ſuch a plain way of living, as is moſt agreeable to the ſelf-denying principle of truth which we profeſs, and which is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to that tranquillity of mind requiſite to a religious conduct through this world.</p>
            <p>It is, therefore, earneſtly recommended to thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037474_0041_100D12CE48D36640"/>
in commerce particularly, and in all other concerns, cloſely to attend to the guidance of the precious principle of light and truth in the heart, that they may witneſs their views, and movements, circumſcribed, and their minds guarded againſt an inordinate purſuit after the accumulation of wealth; againſt unduly entering into concerns, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend much upon the uncertain probabilities of hazardous enterpriſes; and more eſpecially againſt launching into buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon ſuch credit, as their profeſſion of the truth may have given them, and more at the hazard of others property than their own. And that all friends be careful of entering into haſty engagements; but when they give their words, that they as carefully abide by and perform them, to the utmoſt of their power, the reputation truth gives them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe wounded.</p>
            <p>And let all amongſt us be cautioned, to conſider well the ground on which they become endorſers, or joint-ſecurities, leſt, for want of due conſideration, any involve themſelves and families into ruinous circumſtances, and riſk their own peace of mind. And if any amongſt us find themſelves em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed, and not likely to be able to comply with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, it is adviſed, that ſuch diſcloſe their circumſtances to ſome judicious friends, and, if it appears neceſſary, call their creditors together, and ſeaſonably ſtate their ſituation, and then be particular in ſuch ſituations, to take the counſel of the overſeers, and ſuch other judicious friends as they may think proper to call in, relative to a ſettlement of their affairs, agreeable to the principles of juſtice and equity.</p>
            <p>It is alſo adviſed, that overſeers counſel ſuch as give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſuſpect, that they are ſo declining in their worldly circumſtances, as to be likely to bring reproach on our chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian profeſſion, by falling ſhort of honeſtly diſcharging their
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:037474_0042_100D12D1221D6DD0"/>
contracts, to the injury of their juſt creditors. And that all concerned in trade, keep their accounts in ſuch a clear and accurate manner, that, in caſes of failure, their creditors may ſee how the deficiency has happened. Thoſe friends who may be appointed by monthly meetings to viſit thoſe who have failed, ſhould always make due inquiry how they have acted in the above reſpects, and report to the monthly meeting.</p>
            <p>And it is alſo adviſed, that friends be cautious how they receive collections or bequeſts, for the uſe of the poor or other purpoſes of ſociety, of perſons who have fallen ſhort of the payment of their juſt debts, though legally diſcharged by the voluntary act of their creditors; for until ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have ſatisfied their creditors, their poſſeſſions cannot in equity be called their own. And when any failures of this kind do occur, and ſuch decline making farther payments towards the remaining balances of their juſt debts, when of ability ſo to do, monthly meetings ſhould be informed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and inquire into the cauſe, and if after a tender and brotherly examination, it ſhould appear, that their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are ſuch as to render it clearly adviſable, that a farther payment ſhould be offered to the creditors; or that a ſtate of the debtor's affairs ſhould be laid before the creditors, and ſubmitted to them, whether a farther payment ſhould be made at that time, or referred to a farther day, let advice to the individual be given accordingly. And where monthly meetings diſcover, in any who have fallen ſhort of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their juſt debts, a conduct, attended with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that bring a reproach on our religious ſociety, ſuch offenders ſhould, after due labour extended, be teſtified againſt, unleſs they condemn their miſconduct in a ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory manner. And it is adviſed, that where friends accept
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037474_0043_100D12D34F64F2D0"/>
the office of truſtee or aſſignee, they be active in collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effects of the eſtate, and punctual in making ſpeedy diſtribution</p>
            <p>The danger and inconveniences which have frequently aroſe from partnerſhips in trade between friends and others who are not members of our ſociety, having in divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances been very apparent, and apprehending ſome have ſuſtained a loſs in their religious progreſs by a connection of that kind, we feel deſirous, that, when any in profeſſion with us are about forming connections in buſineſs, they may duly conſider the ſubject, and keep in view the propriety and greater ſafety of confining their proſpects to thoſe who are in memberſhip with us. And when any do engage, and become a partner in commercial concerns with thoſe not of our ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and it ſhould ſo happen, through a failure of engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or payment of juſt debts in ſeaſon, on the part of the ſaid partnerſhip, as to give reaſonable occaſion for a legal procedure at law, that, in that caſe, a creditor, who may be a member of our ſociety, may be at liberty to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly—it appearing to us very improper that the due courſe of juſtice ſhould be obſtructed by any of our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers connecting themſelves with thoſe not in profeſſion with us.</p>

            <head>REQUESTS To be received into Memberſhip.</head>
            <p>UNITEDLY reſulted, that requeſts from ſuch as deſire to be received into memberſhip be introduced by the overſeers, and read in the preparative meeting; and if no evident impropriety appears to their going forward to the monthly meeting, that they be ſent with the minutes of the preparative. That no preparative meeting or overſeers judge of any ſuch requeſt, ſo as to prevent its going to the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting; though either may be at liberty to obſerve to the perſon any manifeſt obſtruction; but if ſuch perſon ſtill remains deſirous that the requeſt ſhould be laid before the monthly meeting, that it be admitted to go in the manner before directed. 1789. And when a monthly meeting is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that the motives to ſuch requeſt are ſincere, and alſo of the fitneſs of ſuch requeſter to become a member of our ſociety, a minute ſhould then be made of the acceptance of ſuch into memberſhip, and two friends appointed to acquaint the perſon thereof, in a ſuitable manner.</p>
            <p>It is concluded to be the duty of monthly meetings, to receive children that are young, whoſe parents are members and they not, on the application of their parents, unleſs ſome obſtacle ſufficient to juſtify a refuſal ſhould appear to the meeting. And as children who are deſcended from parents, the one a member and the other not, are not conſidered members of our ſociety, monthly meetings are in this caſe
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037474_0045_100D12D6773F6AD8"/>
alſo, with the reſtrictions mentioned above, to receive ſuch children, on the requeſt of the parent that is a member, in which caſe our monthly meetings are to pay a due reſpect to the other parent, and to that parent's willingneſs that the child ſhould be educated conformable to our religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>

            <p>ADVISED, that all friends keep themſelves, and thoſe under their tuition, out of the world's corrupt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, manners, vain and needleſs things and faſhions, in apparel, buildings, and furniture of houſes, ſome of which are indecent and unbecoming. And that they avoid the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate or vain uſe of lawful things, which, though inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in themſelves, may thereby become hurtful: avoid alſo ſuch kind of ſtuffs, colours and dreſs, as are calculated more to pleaſe a vain and wanton, or proud mind, than for their real uſefulneſs. And let tradeſmen and others, members of our religious ſociety, be admoniſhed accordingly, that they may not make themſelves acceſſary to theſe evils; for we ought in all things to take up the daily croſs of Chriſt, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of God which brings ſalvation, and teaches to deny all ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world, that we may adorn the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; ſo ſhall we feel his bleſſing, and may be inſtrumental in his hand for the good of others.</p>
            <p>And whereas we have with deep concern obſerved, that there is a great declenſion from that ſimplicity in ſpeech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and apparel, which our worthy predeceſſors were led into; and as we find by experience, that the ſame ſpirit of truth, which led our ancients to lay aſide every thing unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the followers of Chriſt, will ſtill lead in the ſame path all who ſubmit to its guidance, we earneſtly intreat all friends to watch over themſelves in theſe reſpects.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>Let not any ſuch as degenerate in theſe reſpects excuſe their own weakneſs, under a pretence of the miſconduct of ſome who have appeared outwardly plain—an objection of very little weight; for did they rightly conſider, they would clearly ſee, that the very reaſons why deceivers ſometimes put on plain apparel, is becauſe true men have been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to wear it. We alſo tenderly adviſe, that friends take heed, that they uſe plainneſs of ſpeech without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in all their converſe among men; and not balk their teſtimony by a cowardly compliance, varying their language according to their company, a practice of very ill example to our obſerving youth, and rendering thoſe who uſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and looked upon as a kind of hypocrites, even by thoſe with whom they ſo comply.</p>
            <p>When any ſo far depart from that ſimplicity and plainneſs which truth leads into, as to copy after, and run into the vain and extravagant faſhions of the world, either in ſpeech, behaviour, apparel, or furniture of their houſes, or in other reſpects, it is deſired and adviſed, that friends, from time to time, as ſuch things appear, be ſtirred up in the wiſdom of truth, to take due and prudent care therein; and if any, by continuing in ſuch practices, reject the advice and labour of their friends,—let ſuch caſes be brought forward to the monthly meeting for further care and proceeding, as may appear neceſſary for the ſupport of our Chriſtian teſtimony.</p>

            <p>ADVISED, that friends keep to their wonted example and teſtimony againſt the ſuperſtitious obſervation of days, and to the ſimplicity of truth, and our ancient teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in calling the days and months by ſcripture names and not by heathen. E. D.</p>
            <p>And that the importance of that chriſtian teſtimony, borne by our predeceſſors in this caſe, may be the more clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, the following is recommended to ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</p>
            <div type="explanation">
               <head>A brief account of the origin of the names of ſome months of the year, and of all the days of the week, now cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and commonly uſed.</head>
               <p n="1">I. January was ſo called from Janus, an ancient king of Italy, whom heatheniſh ſuperſtition had deified, to whom a temple was built and this month dedicated.</p>
               <p n="2">II. February was ſo called from Februa, a word denoting purgation by ſacrifices; it being uſual in this month for the prieſts of the heathen god Pan to offer ſacrifices, and perform certain rites, conducing, as was ſuppoſed, to the cleanſing or purgation of the people.</p>
               <p n="3">III. March was ſo denominated from Mars, feigned to be the god of war, whom Romulus, founder of the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, pretended to be his father.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. April is generally ſuppoſed to derive its name from the Greek appellation of Venus, an imaginary goddeſs, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by the Romans.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:037474_0049_100D12DFF69874A8"/>V. May is ſaid to have been ſo called from Maia, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercury, another of their pretended ethnic deities, to whom in this month they paid their devotions.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. June is ſaid to take its name from Juno, one of the ſuppoſed goddeſſes of the heathen.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. July, ſo called from Julius Caeſar, one of the Roman emperors, who gave his name to this month, which before was called Quintilis or the fifth.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Auguſt, ſo named in honour of Auguſtus Caeſar, another of the Roman emperors; this month before was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sextilis or the ſixth.</p>
               <p>The other four months, namely, September, October, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember and December, ſtill retain their numerical Latin names, which, according to the late regulation of the calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, will for the future be improperly applied. However, from the continued uſe of them hitherto, as well as from the practice of the Jews before the Babyloniſh captivity, it ſeemeth highly probable that the method of diſtinguiſhing the months by their numerical order only, was the moſt ancient, as it is the moſt plain, ſimple and rational.</p>
               <p>As the idolatrous Romans thus gave names to ſeveral of the months, in honour of their pretended deities: ſo the like idolatry prevailing among our Saxon anceſtors, induced them to call the days of the week by the name of the idol which on that day they peculiarly worſhipped.—Hence,</p>
               <p>The firſt day of the week they called Sunday, from their accuſtomary adoration of the ſun on that day.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day of the week they called Monday, from their uſual cuſtom of worſhipping the moon on that day.</p>
               <p>The third day of the week they named Tueſday, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of one of their idols called Tuiſco.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:037474_0050_100D12E268F65FB8"/>The fourth day of the week was called Wedneſday, from the appellation of Woden, another of their idols.</p>
               <p>The fifth day of the week was called Thurſday, from the name of an idol called Thor, to whom they paid their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion on that day.</p>
               <p>The ſixth day of the week was termed Friday, from the name of Friga, an imaginary goddeſs, by them worſhipped.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh day they ſtiled Saturday, as is ſuppoſed from Saturn, or Seater, by them then worſhipped.</p>
               <p>Seeing, therefore, that theſe appellations and names of days, months and times, are of an idolatrous or ſuperſtitious original, contrary to the divine command, <q>make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the names of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth,</q> Exod. xxiii. 13,—the practice of good and holy men in former ages, and repugnant to the chriſtian teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, borne by our faithful friends and predeceſſors in the truth, for the ſake of which they patiently endured many revilings; let neither the reproach of ſingularity, nor the ſpecious reaſonings of ſuch as would evade the croſs of Chriſt, turn any aſide from the ſimplicity of the goſpel, nor diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from keeping to the language of truth, in denominating the months and days according to the plain and ſcriptural way of expreſſion, thereby following the example of our worthy elders, and coming up in a noble and honourable teſtimony againſt thoſe and all other remains of idolatry and ſuperſtition. E. D.</p>
               <p>Neither can we conform to the cuſtom of illuminating our houſes, or doing any act as a mark of rejoicing for victory in war—or in other reſpects comply with the ordinances of man relative to faſt-days, or thoſe appointed for publick thankſgiving or rejoicing.</p>

            <p>AS one of the firſt great cauſes, which engaged our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient friends to the orderly eſtabliſhing our Chriſtian diſcipline, was the care of the poor, it is the advice and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of this meeting, that all poor friends amongſt us be taken due care of, according to friends ancient practice; that their caſes, and the caſes of ſuch as may be likely to require aſſiſtance, be, from time to time, duly inſpected, and they adviſed, relieved, and aſſiſted in ſuch buſineſs as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; and that two or more ſuitable men friends, and the like number of women friends in each monthly meeting, be appointed to have the care of the poor, whoſe buſineſs and duty it ſhould be to viſit, inſpect, and relieve them.</p>
            <p>And it is deſired, that friends and meetings extend due care in affording the neceſſary ſchool learning to the children of the poor, and others alluded to in the foregoing paragraph.</p>
            <div type="report">
               <head>Yearly Meeting, 1796. The following report is received from the friends thereto appointed.</head>
               <p>In attending to the ſubject of our appointment, our minds are ſenſibly affected with ſympathy, and with a full perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that an increaſe of care is greatly neceſſary; and that there is occaſion, not only to renew the recommendation of this meeting ſome years ſince reſpecting quarterly collections,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:037474_0052_100D12E788647000"/>
but that it be earneſtly enjoined on each monthly meeting, to attend cloſely to thoſe collections, with a liberality that will keep it in a ſituation ſuitable to the neceſſary expenſes that may ariſe, and thereby avoid the painful neceſſity of reſorting to a particular perſonal ſubſcription, either for the relief of the poor or otherwiſe:—that each monthly meeting be deſired to appoint a few judicious friends, a ſtanding committee, to have the direction and diſpoſing of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſo raiſed; and that the treaſurer of each monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be directed to pay to them, or their order, ſuch monies as they ſhall judge right to call for. This, we apprehend, will remove one cauſe of concern. And the committee are united in believing, that the ſituation and peculiar circumſtances of ſome of our monthly meetings are ſuch, as do occaſion the neceſſary expenſes of Society to fall ſo diſproportionately heavy as to claim a brotherly ſympathy, and therefore ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the propriety of the yearly meeting recommending this ſubject to the ſuperintendance of our meeting for ſufferings; and that it be recommended to their care, to extend advice and aſſiſtance in ſuch caſes as may appear to them adviſable, and agreeable to the preſent proſpect that opens on this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting occaſion—Not only a brotherly care, but a ſafety will appear herein, when it is recollected that the committee annually appointed to ſettle the treaſurer's accounts will have an opportunity to point out any injudicious appropriations.</p>
               <p>The report received the ſolid deliberation of the meeting, and a free communication of ſentiments evidenced a full united concurrence with the report of the committee—and it is earneſtly recommended to the care and attention of our monthly meetings, and our meeting for ſufferings is deſired

to keep the ſubject under their care and ſuperintendance, and to call on the treaſurer of this meeting, from time to time, for ſuch ſums as may appear to them neceſſary to carry the brotherly views of this meeting into effect.</p>
               <p>The above minute is not to be underſtood as contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordinary relief of the poor, but only the diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate expenſes that ſome, more eſpecially remote monthly meetings, may be put to by extra ſervices in lengthy journies or otherwiſe.</p>

            <head>DISTILLED SPIRITS AND SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS.</head>
            <p>IN attending to the ſtate of things as brought up from the ſeveral quarters, it was cauſe of cloſe exerciſe to find, that any among us ſhould yet give way to the exceſſive uſe of ſpirituous liquors; and the meeting being led to conſider the importation and ſale of that article as contributing to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and increaſe of this mighty evil, we therefore earneſtly recommend to the quarterly and monthly meetings, to give ſerious and cloſe attention to this important ſubject; that concerned friends be exemplary in this reſpect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to adviſe our members againſt being concerned in importing or ſelling of diſtilled ſpirituous liquors, or the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillation of them; and that they be watchfully cautious how they encourage in others a traffick ſo pernicious to our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men. Y. M. 1785.</p>
            <p>And although we have comfortable cauſe to believe the advice iſſued ſome time ſince by this meeting concerning a commerce in, and the unneceſſary uſe of, diſtilled ſpirituous liquors, hath had place in the minds of many, evidenced by a decline of the commerce and uſe of that article among us; yet, from the reports, there is ground to fear ſome have been and others are in danger of going back again; and it being an article ſo exceedingly deſtructive to the eſſential welfare of mankind, it is painfully affecting that any in profeſſion with
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:037474_0067_100D130B79F7DBE8"/>
us ſhould, for the ſake of gain, contribute to ſo great an evil; we therefore think it beſt to ſignify that it is contrary to the advice and judgment of this meeting, that any of our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould continue to traffick therein; and we requeſt our quarterly and monthly meetings carefully to watch over their reſpective members, and ſee how far this, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in 1785 on this ſubject, is obſerved; and that an account thereof come up to next yearly meeting. 1788.</p>
            <p>Although it appears by the accounts, that our advice and counſel, reſpecting the uſe of and commerce in diſtilled ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, have obtained conſiderable attention in each quarter; yet we find there ſtill remains a number in the practice of trafficking in that article, but that divers of them give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to hope they will decline the buſineſs; and that no friend is in the practice of diſtilling thoſe liquors: and the ſubject coming weightily under a renewed conſideration, it is the earneſt deſire of this meeting, that our advice and judgment expreſſed laſt year may be renewedly adverted to, and that our monthly meetings appoint committees to aſſiſt the overſeers in labouring with ſuch amongſt us, who ſtill continue to traffick in the pernicious article of diſtilled ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and that a report thereon be brought forward next year. 1789.</p>
            <p>By reports from our quarters it appears, that our members are clear of trafficking in diſtilled ſpirits, except four, and one of thoſe under dealing for other miſconduct. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued attention of our monthly meetings is deſired to this ſubject, that thoſe who ſtill diſregard the labour beſtowed, from a concern attending this yearly meeting, may be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly dealt with by the monthly meetings to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; and if not brought to ſuch a ſenſe of their miſconduct as to refrain from that traffick, they are to be diſowned. 1792.</p>

            <p>And it having been obſerved, that a pernicious cuſtom hath prevailed of giving rum and other ſtrong liquors to excite people to bid at vendues to advance the price, which, beſides the injuſtice of the artifice, leads to intemperance and diſorder; it is therefore the ſenſe of this meeting to caution friends againſt the ſame.

            <p>ON conſideration of the mode for examining of memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als or teſtimonies, forwarded by monthly meetings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting deceaſed friends, previous to their being read in the yearly meeting, it is concluded that quarterly meetings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them timely to the meeting for ſufferings for inſpection and conſideration, before they are forwarded to the yearly meeting, that the neceſſity of appointing a committee thereon, during the ſitting of the yearly meeting, may be avoided.</p>

            <head>QUERIES.</head>
            <p>AGREED, that the twelve following queries be diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read, and deliberately conſidered, in each preparative and monthly meeting preceding each quarterly meeting; at which time friends may have the opportunity of making ſuch obſervations as may tend to excite to vigilance and care in the diligent exerciſe of our Chriſtian diſcipline; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote an united labour for the good of the church. And in order to convey a general account of the ſtate of friends in ſuch caſes as may be moſt immediately neceſſary to the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meetings, full and explicit anſwers be given by the preparative meeting, preceding the monthly meeting that precedes the quarter, to the firſt, ſecond, eighth, tenth and twelfth, three times in the year: and thoſe anſwers ſent from the preparative to the monthly meeting, are to be digeſted in the monthly meeting and ſent to the quarter. And once in the year, that is to ſay, at the preparative and monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, before the quarterly meetings, next preceding the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, that the ſaid twelve queries be in like manner read and conſidered, and each of them particularly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly anſwered, and forwarded as above directed, in order to convey to the yearly meeting a clear account of the ſtate of ſaid meetings.</p>
            <p>Query I. Are friends careful to attend all our meetings for religious worſhip and diſcipline; is the hour obſerved; and are they clear of ſleeping, and all other unbecoming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour therein?</p>

Are friends careful to keep themſelves, their own, and other friends children under their care, in plainneſs of ſpeech, behaviour and apparel; to the frequent reading the holy ſcriptures, and to guard againſt reading pernicious books, and the corrupt converſation of the world; and to extend a due care in theſe reſpects towards others under their tuition? —and friends are adviſed to be careful when they are about taking ſuch into their families, that they be thoſe that are likely to take their advice in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Do friends avoid the unneceſſary uſe of ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, frequenting of taverns, and attending places of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and keep in moderation and temperance on account of marriages, births and burials?</p>

            <head>WOMEN's MEETINGS.</head>
            <p>FORASMUCH as our women's meetings for diſcipline were ſet up and eſtabliſhed in the wiſdom of truth, and by long experience have been found of manifeſt advantage, not only to our ſociety in general, but to the youth of their own ſex in particular; it is therefore earneſtly deſired, that, in all their meetings, they may wait for, and feel after the ariſing of the pure influence of the ſpirit of truth, that they may be thereby qualified to come up in a faithful diſcharge of duty in that part of the diſcipline of the church, properly claiming their attention and care; and to act in all caſes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the preſervation of good order; to treat with diſorderly members of their own ſex, and requeſters, as the caſe may require; yet not ſo as to receive or diſown any without the concurrence of the men's meeting; and when they have ſo far proceeded in any caſe, that requires the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the men's meeting, as to apprehend no further ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by its longer continuance amongſt them, they are to lay the ſame in an explicit manner before the men's meeting, who are to enter it clearly on their minutes, and, if nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to obſtruct their concurrence, that the women be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thereof; but if the men ſhould apprehend a ſervice from farther endeavours, particularly in the caſe of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, either on an acknowledgment or otherwiſe, or requeſt from a perſon to be received into memberſhip, that they then appoint a committee to unite with an appointment from the women's meeting, to the conſideration of the ſubject, and to give ſuch farther attention thereto as may tend to
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:037474_0079_100D1324111B5948"/>
bring the men and women's meetings to a united judgment, which, after being come to, the women are to inform the individual thereof, and if the caſe requires a publick teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the men are to make an appointment of two friends to aſſiſt in preparing the ſame, and to publiſh it agreeable to our diſcipline. And when any woman friend removes from one monthly meeting to another, and a certificate becomes neceſſary, they are to appoint a committee to make the neceſſary inquiry, and prepare an eſſay for that purpoſe, and when approved, to be laid before the men's meeting for their concurrence, and if approved by them, to be ſigned by the clerk of both meetings. And when the certificate is to include one or more males, as may be the caſe in the removal of families, then the men and women are to join in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and in preparing the eſſay, and when approved by the men's meeting, they are to hand it to the women, and after being concurred with by them, to be ſigned as before direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the clerk of each meeting—and that all certificates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for women friends be laid before the men's meeting before they are accepted.</p>

            <head>MEETINGS OF MINISTERS AND ELDERS.</head>
            <p>AS much depends on the example and conduct of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and elders, meetings have been eſtabliſhed among them, for the purpoſe of inſpecting into the ſtate of that part of the body, whether all are preſerved in an exemplary walking anſwerable to their ſtation, and where advice, caution and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement may be adminiſtered for the help and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening one of another, as in the wiſdom of truth may appear neceſſary; for the more proper and uſeful proceeding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the following queries are recommended to be read and anſwered therein:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Are miniſters and elders diligent in attending meetings for worſhip and diſcipline, and careful in bringing their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies with them?</p>
            <p n="2">II. Are they careful to labour honeſtly to maintain our Chriſtian diſcipline in every part, and not ſcreen their own families from the operation thereof?</p>
            <p n="3">III. Are miniſters careful to miniſter in the ability which truth gives; to avoid tones, unbecoming geſtures, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their teſtimonies ſo far as to become burdenſome?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Are the elders careful to encourage thoſe who are young in the miniſtry in the right line, and diſcourage a forward ſpirit in any who run into words without life and power?</p>
            <p n="5">V. Are there any who travel abroad and appoint meetings that are not recommended as miniſters; or do any recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended miniſters appoint meetings contrary to our diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline?</p>

               <pb n="132" facs="unknown:037474_0081_100D13288A5E82B0"/>VI. Are miniſters and elders in love and unity one with another, and with the meetings whereunto they belong?</p>
            <p>And let miniſters and elders dwell in that life which gives ability to labour ſucceſsfully in the church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Which meetings are to be held in the following manner, viz.</p>
            <p>The miniſters and elders of each monthly meeting, are to meet once in three months, and, after ſome time ſpent in ſolid retirement, to proceed to read and prepare anſwers to the queries, ſuitable to the ſtate of the members thereof; from which preparative meeting a ſuitable number of friends are to be appointed as repreſentatives to attend the quarterly meeting of miniſters and elders with ſaid anſwers, and ſuch other buſineſs as the preparative meeting may direct. The quarterly is compoſed of all the preparative meetings of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and elders within the quarter, where the queries, with the anſwers from the preparatives, are to be read, and the import of thoſe anſwers to be entered on their minutes, and a copy thereof ſent by their repreſentatives to the yearly meeting of miniſters and elders, containing a juſt account of the ſtate of the meetings from which they are ſent; by which an opportunity may be given for ſuitable advice to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered by that meeting, which is held on the ſeventh day of the week preceding the yearly meeting of diſcipline, beginning at the tenth hour; where a ſuitable number of elders are to be appointed, to the overſight of the meetings for worſhip during the yearly meeting, to adviſe as they find occaſion, and make ſuch report to the adjournments of the meeting as they may ſee neceſſary; and the like appointment to be made by the quarterly meetings of miniſters and elders,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:037474_0082_100CDAF28722E398"/>
to the overſight of the publick meetings during the time of the quarterly meetings.</p>
            <p>And ſaid meetings of miniſters and elders are not in any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to interfere with any part of the exerciſe of the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the church belonging to the yearly, or any ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate meeting for diſcipline.</p>
            <p>And as the fountain of all good is, from time to time, opening among us the ſpring of living miniſtry, it is greatly deſired, that miniſters and elders may ſo dwell under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence, as to be able to diſcover, what offering in come from the right ſpring, and what do nor, and thereby be qualified to be as nurſing fathers, and nurſing mothers, to ſuch that are young in the miniſtry; and may with all <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <head>MEETING FOR SUFFERINGS.</head>
            <p>THE meeting for ſufferings was appointed by the yearly meeting in 1758, and the year following the ſubject more fully engaging attention, the meeting for ſufferings was eſtabliſhment, and the ſervices thereof more fully ſtated, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the following minute, viz.</p>
            <p>The meeting for ſufferings are to take under their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the caſes of any of our brethren who are ſubjected to ſufferings for the teſtimony of truth, and repreſent ſuch caſes as they may think proper to thoſe in authority, in order to obtain redreſs; to pay attention to any bills that may be brought forward in the legiſlature that may likely affect our religious teſtimony, and to make application when they may judge proper. The ſaid meeting for ſufferings is to be conſidered as repreſentatives on behalf of the yearly meeting, and to appear in any matter where the intereſt and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth may render it neceſſary; and as there may be ſometimes a neceſſary expenſe attending the tranſaction of ſome part of their buſineſs, the treaſurer is requeſted to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ſaid meeting with money neceſſary for ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. 1759.</p>
            <p>It is concluded, that the meeting for ſufferings have liberty to take into conſideration the purchaſing and diſtributing ſome uſeful books amongſt friends and others, and act in matters of that nature according as to them may appear moſt likely to promote the principles of truth, and our Chriſtian teſtimony. 1783.</p>

            <p>It appears by the minutes of the yearly meeting in 1799, that a new appointment of the meeting for ſufferings took place, to be conſtituted in the following manner, viz. That the yearly meeting appoint twenty-four friends for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that each quarter appoint four; that thoſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the quarterly meeting of Weſtbury and Purchaſe, unite with thoſe appointed by the yearly meeting in conſtituting the meeting for ſufferings; and that thoſe appointed by the quarterly meetings of Nine-Partners and Eaſton, be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as correſponding members with the ſaid meeting, and to attend as members thereof, as often as their diſtant ſituation may permit, and to them appears right and conſiſtent; and that they pay particular attention to matters that may be of a ſuffering nature, or concern the meeting for ſufferings; to give timely notice of all ſuch caſes to that meetings; and that in all matters of moment, one or more of their number attend the meeting for ſufferings therewith, if reaſonably in their power. And the ſaid meeting for ſufferings are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to attend to the buſineſs which may come before them agreeable to former inſtructions, and the principles upon which that meeting was founded—To meet at the time and place the late meeting for ſufferings adjourned to, and to take up and purſue the buſineſs left on the minutes of that meeting.</p>

            <head>MEETING-HOUSES AND GROUND.</head>
            <p>IT is recommended to the quarterly and monthly meetings to make timely and careful inſpection into the ſituation of the titles of meeting-houſes, burial-ground, and other eſtates which have been veſted in truſtees, and by them held for the uſe and benefit of the ſociety at large, or of any of thoſe meetings, ſo that, if it ſhould appear needful by the death of any ſuch truſtees or otherwiſe, due and ſeaſonable care may be taken to appoint ſome others to the truſt, that friends may avoid future difficulties, and the riſk of being deprived of ſuch eſtates. And it is further recommended, that quarterly and monthly meetings reſpectively, as the caſe may require, keep exact records of all ſuch truſts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances; and alſo that a clear and regular account be kept by each reſpective meeting of the place where, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with whom the papers, minutes and records, belonging to our religious ſociety, are from time to time depoſited, wherein due care ſhould be taken to lodge them with ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able friends.
