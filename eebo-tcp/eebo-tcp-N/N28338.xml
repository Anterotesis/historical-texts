            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF AUGUSTUS VON KOTZEBUE. WRITTEN BY HIMSELF. MY LITERARY LIFE.</head>
            <p>AS an author, I have experienced both good and bad success, both in a high degree, both frequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited. I flatter myself that it may be useful to young men desirous of entering upon the slippery career of literature, to read the history of a man, who has not reached the goal indeedâ€”for how few ever do reach it!â€”but who has so far advanced before them in the progress towards it; one who, without ceremony, joins their circle, and relates without disguise when he fell, when he erred, and when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; where he enjoyed the assistance of the Nine, and where he mistook the ravings of a Bacchante for the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Muse.</p>
            <p>Come hither, then, ye inexperienced youths, who have, for the first time, dipped the tip of your tongue in the honey of Parnassus, and think it desirable because it is sweet; sit down and listen to me. You see I am in the vein; my soul is unconstrained, and my lips are opened to confess with candour when I have been deluded by vanity, and when my mind has been warmed with the feelings of the true and the beautiful.</p>
            <p>Rise then! rise before me, ye fairy phantoms of my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py childhood! In remembrance you now scarce form a part of the being I now am! Rise and hover round me, ye gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle shades!â€”Gracious Providence! suffer once more those delightful hours to rise out of the ocean of the past, like a dim mist before my fancy!</p>
            <p>Seize then the fleeting shades as they pass!â€”Seest thou there that boy who hangs with rapt attention on his mother's tongue, as she reads to him and his sister some winter even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:037766_0006_100F471516CFDFD0"/>
the interesting tale?â€”That boy was yourself!â€”Seest thou again how he makes the chair his table, and the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool his chair? See how he devours the romance, while ball and playthings lie neglected in the corner!â€”That boy was yourself!</p>
            <p>My honored motherâ€”Heaven be praised she still lives, she hears my grateful acknowledgmentsâ€”My good mother, when but a very young widow, denied herself many of the pleasures and enjoyments of life, to devote herself entirely, to the education of her children. She possessed taste, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sensibility, and a rich portion of patient maternal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. With these qualities, her efforts could not be wholly unsuccessful. She provided preceptors of different kinds, but to her own discernment and taste I owe more than to the tutors to whose care my instruction was confided.</p>
            <p>In the evening I used to read to her in the parlour. The first book that made a lively impression on me was a Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tales selected from all languages, then in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; the next was Don Quixote; Robinson Crusoe then engrossed my fancy, and I wished myself the possessor of some desert island.</p>
            <p>Even in my sixth year I began to compose rude essays in verse; not long after I made my first dramatic effort. I made a comedy, which was just the length of an octavo page. I was sensible, indeed, that it ought to be much longer, in order to resemble a comedy; but who was to teach me the art of spinning out the thread, and expanding my materials?</p>
            <p>I now come to that incident of my life, which, in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, produced the greatest influence on my charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and from my tenderest childhood irrevocably destined me to be a dramatic writer. The late Abt, the player, came with his strolling company to Weimar. Since I possessed any power of thought, there had been no players in Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and my curiosity was unbounded. Musaeus, the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent Musaeus, who was attached to me from a child, offered to take me to the theatre.</p>
            <p>I went with a kind of reverential awe; my expectation was wound up to the highest pitch. The piece was Klop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock's Death of Adam. Musaeus placed me before him on a bench, that I might see over the heads of the spectators. The curtain drew up. I was all ear, all eye. Not a word, not a movement escaped me. Never had I before experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced such powerful impressions. I returned home en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted. Robinson Crusoe and the desert island disappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The theatre now engrossed my whole soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:037766_0007_100F4718C2177620"/>
My joy, therefore, was unbounded, when the Dutchess Amelia, that favorite of the Muses, established a theatre at Weimar. Several of the most celebrated performers of the time came there, and, among others, the admirable Eckhof. I never omitted any opportunity of going to the play, and I wondered that those who could do what they pleased, could prefer any other species of entertainment. As a proof of my attention, I could repeat the whole of Lessing's Emilia Galotti without ever having had the book in my hand. To the honor of the fashionable world at Weimar, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess indeed that Emilia Galotti was very often performed, and always to full houses.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile I was a pupil of Musaeus in the Gymnasium at Weimar. Among other things, we had every Saturday an hour dedicated to the reading of little poetical attempts. At this period the rage for ballets was at its height, and the magazines swarmed with terrific stories of chivalry and ghosts. I composed a ballet in the taste of the times. It contained abundance of murder and ghosts; a Spirit read a lecture on vice, and the sinner was at length carried away by the Devil.</p>
            <p>I read this performance the first Saturday after it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and judge my raptures when, after it was finished, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saeus pronounced those words which I shall never forget: "Well, very well! From what magazine have you taken this?" With what triumph did I reply, that it was my own composition! "Really!" answered Musaeus: "Bravo! go on." Nothing could exceed my transports at this pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric, and my poetic propensity was confirmed.</p>
            <p>At this time of life every thing is imitation, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there is not a single original idea in a man's head till he is of an age to propagate his species. Every thing I now made was only an imitation of the book I had last read. I wrote a comedy called All's Well that Ends Well, which I believe had a strong resemblance to the Count of Olsbach. Goethe used to visit in our house; he heard of my comedy, and was so condescending, or so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, as to ask a reading of it. By this wish he highly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified my mother; and this probably was his object, for I never heard more of the comedy. This able man, however, in my boyish days always treated me with great kindness.</p>
            <p>In my sixteenth year I went to Jena. At first my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was principally directed to the acquisition of the dead and living languages, and in both these my knowledge was considerably increased. At Jena my partiality for the stage
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:037766_0008_100F471A4BDA0EC0"/>
still continued. Before my arrival, there was a private the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre established among the students, and it was one of my first objects to be admitted into the association. As it is not customary for ladies to appear in such theatres, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my youth, female characters of the younger sort were often assigned to me. My propensity for rhyming likewise continued, and I produced a number of poetic tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles.</p>
            <p>In my eighteenth year I undertook to write a Romance, which I finished. It consisted of eight or ten sheets, and, in my opinion at the time, was nothing inferior to Goethe's Werther. The story indeed was much more terrific; for my hero precipitated himself from the top of a high rock, and was dashed to pieces. This performance I sent to Weygand, then publisher of most fashionable romances at Leipzic. After waiting some time, however, I had the mortification to receive an answer from him, in which he told me that the manuscript was at my service, and desiring me to order payment of the postage of it! I never, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, enquired after it.</p>
            <p>In the year 1779 I returned to Jena from the visit I had paid to my sister then lately married, and applied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable zeal to the study of jurisprudence. I likewise at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the professors of history, logic, and metaphysics, and continued to improve myself in modern languages.</p>
            <p>I this year produced a tragedy called Charlotte Trank, which was performed at our private theatre, and I myself enacted one of the principal characters. The reception of it, however, was rather cold. Soon after I wrote a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which was much better received, and, as far as I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, contained some tolerable comic touches. I likewise instituted a poetic club, from which I derived considerable improvement.</p>
            <p>In my nineteenth year I returned to Weimar, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the Pandects with great industry; was examined by the Government, and admitted Advocate. While I wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for clients, I myself continued a zealous client of the Muses. The summer after my return, I wrote several little things, which I am not now ambitious to recall into notice. I likewise wrote some Tales, which were published with my name by Dyk, at Leipzie, with an hundred and fifty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by some other hand. Several little dramatic pieces were likewise the produce of my partiality for the theatre.</p>
            <p>In 1781 I went to Petersburgh. For some time I repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my turn for poetic pursuits, but I again began occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

to indulge my ruling propensity. There was a German theatre at Petersburgh. It was then in a very indifferent state; but soon after it was put in the number of the royal theatres, and the direction of it given to my friend General Bawr, of the artillery, a German. I now again found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in my element.</p>
            <p>I wrote a tragedy in five acts, called Demetrius Czar of Moscow. By a whimsical circumstance the representation of this piece was nearly prohibited. In the history Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius was by many called an impostor. In my play I found it convenient to make him a hero. It turned out, however, that there was an old proclamation of Peter the Great, in which this same Demetrius was declared to be an impostor. With much difficulty, however, the piece was allowed to be performed; after I had in a very formal manner been made to declare that I was perfectly satisfied of the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Demetrius, and the justice of the proclamation, and that the freedom which I had used in my play was merely a <hi>licentia poetica.</hi> I like wise wrote a comedy, called The Nun and the Chambermaid, which was performed with great success. It was never published, and the copy of it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally lost.</p>
            <p>In the year 1782, some of my friends who had influence at court, proposed to procure me a place, and to facilitate their exertions I was requested to write a small volume of Tales and Fables for young Princes, to be dedicated to the young Grand Duke. Though I felt no great call for such a task, I complied; and the volume was printed in a most superb manner by the direction of one of my friends. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, that I was not qualified for this kind of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I resolved, after the work had proceeded a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble length, to repay the publisher for his expence, and to bury the four sheets which were finished in eternal oblivion.</p>
            <p>Ye who so often and so loudly accuse me of vanity, to my Fables I appeal as the proof of your falsehood! Their suppression cost me some hundred rubles, but my vanity not a sigh.</p>
            <p>I now come to the period when I went to reside at Revel. Soon after this I wrote two plays, The Hermit of Formen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera, and Adelaide of Wulfingen. The former was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at a private theatre, and my propensity for the stage revived. To this propensity the people of Revel are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for a theatre, which for the last ten years has had an excellent company, and can boast of performers of no common merit. It was opened with a piece of mine, called
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:037766_0010_100F471E5D6786E0"/>
Every Fool has his Cap. The piece bore a striking resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to Moliere's Miser, and I have buried it among my papers.</p>
            <p>In autumn, 1787, I was seized with a severe illness, which for several years reduced me to a state between life and death; or, what is worse than death, a state of gloomy dejection of spirits. In the very height of this malady, I wrote Misanthropy and Repentance <note n="*" place="bottom">The Stranger.</note>, and soon after The Indians in England. Both of them were finished within about eight or nine weeks. Never in my life, either before or since, did I feel such copiousness of ideas, such vigour of imagination, such fertility of diction: and I believe it to be undeniable that there are some kinds of maladies (among which may particularly be included those which increase the irritability of the nerves) which elevate the powers of the mind to an unusual height; just as, according to the story, a diseased muscle forms a pearl.</p>
            <p>In the year 1790, I wrote The Virgin of the Sun, The Child of Love <note n="*" place="bottom">Lover's Vows.</note>, and Brother Moritz the Humourist. I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise proceeded in the collection of my smaller works.</p>
            <p>Upon Misanthropy and Repentance many foolish things were said and written at the time. Among other things, it was objected that it was defective in poetic justice, because, by an unconditional forgiveness, I had restored the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to the enjoyment of all the pleasures of life. Whether any forgiveness could completely remove the cruel punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which her crime carried with it; whether such a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as Eulalia <note n="â€ " place="bottom">Called Adelaide, or Mrs. Huller, in the play as performed hero.</note>, with a conscience so awakened, could ever again be happy, are questions which nobody thought it worth while to ask, except Mr. Ziegler, who, however, took up the whole affair erroneously, and, by the unjustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able freedom of calling Eulalia's seducer from the dead, completely changed the nature of the case. I therefore wrote the Noble Lie <note n="â€¡" place="bottom">Translated for the New-York theatre under the title of The Stranger's Birth Day.</note>, in which, although certainly there appears a girl fallen from virtue, a circumstance on which the impure imagination of Reviewers continues to dwell, unquestionably prevails the purest moral that ever was inculcated from the pulpit or the stage.</p>
            <p>In 1790, I experienced one of the severest dispensations of Providence, in the death of an amiable wife. Grief for this loss drove me to Paris, and the account of this excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:037766_0011_100F4722298BB248"/>
I published under the title of The Flight to Paris. This book was likewise severely attacked by some critics.</p>
            <p>Full of indignation against the Parisians, of whose exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses I had been an eye-witness, on my return to Mentz I wrote The Female Jacobin Club, a farce not without some humour. My friend Huber, however, because he happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of a different political creed from me, fell foul of it in the most violent manner. Nevertheless, despotism is to me as hateful as it is to him; and this I testified soon after in my Philosophical Sketch of Louis XIV. My publisher at Strasburgh sent me the work in manuscript, and the correspondence which I had with him on the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, was broken open before it reached me. I complained to our minister at Frankfort on the subject, who took my side; but it was alledged at Mentz that the letters were open before they arrived there, and I never was able to learn who it really was who did me the honor to mistake me for a spy, or a red-capped Jacobin. It seems to be my fate, that while Mr. Huber and Co. exclaim against me as an advocate of despotism, the despots around consider me as a dangerous democrat, worthy of their most jealous atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I could give signal examples of this, if a man were at liberty to tell all he could.</p>
            <p>Once in my life I had the weakness to write a book in complaisance to another. It was the book on Nobility. I could say a great deal on this subject, but I am not at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do it. If the world knewâ€”and perhaps they may one day knowâ€”into what equivocal reputation of a certain kind I have been thrown by the opinions, which both before and since I have expressed, and which have been so egregious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly misrepresented; if they knew how my most confidential private correspondence was turned against me; if they knew what inducements I had, and from whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, they would decide upon that production upon quite different grounds; they would take into view not only the author, but the citizen and the father. I confess, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that my inconsiderate complaisance laid me open in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral points to the attacks of criticism; but for attack from those with whom I had lived in habits of friendship, I was not prepared.</p>
            <p>All that I have written since has been received by the public with approbation, and by the critics announced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out approbation. These are, Count Benyowsky, The Death of Rolla <note n="*" place="bottom">Pizarro in Peru.</note>, The Youngest Children of my Fancy, Poverty and Honor, The Man of Forty Years, The Negro Slaves,
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:037766_0012_100F4723B36CCF68"/>
The Chace <note n="*" place="bottom">Der Wildfang.</note>, The Count of Burgundy, The Defamers <note n="â€ " place="bottom">The Force of Calumny.</note>, False Shame, and La Peyrouse <note n="â€¡" place="bottom">In addition to this catalogue we can addâ€”Sultan Wampum; The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; Family Connexions; Self-Immolation; The Children of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory; and The Peevish Man, which have been published; and six which were finished and sold to various European theatres as long ago as the 11th of June 1799: The names, as given in a letter of that date addressed to William Dunlap, are as follows: The Epigram, in four acts: The Reward of Truth, in five acts: Johanna von Montfaucon, in five acts: The Writing Desk, in four acts: The Two Klingsbergs, in four acts: and The Wise Woman in the Woods, in five acts.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Many of my plays have had the good fortune to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into French, Dutch, Danish, Polish, Russian, Italian <note n="Â§" place="bottom">He had not, when this was written heard of the great success of his dramas in this country.</note>; a new thorn in the side of the Reviewers! A few days ago I received the following piece of intelligence in a letter from Moscow: "Your play, the Child of Love, was as often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, and with more applause here than The Marriage of Figaro in Paris. It is very well translated into Russian."</p>
            <p>Is it not matter of surprise, that at the same time, and in so many countries, the Public should every where have judged wrong, and approved of things upon which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views had pronounced irrevocable sentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?â€”The investigation of that phenomenon, however, I must reserve for the continuation of this article on some other occasion. What may follow I must beg to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the defence of a man accused; for the critics have so often charged me at the bar of their judges and mine, the Public, that it would seem a contempt for that tribunal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to take the trouble to answer. In this view I certainly may have some claim to indulgence. Yet shall it be my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as far as it is in my power, to intersperse with flowers so dry a subject, and never forget what Beaumar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chais so well observes: <hi>"Faut-il, parce qu'on a raison, donner des vapeurs Ã  son lecteur? et faire secher d'ennui les magistrats? Leur Ã©tat n'est que trop pÃ©nible!"</hi>
               <note n="â€–" place="bottom">Because you are in the right, are you to give your readers the spleen, or kill the judges with ennui? Their situation is irksome enough already!</note>

                     <p>Ah, there it is! there it is! How can a child of a genteel family think of sleeping half her life like a dormouse?</p>

                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed I can't help it, mama. After sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per I am <hi>so</hi> sleepy, that if I did not go to bed, I should certainly nod in my chair.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>That's because you cat. A shocking vulgar custom. You may know a lady of quality by her complaints. Thank heaven, I have not known an hour of health in my life.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lis.</speaker>
                     <p>That accounts, madam, for the air of soft languor which diffuses itself over your person, and renders your manners so interesting.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>Dear Lisette, you know men are tyrants; and how should we weak creatures dare to trample under foot the rights of the strong, if we could not render our delicacy interesting? Nervous complaints, cramps and hysterics have metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosed many a lordly master into a supple slave. But these are things which little girls can't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand: go, child, into my closet, read in the prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, and take care of the lap-dog.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>

                     <p>He went a hunting very early this morning.</p>

                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>Poor man! Anxiety deprives him of rest. It is strange how <hi>hard</hi> some people take the <hi>soft</hi> passion. What think you, Lisette, shall I marry him?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lis.</speaker>
                     <p>Consult your heart, madam.</p>

                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh, horribly vulgar! No, no, those times are past, when the heart was suffered to play the master and lead blindfolded reason in chains. Love is a good servant, but a bad master. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is a hateful custom; but, being established,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037766_0034_100F47585C4C3B70"/>
one must conform to it, as to the afternoon's nap in Spain. But woe to the fool who bends her neck where she was born to govern.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lis.</speaker>
                     <p>But with Mr. Piffleberg?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>True, there I run no risk of enslaving myself; and that is no small recommendation. His estate, it is true, is mortgaged; but he is an honest creature, and since one must have a male animal about one, as well him as another. To be sure he is a little too rough and noisy, but he has a great deal of nature about him, and I love na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!â€”Lisette, where are my other teeth?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>In your bed-chamber, madam.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>This man seems really attached to me: but I must make trial of his talents for obedience.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lis.</speaker>
                     <p>And if he stands the trialâ€”?</p>

                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>Whyâ€”I am tired of rambling about thus alone: I want a husband to settle my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and take the trouble off my hands of quarrelling with innkeepers and postillions. Then when I consider that I have a little child to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide forâ€”</p>

                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>What young lady? A child who hardly knows her right hand from her left. I hope, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sette, you don't put things in her head.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lis.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh dear, madam! Mercy forbid! Why she hardly knows that she has a head.</p>

                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>Ah! Lisette, a mother's duty is a heavy burthen: then there is the lap-dog and the canary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds.â€”My future spouse will have enough to do.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lis.</speaker>
                     <p>You might easily get rid of the young lady.</p>

                     <speaker>Lis.</speaker>
                     <p>It would be a pity, to be sure, for poor Mopsy the lap-dog's sake, he is so attached to her.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>That alone would be sufficient. Come, Lisette, let me attend a little to my dress. No, no, as long as the dear lap-dog lives, Nannette must not think of marrying.</p>

                     <p>So ho! Dam'me the widow's up. I've been at some of my old blunders I suppose. I'm off the trackâ€”must call in. Don't take any thing amiss, widow. I am plain, but as honest as my spaniel; staunch as my pointer. A good fowling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece

should have a rusty coat; your polish startles the gameâ€”but clean within, widow; clean within! And what signifies a little rough casing, so as the heart has but its proper loading, well wadded and ramm'd.</p>

                     <speaker>M. B.</speaker>
                     <p>Very pretty, sir! Why not in the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan war?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pif.</speaker>
                     <p>Trojan war! When was that? Was that one of old Fred's? But damn all wars, they spoil sport. I love peace, and will marry you, even though you had gone to school with Methusalem. Therefore, widow, make no difficulty. Come with me to Piffleberg. My curateâ€”a damn'd good shotâ€”shall publish the banns, and then in God's nameâ€”be fruitful and multiply.</p>

                     <p>Not quite so fast, Mr. Sportsman. To win a lady or to shoot a partridge are two very different things. There is nothing so disgusting as one of your marriages which are concluded like a matter of bargain and sale; where there is no elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no moonlight assignation, no duel, no sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide to enliven the scene a little.</p>

                     <p>Suicide! A very lively affair to be sure, widow; but it may do as well <hi>after</hi> the ceremony. As to the duel, why I'm a damn'd good shot, crack! but who is there to sight with?</p>

                     <p>This is a public hall: people constantly passing and repassing.â€”But observe, sir. Yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der door leads to the garden. Here is the key to it. When the clock strikes twelve, the noon of night and hour of ghosts, I shall expect you here.</p>

                     <speaker>Pif.</speaker>

                     <p>What, sir? would you expose my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter? Besides, the garden is so much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant; the pure air and the nightingale's songâ€”and I shall myself be there.</p>

                     <p>Ha! ha! ha! Of all the foolish animals in creation, surely that species called man is the most so. A fellow hires himself to be shot at for six-pence a day, which is three pence less than boys give in England to shoot at a cock on Shrove-Tuesdayâ€”one day a cannon-ball takes off his legâ€”that is his day of honor. A foolish girl,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:037766_0057_100F478D4C556CC8"/>
who sighs for she knows not what, on a day called a wedding-day, bends her neck to the matrimonial yoke, and becomes the slave of a dunceâ€”that is her day of honor. Another, still more foolish, takes the veil and becomes a nun; on a certain day she is decorated for the sacrifice, renounces her reason, her senses, her friends, and the worldâ€”and <hi>that</hi> is her day of honor. The first gets a medal, the second a husband, and the thirdâ€”no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. Thus do the few make fools of the many, and the fools are dismissed, as fools ought to beâ€”with fools-caps.</p>

                     <p>The hour of trial has nearly arrived. Obedience, Mr. Piffleberg, obedience is the test. If he does not make use of the garden-key, he shall find my heart shut to him forever. Confess it, Salome, thou wishest him to prove worthy of

the reward; for, alas! she who has seen eight and forty summersâ€”hushâ€”let no one hear itâ€”age has betrayers enough; the tongue need not prove traitor. What is that? Why do the trees rustle so violently under the window? Don't I hear the window move? Yes, I feel by the blowing of the wind that it opens. Should Piffleberg, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give me a proof of his affectionate obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, come through the window!â€”Oh, delightful thought!â€”What heart could resist such romantic love? I will listen, however.</p>

                     <p>Yes, my lady, Mr. Piffleberg is my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! My mother was his house-keeperâ€”but, as her charms faded, the cruel man abandoned her, to seek her bread in the wide world with me, pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty babe, at her back.</p>

                     <p>As I grew up, I entered the service. I fought in Russia against the Turks, and in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders against the French. My scars bear testimony to my valor. Meanwhile, my father, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing my plaintive letters, afforded me neither countenance or support. Accident brought me at length to this town.

                     <p>Is heart-beating a sin?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>I know not. But I had a governess who used to say, "Abstain from every thing which makes the heart beat or the blood rise in your cheeks."</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>I suppose her worn-out heart had not blood enough to spare a blush to her wrinkled cheeks on any occasion.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>I pray you bring a light hither.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>Why?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>You always ask me "why?" And I know not. But something within whispers, "ask him to bring a light."</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>And what will that "something" say, if I refuse?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>It will be unquiet and say, "Those who seek darkness will do evil."</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>Can one not do evil by the light?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
                     <p>No. Surely one would be ashamed of oneself.</p>

                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>But consider, dear Nannette, if there was a light hereâ€”but a step from us is your mother's chamberâ€”How easily might we be betrayed!</p>

                     <p>O yes, I love you dearly:â€”but to be alone together, certainly is not right. I wish it were day-break!</p>

                     <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
                     <p>Your impatience will spoil all. We shall be surprised, you will be torn from me, and then you will be lost to me forever.</p>

                     <p>So! I give it up! Dam'me if all my hounds will catch this hare. He's an old foxâ€”up to all the tricks. Beating about through thick and thin, and what have I got by it? Wet feetâ€”car-acheâ€”and rheumatism in my arm. I will not go and have my head combed by the widow in the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. No, no, there's no sport in that. I had rather stay here till day-light, and strive to nap it a little upon the softest chair I can find. <hi>(Gropes about and finds the chair on which Molkus sleeps.)</hi> So, so! Now we will try if an old sportsman can sleep without rocking after a wild-goose chace. <hi>(Sits.)</hi>

                     <p>Thunder and lightning! The devil may take you and your daughter too! I am tired of being fooled. The moment I set a foot in your house, all hell is let loose to torment me. One damn'd fellow blinds me with hair-powderâ€”Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calls me his fatherâ€”Another impostor talks of my little Billyâ€”And now, when I had the young lady fast, she is changed into this pest of a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid! Dam'me the place is worse than a mad-house. No, widow, I'm off. I've chang'd my mind. I am poor to be sureâ€”but rather freedom and a roasted potatoe, than to be loaded with a foolish old woman on one side and a bag of gold on the other! Yhoix! Tally ho! Yhoix! Dam'me, I'm off, crack!</p>

            <head>NOTES ON THE WILD-GOOSE CHACE.</head>
            <p>THE title of this play in the original is <hi>Der Wildsang,</hi> which is equivalent to the English phrase of <hi>The Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap.</hi> The English reviewers gave <hi>Wild Oats</hi> as their translation of <hi>Wildsang;</hi> and I should have adopted it, had not Mr. O'Keefe preoccupied that title.</p>
            <p>Page 9. <hi>Song.</hi>] One acknowledgment will suffice for all the songs. They are added by the translator, who must therefore be chargeable with their faults.</p>
            <p>Page 10. <hi>We may know,</hi> &amp;c.] Here eighteen words, including the reference, are added by the translator.</p>
            <p>Page 11. <hi>Thus let the pupil,</hi> &amp;c.] Fourteen words are added.</p>
            <p>Same page. <hi>Nay, but my good,</hi> &amp;c.] Ten words are added.</p>
            <p>Page 12. <hi>Angel's head and swan's,</hi> &amp;c.] Eleven words are introduced in place of the originalâ€”"I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand you." These may serve as specimens of the freedom with which I have translated this play. To mark every such variation would be trifling and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
            <p>Page 22. Between the words <hi>"Because your's was so"</hi> and <hi>"But you do not know,"</hi> twenty-eight words are add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the following lines are omitted.</p>

               <p>I do not say so. A man may win at dice or draw a prize in the lottery. But I pray you make not your choice until the romantic fire of youth is exhausted.</p>

               <p>That may be a long time. I have lately see a Issland's "Old Bachelor" represented, and poor <hi>Reinhold</hi> has made such an impression on me, that I am resolved to marry over head and heels.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Right, dear Mr. Felix; I will prove Nannette with all the caution of a lover.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
               <p>That, indeed, is all a lover can promise.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
               <p>In the first place, I have written her this letter, in which I tell her that I adore her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! the best possible mode of gaining a true knowledge of her.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
               <p>If I only knew how to convey the letter to her.</p>

               <p>In time we pluck roses.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
               <p>But when the rose is already expanded, there is no time to be lost.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
               <p>You have called me your friend. Well, then, make use of my eyes. Love has not varied my vision by putting spectacles on my nose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
               <p>Is love a dealer in spectacles? Or do you think it is better to borrow the microscope from the hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac? He that breaks a man's spectacles is entitled to little thanks for the action."</p>

            <p>Page 29. Lisette's soliloquy is added to introduce the song and close the act, as I thought it necessary to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the first act on account of its excessive length.</p>
            <p>Page 30. A few introductory words became necessary, for the above reason, in beginning the second act.</p>
            <p>Page 31. <hi>So ho!

            <p>Page 42. <hi>Ah ha! my lady, pardonnez,</hi> &amp;c.] I took the liberty to make my hair-dresser a Frenchman, and in the representation have seen no reason to repent the change.</p>
