            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Fathers and Brethren, the governing Paſſions of the human Soul, which are indeed the great Sources of Action, are <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear.</hi> Now the Religion of JESUS contains Arguments no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly adapted to influence both, which is indeed its peculiar Glory. Here are the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attractives to allure our <hi>love</hi> and ſtrike our <hi>ingenuity</hi> that ever were preſented to the human Mind. I mean redeeming Love and Goodneſs, the aſtoniſhing condeſcention of God himſelf in aſſuming our Nature, under the ruinous Circumſtances conſequent to our Apoſtacy, and therein enduring voluntarily and patiently, in his Name, Body and Soul, all that Contempt and Miſery which our Sins demerited, in order to reconcile us to GOD, and ſave us from Wrath and Ruin. O matchleſs Mercy! O amazing Goodneſs! O the intollerable, incomprehenſible and inxpreſſible Agonies and Pains our dear dear, Lord endured! One would think that the mentioning of this <hi>Love</hi> alone, was ſufficient to conſtrain Mankind to follow the <hi>Redeemer</hi>'s Standard, and to <hi>dare</hi> to be Holy. But ſad Experience proves the Contrary. Degenerate Mankind, while under the Dominion of Sin, are almoſt wholly loſt to all ſenſe of Ingenuity and Gratitude. Nothing truly Great and Noble has the habitual aſcendant in them. No! Immoderate Self-love is the ſecret Spring of all their Motions, and therefore it's neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to alarm thoſe <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Souls out of their fatal Security and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, by Arguments of <hi>Terror,</hi> that hereby they may be brought to a ſight and ſenſe of their Danger, and conſequently conſtrained to the earneſt Uſe of Means to obtain an eſcape.</p>
            <p>THIS the primitive Miniſters of CHRIST were well aware of, as the Text I have choſen to diſcourſe upon informs us. They having had the Experience of the <hi>Terrors</hi> of God upon their own Minds, before their cloſure with JESUS, and having known their Neceſſity, Influence and Uſe, did labour by the ſame Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others to be Holy, <hi>Knowing the Terrors of the LORD we perſwade Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND methinks among all the Arguments of <hi>Terror</hi> graſp'd in the ſacred Volumn, none is more affecting and awful than that of the <hi>General Judgment,</hi> and this is what our Text refers to, and is therefore the Subject of our preſent Meditations.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>General Judgment,</hi> my Brethren, is one of the moſt grand
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006427_0003_1028E4EFF1A405E8"/>
and important Events that comes within the Compaſs of human Knowledge; the Conſideration whereof ſhould ſummons all our Powers to the moſt reverend and deep Attention.</p>
            <p>THAT there is a JUDGMENT to come, appears from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subordination of Man to God, as a Creature to his Creator, a Subject to his Prince, and a Servant to his Maſter.</p>
            <p>FROM this <hi>Subordination,</hi> correſpondent Obligations do reſult; for the Neglect or Performance of which, it is but reaſonable they ſhould Account, and receive <hi>Rewards</hi> accordingly, otherwiſe the aforeſaid Relations and Obligations would be vain and to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>THERE are likewiſe natural Relations among Men, and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions which give ground to ſeveral Duties of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> by the neglect of which others may ſuffer great Injury, of which they can ſometimes get no redreſs. Is it not then moſt juſt and reaſonable that ſuch Caſes ſhould be referred to the common Patron of RIGHT, in order to be ſuitably rewarded? This was the Apoſtle's Judgment in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he aſſures us, <hi>that it is a righteous Thing with God, to recompence Tribulation to thoſe that trouble his People, and to them who are troubled reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND are there not many ſecret good and bad Diſpoſitions, which are not nor cannot be here awarded? Then is it not reaſonable that there ſhould be a Time when both ſhall be diſcloſed and obtain an anſwerable recompence?</p>
            <p>THERE have been, and no doubt are in the World, ſuch Perſons who commit great Injuries, and yet no Juſtice can be got of them, either becauſe of their Policy, their Power, or Authority: Is it not neceſſary therefore that there ſhould be a ſupreme Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, before which ſuch grand, inſolent and ungovernable Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals ſhould be arraigned? Not to ſay that Conſcience accuſes for the moſt ſecret Crimes, and preſages a Judgment to come; yea the common Senſe of Mankind dictates the reaſonableneſs of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the Guilty. Does not every Perſon when he ſees ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guilty of groſs Crimes, judge it unfit that he ſhould eſcape with Impunity? And will not the Mind be grated with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation or Grief by beholding the Inocent and Beneficent Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering?</p>
            <p>IS not a <hi>future Judgment,</hi> my Brethren, when eternal Rewards ſhall be diſpenſed, needful to excite Men to Vertue and Goodneſs, and to reſtrain them from Vice? Certainly Men are by Nature prone to a preſent ſenſible Good, which the fears of a greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and the Hopes of a greater Good, are neceſſary to turn them from.</p>
            <p>FEAR and <hi>Hope</hi> are doubtleſs the main <hi>Springs</hi> which turn the Wheels of human Action. Now this life ſcarcely affords Rewards which overpoize the Difficulties that attend Piety and Vertue; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can human Laws extend to all Actions, and hence, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle obſerves, <hi>if in this Life only we have Hope, we are of all Men the moſt miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006427_0003_1028E4EFF1A405E8"/>AGAIN, Human Society muſt disband without a <hi>Judgment</hi> to come: For how can that ſubſiſt without <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and can theſe be expected without Conſcience, and can that do its Office without <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> without a regard to a future reckoning?</p>
            <p>IF you enquire concerning the <hi>Judge,</hi> I anſwer, the abſolute Power of judging, inſeparably belongs to God the Father, he being our Creator, to his Judgment we ſtand obnoxious. But the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi> of this <hi>judicial</hi> Authority, is, for wiſe Purpoſes, committed to the Son.</p>
            <p>IT is neceſſary that the Judge ſhould be viſible, in order to the clearer Conviction and more ample Satisfaction of the Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> is a Branch of CHRIST'S <hi>Kingly Office,</hi> which the Father conferred upon him as a Reward of his mediatorial abaſure. Indeed it is an Office of two great emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to be conferred upon any other, to determine the final States of intelligent Beings; the <hi>Lamb is only worthy to take the Book of Judgment and open the Seals thereof, becauſe he hath redeemed us to God by his Blood.</hi> It is he alone who hath a Capacity for this Province, becauſe of his Omniſcience, Wiſdom and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>AND ſurely, <hi>Sirs,</hi> it is but right that the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould be veſted with a Power to reward his Friends, and cruſh his inveterate Enemies, that ſo the apparent diſhonours of his Croſs may be forever rol'd away.</p>
            <p>FARTHER, the Glories of God's Wiſdom and Love, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd in appointing ſo well qualified a Perſon, ſo meek, ſo loving, ſo merciful a Judge. Not to ſay, that this appointment likewiſe ſerves to beget in us, a Reverence of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> an Obſervance of his Laws, and an Imitation of his Example.</p>
            <p>AS to the <hi>Manner</hi> of the judicial Proceſs, the ſacred Scriptures give us the following account hereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Time is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it, which is called <hi>a Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT God hath regiſtered Men's Actions in the Book of his Omniſcience in order to it.</p>
            <p>THAT for this End, a Reſurrection of the Juſt and Unjuſt ſhall be effected by Almighty Power.</p>
            <p>THAT then all Perſons raiſed, ſhall be preſented before the Bar of God; <hi>I ſaw,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John, the Dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT every Thought, Word and Action ſhall be examined, <hi>God will bring to light the hidden Things of Darkneſs, and make manifeſt the Counſels of all Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT after this, a definitive Sentence ſhall paſs agreeable to Mans Actions, which ſhall be accordingly executed.</p>
            <p>THAT all Things ſhall be tranſacted in a fair and regular Manner, to the Conviction of all preſent.</p>
            <p>NOW, my dear and reverend Brethren, methinks the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what has been ſaid, ſhould excite us, who bear the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006427_0004_1028E4F180BFE118"/>
Character, unweariedly to endeavour <hi>(pro viribus)</hi> to <hi>alarm</hi> and <hi>perſwade</hi> a ſecure and obſtinate World, by <hi>the Terrors of the LORD,</hi> after the Apoſtolical Preſident in our Text, whatever <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> mutter to the Contrary, <hi>ſeeing that the whole need no Phyſician, but the ſick.</hi> Let us urge Sinners with the utmoſt Importunity and moſt ſolemn <hi>Pathos,</hi> to repent and believe the Goſpel; to fly from the Wrath to come to the great <hi>Redeemer</hi> for Shelter and Salvation.</p>
            <p>AND ſhould not the Thoughts of the ſolemn judicial Scene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, excite all, both Miniſters and People to watchfulneſs and ſobriety, <hi>for we know not when the Son of Man cometh, at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, Cock-crowing, or in the Morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR ſhould we be thereby leſs induced to <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>candor</hi> in our whole behaviour, and to the ſerious ſteady Performance of the ſecret Duties of Religion; which will be then openly and honourably mentioned, and graciouſly, but plentifully, Rewarded. O, Sirs! let us endeavour to have the Teſtimony of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in our favour, that <hi>in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Converſation in the World.</hi> O let us improve our <hi>Talents,</hi> for we are but Stewards, and muſt quickly give Account of our Stewardſhip. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>My Reverend Brethren, in order to improve to Purpoſe, the Talents which a gracious God has given us, is it not neceſſary to keep to the Buſineſs of our proper Province, <hi>(Hoc age, en tutois iſthi)</hi> and ſhould we not call to mind the notable Council of the famous <hi>German,</hi> who of a Miniſter of Religion became a Miniſter of State, and for ſome Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management being condemn'd to die, generouſly left for our Inſtruction this Diſtick.</p>
                  <p>Diſce meo exemplo, mandato munere fungi.</p>

            <p>LET us relieve Mens outward Wants as far as we have Ability and Opportunity: This, above all other Inſtances of Goodneſs, is particularized in the ſcriptural Deſcription we have of the <hi>General Judgment,</hi> I <hi>was Hungry and ye fed me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>O! let us forgive Injuries, <hi>he ſhall have Judgment without Mercy, who hath ſhewed no Mercy. If we forgive not Men their Treſpaſſes neither will God forgive ours.</hi>

            <p>O! let us beware of <hi>raſh judging, why doſt thou judge thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy Brother, for we ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment Seat of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
            <p>AND on the Contrary, dear Sirs, O let us labour to increaſe in that glorious Grace of LOVE, <hi>which hopes all Things, ſuffers long, and is kind, and is not eaſily provok'd.</hi> And let the Thoughts of the <hi>laſt Judgment</hi> deter us from Injuſtice, Covetouſneſs and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind and Behaviour. <hi>Let no Man go beyond and defraud his Neighbour, for God is the avenger of all ſuch.</hi> Seeing then that all theſe Things ſhall come to paſs, which the Scriptures
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006427_0004_1028E4F180BFE118"/>
ſpeak of the laſt <hi>Judgment, what manner of Perſons ought we to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Conſideration of the <hi>laſt Judgment</hi> may ſerve to keep us from <hi>Infidelity,</hi> becauſe of the Confuſions and Injuſtice that are in the World, for this is but a ſhort Time of Trial; after the Concluſion of this Drama, all Things will be put to Rights and appear in their proper Colours. What tho' we endure unjuſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives for a Time, God <hi>will bring forth the Righteouſneſs of his People as the Light, and their Judgment as the noon Day;</hi> and hence the Apoſtle obſerves, <hi>it was a ſmall Thing to him, to be judged of Man's Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW, <hi>Sirs,</hi> we ſhould be excited to examine our Sates, our Principles of Action, our Speeches and Works, and ſee whether they will ſtand the tryal of the <hi>laſt Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>METHINKS, dear Brethren, the Conſideration of the <hi>laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> may juſtly ſtrike <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Conſternation</hi> into every Tribe of Impeninents; if it be conſidered, that it ſhall be univerſal as to Perſons and Things, as well as impartial and irreverſible. God <hi>will bring to Judgment every Work, with every ſecret Thing;</hi> he will bring to light <hi>the hidden Things of Darkneſs, and make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Councils of the Heart,</hi> as I before obſerved.</p>
            <p>THE moſt ſecret impious Thought muſt then be diſcloſed, and the moſt diſguiſed Contrivances brought to the open light of <hi>Day;</hi> and it is but reaſonable it ſhould be ſo, ſeeing the moral Good and Evil of Actions much depend upon their Intention. The Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is a <hi>diſcerner of the Thoughts, and ſearcher of the Heart,</hi> will, in the Day of his coming, examine and open the ſecret Springs of the Actions of Men; and then likewiſe ſhall their Words be ſcan'd and judg'd; and this is but reaſonable, ſeeing they are the moſt natural Indications of the Temper and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Mind, and often do much Injury to the Names, Bodies and Eſtates of Men. Our Lord aſſures us, <hi>that Men muſt give an Account of every idle Word in that Day, (Mat.</hi> xii. 36, 37.) <hi>and that by our Words we ſhall be juſtifyed, and by our Words we ſhall be condemned.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> informs us, that <hi>Enoch,</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> propheſied of theſe Things ſaying, <hi>that the LORD ſhall come with with ten Thouſand of his Saints to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly of their ungodly Deeds and hard Speeches.</hi> How ſhall the <hi>lyar,</hi> the <hi>unjuſt Perſon,</hi> the <hi>whoremonger,</hi> the <hi>ſlanderer</hi> and <hi>back-biter</hi> then appear.</p>
            <p>AND every evil Action muſt then be ſtript of all its preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, and open'd in its horid deformity; yea and the Evils we have induced others to commit, we muſt then anſwer for. There a light ſhall be ſtruck into all the Works of Darkneſs, thro all the pretexts of Subtilty, and every impenitent Tranſgreſſor, with out Diſtinction, will be covered with Confuſion, and expos'd to contempt and ſcorn!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Alexanders</hi> and <hi>Nimrords</hi> of the Earth, and all the Sons of Violence, of Blood and Rapine, that have ſacrificed the Lives of

Thouſands to their Ambition and Avarice, and made Nations tremble before them, muſt ſtand appal'd before their Judge to receive their final Sentence: Then will they curſe the madneſs of their Arrogance, and <hi>cry to the Hills and Mountains to fall on them, and hide them from the Face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi> All the human Race muſt appear at the dreadful Summons.

At that Tribunal there will be no difference or reſpect of Perſons obſerved between the greateſt Prince and meaneſt Peaſant And that which makes the <hi>General Judgment</hi> the more ſolemn and dreadful, is that there will be no Appeal forever from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Judge.</p>
            <p>WITH what awful Solemnity does the holy Scriptures repreſent the Scene of the laſt Judgement, then, we are told, that <hi>there will be diſtreſs of Nations, with perplexity, the Sea roaring and Men's Hearts failing them for fear, that then the Sun ſhall be darkned and the Moon ſhall not give her Light, and all the Powers of Heaven be ſhaken;</hi> that the <hi>Archangel</hi>'s <hi>Trumpet ſhall ſound to the Extremities of the Earth, after which the Son of Man ſhall deſcend from the viſible Heavens in a Cloud, and appear in his own and in his Father</hi>'s <hi>Glory. Thouſands of Angels ſhall miniſter to him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſhall ſtand before him!</hi> The Son of GOD will come with Power and great Glory in flaming Fire, <hi>to take Vengeance on thoſe that know not GOD, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power. Then the Sea ſhall give up her Dead, and Death and Hell ſhall deliver up their Dead,</hi> and the whole Atmoſphere be in one awful uniform Blaze! <hi>The Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great Noiſe, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall melt with fervent Heat, the Earth alſo and all its Works ſhall be burnt up!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEN the Almighty Judge ſhall be ſeated upon his Saphire Throne from which the Earth and Heavens ſhall flee away.</p>
            <p>WHEN our bleſſed Saviour came to ſuffer for the Sins of the World, he came in the Form of a Servant, and vail'd his Glory with a <hi>clayie Mantle;</hi> he ſtoop'd to aſſume the Infirmities of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in the moſt humble Circumſtances, and was expoſed to Cruelty and Contempt: But when he comes as a Judge, he will aſſume his proper Greatneſs, and appear with a Splendor ſuitable to the Dignity of his Office, ſuitable to the Glory of his Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! <hi>All Nature ſhall tremble before him, and the Foundations of the Hills ſhall ſhake becauſe he is Wroth!</hi> The Sars ſhall ſtart from their Orbs, and the Canopy of the viſible Heavens ſhall ſhrivel up into a flaming ſcroll, and the whole Earth ſhall be a burning trembling Globe of Fire.

When all theſe amazing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents are brought to paſs, and that in a ſudden and tremenduous Manner, how ſhall the Wicked appear; when the <hi>Curtain</hi> between both Worlds is drawn, and all Inhabitants of Heaven, Earth, and Hell preſent themſelves to us at one View, how will it ſtrike the impenitent with Terror and Amazement, eſpecially when the final Sentence ſhall be pronounced, <hi>Go ye Curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will it be for all the Sons of Shame and Death, to behold univerſal Nature diſſolving in the moſt dreadful Agonies, and all the curious Works of Art covered with Flame and Ruin! To hear the Heavens roaring with dreadful Thunders, and the great Ocean bewailing the general Cataſtrophe, with the loudeſt Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs! To ſee the viſible Heavens cover'd with one ſheet of Fire, and ſending down burning Showers upon the reeling Earth! The ſulphurous Matter of which will doubtleſs catch fire and burſt its Bowels into burning Rivulets! How dreadful will it be to feel the Earth totter like a <hi>Tennis Ball</hi> with Earthquakes, and to hear the dreadful rumblings thereby cauſed in its Bowels; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the hideous Screeches of damned Men and Women! The whole Earth will be then like a burning <hi>Veſuvius</hi> or <hi>Aetna!</hi> Where will theſe poor Creatures fly for ſhelter who have no Friend in Heaven, or on Earth to help them in their Diſtreſs? What ſhame muſt cover their Faces? What Anguiſh rack their Hearts, when their ſecret Impieties are diſclos'd, before that vaſt Aſſembly of the Quick and Dead! How muſt a Sight of their Companions in Iniquity confound them and encreaſe their Woe and Horror?

            <p>O ſecure Sinners, your Eyes and Ears ſhall ſee and hear theſe Things! O what a ſcrole of Mourning and Lamentation and Woe ſhall then be opened before you?

            <p>SIRS, the ſtrongeſt Images we can form of the Majeſty of GOD, and the terrible Effects of his angry Reſentment are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely too feeble and languid to give an adequate Repreſentation thereof. O therefore <hi>let us kiſs the Son, leaſt he be angry and we periſh from the Way, when his Wrath is kindled but a little, bleſſed are all they that put their Truſt in him.</hi> By this may we all be hid in the great and terrible Day of GOD's Anger, thro' JESUS CHRIST our LORD.
