            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS by an act 6th Geo.

and to the actual interruption of the due intercourſe from Great-Britain and Ireland to the colonies, deeply affecting the navigation, trade, and manufactures of this kingdom, and of Ireland, and announcing farther an interruption of all exports from the ſaid colonies to Great-Britain, Ireland, and the Britiſh iſlands in America: Now, for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe ruinous miſchiefs, and in order to an equitable, honourable, and laſting ſettlement of claims not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently aſcertained and circumſcribed, May it pleaſe your moſt excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty that it may be declared, and be it declared, by the king's moſt excellent majeſty, by and with the advice and conſent of the lords ſpiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and commons in this preſent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſembled, and by the authority of the ſame, that the colonies of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica have been, are, and of right ought to be, dependent upon the imperial crown of Great-Britain, and ſubordinate unto the Britiſh parliament, and that the king's moſt excellent majeſty, by and with the advice and conſent of the lords ſpiritual and temporal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

Nevertheleſs, in order to quiet and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel groundleſs jealouſies and fears, be it hereby declared, That no military force, however raiſed, and kept accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to law, can ever be lawfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to violate and deſtroy the juſt rights of the people. Moreover, in order to remove, for ever, all cauſes of pernicious diſcord, and in due contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the vaſt increaſe of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and population in the colonies; and having at heart to render the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſo great a body of induſtrious ſubjects there more and more happy, by the ſacredneſs of property and of perſonal liberty, and of more extenſive and laſting utility to the parent king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by indiſſoluble ties of mutual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, confidence, trade, and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal benefits, Be it declared and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, by the king's moſt excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, by and with the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the lords ſpiritual and temporal and commons in this preſent parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſembled, and it is hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and enacted, by the authority of the ſame, That no tallage, tax, or other charge for his majeſty's revenue, ſhall
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014076_0008_0F92FE80ABE117E0"/>
be commanded or levied from Britiſh freemen in America, without common conſent, by act of provincial aſſembly there, duly convened for that purpoſe. And it is hereby further declared and enacted, by the king's moſt excellent majeſty, by and with the advice and conſent of the lords ſpiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and commons in this preſent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſembled, and by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſame, That it ſhall and may be lawful for delegates from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective provinces, lately aſſembled at Philadelphia, to meet in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs at the ſaid Philadelphia, on the 9th day of May next enſuing, in order then and there to take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the making due recognition of the ſupreme legiſlative authority and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending power of parliament over the colonies, as aforeſaid.—And moreover, may it pleaſe your moſt excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that the ſaid delegates to be in congreſs aſſembled, in manner aforeſaid, may be required, and the ſame are hereby required, by the king's majeſty ſitting in his parliament, to take into conſideration (over and above the uſual charge for ſupport of civil government
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014076_0009_0F92FE815F24CF10"/>
in the reſpective colonies) the making a free grant to the king, his heirs and ſucceſſors, of a certain perpetual reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, ſubject to the diſpoſition of the Britiſh parliament, to be by them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated as they in their wiſdom ſhall judge fit to the alleviation of the national debt: no doubt being had but this juſt, free aid, will be in ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable proportion as may ſeem meet and becoming from great and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colonies towards a parent country, labouring under the heavieſt burthens, which, in no inconſiderable part, have been willingly taken upon ourſelves and poſterity, for the defence, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and proſperity of the colonies.— And to this great end be it farther here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declared and enacted, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral congreſs (to meet at Philadelphia as aforeſaid) ſhall be, and is, hereby au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized and empowered (the delegates compoſing the ſame being firſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently furniſhed with powers from their reſpective provinces for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to adjuſt and fix the proportions and quotas of the ſeveral charges to be borne by each province reſpectively, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014076_0010_0F92FE822663AEB8"/>
the general contributory ſupply; and this, in ſuch fair and equitable meaſure, as may beſt ſuit the abilities and due convenience of all: Provided always, That the powers for fixing the ſaid quotas, hereby given to the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from the old provinces compoſing the congreſs, ſhall not extend to the new provinces of Eaſt and Weſt Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida, Georgia, Nova-Scotia, St. John's, and Canada; the circumſtances and abilities of the ſaid provinces being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the wiſdom of parliament in their due time: And in order to afford neceſſary time for mature deliberation in America, be it hereby declared, That the proviſions for aſcertaining and fixing the exerciſe of the right taxation in the colonies, as agreed and expreſſed by this preſent act, ſhall not be in force, or have any operation, until the delegates to be in congreſs aſſembled, ſufficiently authorized and empowered, by their reſpective provinces, to this end, ſhall, as an indiſpenſable condition, have duly recognized the ſupreme le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative authority, and ſuperintending power of the parliament of Great-Britain

over the colonies as aforeſaid: Always underſtood, That the free grant of an aid, as heretofore required and expected from the colonies, is not to be conſidered as a condition of redreſs, but as a juſt teſtimony of their affection: And whereas divers acts of parliament have been humbly repreſented, in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to his majeſty from America, to have been found grievous, in whole or in part, to the ſubjects of the colonies, be it hereby declared by the king's moſt excellent majeſty by and with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and conſent of the lords ſpiritual and temporal and commons in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent parliament aſſembled, and by the authority of the ſame, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of admiralty and vice-admiralty courts in America, ſhall be reſtrained within their ancient limits, and the trial by jury, in all civil caſes, where the ſame may have been aboliſhed, reſtored: And that no ſubject in America ſhall, in capital caſes, be liable to be indicted and tried for the ſame, in any place out of the province, wherein ſuch offence ſhall be alleged to have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor be deprived of a trial by his
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014076_0012_0F92FE87DCFAE260"/>
peers of the vicinage; nor ſhall it be lawful to ſend perſons indicted for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in any province of America, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other colony, or to Great-Britain, for trial: And be it hereby declared and enacted, by the authority aforeſaid, That all and every the ſaid acts, or ſo much thereof as are repreſented to have been found grievous, namely, the ſeveral acts of the 4th Geo. III. ch. 15 and ch. 34.—5th Geo. III. ch. 25.—6th Geo. III. ch. 52.—7th Geo. III. ch. 41 and ch. 46.—8th Geo. III. ch. 22.— 12th Geo. III. ch. 24.—with the three acts for ſtopping the port, and blocking up the harbour of Boſton; for altering the charter and government of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſett's-Bay; and that entitled, An act for the better adminiſtration of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, &amp;c. Alſo the act for regulating the government of Quebec, and the act paſſed in the ſame ſeſſion relating to the quarters of ſoldiers, ſhall be, and are hereby SUSPENDED, and not to have effect or execution, from the date of this act: And be it moreover hereby declared and enacted, by the authority aforeſaid, That all and every the before
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014076_0013_0F92FE8920D4D4B8"/>
recited acts, or the parts thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, ſhall be, and are, in virtue of this preſent act, finally repealed and annulled, from the day that the new recognition of the ſupreme legiſlative authority, and ſuperintending power of parliament over the colonies, ſhall have been made on the part of the ſaid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</p>
            <p>And for the better ſecuring due and impartial adminiſtration of juſtice in the colonies, be it declared and enacted by the king's moſt excellent majeſty, by and with the advice and conſent of the lords ſpiritual and temporal and commons in this preſent parliament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, That his majeſty's judges in courts of law in the colonies of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, to be appointed with ſalaries by the crown, ſhall hold their offices and ſalaries as his majeſty's judges in England, <hi>quamdiu ſe bene geſſerint.</hi> And it is hereby further declared, by the authority aforeſaid, that the colonies in America are juſtly entitled to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, franchiſes, and immunities granted by their ſeveral charters or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; and that the ſaid charters
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014076_0014_0F92FE8B225250E0"/>
or conſtitutions ought not to be inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or reſumed, unleſs for miſuſer, or ſome legal ground of forfeiture. So ſhall true reconcilement avert impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calamities, and this moſt ſolemn national accord between Great-Britain and her colonies ſtand an everlaſting monument of clemency and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the benignant father of his people, of wiſdom and moderation in this great nation, famed for humanity as for valour; and of fidelity and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affection from brave and loyal colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to their parent kingdom, which will ever protect and cheriſh them."</p>
