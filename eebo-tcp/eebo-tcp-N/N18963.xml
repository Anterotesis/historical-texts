            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS enchiridion, I preſent thee with, is the fruit of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude: a ſchool few care to learn in, though none inſtructs us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Some parts of it are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of ſerious reflection; others the flaſhings of lucid inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals; written for private ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and now publiſhed for an help to human conduct.</p>
            <p>The author bleſſeth God for
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:024663_0003_0FC819F6B048CF30"/>
his retirement, and kiſſes that gentle hand which led him into it: for though it ſhould prove bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to the world, it can never do fo to him.</p>
            <p>He has now had ſome time he could call his own, a property he was never ſo much maſter of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: in which he has taken a view of himſelf and the world; and obſerved wherein he hath hit and miſſed the mark; what might have been done, what men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and what avoided, in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conduct: together with the omiſſions and exceſſes of others, as well ſocieties and governments, as private families and perſons. And he verily thinks, were he to live over his life again, he
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:024663_0004_0FC819FE5461C9E8"/>
could not only, with God's grace, ſerve him, but his neighbour and himſelf, better than he hath done, and have ſeven years of his time to ſpare. And yet, perhaps, he hath not been the worſt or the idleſt man in the world; nor is he the oldeſt. And this is the rather ſaid, that it might quicken thee, reader, to loſe none of the time that is yet thine.</p>
            <p>There is nothing of which we are apt to be ſo laviſh as of time, and about which we ought to be more ſolicitous; ſince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we can do nothing in this world. Time is what we want moſt, but what, alas! we uſe worſt; and for which God will
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:024663_0005_0FC81A010A0FAF00"/>
certainly moſt ſtrictly reckon with us, when time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>It is of that moment to us in reference to both worlds, that I can hardly wiſh any man better, than that he would ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he does with his time; how and to what end he employs it; and what returns he makes to God, his neighbour, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it. Will he never have a ledger for this; this, the greateſt wiſdom and work of life?</p>
            <p>To come but once into the world, and trifle away our true enjoyment of it, and of ourſelves in it, is lamentable indeed. This one reflection would yield a think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſon great inſtruction. And, ſince nothing below man can ſo
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:024663_0006_0FC81A06280A7148"/>
think, man, in being thoughtleſs, muſt needs fall below himſelf. And that, to be ſure, ſuch do, as are unconcerned in the uſe of their moſt precious time.</p>
            <p>This is but too evident, if we will allow ourſelves to conſider, that there is hardly any thing we take by the right end, or improve to its juſt advantage.</p>
            <p>We underſtand little of the works of God, either in nature or grace. We purſue falſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and miſtake education ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely. We are violent in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, confuſed and immethod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical in our whole life; making that a burthen, which was given for a bleſſing, and ſo of little comfort to ourſelves or others;
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:024663_0007_0FC81A070B9DDC98"/>
miſapprehending the true notion of happineſs, and ſo miſſing of the right uſe of life, and way of happy living.</p>
            <p>And until we are perſuaded to ſtop, and ſtep a little aſide, out of the noiſy crowd and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering hurry of the world, and calmly take a proſpect of things, it will be impoſſible we ſhould be able to make a right judgment of ourſelves, or know our own miſery. But after we have made the juſt reckonings which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement will help us to, we ſhall begin to think the world in great meaſure mad, and that we have been in a ſort of Bedlam all this while.</p>
            <p>Reader, whether young or old,
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:024663_0008_0FC81A09EA0F97E8"/>
think it not too ſoon or too late to turn over the leaves of thy paſt life: and be ſure to fold down where any paſſage of it may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thee: and beſtow thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of time, to correct thoſe faults in thy future conduct, be it in relation to this or the next life. What thou wouldſt do, if what thou haſt done were to do again, be ſure to do as long as thou liveſt, upon the like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Our reſolutions ſeem to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, as often as we reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our paſt errors; but, alas! they are apt to flag again upon freſh temptations to the ſame things.</p>
            <p>The author does not pretend
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:024663_0009_0FC81A0D1BEA7FE8"/>
to deliver thee an exact piece; his buſineſs not being oſtentation, but charity. It is miſcellaneous in the matter of it, and by no means artificial in the compoſure. But it contains hints, that may ſerve thee for texts to preach to thyſelf upon, and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend much of the courſe of human life: ſince whether thou art parent or child, prince or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, maſter or ſervant, ſingle or married, publick or private, mean or honourable, rich or poor, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous or improſperous, in peace or controverſy, in buſineſs or ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; whatever be thy inclination or averſion, practice or duty, thou wilt find ſomething not unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaid for thy direction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:024663_0010_0FC81A0E64171320"/>
Accept and improve what deſerves thy notice; the reſt excuſe, and place to account of good-will to thee and the whole creation of God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IT is admirable to conſider how many millions of people come into and go out of the world, ignorant of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of the world they have lived in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If one went to ſee Windſor-Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or Hampton-Court, it would be

ſtrange not to obſerve and remember the ſituation, the building, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, fountains, &amp;c. that make up the beauty and pleaſure of ſuch a ſeat. And yet few people know themſelves: no, not their own bodies, the houſes of their minds, the moſt curious ſtructure of the world; a living, walking taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; nor the world of which it was made, and out of which it is fed; which would be ſo much our benefit, as well as our pleaſure, to know. We cannot doubt of this when we are told that the "inviſible things of God are brought to light by the things that are ſeen;" and conſequently we read our duty in them, as often as we look upon them, to him that is the great and wiſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them, if we look as we ſhould do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The world is certainly a great and ſtately volume of natural things, and may be not improperly ſtiled the hieroglyphicks of a better; but, alas, how very few leaves of it do we ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

               <p n="5">5. The firſt thing obvious to children is what is ſenſible; and that we make no part of their rudiments.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We preſs their memory too ſoon, and puzzle, ſtrain, and load them with words and rules to know grammar and rhetorick, and a ſtrange tongue or two, that it is ten to one may never be uſeful to them; leaving their natural genius to mechanical, and phyſical or natural knowledge uncultivated and neglected; which would be of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding uſe and pleaſure to them thro' the whole courſe of their lives.</p>

7. To be ſure, languages are not to be deſpiſed or neglected; but, things are ſtill to be preferred.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Children had rather be making of tools and inſtruments of play; ſhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drawing, framing, and building, &amp;c. than getting ſome rules of propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of ſpeech by heart: and thoſe alſo would follow with more judgment, and leſs trouble and time.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It were happy if we ſtudied na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more in natural things; and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to nature: whoſe rules are few, plain, and moſt reaſonable.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Let us begin where ſhe begins, go her pace, and cloſe always where ſhe ends, and we cannot miſs of being good naturaliſts.</p>
               <p n="11">11.

underſtood by us; and an eternal wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power, majeſty, and goodneſs, very conſpicuous to us, through thoſe ſenſible and paſſing forms: the world wearing the mark of its Maker, whoſe ſtamp is every where viſible, and the characters very legible to the children of wiſdom.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And it would go a great way to caution and direct people in their uſe of the world, that they were better ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and known in the creation of it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For how could men find the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to abuſe it, while they ſhould ſee the great Creator ſtare them in the face, in all and every part thereof?</p>
               <p n="14">14. Their ignorance makes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible; and to that inſenſibility may be aſcribed their hard uſage of ſeveral parts of this noble creation: that has the ſtamp and voice of a Deity every where, and in every thing, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving.</p>
               <p n="15">15. It is pity therefore that books have not been compoſed for youth, by
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024663_0024_0FC81A3CEC65D840"/>
ſome curious and careful naturaliſts, and alſo mechanicks, in the Latin tongue, to be uſed in ſchools, that they might learn things with words: things obvious and familiar to them, and which would make the tongue eaſier to be obtained by them.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Many able gardeners and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen are ignorant of the reaſon of their calling; as moſt artificers are of the reaſon of their own rules that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their excellent workmanſhip. But a naturaliſt and mechanick of this ſort is maſter of the reaſon of both; and might be of the practice too, if his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry kept pace with his ſpeculation: which were very commendable; and without which he cannot be ſaid to be a complete naturaliſt or mechanick.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Finally, if man be the index or epitome of the world, as philoſophers tell us, we have only to read ourſelves well, to be learned in it. But becauſe there is nothing we leſs regard than the characters of the Power that made

               <p n="18">18. And yet we are very apt to be full of ourſelves, inſtead of him that made what we ſo much value; and but for whom we can have no reaſon to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue ourſelves. For we have nothing that we can call our own; no, not our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for we are all but tenants, and at will too, of the great Lord of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the reſt of this great farm, the world that we live upon.</p>
               <p n="19">19. But, methinks, we cannot anſwer it to ourſelves, as well as our Maker, that we ſhould live and die ignorant

of ourſelves, and thereby of him, and the obligations we are under to him for ourſelves.</p>
               <p n="20">20. If the worth of a gift ſets the obligation, and directs the return of the party that receives it, he that is ignorant of it, will be at a loſs to value it, and the giver for it.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Here is man in his ignorance of himſelf: he knows not how to eſtimate his Creator, becauſe he knows not how to value his creation. If we conſider his make, and lovely compoſiture, the ſeveral ſtories of his wonderful ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his divers members, their order, function, and dependency; the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of food, the veſſels of digeſtion, the ſeveral tranſmutations it paſſes, and how nouriſhment is carried and diffuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout the whole body, by moſt intricate and imperceptible paſſages; how the animal ſpirit is thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, and, with an unſpeakable dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and motion, ſets all parts at work to feed themſelves; and, laſt of all,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024663_0027_0FC81A4224D35E40"/>
how the rational ſoul is ſeated in the animal, as its proper houſe, as is the animal in the body; I ſay, if this rare fabrick alone were but conſidered by us, with all the reſt by which it is fed and comforted, ſurely man would have a more reverent ſenſe of the power, wiſdom, and goodneſs of God, and of that duty he owes to him for it. But if he would be acquainted with his own ſoul, its noble faculties, its union with the body, its nature and end, and the providences by which the whole frame of humanity is preſerved, he would admire and adore his good and great God. But man is become a ſtrange contradiction to himſelf; but it is of himſelf; not being by conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but corruption, ſuch.</p>
               <p n="22">22. He would have others obey him, even his own kind; but he will not obey God, that is ſo much above him, and who made him.</p>
               <p n="23">23. He will loſe none of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; no, not bate an ace of it. He is

humourſome to his wife, beats his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is angry with his ſervants, ſtrict with his neighbours, revenges all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts to the extremity; but, alas! for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets all the while that he is the man; and is more in arrear to God, that is ſo very patient with him, than they are to him, with whom he is ſo ſtrict and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
               <p n="24">24. He is curious to waſh, dreſs, and perfume his body, but careleſs of his ſoul; the one ſhall have many hours, the other not ſo many minutes; this ſhall have three or four new ſuits a year, but that muſt wear its old cloaths ſtill.</p>
               <p n="25">25. If he be to receive or ſee a great man, how nice and anxious is he that all things be in order; and with what reſpect and addreſs does he approach and make his court? But to God, how dry and formal, and conſtrained in his devotion?</p>
               <p n="26">26. In his prayers he ſays, "Thy will be done;" but means his own: at leaſt acts ſo.</p>

But yet the leſs form in religion the better, ſince God is a ſpirit: for the more mental our worſhip, the more adequate to the nature of God; the more ſilent, the more ſuitable to the language of a ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="508">508. Words are for others, not for ourſelves: nor for God, who hears not as bodies do, but as ſpirits ſhould.</p>
               <p n="509">509. If we would know this dialect, we muſt learn of the divine principle in us. As we hear the dictates of that, ſo God hears us.</p>

510. There we may ſee him, too, in all his attributes; though but in little, yet as much as we can apprehend or bear: for as he is in himſelf, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, and "dwelleth in that light no eye can approach." But in his image we may behold his glory; enough to exalt our apprehenſions of God, and to inſtruct us in that worſhip which pleaſeth him.</p>
               <p n="511">511. Men may tire themſelves in a labyrinth of ſearch, and talk of God; but if we would know him indeed, it muſt be from the impreſſions we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him: and the ſofter our hearts are, the deeper and livelier thoſe will be upon us.</p>
               <p n="512">512. If he has made us ſenſible of his juſtice, by his reproof; of his patience, by his forbearance; of his mercy, by his forgiveneſs; of his holineſs, by the ſanctification of our hearts through his ſpirit; we have a grounded knowledge of God. This is experience, that ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;

this enjoyment, that report. In ſhort, this is undeniable evidence, with the realities of religion, and will ſtand all winds and weathers.</p>
               <p n="513">513. As our faith, ſo our devotion, ſhould be lively. Cold meat will not ſerve at thoſe repaſts.</p>
               <p n="514">514. It is a coal from God's altar muſt kindle our fire: and without fire, true fire, no acceptable ſacrifice.</p>
               <p n="515">515. "Open thou my lips, and then" ſaid the royal prophet, "my mouth ſhall praiſe God." But not 'till then.</p>
               <p n="516">516. The preparation of the heart, as well as the anſwer of the tongue, is of the Lord: and to have it, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt be powerful, and our worſhip grateful.</p>
               <p n="517">517. Let us chuſe, therefore, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune where there is the warmeſt ſenſe of religion; where devotion exceeds formality, and practice moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds with profeſſion; and where there is, at leaſt, as much charity as zeal: for where this ſociety is to be
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:024663_0117_0FC816D329B70420"/>
found, there ſhall we find the church of God.</p>
               <p n="518">518. As good, ſo ill men, are all of a church: and every body knows who muſt be head of it.</p>
               <p n="519">519. The humble, meek, merciful, juſt, pious, and devout ſouls, are every where of one religion; and when death has taken off the maſk, they will know one another, though the diverſe live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they wear here make them ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p n="520">520. Great allowances are to be made for education and perſonal weakneſſes; but it is a rule with me, 'That man is truly religious, that loves the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he is of for the piety, rather than the ceremony, of it.'</p>
               <p n="521">521. They that have one end, can hardly diſagree when they meet. At leaſt their concern in the greater, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates their value for, and difference about, the leſſer things.</p>
               <p n="522">522. It is a ſad reflection, that many
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:024663_0118_0FC816D58AA17750"/>
men hardly have any religion at all, and moſt men have none of their own; for that which is the religion of their education, and not of their judgment, is the religion of another, and not theirs.</p>
               <p n="523">523. To have religion upon authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not upon conviction, is like a ſinger-watch, to be ſet forwards or backwards, as he pleaſes that has it in keeping.</p>
               <p n="524">524. It is a prepoſterous thing, that men can venture their ſouls, where they will not venture their money: for they will take their religion upon truſt, but not truſt a ſynod about the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of half a crown.</p>
               <p n="525">525. They will follow their own judgment when their money is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whatever they do for their ſouls.</p>
               <p n="526">526. But, to be ſure, that religion cannot be right, that a man is the worſe for having.</p>
               <p n="527">527. No religon is better than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural one.</p>
               <p n="528">528. Grace perfects, but never ſours or ſpoils, nature.</p>

529. To be unnatural in defence of grace is a contradiction.</p>
               <p n="530">530. Hardly any thing looks worſe than to defend religion by ways that ſhew it has no credit with us.</p>
               <p n="531">531. A devout man is one thing, a ſtickler is quite another.</p>
               <p n="532">532. When our minds exceed their juſt bounds, we muſt not diſcredit what we would recommend.</p>
               <p n="533">533. To be furious in religion is to be irreligiouſly religious.</p>
               <p n="534">534. If he that is without bowels is not a man: how, then, can he be a Chriſtian?</p>
               <p n="535">535. It were better to be of no church, than to be bitter for any.</p>
               <p n="536">536. Bitterneſs comes very near to enmity, and that is Beelzebub; becauſe the perfection of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p n="537">537. A good end cannot ſanctify evil means; nor muſt we ever do evil that good may come of it.</p>
               <p n="538">538. Some folk think they may ſcold,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:024663_0120_0FC816DE917B0D48"/>
rail, hate, rob, and kill too; ſo it be but for God's ſake.</p>
               <p n="539">539. But nothing in us unlike him can pleaſe him.</p>
               <p n="540">540. It is as great preſumption to ſend our paſſions upon God's errands, as it is to palliate them with God's name.</p>
               <p n="541">541. Zeal dropt in charity, is good; without it, good for nothing: for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours all it comes near.</p>
               <p n="542">542. They muſt firſt judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that preſume to cenſure others: and ſuch will not be apt to over-ſhoot the mark.</p>
               <p n="543">543. We are too ready to retaliate, rather than forgive, or gain by love and information.</p>
               <p n="544">544. And yet we could hurt no man that we believe loves us.</p>
               <p n="545">545. Let us, then, try what love will do: for if men do once ſee we love them, we ſhould ſoon find they would not harm us.</p>
               <p n="546">546. Force may ſubdue, but love gains; and he that forgives firſt, wins the laurel.</p>

547. If I am even with my enemy, the debt is paid; but if I forgive it, I oblige him for ever.</p>
               <p n="548">548. Love is the hardeſt leſſon in Chriſtianity; but, for that reaſon, it ſhould be moſt our care to learn it. 'Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficilia quae pulchra.'</p>
               <p n="549">549. It is a ſevere rebuke upon us, that God makes us ſo many allowances, and we make ſo few to our neighbour: as if charity had nothing to do with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; or love with faith, that ought to work by it.</p>
               <p n="550">550. I find all ſorts of people agree, whatſoever were their animoſities, when humbled by the approaches of death; then they forgive, then they pray for, and love one another: which ſhews us, that it is not our reaſon, but our paſſion, that makes and holds up the feuds that reign among men in their health and fulneſs.

               <p n="552">552. "He that lives in love, lives in God," ſays the beloved diſciple: and, to be ſure, a man can live no where better.</p>
               <p n="553">553. It is moſt reaſonable men ſhould value that benefit which is moſt durable. Now tongues ſhall ceaſe, and prophecy fail, and faith ſhall be conſummated in ſight, and hope in enjoyment; but love remains.</p>
               <p n="554">554. Love is indeed heaven upon earth; ſince heaven above would not be heaven without it; for where there is not love, there is fear; but, 'Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love caſts out fear." And yet we naturally fear moſt to offend what we moſt love.</p>

for too. "If you love me," ſays our bleſſed Redeemer, "keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments." Why? Why then, he will love us; then we ſhall be his friends; then he will ſend us the Comforter; then whatever we aſk we ſhall receive; and then, where he is we ſhall be alſo, and that for ever. Behold the fruits of love; the power, virtue, benefit, and beauty of love!</p>
               <p n="556">556. Love is above all; and when it prevails in us all, we ſhall all be lovely, and in love with God, and one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>

               <head>THE RIGHT MORALIST.</head>
               <p n="1">1. A RIGHT moraliſt is a great and good man; but, for that reaſon, he is rarely to be found.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are a ſort of people that are fond of the character, who, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, have but little title to it.</p>

3. They think it enough, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud a man of his pay, or betray his friend; but never conſider, that the law forbids the one at his peril, and that virtue is ſeldom the reaſon of the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But certainly, he that covets can no more be a moral man, than he that ſteals; ſince he does ſo in his mind. Nor can he be one that robs his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his credit, or that craftily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermines him of his trade or office.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If a man pays his taylor, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches his wife, is he a current mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt?</p>
               <p n="6">6. But what ſhall we ſay of the man that rebel; againſt his father, is an ill huſband, or an abuſive neighbour; one that is laviſh of his time, of his health and of his eſtate, in which his family is ſo nearly concerned? Muſt he go for a right moraliſt, becauſe he pays his rent well?</p>
               <p n="7">7. I would aſk ſome of thoſe men of morals, whether he that robs God, and
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024663_0126_0FC816EC54524D10"/>
himſelf too, though he ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his neighbour, be the moral man?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Do I owe myſelf nothing? And do I not owe all to God? And, if paying what we owe makes the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man, is it not fit we ſhould begin to render our dues where we owe our very beginning; aye, our all?</p>
               <p n="9">9. The complete moraliſt begins with God; he gives him his due, his heart, his love, his ſervice: the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful giver of his well-being, as well as being.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He that lives without a ſenſe of this dependence and obligation, cannot be a moral man, becauſe he does not know his returns of love and obedience, as becomes an honeſt and a ſenſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which very term implies he is not his own; and it cannot be very honeſt to miſemploy another's goods.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But how! can there be no debt but to a fellow creature? Or, will our exactneſs in paying thoſe trifling ones,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:024663_0127_0FC816EFAA9273E8"/>
while we neglect our weightier obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cancel the bonds we lie under, and render us right and thorough mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts?</p>
               <p n="12">12. As judgments are paid before bonds, and bonds before bills or book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debts; ſo the moraliſt conſiders his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations according to their ſeveral dignities.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, him to whom he owes himſelf. Next, himſelf, in his health and livelihood. Laſtly, his other obligations, whether rational or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary; doing to others, to the extent of his ability, as he would have them do unto him.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In ſhort, the moral man is he that loves God above all, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelf: which fulfils both tables at once.</p>

I cannot ſee the policy, any more than the neceſſity, of a man's mind giving the lie to his mouth; or his mouth giving falſe alarms of his mind: for no man can be long believed, that teaches all men to diſtruſt him: and ſince the ableſt have ſometimes need of credit, where lies the advantage of their politick cant or banter upon mankind?</p>

But when we conſider what all this art and diſguiſe are for, it equally heightens the wiſe man's wonder and averſion; perhaps it is to betray a father, a brother, a maſter, a friend, a neighbour, or one's own party.</p>
               <p n="45">45. A fine conqueſt! what noble Grecians and Romans abhorred: as if government could not ſubſiſt without knavery, and that knaves were the uſefulleſt props to it; though the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, as well as greateſt, perverſions of the ends of it.</p>

               <p n="227">227. Our noble Engliſh patriarchs, as well as patriots, were ſo ſenſible of this evil, that they made ſeveral excellent laws, commonly called ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, to forbid, at leaſt limit, the pride of the people; and, becauſe the execution of them would be our intereſt and honour, their neglect muſt be our juſt reproach and loſs.</p>
               <p n="228">228. It is but reaſonable that the puniſhment of pride and exceſs ſhould help to ſupport the government; ſince it muſt otherwiſe inevitably be ruined by them.</p>
               <p n="229">229. But ſome ſay, 'It ruins trade, and will make the poor burdenſome to the publick;' but if ſuch trade, in conſequence, ruins the kingdom, is it not time to ruin that trade? Is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

               <p n="231">231. To wink at a trade that effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates the people, and invades the ancient diſcipline of the kingdom, is a crime capital, and to be ſeverely puniſhed, inſtead of being excuſed, by the magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="232">232. Is there no better employment for the poor than luxury? Miſerable nation!</p>

               <p n="236">236. But a vain man is a nauſeous creature: he is ſo full of himſelf, that he has no room for any thing elſe, be it ever ſo good or deſerving.</p>
               <p n="237">237. It is I, at every turn, that does this, or can do that. And as he abounds in his compariſons, ſo he is ſure to give himſelf the better of every body elſe; according to the proverb, "All his geeſe are ſwans."</p>
               <p n="238">238. They are certainly to be pitied that can be ſo much miſtaken at home.</p>

               <p n="240">240. But, at the ſame time, one would wonder they ſhould not feel the blows they give themſelves, or get from others, for this intolerable and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

               <p n="241">241. To be a man's own fool is bad enough; but the vain man is every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's.</p>
               <p n="242">242. This ſilly diſpoſition comes of a mixture of ignorance, confidence, and pride: and as there is more or leſs of the laſt, ſo it is more or leſs offenſive, or entertaining.</p>
               <p n="243">243. And yet, perhaps, the worſt part of this vanity is its unteachableneſs. Tell it any thing, and it has known it long ago; and out-runs information and inſtruction, or elſe proudly puffs at it.</p>
               <p n="244">244. Whereas the greateſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings doubt moſt, are readieſt to learn, and leaſt pleaſed with themſelves; this, with nobody elſe.</p>
               <p n="245">245. For though they ſtand on high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ground, and ſo ſee farther than their neighbours, they are yet humbled by their proſpect, ſince it ſhews them.

their ſeveral degrees of glory; and ſo the other ſtars, of magnitude and luſtre.</p>
               <p n="257">257. If we look upon the earth, we ſee it among the trees of the wood, from the cedar to the bramble; among the fiſhes, from the leviathan to the ſprat; in the air, among the birds, from the eagle to the ſparrow; among the beaſts, from the lion to the cat; and among mankind, from the king to the ſcavenger.</p>
               <p n="258">258. Our great men, doubtleſs, were deſigned, by the wiſe framer of the world, for our religious, moral, and politick planets; for lights and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the lower ranks of the numerous company of their own kind, both in precepts and examples; and they are well paid for their pains too, who have the honor and ſervice of their fellow-creatures, and the marrow and fat of the earth for their ſhare.</p>
               <p n="259">259. But is it not a moſt unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble folly, that men ſhould be proud of the providences that ſhould humble

them; or think the better of themſelves, inſtead of him that raiſed them ſo much above the level; or of being ſo in their lives, in return of his extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours?</p>
               <p n="260">260. But it is but too near a-kin to us, to think no farther than ourſelves, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the acquiſition, or uſe, of our wealth and greatneſs: when, alas! they are the preferments of heaven, to try our wiſdom, bounty, and gratitude.</p>
               <p n="261">261. It is a dangerous perverſion of the end of providence, to conſume the time, power, and wealth, he has given us above other men, to gratify our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did paſſions, inſtead of playing the good ſtewards, to the honor of our great benefactor, and the good of our fellow-creatures.</p>
               <p n="262">262. But it is an injuſtice too; ſince thoſe higher ranks of men are but the truſtees of heaven, for the benefit of leſſer mortals: who, as minors, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to all their care and proviſion.</p>

263. For though God has dignified ſome men above their brethren, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was to ſerve their pleaſures; but that they might take pleaſure to ſerve the publick.</p>
               <p n="264">264. For this cauſe, doubtleſs, it was that they were raiſed above ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or any trouble to live, that they might have more time and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to care for others: and it is certain, where that uſe is not made of the bounties of providence, they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzled and waſted.</p>
               <p n="265">265. It has often ſtruck me with a ſerious reflection, when I have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great inequality of the world that one man ſhould have ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his fellow-creatures to wait upon him, who have ſouls to be ſaved as well as he; and this not for buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but ſtate. Certainly a poor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of his money, and a worſe of their time.</p>
               <p n="266">266. But that any one man ſhould

               <p n="267">267. But even in allowable ſervices, it has an humbling conſideration, and what ſhould raiſe the thankfulneſs of the great men to him who that ſo much bettered their circumſtances; and moderate the uſe of their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over thoſe of their own kind.</p>
               <p n="268">268. When the poor Indians hear us call any of our family by the name of ſervants, they cry out, 'What! call brethren ſervant! we call our dogs ſervants, but never men.' The moral certainly can do us no harm, but may inſtruct us to abate our height, and narrow our ſtate and attendance.</p>
               <p n="269">269. And what has been ſaid of their exceſs may, in ſome meaſure, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to other branches of luxury, that ſet ill examples to the leſſer world, and rob the needy of their penſions.</p>

               <p n="289">289.

               <p n="296">296. Wherefore a man can never be a true and good Chriſtian without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, even in the loweſt ſenſe of it;
