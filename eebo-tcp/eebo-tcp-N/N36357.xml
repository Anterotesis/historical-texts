            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>OVID'S <hi>Art of Love,</hi> having lately appeared in <hi>French</hi> with <hi>Obſervations</hi> written by the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which have been very well received in <hi>France;</hi> it has been thought proper to add ſuch of them as are moſt curious to this <hi>verſion,</hi> and to make other new <hi>remarks</hi> in ſome places, where the <hi>Engliſh tranſlators</hi> have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven another <hi>turn</hi> to the <hi>original.</hi> The <hi>introduction</hi> to theſe <hi>obſervations</hi> is entirely the <hi>French</hi> author's; ſo are moſt of the reflections. 'Tis hop'd thoſe that are not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, will not be found to be of leſs importance than thoſe that are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>A great many people are miſtaken in theſe books: and though they were made uſe of as a pretence to drive the author from the court of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and confine him to <hi>Tomos,</hi> on the frontiers of the <hi>Getae</hi> and <hi>Surmatae,</hi> yet they were not the true cauſe of his confinement. They are very far from being ſo licentious as the writings of ſeveral other poets, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> However, we muſt own he might have been a little more diſcreet, eſpecially in ſome places.</p>
            <p>That which offended the <hi>Romans</hi> moſt in this work, cannot touch us. It has always been more dangerous in <hi>Italy</hi> to converſe with women of honour, and frequent their houſes, than 'tis with us: Though there is more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and what in that country may be an occaſion of debauchery, would not at all be ſo in ours.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid againſt theſe books <hi>of the Art of Love,</hi> by ſome over-ſcrupulous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe diſcretion has too much of affectation in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; they are not only neceſſary for the knowledge of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> tongue, and the <hi>Roman</hi> hiſtory, concerning which they contain ſeveral things very particular; but for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> we find in them, which the moſt <hi>grave</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> have thought worthy to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:047526_0005_1023BD6573B6AD90"/>
In a word, there's nothing in them that comes near the <hi>licence</hi> of ſome <hi>epigrams</hi> of <hi>Catullus Martial,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonius,</hi> of ſome <hi>ſatyrs</hi> of <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other pieces of <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>modern</hi> authors which are read and commented upon; and about which even cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and other religious perſons, as eminent for their piety as their erudition, have employed their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Yet who has condemn'd or complain'd of them? We muſt confeſs, ſuch things ſhould be manag'd with addreſs: and thoſe of them who have meddled with any of the authors I have named, have ſhewn that it may be done ſo, by their ſucceeding ſo happily in it.</p>
            <p>As for this treatiſe of the <hi>Art of Love,</hi> for which the author has alſo preſcrib'd a <hi>remedy,</hi> as it is liable to be all interpreted by thoſe whoſe pens poiſon every thing they touch; ſo it may bear a good conſtruction, by ſuch as know how to turn every thing to advantage.</p>
            <p>I will yet ſay, this <hi>Art</hi> may be apply'd to thoſe that intend to marry. There is nothing ſure againſt decency in all that. I agree, if you will have it ſo, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſo far as to direct one to the means to gain a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. If this was not lawful heretofore in <hi>Italy,</hi> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the jealous humour of the <hi>Italians,</hi> we cannot, for the ſame reaſon only, ſay it ought to be forbidden in our country, any more than in ſeveral others, provided we could be ſure the ladies modeſty would not be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before whom youth ſhould be always careful not to exceed the bounds of the reſpect that's due to them.</p>
            <p>Be it as it will, I have thought of endeavouring to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all that is ſaid in thoſe books of wanton <hi>love,</hi> to the <hi>art</hi> of loving the <hi>ſciences.</hi> The <hi>emblem</hi> is not diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, neither is it impoſſible to explain all that <hi>Ovid</hi> has written here upon the love of <hi>beauty</hi> by that of the <hi>arts.</hi> What do we not ſometimes underſtand by the loves of a ſhepherd and ſhepherdeſs? By a lover of incomparable beauty, and his fair one paſſionately in love? But, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fable, how often has the loves of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:047526_0006_1023BD69AB0F5C78"/>
               <hi>Juno</hi> been moraliz'd upon, as well as thoſe of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Daphne, Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus, Myrrha</hi> and <hi>Cynaras,</hi> and ſeveral others, the examples of which are almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite? Yet theſe things are ſeen every day, all the world read and admire them. Tho' the outſide of them is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtrong, and the literal ſenſe more ſuſpected, than any of the precepts laid down in <hi>Ovid's Art of Love</hi> are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious.</p>
            <p>But, to ſoften this thought a little, let us figure to ourſelves, that the poet is not only a <hi>gallant</hi> of the court of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> but a philoſopher of the <hi>Portic</hi> and <hi>Lyceum;</hi> who propoſes to us, as to his diſciples, excellent rules to acquire the <hi>virtues</hi> and <hi>ſciences,</hi> repreſented under the name of the <hi>muſes,</hi> or ladies of various beauty, who may be met with every where, eſpecially in great academies, in the ſchools, in courts, in walks, and in holy places; figured by <hi>cirques, theatres, galleries, portices,</hi> and the <hi>temples</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> deities, where great aſſemblies were held. And when we have choſen that which pleaſes us beſt, and is moſt agreeable to our nature; let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to gain its good graces, and enjoy it, that we may become more wiſe, and more virtuous. Thus we may deceive our imagination: and 'twill be eaſy for us to make the reading of this treatiſe, not only pleaſant, but profitable. We need not then have any ſcruple upon us, becauſe there is nothing unchaſte in the expreſſion, though ſuch things as are entirely gallant are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected; at leaſt no farther than modeſty and decency requir'd. I will, if I can, explain my thoughts in this matter, according as occaſion may offer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the Art of Love.</hi> By this we ought to underſtand how we muſt love, or how we muſt preſerve the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of our love, when we have once acquir'd it. Otherwiſe 'twas uſeleſs to write an <hi>Art of love.</hi> For <hi>love</hi> is form'd in the heart without <hi>art,</hi> and all are without <hi>art</hi> ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of that paſſion. It generally ſurprizes us, and we know not from whence it comes, though we feel it very ſenſibly. For this reaſon the poets ſo often endeavour to
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:047526_0007_1023BD6CE5BB5128"/>
perſuade us that <hi>love</hi> is a potent <hi>god,</hi> who wounds every thing with his darts; and that there is no creature able to reſiſt him. We therefore need no <hi>art</hi> to teach us to <hi>love,</hi> or even to <hi>love</hi> any thing reaſonably; but 'tis of very great importance to each of us, that, when we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd, the inſpiration ſhould be for a proper object, and a good end, as I deſign to ſhew you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ovid.</hi> This poet wrote theſe books a few years before his exile, under colour of which the <hi>decree</hi> of the ſenate for his baniſhment was procur'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though they certainly were not the <hi>cauſe</hi> of it; and indeed could not reaſonably be ſo, unleſs <hi>Ovid</hi> wrote them in favour of <hi>Auguſtus'</hi>s grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter, whom he viſited with a little too much fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, and did it to pleaſe her. For ſhe, no more than her mother, <hi>Agrippa'</hi>s wife, was not ſo modeſt as perſons of quality and high condition ought to be, as well for their own glory, as for an example to others.</p>
            <p>The two firſt books of the <hi>Art of Love,</hi> contain the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which the author lays down for young men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in their courtſhip to the ladies, and the third teaches the ladies how they ought to make themſelves belov'd. The allegory is not uneaſily applied to the <hi>ſciences</hi> and the <hi>virtues,</hi> repreſented as lovely women, after my way of imagining it.</p>

Alluding to a ceremony practis'd by the <hi>Romans</hi> of purifying the bed; an office which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the nurſe.
