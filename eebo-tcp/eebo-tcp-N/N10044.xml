            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I ſhall then apply the whole.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I am briefly to go over the whole ſtory of which the text is a part.</p>
            <p>Our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt was at this time on the croſs, bearing the ſins of his people. To caſt the greater reproach upon him, they crucified two thieves, the one on his right hand, the other on
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012759_0004_0F94FA2E831B6CE8"/>
his left; thereby intimating that he was the moſt enormous offender of the three. While the inhuman ſpectators were deriding and inſulting our Lord, "one of the malefactors railed on him, ſaying, if thou be Chriſt, ſave thyſelf and us." The evangeliſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew ſpeaks in the plural number, and ſo doth Mark, "They that were crucified with him, reviled him." From whence many expoſitors ſuppoſe, that the thief, who afterwards expreſſed himſelf with ſuch penitence and faith, at firſt joined in this opprobrious and impious language; but it is more probable, that the plural number is put for the ſingular in thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, an hebraiſm frequently uſed in the ſacred writings,<note n="¶" place="bottom">They who deſire to ſee inſtances of this may conſult <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge, Macknight, Gayſe,</hi> and others.</note> and that we are to receive the account given by Luke as the moſt exact repreſentation; "<hi>One</hi> of the malefactors railed on him."</p>
            <p>"But the other anſwering, rebuked him, ſaying, doſt not thou fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation? and we indeed juſtly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiſs." Doſt not thou fear God, when thou art juſt going to give an account of the things done in the body before his awful bar? Doſt thou dare to add to the enormities of thy former life, the guilt of inſulting one who is like thyſelf ſentenced to die, and feels the ſame cruel tortures to which we are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And as for our puniſhment it is juſt. Our crimes deſerve all the infamy and diſtreſs to which we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; but this is an innocent man, who is only a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim to envy and malice; he hath not done any thing amiſs, he juſtly claims the character of Meſſiah, tho' he doth not vouchſafe to give that proof of it which you inſolently demand, and though he is now ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a criminal with us.—Thus this poor malefactor, when he could do it in no other way, gives glory to God by confeſſing his ſins, and acknowledging the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012759_0005_0F94FA2FE363E408"/>
juſtice of the puniſhment which he now ſuffered; and at the ſame time confeſſes Jeſus Chriſt, though he ſaw him in the moſt humble circumſtances, "obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to death, even the death of the croſs."</p>
            <p>"And he ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom." We ſcarce find ſuch an inſtance of faith in the whole book of God! Our Lord had been condemned by the Jewiſh Sanhedrim and the Roman Governor, he was now ſuffering as a malefactor, he was deſerted by his own diſciples, reviled by the rulers and teachers of the people; his external appearance was more like a ſlave than like a Prince and a Saviour; yet, under all theſe ignominious circumſtances, this criminal owns him as his Lord, believes that he had a kingdom beyond the grave, and looks to him for ſalvation in the future world.</p>
            <p>Some have been very ſollicitous to find out how this thief came to the knowledge of Chriſt, ſo as to own his exalted character, and ſubmit to him as Lord and Chriſt. Knowledge neceſſarily precedes faith. "How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" But though he was a thief, he might have had frequent opportunities of hearing Chriſt, before he was apprehended by authority; if not, he might have heard of him from others, for the fame of Jeſus, of his perſon, his pretenſions, and his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, went through all the country; the ſight of Jeſus would naturally bring theſe things to mind; he might be affected with our Lord's patience under his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and his meekneſs towards thoſe who inſulted and abuſed him; and the Spirit of God might, by his ſecret energy, give him a new and transforming view of truths he had formerly heard with indifference, perhaps with contempt. It ſeems as if he muſt have known ſomething of our Lord's character, or he could not have borne that teſtimony to his innocence, "this
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012759_0006_0F94FA3062626610"/>
man hath done nothing amiſs." But allowing that this criminal had never heard of Jeſus before, he heard enough this day, even from his enemies, to teach him, that our Lord aſſumed the character of the Meſſiah who was to come into the world, for they expreſly upbraided him with pretending to be the Chriſt, the choſen of God; and having, probably, been educated in the Jewiſh religion, he was acquainted with the ancient prophecies, and the general expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there was of the advent of the Meſſiah; and from the excellent ſpirit which our Lord exhibited, and the very cruel and wicked temper diſcovered by thoſe who attended his crucifixion, he might conclude that for envy they had delivered him; and this evidence preſented to one, brought, by divine influence, to a happy ingenuity of temper, and readineſs of mind to embrace truth, might be a rational foundation of faith. Eſpecially, if to all the reſt was added the preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural darkneſs ſpoken of in the next verſe, and which ſome think was now begun. Whether we embrace one or the other of theſe opinions, the hiſtory menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons no expreſſion of regard to Chriſt, till the other thief railed on him; we may therefore reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he never had believed till now: Convinced by our Lord's piety and goodneſs in ſuch a trying ſituation, and by the miraculous circumſtances which attended him, he addreſſes him in the language of a moſt noble and vigorous faith. "Lord, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, when thou comeſt into thy kingdom." Nor is his faith more to be obſerved than his modeſty; the diſciples James and John, or their ambitious mother for them, petitioned that they might ſit, the one on the right hand, and the other on the left, in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they could not be content without high prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this thief doth not ſoar ſo high; as he had more juſt notions of the Meſſiah's kingdom, ſo he had more low thoughts of himſelf. "Lord, remember me," is his humble requeſt. Let me not be caſt out—Let me be admitted, even when thou comeſt—I aſk
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012759_0007_0F94FA328F2234E0"/>
no more—aſſign me the loweſt place—it is enough—this is as much as I can hope for—it is infinitely more than I deſerve.—This was the prayer of this remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble penitent, full of faith and humility, and thus did divine grace triumph over the malice and wickedneſs of our Lord's enemies.—But I come now to the</p>
            <p>Second thing propoſed, which was to explain the anſwer of our Lord to the requeſt made him by the penitent believing thief. "And Jeſus ſaid unto him, verily I ſay unto thee, To-day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe."</p>
            <p>Here are three things which need particular illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We are to enquire what we are to underſtand by <hi>paradiſe,</hi> into which Chriſt promiſes this humble penitent an admiſſion. The word originally ſignifies a pleaſant and delightful garden, and therefore the place where Adam reſided before his apoſtacy was called paradiſe by the Jews. It may properly be uſed for any place of delight; in our text it intends the receptacle of the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, in the intermediate ſtate, or during their ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the body. To this bleſſed place the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Paul tells us he was caught up.<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 12. 4.</note> This para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, many learned men ſuppoſe, is diſtinct from the third heaven to which the apoſtle was alſo taken up,<note n="§" place="bottom">Verſe 2.</note> and where God hath fixed his throne, and diſplays his glory more illuſtriouſly than he doth any where elſe.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be explained in the words, is what our Saviour intends when he ſays, "Thou ſhalt be <hi>with me</hi> in paradiſe." This paſſage is a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of that abſurd opinion, which ſome of the ancients entertained, that Chriſt deſcended into hell the place of the damned. When our Saviour ſays by
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012759_0008_0F94FA3351396898"/>
the Spirit of prophecy, "Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell," the expreſſion intends no more than that God would not leave him in the ſtate of the dead. And ſo we muſt interpret that paſſage in the creed called the apoſtle's, "he deſcended into hell," if we receive it at all. Whatever they intended who firſt added it, this clauſe cannot be underſtood in any other ſenſe conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with truth, than that his ſoul went into the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world, where the ſpirits of the ſaints remain in a ſeparate ſtate, waiting for the redemption of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. When therefore our Lord ſays to the penitent thief, "this day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe," he intends that his ſeparate ſpirit ſhould be in that place to which he was going himſelf. To be with Chriſt conſtitutes the happineſs of the ſaints.</p>
            <p>The third thing I propoſed to explain is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, "<hi>To day</hi> ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe." This phraſe intimates that his ſoul ſhould immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs into glory; that it ſhould neither be in a place of ſilence and inactivity, nor ſhould deſcend to a place allotted to purge and purify it.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to the third general head, which is to take notice of ſeveral profitable leſſons which we are taught in this anſwer of our Saviour's to the penitent thief. Here</p>
            <p>Firſt, We obſerve the aſtoniſhing goodneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. He heard the inſults and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of his enemies with the moſt profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, not a word proceeded from him in anſwer to their invectives; but no ſooner doth this humble pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent apply to him, than he attends to the voice of his ſupplication, and tho' he was himſelf conflicting with the greateſt diſtreſs and torture, he vouchſafes to give him a gracious anſwer. The requeſt was, "Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom." Our bleſſed Saviour doth not in return reproach him
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012759_0009_0F94FA3418A3D898"/>
with his former crimes, with his impenitence and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duracy under the means of grace with which he had been favored; he doth not tell him, it was too late for him to hope for mercy, after having led ſuch a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life. He doth not reject him, becauſe he had not believed in him before, or becauſe he was juſt now expiring, and ſo could have no opportunity of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his regard to him in the world. No!—Our Lord knew the change which divine grace had wrought in him—he ſaw with infinite compaſſion the penitence and remorſe which poſſeſſed his ſoul—he knew that his profeſſions of reſpect and homage were ſincere—and that in his heart he ſubmitted to him as conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mediator between God and man: He therefore owned him as a diſciple, and for his ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, gave him the ſtrongeſt aſſurance of happineſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. The humble ſuppliant aſks, "Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me when thou comeſt in thy kingdom," Chriſt anſwers, "This day thou ſhalt be with me in paradiſe." Upon which Grotius obſerves, that our Lord promiſes more than was aſked. It is as if he had ſaid, "Thou haſt requeſted, that I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you when I take poſſeſſion of my kingdom, I will not ſo long delay the deſires of thine heart: but will grant a part—ſome firſt-fruits of the happineſs you hope for, this very day: You ſhall die ſafe, and immediately after death divine pleaſures await you." Wonderful goodneſs! Such as could proceed from none but him who is goodneſs itſelf!</p>
            <p>Secondly, In what dignity doth our Lord Jeſus Chriſt appear! and with what extenſive dominion is he veſted! "This day thou ſhalt be with me in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe." He ſpeaks like a King; like a King upon his throne. Hanging on a croſs, attended with every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of infamy and diſtreſs, with what authority and majeſty doth he "not only undertake to diſpenſe pardons, but to diſpoſe of ſeats in paradiſe!" If he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012759_0010_0F94FA34C7BF2780"/>
had this power in his dying agonies, as undoubtedly he had; how readily ſhould we receive his declaration ſince he aroſe from the dead, "all power is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, in heaven, and in earth." Our once crucified Lord is exalted above all principalities and powers, and hath authority to give eternal life to whomſoever he will. So much ſeems to be intended in that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription which He gives of himſelf,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 1. 18.</note> "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of Hades and of death." Under the word <hi>Hades</hi> is included the whole inviſible world, the ſeat of the bleſſed, as well as the priſon of the damned—The paradiſe of God, as well as hell the place of puniſhment. Of this inviſible world Jeſus Chriſt hath the keys, i. e. he hath full power and authority to aſſign to both the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the wicked, their ſeparate and very different apartments. "He openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. 3. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, We may obſerve from our Saviour's anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to this penitent malefactor, that the ſouls of the righteous do immediately paſs into a ſtate of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. That this was the happy caſe with the thief, we have already ſuppoſed to be implied in our text; and can any one think that this was a privilege peculiar to him? That this man was honored in this reſpect above Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Moſes, and the other patriarchs and prophets? Did the ſoul ſleep with the body, would the apoſtle Paul have been at all in a ſtrait which he ſhould chuſe, whether to depart or to abide in the fleſh? Would not any chriſtian chuſe to glorify God, however imperfectly, in this world; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be abſolutely incapable of glorifying him at all? Why doth Stephen with holy joy call upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to receive his ſpirit, if he was juſt going to leave a ſtate of active ſervice for a ſtate of ſilence and inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity? Why does our Saviour repreſent the ſoul of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012759_0011_0F94FA358CD18E20"/>
Lazarus, as taken into Abraham's boſom, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a power of action, if ſeparate ſpirits are in a ſtate of inſenſibility? It is obſervable, that, at this very time, when Lazarus is ſpoken of as in a ſtate of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and enjoyment, the rich man is repreſented as in torments, and his brethren as alive and in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation ſtate. It is however plain from the ſacred ſcriptures, that the ſouls of the righteous do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that compleat happineſs, while diſunited from the body, which they will afterwards. When Chriſt comes to judgment he will reward men according to their works. Then will he ſay to the righteous, "Come ye bleſſed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you:"<note n="§" place="bottom">Mat. 25. 34.</note> this plainly implies that they were not in full poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it before; and therefore the apoſtle, when he ſpeaks of thoſe who "look for the bleſſed hope," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nects with it "the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Tit. 2. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, This inſtance of the mercy and grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is an argument againſt deſpair of the mercy of God. The greateſt, the oldeſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, have from hence encouragement, though not to delay their repentance, yet to repent in hope of their obtaining mercy: Here was one who had been an enormous ſinner, and continued, for aught that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, impenitent, till he was actually ſuſpended on the croſs, and within a few hours of death; yet, even this wretched ſinner, upon his application to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, finds mercy. Surely then none need to deſpair, but all ought to repair to this merciful High-Prieſt, who is now highly exalted, to grant repentance and remiſſion of ſins; and whoſe precious blood clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from all ſin. There is no reaſon to be given, why the greateſt and moſt obdurate ſinner, who is brought to ſubmit to the Saviour and Redeemer of men, may not expect pardon and acceptance. If ſuch ſinners are excluded under the goſpel diſpenſation, if
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012759_0012_0F94FA36529EE050"/>
there are any of whoſe ſalvation there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; it muſt be, either becauſe the merits of Chriſt are not ſufficient to purchaſe redemption for them, or elſe becauſe they are excluded from the benefit of what he hath done and ſuffered, by the expreſs decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God. As for the firſt of theſe, ſurely none will venture to aſſert, that the merits of Chriſt are not ſufficient to purchaſe pardon for the greateſt and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt offender that ever lived. As he is an infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo what he did, as our ſurety, is of infinite worth and value, enough to anſwer all the demands of the law, and to procure a right to all the bleſſings he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to purchaſe. If any then are excluded the benefit of Chriſt's mediatorial tranſactions, it is not on account of any deficiency in what he hath done and ſuffered; it muſt be by an explicit declaration. They muſt be excepted, if not by name, yet by deſcription, from the general offers of pardon and ſalvation, or they have no warrant to except themſelves—no reaſon to deſpair of mercy, or to determine that they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too great or too old ſinners to be forgiven. But where do we find ſuch exceptions in the word of God? Where is it ſaid, that none ſhall partake of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits purchaſed by Chriſt, whoſe ſins have amounted to ſuch a degree, or who have continued ſo long in them? On the contrary, are not the invitations of the goſpel made to all without exception? "Come unto me," ſays our Lord, "all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt."<note n="¶" place="bottom">Mat. 11. 28.</note> "Whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely."<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 22. 17.</note> "If any man thirſt, let him come."<note n="‡" place="bottom">John 7. 37.</note> Are not the promiſes made abſolutely to every one that believeth? "He that believeth ſhall be ſaved."<note n="§" place="bottom">Mark 16. 16.</note> "Him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out."<note n="‖" place="bottom">John 6. 37.</note> There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, no excluſion in the goſpel, but of thoſe who are finally impenitent and unbelieving. Nor are any, who live under the ſound of the goſpel, excluded from
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012759_0013_0F94FA3708A3F1D0"/>
the hope of obtaining faith and repentance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently pardon and ſalvation, but they who commit the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which our Saviour tells us "ſhall not be forgiven." All other kinds of ſin have been, and may be pardoned. We find ſome of the greateſt tranſgreſſors have been received to mercy. Such was Manaſſeh, who filled Jeruſalem with innocent blood. Such were the Corinthians, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the account the apoſtle Paul gives of them, in their heathen ſtate. And ſuch have been a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of others, whom God hath called by his grace. Such was the thief on the croſs; and yet our Saviour doth not in the leaſt heſitate to aſſure him of pardon after death, upon his expreſſing his faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And we are hereby taught, to uſe the words of another, "that no impurities of life, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo foul, no crimes, though never ſo black, never ſo numerous, ſhut us out from mercy, provided we ſincerely repent; that the grace of God can recover wretches, even when they are at the laſt gaſp, and juſt dropping into everlaſting torments. Repentance, when true, is never too late, and therefore the thief upon the croſs is a ſovereign <hi>antidote</hi> againſt <hi>deſpair.</hi>" But it is a moſt horrible abuſe of this doctrine, for any to encourage themſelves in ſin, from this inſtance of the grace of God; and to defer their repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this man found mercy in his laſt hours. "As to actual repentance itſelf, and ſuch grace being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to thoſe (when they come to death's door) who have been profligate and habitual ſinners all their days, the moſt that can be inferred from hence is, that ſuch a thing <hi>may</hi> be, but it gives us no manner of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, nor ſo much as one poſſible argument that it certainly <hi>ſhall</hi> be. Men may outſtay the day of grace, God may deny them both the will and the power to repent; and therefore this example, when truly conſidered, is an excellent <hi>preſervative</hi> againſt <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</hi>"—But this brings me to the</p>
            <p>Fourth propoſition, which is to ſhow, that there is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012759_0014_0F94FA3BC3879468"/>
no reaſon, from this inſtance, for any to preſume on the mercy of God, ſo as to neglect, or defer their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. There are ſo many circumſtances which make this an extraordinary caſe, that it muſt be the greateſt poſſible madneſs and folly, to reaſon from this example, in favor of ſinners who delay their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the laſt moment. This, indeed, ſhews that God can convert ſinners even in a dying hour, and ſo long as ſuch an exertion of divine power and grace is poſſible, none ought to deſpair. But there is a vaſt medium between deſpair and preſumption, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common courſe of divine grace, there is but little reaſon to entertain hopes of thoſe, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe this triumph of the mercy and goodneſs of God, to embolden themſelves in impiety and vice, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry to God for mercy, when they can ſin no longer. To prevent ſuch a vain confidence, I ſhall obſerve ſeveral things, which ought, in all reaſon, to keep us from ſuch a miſimprovement of this affecting and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtory.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This is a ſingle example. I do not mean that there never was another inſtance, of a ſinner's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining mercy in a dying moment; God knows how many more there may have been. But there is no other recorded in the book of God; and therefore there is no other that we can be poſitive about. And what color of reaſon is there to conclude, that we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the grace of repentance becauſe one man did, when ſo many have gone out of the world in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſtate. We do not conduct thus in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For inſtance, we are told, that Mithridates king of Pontus, had, by a conſtant uſe of antidotes, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf proof againſt all kinds of poiſon, that he could drink the largeſt potion without any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ill effect: Would any one, becauſe a ſingle man had attained to ſuch ſecurity, venture to take a doſe of poiſon, upon the preſumption that it would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect him, when it is known what an awful effect it
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012759_0015_0F94FA3DB22D2760"/>
hath had upon others; and that it hath brought mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to a moſt tragical end? No!—men act more cautiouſly where this life is in danger. Alas! Why do we forget all caution, where the life of our preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and immortal ſouls is concerned, which is of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater importance? Why ſhould we encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ourſelves from the inſtance of the penitent thief to neglect our ſouls, any more than we do to expoſe ourſelves to temporal danger, becauſe others have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, when in ſimilar circumſtances?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The penitent thief was an extraordinary inſtance of faith. Our Lord was, at this time, in the depths of his humiliation, he was dying on a croſs, and in ſuch circumſtances of infamy and diſtreſs, that even his own diſciples ſeemed to queſtion, whether this was he who was to deliver Iſrael. But while in ſuch a diſgraceful ſituation, this condemned malefactor acknowledges him to be a King, owns him as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, implores his favor, and carries his views to that ſpiritual kingdom, which, as one obſerves, "fleſh and blood and human reaſon could never have diſcovered; a kingdom, which no eye, but the eye of faith could have ever perceived, and which even they, who had enjoyed the advantage of three years inſtruction and converſation, never yet perfectly underſtood. This was a confeſſion ſo reſolute, ſo ſingular, ſo illuſtrious, that no preacher, no apoſtle, no martyr ever came up to the heightening commendations of it; none gave ſo ample a teſtimony to the bleſſed Jeſus, becauſe none had this peculiar excellence, of giving it under ſo many diſadvantageous and diſcouraging circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances." His faith is yet more illuſtrious, if, as moſt expoſitors ſuppoſe, he had not heard of Chriſt before, but embraced the firſt opportunity he ever had of confeſſing him.—What pretence can wicked and ungodly men under the goſpel have, to draw this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample into a precedent, to ſupport their preſumption and obſtinate continuance in ſin? Can they make
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012759_0016_0F94FA3DDB924210"/>
the caſe of a man, who, perhaps, never heard of Chriſt, or only tranſiently, and who owned him when every one elſe forſook him, a parallel to their's, who have all their days ſat under the light and preaching of the glorious goſpel, and have refuſed to ſubmit to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Saviour, now the reproach of the croſs is ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually rolled away, and he is declared to be the Son of God with power, by his reſurrection from the dead? Why ſhould a delaying ſinner take encouragement from this example of the thief, unleſs he were ſure of having the ſame ingenuity of mind that he had? It is not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to be expected, that every ſincere convert ſhould attain to the ſame eminent degree of faith to which he aroſe; no doubt, the leaſt degree of a holy regard to Jeſus Chriſt will be accepted. But as it was very extraordinary in this man to profeſs Chriſt under ſuch peculiar circumſtances; ſo it is very uncommon for one who has been careleſs and profligate in his life, to find a heart to repent, and to reſign himſelf up to Chriſt in his laſt moments. 'Tis true, nothing is too hard for omnipotent grace, but the enquiry is not what God <hi>can</hi> do, but what, according to his word, and his uſual method of dealing with ſinners, we may reaſonably expect he <hi>will</hi> do; and according to theſe rules, we cannot look upon the extraordinary caſe in our text, as eſtabliſhing a precedent for common and ordinary caſes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This was an extraordinary time, ſuch as will never be again. The Lord of glory was expiring on a croſs; it was ſitting, that, at ſuch a time, there ſhould be ſome illuſtrious trophy of divine power and grace. What ſingular glory doth the converſion of this ſinner reflect on our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? By this he evidenced his ſuperiority to the powers of earth and hell, though he ſaw fit to yield, for a time, to their malice. In this his moſt humble ſtate, he, as it were, led captivity captive, by reſcuing a ſoul of which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan doubtleſs ſuppoſed himſelf ſecure. The other
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012759_0017_0F94FA3F3B36B8D0"/>
malefactor ſays to our Lord with an air of inſolent contempt, "If thou be Chriſt, ſave thyſelf and us." Our Lord could eaſily have done this and much more, but how then would the ſcriptures have been fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thus it muſt be? But though our Lord did not come down from the croſs, to anſwer the demand of this hardened wretch, he exerted his power in a manner much more worthy of himſelf, and agreably to the great deſign of his coming into the world; he bowed his companion's heart, and ſaved him from the wrath which is to come. But what encouragement can this afford to delaying ſinners? can they ſuppoſe that the Son of God will again deſcend from heaven and die upon the croſs? and if ſuch a time and ſuch circumſtances are never likely to come again, ſurely, no one can argue, with any degree of certainty, that he ſhall become a true penitent, becauſe this was the happy caſe with the thief, for whoſe converſion there was ſuch an extraordinary reaſon.</p>
            <p>I might go on, and obſerve the folly and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe who encourage themſelves in delays from this example, as it is dreadfully uncertain, whether they ſhall have an opportunity, in their expiring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to repent and commit themſelves into the hands of the Redeemer. Many are ſnatched ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the eternal world. Many are deprived of reaſon by the force of the diſeaſe with which they are viſited. Others are ſtupid and inſenſible with reſpect to ſpiritual and eternal things. But the time calls me to the Improvement of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From what we have heard we are led to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the ſovereignty of divine grace. By ſovereignty, I do not intend that God ever acts without the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of wiſdom: An infinitely wiſe Being muſt always have the higheſt reaſon for what he does. Nor dare I ſay, that he hath no regard to any diſpoſition in us,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012759_0018_0F94FA3F649D1F88"/>
when he confers pardon and happineſs. But he is not accountable to any of his creatures, nor doth he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beſtow his favors on thoſe we ſhould think moſt proper to be diſtinguiſhed, nor in the time and way we ſhould expect: The Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth, nor are his ways our ways. Behold a miſerable malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor exerciſing true repentance in his dying moments, and received into favor, while the learned Scribes and Phariſees, the rulers and teachers of the people, are left impenitent and unpardoned! The boiſterous, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man jailor believes and is ſaved; but the hopeful young ruler, who accoſted our Saviour with ſo much reſpect, enquiring with great ſeeming earneſtneſs, and in the prime and vigor of life, about the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, went away ſorrowful! According to our view of things, a malefactor condemned to die for his enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crimes would be the moſt unlikely to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but Chriſt makes him an eminent example of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace. "God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth." And that which makes the ſovereignty of God the more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, in this inſtance, is, the diſtinction made between the two criminals. Nothing appears but that they were equal in their guilt, they had been perhaps part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their crimes, as they were conſigned to the ſame puniſhment: But behold one is taken, and the other left! One remains hardened in his impiety, the other is melted into contrition and the moſt ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſorrow! It was the God of all grace who made them to differ. He, by his almighty energy, ſubdued the heart of the one, and made him ſuch an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous penitent; while the other breathed out blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and reproaches againſt the Son of God, and was left to periſh in his ſins. The one hath infinite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to adore the wonderful grace extended to him, the other cannot complain of injuſtice, he received but the juſt reward of his doings. And we have all reaſon to adore the ſovereignty of God, in ſhewing mercy to one and leaving the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:012759_0019_0F94FA40136C07D8"/>
Secondly, How unreaſonable and dangerous is their conduct, who take encouragement from the thief upon the croſs, to delay their repentance! This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, you ſee, is every way extraordinary; and therefore cannot, with the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon, be taken as a precedent, or ſpecimen of God's common method of dealing with ſinners. It may, indeed, with reaſon be ſuppoſed, that there have been others, who reſembled this thief in the ſincerity of their repentance, as they have been like him in the lateneſs of it, whom God hath received to his mercy; but have we not reaſon to fear, that the repentance of moſt, when they apprehend themſelves in dying circumſtances, is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and deceitful, extorted only by the terrors of an awakened conſcience, and the fear of eternal miſery? Though we are to hope the beſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular perſons, yet if we judge by examples, can we judge very favorably of death bed repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? If we examine the after conduct of thoſe, who have been raiſed from the gates of death, and who, in that ſituation, have appeared with the ſtrongeſt marks of humility and penitence; how very rare is it to find any, upon whom the impreſſions of religion have been abiding! With reſpect to the moſt," it hath happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them according to the true proverb, the dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire." And it deſerves particular notice, that even at this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary time, when our Saviour was dying on the croſs, though he had mercy on one of thoſe who were cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with him, yet he left the other in a ſtate of blindneſs and inſenſibility. The one is, as it were, hung up a monument of vengeance, the other is ſet up as a trophy of the Redeemer's victory over the Prince of darkneſs. There is as much reaſon that the one ſhould awaken us to the greateſt attention and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, as that the other ſhould encourage us to hope in the mercy and grace of God. Yea, as an attention to the great things of religion is every one's immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012759_0020_0F94FA40CDBDF990"/>
duty, and will be followed with unſpeakable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and as delays in this caſe are extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, we ought to improve this whole narration, as an argument to repentance, inſtead of abuſing it to harden ourſelves, againſt the methods of inſtruction, with which an infinitely merciful God is pleaſed to favor us.</p>
            <p>Let us then be excited to repair to our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for pardon and ſalvation. Let none neglect it, ſeeing it is a matter of the greateſt importance. Let none defer it, ſeeing life is uncertain, and opportunity may ceaſe. Let none give way to dejection and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, however great and aggravated their ſins have been: You ſee God can extend mercy to ſuch as you, in a conſiſtency with the perfection of his nature, and the dignity of his government; and ſo long as he can, who can ſay but he will? Your caſe is hazardous, it may not be deſperate. The merits of Chriſt are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to atone for the greateſt offences, there have been inſtances of great ſinners becoming great peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, there is no declaration in the word that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes you from hope. There can be no reaſon for preſumption, or for continuance in an evil courſe, but there is great encouragement to be found in the way of duty. It is your beſt, your wiſeſt courſe to wait upon God, in the ways of his appointment, who can tell but he may hear the voice of your ſupplication, have mercy upon you, and ſave you? Your caſe is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly hopeful, if you are rouſed to a deep concern and ſollicitude about your eternal ſtate. Let your caſe be what it will, your ſins ſmall or great, many or few, the direction of the goſpel is, "If any man thirſt let him come to me;" and the merciful declaration is, "Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out."</p>
            <p>But it is undoubtedly expected by my hearers, that I ſhould more particularly addreſs the <hi>poor priſoner</hi> who now ſtands forth in this aſſembly, a ſpectacle to angels and to men</p>

               <hi>Unhappy young Man!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is at your earneſt and repeated deſire, that I have taken upon me to be your monitor this day, probably the laſt Lord's-day you have to ſee on earth. My tho'ts very ſoon fixed on the ſtory of the penitent thief, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I have been diſcourſing. Your ſituation is in ſome reſpects ſimilar to his—You have been a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor as he was—The crime for which you was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended is of the ſame kind with his—You are to die, as he did, a victim to public juſtice. But your caſe is very different from his, if he had never heard that Jeſus was the Meſſiah till he was hanging on the croſs:—You have heard this glorious truth all your days;—You have ſinned againſt the light of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, againſt the love and grace of the Redeemer.—You have ſlighted the merciful invitations, and kind warnings with which the ſcriptures abound.—You have been an atrocious ſinner—an obdurate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.—You have been guilty of ſecret ſins—You have committed preſumptuous tranſgreſſions.—You have gone on from one crime to another, until your iniquity hath found you out, and you are condemned to die by the law of the land.—But I mean not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach you with your crimes, or to kindle reſentment in the minds of my hearers againſt you—I pity you from my very ſoul—My bowels yearn, when I look upon you—a young man—in the ſtrength and vigor of life; and who might, in a courſe of nature, have lived many years, and have been, had you taken to good courſes, a comfort to your friends, and a bleſſing to ſociety, and conſider, that you are, in a few—a very days, to be cut off from the land of the living, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a public ignominious death. I pity you ſtill more, when I conſider you as an offender againſt the great God, the righteous Governor of the world, and in danger of his eternal wrath. You are, in a few days, to appear before the judgment ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt, of which the moſt auguſt tribunal in this world is but a faint

emblem—<hi>There,</hi> you are to give an account of the things done in the body, of all the actions of your paſt life—<hi>There,</hi> you are to hear your final doom.—In this ſupreme Court, there will be no occaſion of witneſſes to prove your guilt; or of any to point out your violations of the divine law. Your own heart will convict you, and conſcience will be inſtead of a thouſand witneſſes—<hi>There</hi> every mouth will be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; your guilt will ſtrike you dumb.—If you fear the deſtruction of your body, can your heart endure the thought of this infinitely more amazing condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?—Well may your fleſh tremble for fear of God; with infinite reaſon may you be afraid of his judgment. We wonder not, if, in the contemplation of this amazing ſcene, you cry out, in terror and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs—Who ſhall ſtand before this holy Lord God—Men and brethren what ſhall I do?</p>
            <p>But, is your caſe deſperate?—Is there no room for hope? Bleſſed be God, there is. I bring you this day glad tidings of great joy—The King of heaven is a merciful King—He can be juſt, and yet juſtify the ſinner that believeth in Jeſus—The blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin—The inſtance of our text, though it give you no reaſon to conclude that your ſins will certainly be forgiven, yet, affords a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt deſpair. You may from hence enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome hope that you are yet within the reach of mercy. Have you been a great offender? Jeſus Chriſt is an almighty Saviour—Are you the chief of ſinners? attend to the words of an inſpired apoſtle, "it is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief."—Is the wrath of God revealed againſt all unrighteouſneſs? Are we told that "the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God"—Are <hi>thieves</hi> particularly enumerated, in the catalogue the apoſtle Paul gives of ſinners who will be excluded this bleſſedneſs? Yet hear what this holy apoſtle adds,

"ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God."<note n="§" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note>

            <p>Repentance, you juſt heard, is never too late, if it be ſincere; and it is an everlaſting truth, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved. Here then, <hi>poor unhappy youth!</hi> is a door of hope for you, even for you;—Behold a fountain opened for ſin, and for uncleanneſs, for wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of every kind. Look to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Caſt yourſelf on the infinite mercy of God, through this divine Redeemer. Our glorious Lord is ſeated at the right hand of God, he hath entered into his kingdom, he hath all power committed to him in heaven and in earth. Say to him, with faith and the deepeſt contrition, <hi>Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me, now thou haſt taken poſſeſſion of thy kingdom!</hi> You have not, indeed, ſuch an extraordinary opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to confeſs Chriſt, nor to ſhew your regard to him, as the penitent thief had: Chriſt is now far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the impious attempts of his enemies: But you may, by an eye of faith, view him as crucified, as having given his life a ranſom for ſinners. You may view him, ſtanding before the throne, as a Lamb that had been ſlain, and there pleading the merits of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning ſacrifice. Tho' your faith ſhould not attain that eminence, which diſtinguiſhed the faith of the thief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſs, yet if it be ſincere, it will be graciouſly accepted, and gloriouſly rewarded. Gloriouſly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it will be, though you ſhould gain only the loweſt ſeat in heaven, though Chriſt ſhould only remember you in his kingdom, and you ſhould be laſt in the tokens of his favor and love.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be your happy caſe, to be admitted to the receptacle of the bleſſed, and it will be, if you are a ſincere penitent and a ſound believer, oh! with what humble gratitude, will you adore that rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

—that ſovereign grace, which, from the chief of ſinners, hath raiſed you, to be a ſaint in glory! and of a condemned malefactor, hath made you a King and Prieſt unto God! With what holy joy, will you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the wonders of redeeming love! and praiſe the God of all grace, even for thoſe ignominious ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which through his infinite mercy, have been made to prepare you for a bleſſed immortality! This, <hi>poor condemned criminal!</hi> is the happineſs which the goſpel reveals. This is the happineſs we ſincerely wiſh you; and which it is poſſible for you, who have ſuch a heavy load of guilt upon you, to attain. And will you not, with unceaſing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, pray, that God would thus glorify the riches of his grace towards you? Is there no danger that you will miſs of the bleſſedneſs which the goſpel reveals? I muſt faithfully tell you, there is. While with pleaſure I repeat that gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, ſo full of encouragement to ſinners, "He that believeth ſhall be ſaved," I muſt ſet before you the dreadful contraſt, "He that believeth not ſhall be damned." If you continue in impenitence and unbelief, the wrath of God will abide on you; all the means that have been uſed, and all the pains that have been taken with you, by the miniſters of Chriſt and other chriſtians, ſince you have been in a ſtate of confinement, (and few have experienced more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this regard) all theſe will riſe up in judgment to condemn you. The merciful God will have no mercy upon you—He will baniſh you his preſence—and make you fuel for unquenchable flames. This ſecond death is infinitely more to be dreaded than that which you are ſoon to ſuffer. "Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do; but fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you, fear him."—I have this day ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and curſing—oh! be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to chuſe life—</p>

Our bleſſed Saviour, with aſtoniſhing condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaid to the thief upon the croſs, "this day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe." While the Son of God thus diſplayed the dignity of his character, and manifeſted his infinite mercy to the penitent believing malefactor; what ſacred joy muſt it afford this, I will not ſay unhappy, but, this truly bleſſed man, to have his pardon ſealed by the lips of his Saviour! To hear this kind aſſurance from him, who was the anointed Son of God, the King of Iſrael!—How did his heart riſe in gratitude to God!—How did he rejoice in the thought of being with him, whom he acknowledged as his Lord!—How did he anticipate the joys of heaven!—And with what pungent ſorrow muſt he afterward be a witneſs of the death of this benevolent Saviour!—How muſt he admire his infinite philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throphy!—And in what a horrid light did he view ſin, his own ſins, which occaſioned the ſufferings of this illuſtrious perſon!—He ſaw the dying agonies of the Son of God—he looked to him, and mourned the wickedneſs, the cruelty, and ingratitude of man—He was humbled and confounded, even though he was aſſured by him who is truth itſelf, that God was pacified towards him—The larger experience he had of the grace of the Redeemer, the more would this tragic ſcene affect and diſtreſs him.</p>
            <p>You, <hi>my friend,</hi> are not to expect, even if you are ſo happy as to be converted to God, that you ſhall have ſo ſenſible evidence of this bleſſed change; you will not hear your Redeemer aſſuring you, with an audible voice, that you ſhall have a place in paradiſe—you will not have an immediate revelation from heaven, that you are a child of God, and have an intereſt in the great and precious promiſes of the goſpel. The way in which God makes it evident to his ſaints and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they are to have a place in his kingdom, is by implanting a principle of holineſs, and making them
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012759_0026_0F94FA49D4DC39A8"/>
like his own bleſſed ſelf. It is by their ſanctification he makes it clear that they are juſtified. The Spirit witneſſes with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God, by enabling us to exerciſe thoſe graces, which the ſcripture makes the marks of God's children. It is while they walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit, that they attain to the bleſſed ſatisfaction, that there is no condemnation belonging to them. You <hi>poor priſoner!</hi> are not like to have much time to try yourſelf by theſe marks of grace. You cannot be certain, how you ſhould behave, if you was again al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to appear on the ſtage of action, and was anew expoſed to the ſnares and temptations of this preſent evil world. You have known, young and inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced as you are, you have known <hi>ſome</hi> upon ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, who have had ſuch views of ſin, as that they have been very confident, they ſhould never again al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themſelves in it; and yet, when God hath merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpared them, they have relapſed into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vices; yea, have become more hardened and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious than ever. How do you know? how <hi>can</hi> you know, that you ſhould not be like theſe, if you had opportunity?—You are not like to have ſuch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity—But as ſuch inſtances ſhew you the treachery of the human heart, be very jealous of yourſelf—very cautious how you think your ſtate ſafe—Be careful to lay the foundation right. "Other foundation can no man lay, beſides what is laid, which is Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus." All your dependence muſt be upon him; and all your expectations from him. Through him alone, you can hope for pardon. From him you muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive that divine principle, and that holy diſpoſition, without which you cannot ſee the Lord. Make it your conſtant prayer, that you may not be deceived in a matter of ſuch infinite importance. Adopt the language of the holy pſalmiſt, "Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012759_0027_0F94FA4A920F0818"/>
me in the way everlaſting." It would be dreadful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! to leave the world with a lye in your right hand; to fall from the moſt tow'ring hopes of future bleſſedneſs, into an abyſs of darkneſs and miſery. Be earneſt with God—Be very importunate—that you may not meet with ſuch an awful diſappointment.</p>
            <p>None of us, who are now with you before the Lord, are able to tell the time of our death—Your time is fixed—Your ſentence is pronounced—In leſs than a week, your days will be extinct, the grave will be ready for you. You are to die before a numerous multitude of ſpectators. The infamy, which will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your death, is a circumſtance of little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Your great concern ſhould be, that your ſoul may be ſafe. Commit this ineſtimable treaſure, your precious and immortal ſpirit, into his hands, who is able to keep that which you commit unto him againſt that day. Think of the greatneſs of your ſins—Think of the glory of Chriſt—Think what he hath done for ſinful man, that he hath laid down his life a ſacrifice—Think what he is now doing, that he is interceding for ſinners in the court of heaven—Think of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſs of his power, as well as riches of his grace—humbly plead for mercy. Like the poor publican, ſmite on your breaſt and ſay, God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to me a ſinner!—or take to yourſelf the language of the penitent thief, Lord, remember me in thy kingdom.</p>
            <p>Never think your work done while you have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to live—make much of the little time you have before you—conſtantly read the holy ſcriptures—be diligent in your devout addreſſes to him who only can work in you to will and to do of his good pleaſure—And, God forbid! that we ſhould ceaſe to pray, that He would extend his compaſſion and grace to you, and that the deſtruction of your body may prove the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012759_0028_0F94FA4B514B94F0"/>
ſalvation of your ſoul—It may be an encouragement to you in your prayers, that a multitude of others bear you on their hearts at the throne of grace.</p>
            <p>And now, I ſincerely ſay, Farewell!—The God of heaven have mercy on you and bleſs you, and ſave you with an everlaſting ſalvation!—God knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall ever again ſee each other's face in this world; may he, of his infinite mercy, grant us a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py meeting at the right hand of Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
            <p>I ſhould gladly make ſome more particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the ſubject we have been upon, and of the melancholy ſpectacle before us, to this numerous aſſembly, many of whom their curioſity hath led hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this time. But I have treſpaſſed on your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience already.</p>
            <p>You ſee an unhappy young perſon doomed to die by the ſentence of the civil magiſtrate—Look upon him—and be thankful for thoſe reſtraints of divine grace, whereby you have been kept from ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous tranſgreſſions, as, in the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, often terminate in ignominious puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and earneſtly pray that he would ſtill keep you from ſuch evil practices. When you ſee this ſad conſequence of indulging vice, let it make you watchful againſt your own corruptions, and againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the occaſions of ſin.</p>
            <p>May our children and young people be awakened to think on their ways, and to turn their feet into the path of God's commandments! Behold! O our children and youth! what it is to provoke the Holy Spirit of God, by rebelling againſt him, and reſiſting the kind motives he ſets before you. No one arrives at the higheſt pitch of wickedneſs at once. You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with what you think ſmaller tranſgreſſions, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012759_0029_0F94FA4C2FF12D98"/>
indulge to ſecret ſins; theſe ſilence the voice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, grieve the Spirit of God, and provoke him to leave you to your own hearts luſts; and no one can tell, whither theſe may carry you, nor in what they may end. This poor man, perhaps a few years ago, thought as little of ſuch an early and ignominious death, as any of you. Nothing can be ſo effectual a ſecurity againſt ſuch great tranſgreſſions, as an inward principle of holineſs. This will ſecure the protection of him who is able to with-hold you from ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, there are ſome preſent, who, if their crimes were brought to light, would receive puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from men; but remember, that you cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the righteous judgment of God. Or however innocent you may be according to the law of man, yet you ſtand condemned by the law of God. In God's ſight no fleſh living can be juſtified. You muſt ſoon die, and give an account to him who will judge the world in righteouſneſs. Near as this condemned criminal is to death, you may be taken out of the world before him. Yea, 'tis poſſible, that he may be made a monument of divine grace, and you, who now look upon him as an object of pity and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may be doomed to eternal torments.</p>
            <p>Are you enemies to God by wicked works? This places you in a worſe ſtate, than any temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in itſelf conſidered, could put you in. You are every moment expoſed to everlaſting deſtruction, which is worſe than death. Oh! fly to Chriſt now, while there is hope. I have ſet before this poor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner the only way in which he can be ſaved. There is but one way of ſalvation for you and for him. Make haſte, make no delay; you run a dreadful ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every moment you put off this important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, becauſe the next moment may finiſh your time of probation, and begin your everlaſting doom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:012759_0030_0F94FA52124429A8"/>
It is poſſible, one who has lived all his days in ſin, may repent in his laſt moments. But will you ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your eternal all on a hare poſſibility? 'Tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, you may be the richeſt man in the univerſe; but would not he be deemed a mad-man, who, upon ſuch preſumption, ſhould neglect to uſe means to procure a ſubſiſtence? The madneſs is greater, infinitely grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to neglect the care of our ſouls, which are made for eternity, and are in danger of being loſt forever. Boaſt not thyſelf of to-morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth. Many, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on a future opportunity, have been cut off in their ſins, and their ſouls have been loſt forever.</p>
            <p>Let me exhort and intreat all who may attend the execution of this poor condemned criminal, to lay to heart ſuch an affecting ſight, and to behave with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and ſeriouſneſs on ſuch a ſolemn occaſion. And may the awful ſpectacle be a means of inſtruction and amendment to ſinners! May they find their hearts ſuitably impreſſed; and ſincerely reſolve that wherein they have done iniquity, they will do ſo no more! Let us all implore the Spirit and grace of God, to preſerve us from the great tranſgreſſion—from every violation of his holy law—And may others hear and fear and not dare to do ſo wickedly!</p>
            <p>Let thoſe who have reaſon to think their peace is made with, and hope, that, when they leave this world, they ſhall go to be with Chriſt in paradiſe, give glory to him who hath ſo marvellouſly diſtinguiſhed them. Who maketh thee to differ from other men?—from thoſe who live in vice and ſin?—or from this poor priſoner? or what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it? If God hath thus diſtinguiſhed us, let us adore the ſovereign mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, which hath not only plucked us as brands
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012759_0031_0F94FA54B7EF9480"/>
out of the burning, but raiſed us to the hopes of a bleſſed immortality.</p>
            <p>While you give glory to God who hath called and choſen you, let me beſpeak your earneſt prayers to God for this poor young man, that God would give him true repentance, and diſplay the riches of his grace in his everlaſting ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Let us with gratitude and joy think of that bleſſed time when Chriſt will receive us into his kingdom—when we ſhall be delivered from the trials and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of life—when we ſhall be no more witneſſes of the crimes of others—and ſhall ourſelves be free from thoſe remains of ſin which attend us in this world, and ſhall be perfectly holy and perfectly happy. God grant, that this may be the portion of each one of us, for the ſake of his dear Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord!</p>
