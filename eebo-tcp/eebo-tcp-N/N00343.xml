            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But thus for the Doctrinal handling of the Truth before us: I proceed to make some Application.</p>
            <p>1. By way of Information.</p>
            <p>2. For Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Infor. 1. <hi>This Doctrine justifieth the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority here, in respect of the Sentence of death which has been passed on the Murderer, who is this day to be executed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a man standing before the Lord, and amongst his people this day, who has done just as my Text expresseth, He has smitten his Neighbour, and that <hi>with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Iron too,</hi> with a cruel Spit made of Iron; the thing proved by several Witnesses,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000417_0021_0FA5B4FBE76B04C8"/>
and the man that was hurt dyed by that wound; therefore he that has smitten him is a Murderer, and must surely be put to death; though for a long time he denied it, nevertheless since his Condemnation he has acknowledged it, and yesterday he confessed to me, that he had in his rage murdered the man, whose death and blood has been laid to his charge; he told me that the other gave him some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll language whereby he was provoked, and that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> said to him, if he came within the door, he would run the Spit into his bowels, and he was as wicked as he said he would be, so that he is guilty of Murder. Therefore none ought to blame those in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for causing the Murderer to be put to death; conscience to God, and to the people under their charge, and to their own Souls also, has necessitated them to do what they have done in this matter. Let every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Scripture, Prov. 28.17. <hi>A man that doth violence to the blood of any person, shall flee to the Pit, let no man stay him</hi>; if he has shed blood, to the Pit let him go, and flie thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let all convenient speed be used in the execution of Justice, that so the Land may be cleared from blood, and let no man in Authority stay him, let no private person So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit for him. But let us be thankful to God,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000417_0022_0FA5B4FCA72462C0"/>
that we are under such Magistrates, as will do Justice, and Execute Judgment, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Sin according as the Word of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that it should be done.</p>

And our Lord Jesus Christ in his Exposition of the sixth Commandment, sheweth that rash anger is a degree of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Matth. 5.21, 22. <hi>You have heard that it was said by them of old time, Ye shall not kill, and whosoever shall kill, shall be in danger of the Judgment, but I say unto you, that whosoever is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his Brother without a cause, shall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Judgment</hi> There is Mans Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seat, and Gods Judgment seat: murder makes a man be in danger of the former; sinful anger exposeth him to the latter; not that all anger is sinful, there is an anger that is good, when a man is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry in Gods Cause, moved with zeal and indignation, because God is dishonoured;

that's very good; and a man may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be angry in his own Cause too and yet not sin. <hi>Be angry and sin not,</hi> but when men are angry without a just cause, that's evil.

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> James Morgan, <hi>being Condemned to die, must needs own to the glory of God, that he is Righteous, and that I have by my Sins provoked him to destroy me before my time. I have been a great sinner, guilty of Sabbath-breaking, of Lying, and of Vncleanness; but there are especially two Sins: whereby I have offended the Great God; one is, that Sin of</hi> Drunkenness, <hi>which has caused me to commit many other Sins; for when in drink, I have been often guilty of Cursing and Swearing, and quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and striking others. But the Sin which lieth most heavy upon my Conscience, is, that</hi> I have despised the Word of God, and many a time refused to hear it prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. <hi>For these things, I believe God has left me to that which has brought me to a shameful and miserable Death. I do therefore beseech <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000417_0031_0FA5B5075ECF96A8"/>
lest they provoke the Lord to do to them as he has justly done by me. And for the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peace of</hi> my <hi>own Conscience, I think</hi> my <hi>self obliged to add this unto</hi> my <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Confession, That I own the Sentence which the Honoured Court has passed upon me, to be exceeding just, in as much as though I had no former grudge and malice against the man whom I have Killed, yet my passion at the time of the fact was so out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, as that it hurried me on to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which makes me justly now proceeded against as a Murderer.</hi>

            <p>O Lord, how many are there in this great Assembly, who have lived and do live in those very Sins, for which this man confesseth that God has been provoked to destroy him!

so many Bodies and Souls should be eternally ruined, and no help for it. How few are there, that if once they be addicted to this vice, do ever truly repent of it, or turn from it. There was a man, who hearing that his Son took evil courses, and that he followed such a vice, well (said he) I hope he'll leave that; and that he was given to another vice, I hope (said he) he'll leave that too; but it was told him his Son was given to Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness also: Nay, then (said he) <hi>I have no hope of him.</hi> I will not say (as he did) there is no hope that ever a Drunkard should repent, but I say, there have been but few such instances in the world. How rarely have any of you known a man that has been addicted to this Body destroying, and Soul-murdering iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that has truly repented of it, or turned from it again. O then, let men that have any love for their Lives or Souls, beware of this bloody Sin.</p>
            <p>But the other evil which this undone man, does especially cry out of, and which now that he seeth his Soul going into Eternity, he saith, <hi>lieth most heavy upon his Conscience,</hi> is <hi>his despising the Word of God.</hi> I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to hear him speak so, for I have known several Condemned Persons, who have made the same out-cry. <hi>O nothing terrifieth our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,

some say, that there are many hundreds, nay, some thousands in this place, that seldome hear a Sermon Preached, from one end of the year to the other; if that be so, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lamentable.

            <p>I Pray God that I may be a warning to you all, and that I may be the last that ever shall suffer after this manner: in the fear of God I warn you to have a care of taking the Lords Name in vain; mind and have a care of that Sin of Drunkenness, for that is a sin that leads to all manner of sins
