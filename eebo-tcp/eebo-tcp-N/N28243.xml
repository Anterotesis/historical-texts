            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>2 SAMUEL, iii. 38.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>And the king ſaid unto his ſervants, Know ye not that there is a prince, and a great man, fallen this day in Iſrael?</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE man, the great man, to whom the king of Judah refers in this paſſage, was Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Abner, commander in chief of the armies, <hi>the thouſands of Iſrael.</hi> He was poſſeſſed of great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical and military abilities. Theſe he diſplayed in the cabinet, and in the courſe of that bloody war which continued long <hi>between the houſe of Saul and the houſe of David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Attached to his country by warm affection, he voluntarily ſtept forth in the defence of its rights, its liberties, civil and religious; and fought the battles of the Lord of Hoſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>He was highly eſteemed by his countrymen. His name gave pleaſure to all ranks, and to all
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037646_0004_100F2C6EE7D9C840"/>
ages, of citizens; and in Abner, the great Abner, they placed the moſt unreſerved confidence.</p>
            <p>He was now grown old in the ſervice of his country; and the time of his departure drew near. Like all other great men, the general muſt die! His exit was attended with circumſtances peculiarly affecting. This ſolemn event took place when his friends were promiſing themſelves great advantages from his wiſdom, patriotiſm, fidelity, and perſeverance. They were then hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the renewal of a union between them and a nation with whom they were now at war. Yea, a treaty was, at that very time, actually on foot for the deſirable purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This great man was interred with peculiar marks of reſpect. We are informed, in the ſacred page, that <hi>king David himſelf followed the bier.</hi> His memory was embalmed with military honours. The ſcene drew tears from the vaſt multitude that attended upon the affecting occaſion; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the funeral proceſſion. <hi>And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lift up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:037646_0005_100F2C711E0A3750"/>The text then may be conſidered as an eulogy delivered at the tomb of this great man. It contains the effuſions of a heart deeply affected with the ſubject, and appears to be ſpoken with all the energy of oriental eloquence. The orator was the ſweet Pſalmiſt of Iſrael. <hi>And the king la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented over Abner; and all the people wept again over him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to impreſs the minds of the riſen, and eſpecially the riſing generation, with a ſenſe of the obligations they were under to this great man, orders were iſſued by authority, that proper badges of mourning ſhould be worn by the citizens in honour to the renowned and illuſtrious general. <hi>And David ſaid to Joab, and to all the people, Rend your clothes, and gird you with ſackcloth, and mourn before Abner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people, no doubt, were the more deeply affected by this event, the fall of this pillar of the ſtate, as the times were <hi>troublous.</hi> There was not that harmony in ſentiment, with reſpect to the public meaſures, which every friend to ſociety moſt devoutly wiſhed; and war, though at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, raged with relentleſs fury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:037646_0006_100F2C7354683E40"/>What tidings were theſe to the great national council! to the army! to the citizens! and to every benevolent friend of mankind! <hi>Abner is fallen!</hi> fallen from his ſphere of honour, dignity, and uſefulneſs! fallen by the all-conquering arm of the great deſtroyer of man! How much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, what military glory, are conſigned to the narrow limits of his venerable tomb! This brave man is fallen into the ſilent grave! <hi>There, princes, counſellors, and the priſoners, reſt together. The ſmall and the great are there, and the ſervant is free from his maſter. They lie down alike in the duſt, and the worms ſhall cover them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a gloom was now ſpread over the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nation! Yea, a neighbouring prince, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the irreparable loſs ſociety ſuſtained in the death of this great man, obſerves, <hi>I am this day weak, though anointed king.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, in the courſe of Divine Providence, a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and flouriſhing family, an agreeable circle of acquaintance, an opulent and increaſing town, a whole nation, by the death of an important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, may indulge a momentary deſpondency, and ſay, <hi>Clouds and darkneſs are round about him.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037646_0007_100F2C75711F4970"/>
Thy judgments are a great deep. Thy way is in the ſea, thy paths in the great waters, and thy footſteps are not known.</hi> But to the pious, who ever truſt in God, light, like the morning ſun, ariſes from the conſoling conſideration, that <hi>righteouſneſs and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</hi> Theſe, when darkneſs ſpreads over the political horizon; when thoſe great and good men, who by their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and influence <hi>ſeemed to be pillars</hi> in church and ſtate, are removed by death; yea, theſe, with unſhaken confidence in Jehovah, <hi>are glad, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This paſſage, my brethren, contains ſentiments which harmonize with the preſent feelings of the United States, with a variation, the propriety of which all muſt acknowledge to be juſt: Know ye not, my friends, that General WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, one of the greateſt and beſt of men, is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in America!</p>
            <p>Who can refrain, upon this mournful and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn occaſion, from exclaiming, O Death! what a victim doſt thou now embrace in thy cold arms! Thou art indeed the king of terrors.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:037646_0008_100F2C782D81F6A0"/>I. WASHINGTON was great.</p>
            <p>His Maker endowed him with diſtinguiſhed mental faculties, and formed him for great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions. His mind was ſolid, contemplative, ſedate, vigorous, tenacious, and determined. His acquirements were ſuch as rendered him agreeable, inſtructive, and eminently uſeful, to his connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions and to mankind. His genius was prolific: its productions were ſuch as diſplayed depth of thought, ſoundneſs of judgment, peculiar penetration, and unconquerable energy. But what gave a luſtre to his great abilities, his aſſemblage of virtues, and to all his heroic achievements, was, the uprightneſs, the benevolence, of his heart. What a diſintereſted regard for the welfare of his country animated him, in his various exertions, while he was engaged in the moſt hazardous enterpriſes!</p>
            <p>He had an uncommon knowledge of men, of nations, and of the art of war. Of this no one can doubt, who will read the hiſtory of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican war. Through our long conteſt with Britain, this Great Man, in the moſt trying cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, diſplayed the wiſdom, the courage, the united qualifications, which rendered him emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037646_0009_100F2C7B189716F8"/>
in his important ſtation, prepared him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend victoriouſly with the moſt renowned European generals, and, under the protection and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Lord of Hoſts, and God of Armies, to become the ſaviour of his country.</p>
            <p>Thus when fleets and armies arrived upon our coaſt, and had taken poſſeſſion of the town of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, with a view of depriving us of thoſe privileges which our venerable predeceſſors ſo highly valued; when we found ourſelves under the diſagreeable neceſſity to have recourſe to the ſword; to raiſe an army of American youth to defend the liberties, and to ſecure the civil and religious rights, of their native land; at this period of memorable impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Great and Benevolent Governor of the Univerſe had, in his wiſe and merciful providence, provided a WASHINGTON to take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our newly-raiſed army.</p>
            <p>Before this Great Man whole armies fell, laid down their arms, and owned him Conqueror. Proud Britain was defeated in her cruel attempt to ſubdue the Americans; and, "after expending nearly one hundred millions of money, and loſing an hundred thouſand lives, was reduced to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037646_0010_100F2C7D557D7ED0"/>
neceſſity of acknowledging the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the United States."</p>
            <p>In this Great Man were united patience, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, probity, ſincerity, veracity, firmneſs, calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unconquerable perſeverance.</p>
            <p>Actuated by that benevolence which influenced him to ſerve his country almoſt eight years as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the American Army, he refuſed every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary compenſation for his ineſtimable ſervices.</p>
            <p>But the greatneſs of this excellent man was not only exhibited in his military character; his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Abilities ſhone with unſullied luſtre. He was great in the cabinet. Even Congreſs itſelf, that venerable and highly-eſteemed body of wiſe ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were indebted to WASHINGTON for that information which originated thoſe reſolves, the wiſdom of which has aſtoniſhed the world.</p>
            <p>We, my brethren, feel, to this day, the happy effects of his influence in that National Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by whom the plan of our Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was formed, in which WASHINGTON, with his uſual dignity, preſided.</p>
            <p>Called by the unanimous voice of the millions of America, he took the firſt ſeat in our new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037646_0011_100F2C7FCDEF13E0"/>
and we, with gratitude to Heaven, beheld GEORGE WASHINGTON Preſident of the United States.</p>
            <p>Here a wide field was opened; here was ſcope for the diſplay of the abilities of this great and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Patriot.</p>
            <p>All were pleaſed; all rejoiced; for all approved of, and put confidence in, his wiſe and ſucceſsful adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>How ſafe felt all ranks and denominations of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens! and what proſperity was extended over our quiet country! The friends of mankind, upon both ſides of the terraqueous globe, rejoiced that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was favoured with ſuch a Great and Good Man; ſo eminently qualified, and ſo benevolently diſpoſed, to guide their public affairs, and to give energy to their government. Yea, gentlemen of diſtinguiſhed obſervation and philanthropy, who came from the Old to viſit the New World, like Sheba's queen beholding <hi>Solomon in all his glory,</hi> have, with no leſs admiration, when acquainted with this Great Man, exclaimed, <hi>It was a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that we heard in our own land of thy acts, and of thy wiſdom. Howbeit, we believed not the words until
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037646_0012_100F2C82048FCD08"/>
we came, and our eyes had ſeen it. And, behold, the half was not told us. Thy wiſdom and proſperity exceed the fame which we heard. Happy are thy men. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are theſe thy ſervants, who ſtand continually before thee, and that hear thy wiſdom!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As an evidence of the greatneſs of this Man, in the eſtimate of the moſt enlightened and judicious of mankind, the celebrated heroes, politicians, ſtateſmen, and benevolent, of all nations, have conſidered it as their brighteſt ornament to be claſſed with General WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>The friends of religion, who intereſt themſelves in the welfare of ſociety, have not been the inattentive ſpectators of theſe momentous events, theſe amazing revolutions, which have been rolling on; and with which they have felt themſelves, and the cauſe they are engaged in, moſt intimately connected. They have been concerned <hi>for the ark.</hi> Their cloſets can witneſs the ſincerity and fervency of their prayers to their God for their dear country. When therefore they ſaw this Great Man placed at the head of our government, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it as an evidence that God had not forſaken this, though they were a very ungrateful and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037646_0013_100F2C843689AF68"/>
people; but that he had bleſſings in ſtore for the preſent and future generations. They perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and unitedly rejoiced that God had raiſed up this Great Man to be an inſtrument of ſo much good to them and to their brethren.</p>
            <p>It was in an eminent ſenſe ſupporting to the humble followers of the Lamb of God, of which they had the moſt plenary evidence, that WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON was not ſeeking perſonal fame, worldly emolument, popular aggrandizement, and unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power; but through all his military exertions, and his political labours, he was aiming to promote the peace, happineſs and beſt intereſt of his country. This aſſimilated him to the ancient Mordecai, who was <hi>accepted of the multitude of his brethren; ſeeking the wealth of his people, and ſpeaking peace to all his ſeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WASHINGTON diſcovered true greatneſs by his attention to, and uniform regard for, religion. He believed that there was a God who governed the univerſe; <hi>that he doth according to his will in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; that none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doſt thou? Therefore he praiſed, extolled
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037646_0014_100F2C86648BB298"/>
and honoured the God of heaven; all whoſe works are truth, and his ways judgment; and thoſe who walk in pride, he is able to abaſe. He knew that there is no king ſaved by the multitude of an hoſt; a mighty man is not delivered by much ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſaw the hand of God in thoſe remarkable providences which took place under his inſpection, and were the effects of his exertions; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation of events, which preceded, opened the way to, and terminated it, the independence of America. In the hour of victory therefore, he called upon all the brigade of his army to give thanks to the Almighty for his merciful interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in favour of his conquering troops.</p>
            <p>Thus, at the ſurrender of lord Cornwallis, the Commander in Chief of the American army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the officers and ſoldiers to attend upon divine ſervice with a ſerious deportment, and with that ſenſibility of heart, which the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the ſurpriſing and particular interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Providence, in their favour, claimed."</p>
            <p>Recollect, my brethren, his anſwers to the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and flattering addreſſes of his fellow
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037646_0015_100F2C888A1B95E0"/>
citizens; in which he kept his eye upon the government of Jehovah; took nothing to himſelf, but gave all the glory to God.</p>
            <p>Waſhington profeſſed a veneration for the GREAT REDEEMER; was one of his viſible followers; united himſelf to his diſciples; ſat at his table; and commemorated that ſolemn, that moſt intereſting event, which opened the way for the ſalvation of ſinners.</p>
            <p>It was one of the maxims of this Great Man, that religion is the only durable foundation of republican governments. If a people are proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and happy, they muſt acknowledge God in all their ways, obſerve his precepts, and obey his commandments.</p>
            <p>He knew that they, and they only, are truly great, who conſult, and exert themſelves to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, the beſt good, the real happineſs, of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>His conduct upon the ſtage of public life was a ſtriking declaration, that vice is no part of, but is incompatible with, real greatneſs; that a man may ſuſtain the higheſt offices, move in the moſt conſpicuous ſphere, be ſurrounded with the moſt
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037646_0016_100F2C8B713C1870"/>
flattering temptations, and yet not deviate from, nor violate, the laws of his God.</p>
            <p>In the hiſtory of this Great Man we behold the moſt immaculate character that was ever drawn by the pen of an uninſpired hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>Here, my brethren, is an example replete with wiſdom and virtue, worth the attention and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of politicians, magiſtrates, citizens, and perſons of all ranks and ages; an example which not only excites the admiration of the preſent age, but will gain the veneration and applauſe of future generations.</p>
            <p>The greatneſs of WASHINGTON was not eclipſed by his retirement from public life. The very idea of his being alive, an inhabitant of MOUNT VERNON, had a greater tendency to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the union of the States, and to repel foreign invaſion, than an army of twenty thouſand men.</p>
            <p>And when our national affairs wore an alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſpect, we ſee him, at the call of his country, "cheerfully relinquiſh the ſweets of retirement, and once more take the command of the armies of the United States."</p>
            <p>But, while moving in this ſphere of nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al importance; forming the neceſſary arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—death
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037646_0017_100F2C8E32188620"/>
put an end to all his plans; daſhed the high-raiſed expectations of Americans, and filled the world with mourners.</p>
            <p n="2">II. WASHINGTON is fallen.</p>
            <p>This Great Man was mortal. It is the decree, the irreverſible decree, of Jehovah, that man muſt die. <hi>I ſaid, Ye are gods, but ye ſhall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</hi> With propriety may we adopt the affecting lamentation of David over his beloved Jonathan, who fell upon mount Gilboa; <hi>How is the mighty fallen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the decreaſe of this great man, this benefactor, this highly-eſteemed, heroic general, this patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſtateſman, the United States ſuſtain a loſs, an irreparable loſs. His ſudden, unexpected exit has deprived his AMIABLE CONSORT, his dear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, his weeping friends, of this ornament to his country, this juſtly-admired, virtuous, great, and moſt amiable man.</p>
            <p>The departure of ſuch a man, in the preſent ſituation of our public affairs, muſt be conſidered as no common calamity to our nation, and even to the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:037646_0018_100F2C8FC304B868"/>But the ſcene is cloſed! We muſt ſee his face no more! His voice, which charmed thouſands, is ſucceeded by a ſolemn, awful ſilence. His pen, that taught leſſons moſt important to ſociety, has dropped from that hand, which, guided by an enlightened mind, a virtuous heart, has charmed the world by its productions.</p>
            <p>The Wiſe and Holy Governor of the Univerſe hath in the courſe of his providence, which is ever juſt and righteous, removed from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of calamity the Father of his Country. Yes, there lies WASHINGTON, upon a level now with a continental ſoldier! Both ſleep quietly together, in the ſame grave; the houſe appointed for all the living.</p>
            <p>It is true, ſo long as the human mind is poſſeſſed of the power of recollection, the character, the example, of this great man muſt be immortal.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is reaſonable that we ſhould take pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic notice of this alarming event.</p>
            <p>When Abner died, the king, the court, the army, the citizens, aſſembled; and, as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of their reſpect, dropt a tear over the fallen general.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:037646_0019_100F2C9152409798"/>Much honour moſt certainly is due to the memory of thoſe great men who have rendered eſſential ſervice to their country.</p>
            <p>How immenſe is our debt of gratitude to God, who raiſed up this Great Man, and qualified him for his diſtinguiſhed ſtation!</p>
            <p>Upon this occaſion ſorrow hath filled our hearts. Americans put on ſackcloth; they wear badges expreſſive of the general lamentation. We are all mourners this day.</p>
            <p>That venerable ſage, the renowned ADAMS, Preſident of the United States, muſt ſenſibly feel, and unite with Congreſs in deploring, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of this Great Man.</p>
            <p>The army contemplate the death of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with the keeneſt ſenſibility; and expreſs their undiſguiſed grief in the animated ſtyle of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient military corps: WASHINGTON was <hi>worth ten thouſand of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Children of God, the Diſciples of Jeſus, are the moſt ſincere mourners in this day of darkneſs. They, it is true, are reconciled to all the divine adminiſtrations. But when men of diſtinguiſhed worth, and of eminent uſefulneſs, are ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037646_0020_100F2C94365ADF08"/>
by death, they conſider it as a token of the diſpleaſure of God; a judgment of Heaven upon an u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ateful, wicked people.</p>
            <p>The face of every citizen, who is a friend to his country, gathers paleneſs, and neighbour addreſſes neighbour in the language of the text: Know ye not that WASHINGTON, that great and good man, is fallen in our Iſrael!</p>
            <p>But why do events like theſe take place in the wiſe and perfect government of the the Moſt High God?</p>
            <p n="1">1. This event is calculated to impreſs the mind of man with a ſenſe of univerſal mortality.</p>
            <p>Here we have the irreſiſtible evidence, that the moſt diſtinguiſhed abilities, conſpicuous virtues, wealth, honour, popularity, extenſive uſefulneſs, all that the world eſteem great and valuable, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſecure the poſſeſſor from ſepulchral darkneſs, the gloomy manſion of the grave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for man, his days are as graſs; as the flower of the field ſo he flouriſheth. The wind paſſeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof ſhall know it no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His days are determined; the number of his
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037646_0021_100F239AD67CED70"/>
months are with thee; thou haſt appointed his bounds, that he cannot paſs. Man lieth down, and riſeth not till the heavens be no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How loud the preſent call! how alarming the admonition!</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of the king of Macedon, that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his ſervant, though he might be ſurrounded by his nobles, his generals, all the pomp and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry of his court, every morning to enter his apartment, and to whiſper in his ear, PHILIP, THOU ART MORTAL.</p>
            <p>May rulers and ruled hear the voice of God in this ſpeaking providence: <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may we, my brethren, daily repeat the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of ancient piety, <hi>Lord, make us to know our end, and the meaſure of our days, what it is, that we may know how frail we are.</hi> In the view of our approaching diſſolution, may we realize the vaſt importance of <hi>repentance towards God, and of faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that when he who is the believer's life ſhall appear, we may appear with him in glory. Therefore be ye alſo ready, for at ſuch an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:037646_0022_100F2C98DCE5C420"/>2. By the death of General WASHINGTON we are taught not to put too much dependence upon any of our fellow creatures, however great and uſeful.</p>
            <p>Is it not an evidence of the depravity of human nature, that rational beings forget that the <hi>wiſe man dieth?</hi> that the moſt important members in the community <hi>dwell in houſes of clay, whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is in the duſt, which are cruſhed before the moth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I recollect, in the courſe of the American revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, an obſervation of a young continental offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who had, not many days before, left the camp. He was, with peculiar pleaſure, dwelling upon the matchleſs qualities of his General. When it was ſuggeſted, that WASHINGTON was but a man, and that he might ſoon fall a prey to the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer; I know, replied the animated ſoldier, that it is poſſible; but it is highly improbable that a man of his worth; of his importance to America, and to the nations of the earth; a man, too, for whoſe life the prayers of ten thouſand chriſtians daily aſcend to the throne of heaven; <hi>I repeat it,</hi> it is altogether improbable that WASHINGTON ſhould die.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:037646_0023_100F2C9B03F99400"/>The inhabitants of the United States have, perhaps, put too much dependence upon this Great Man. In his death, therefore, God is teaching them, that <hi>it is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in man; it is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The fall of WASHINGTON muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a frown of God upon this people, to whom he was ſo very dear.</p>
            <p>Never, in the view of ſome of our moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened citizens, never did the United States ſtand in greater need of his wiſdom, influence, and exertions: ſo doubtful hang the political ſcales, both in Europe and America. The time, moſt certainly, is truly critical. The loſs, therefore, of this Great Man, at ſuch a momentous criſis, ought to be viewed as a judgment, ſent by the Ruler of nations, upon the inhabitants of this guilty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. God is now correcting us; and, by this providence, he is calling upon us all, old and young, to repent, and turn to God <hi>from all our tranſgreſſions, that iniquity be not our ruin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This event affords matter of conviction, to every reflecting mind, that we are greatly indebted
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037646_0024_100F2C9E1CB37150"/>
to God for preſerving the life of this Great Man to ſo late a period.</p>
            <p>We can recollect times when, if he had been removed, our loſs would have been greater, and his benevolent wiſhes to his country incomplete. But he lived to ſee our enemies defeated, America independent, the Federal Government eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, commerce flouriſhing, agriculture progreſſing, the nation riſing in reſpectability, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity enjoying the bleſſings of civil and religious liberty, his fellow citizens in the quiet and full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the means of political and moral felicity.</p>
            <p>Contemplating theſe deſirable events, WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON drew his glittering ſword. And when he ſaw them accompliſhed, he returned it into its ſcabbard, and retired from the theatre of public life, that he might enjoy the long-wiſhed-for fruits of his perſevering exertions, viz. his countrymen <hi>ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under their vine, and under their figtree, and no one to make them afraid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, while we deplore the death of this Great Man, let us with grateful hearts acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the goodneſs of God in continuing him ſo long a diſtinguiſhed bleſſing to the United States.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:037646_0025_100F2CA059C51F48"/>5. Such events, my brethren, taking place in the wiſe, benevolent and perfect government of God, may be overruled for the greater happineſs of a people.</p>
            <p>Soon after Abner's death peace was eſtabliſhed between Iſrael and Judah. One of the wiſeſt of men was placed at the head of the nation, the armies were diſbanded, the ſound of war was heard no more, and Ophir's gold enriched the public treaſury. The temple of the Lord reared its ſacred head; the tribes of Iſrael, from Dan to Beerſheba, preſent themſelves before, and devoutly worſhip, the God of Abraham. Prayers and praiſes aſcend to Jehovah. We are informed, that <hi>they went unto their tents joyful, and glad of heart, for all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the Lord had done for his people.</hi> Thus their mourning is turned into joy. The hand of the Lord is more viſibly ſeen, both in the hour of adverſity and proſperity, and to God they aſcribe all the glory.</p>
            <p>Although our beloved Friend has <hi>cloſed his eyes,</hi> and now ſleeps the long ſleep of death, <hi>the Lord liveth.</hi> He governs his great empire in the moſt deſirable manner. The preſent very affecting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037646_0026_100F2CA1E7182208"/>
connected with, and being part of, his great plan, will be overruled for the diſplay of his glory, and promote the beſt good of all thoſe who are reconciled to the divine will; thoſe <hi>who love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God can raiſe up men, and qualify them for the moſt important ſtations in ſociety. He can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the minds of this people to eye his correcting hand in the fall of this great man, General WASHINGTON; and beſtow the richeſt of his bleſſings upon our dear country.</p>
            <p>May we hear the voice of inſpiration, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the preſent occaſion is particularly pertinent: <hi>Put not your truſt in princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts periſh. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May light ariſe in darkneſs upon the United States, and God be glorified in the ſalvation of our country.</p>
