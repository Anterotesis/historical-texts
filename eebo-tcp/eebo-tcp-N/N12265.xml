            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CONSTITUTION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS the many tyrannical and oppressive usurpations of the King and Parliament of Great Britain, on the rights and liberties of the people of the American colonies, had reduced them to the necessity of introducing a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Congresses and Committees, as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary expedients, and to exist no longer than the grievances of the people should remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out redress.</p>
            <p>AND WHEREAS the Congress of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of New-York, did on the thirty-first day of May now last past, resolve as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"WHEREAS the present government of this colony by Congress and Committees, was instituted while the former government under the crown of Great-Britain existed in full force; and was established for the sole purpose of opposing the usurpation of the British Parliament, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to expire on a reconciliation with Great-Britain, which it was then apprehended would soon take place, but is now considered as remote and uncertain.</p>
            <p>"AND WHEREAS many and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences attend the said mode of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Congress and Committees, as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, in many instances, legislative, judicial, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015472_0003_0F99846D43547A60"/>
executive powers have been vested therein, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since the dissolution of the former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the abdication of the late Governor, and the exclusion of this colony from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the King of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>"AND WHEREAS the Continental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress did resolve as followeth, <hi>to wit,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>WHEREAS his Britannie Majesty, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juction with the Lords and Commons of Great-Britain, has, by a late act of Parliament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the inhabitants of these United Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from the protection of his crown.—And whereas no answers whatever, to the humble pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the colonies for redress of grievances and reconciliation with Great-Britain, has been, or is likely to be given, but the whole force of that kingdom, aided by foreign mercenaries, is to be exerted for the destruction of the good people of these colonies.—And whereas it appears abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely irreconcileable to reason and good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for the people of these colonies, <hi>now</hi> to take the oaths and affirmations necessary for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of any government under the crown of Great-Britain; and it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed, and all the powers of government exerted under the authority of the people of the colonies, for the preservation of internal peace, virtue and good order, as well as for the defence of our lives, liberties, and properties, against the hostile invasions, and cruel depredations of our enemies.</p>
               <p>Therefore, RESOLVED, That it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the respective assemblies and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015472_0004_0F99846DF791B540"/>
conventions of the United Colonies, where no government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs has been hitherto established, to adopt such government as shall, in the opinion of the representatives of the people, best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular, and America in general.</p>
            </q>
            <p>"AND WHEREAS doubts have arisen whether this Congress are invested with sufficient power and authority to deliberate and determine on so important a subject as the necessity of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and constituting a new form of government and internal police, to the exclusion of all foreign jurisdiction, dominion and controul whatever. —And whereas it appertains of right solely to the people of this colony to determine the said doubts, Therefore</p>
            <p>"RESOLVED, That it be recommended to the electors in the several counties in this colony, by election in the manner and form prescribed for the election of the present Congress, either to authorize (in addition to the powers vested in this Congress) their present deputies, or others in the stead of their present deputies, or either of them, to take into consideration the necessity and propriety of instituting such new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as in and by the said resolution of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental Congress is described and recommended: And if the majority of the counties, by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties in Provincial Congress, shall be of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that such new government ought to be insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and established; then to institute and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish such a government as they shall deem best
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015472_0005_0F99846EB39BCAC0"/>
calculated to secure the rights, liberties and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the good people of this colony; and to continue in force until a future peace with Great-Britain shall render the same unnecessary. And</p>
            <p>"RESOLVED, That the said elections in the several counties, ought to be had on such day and at such place or places, as by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of each county respectively shall be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. —And it is recommended to the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, to fix such early days for the said electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as that all the deputies to be elected have sufficient time to repair to the city of New-York by the second Monday in July next; on which day all the said deputies ought punctually to give their attendance.</p>
            <p>"AND WHEREAS the object of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going resolutions is of the utmost importance to the good people of this colony,—</p>
            <p>"RESOLVED, That it be, and it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by earnestly recommended to the Committees, freeholders, and other electors in the different counties in this colony, diligently to carry the same into execution."</p>
            <p>AND WHEREAS the good people of the said colony, in pursuance of the said resolution, and reposing special trust and confidence in the members of this Convention, have appointed, authorized and empowered them for the purpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and in the manner, and with the powers in and by the said resolve specified, declared and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:015472_0006_0F99846F677FD8D0"/>AND WHEREAS the delegates of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed American States, in general Congress conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did on the fourth day of July now last past, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly publish and declare, in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"WHEN in the course of human events, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes necessary for one people to dissolve the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical bands which have connected them with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
            <p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.—That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate, that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes, and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015472_0007_0F9984702A482860"/>
the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of the colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer system of government. The history of the present King of Great-Britain, is a history of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated injuries and usurpations, all having in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect object, the establishment of an absolute ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny over these States. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
            <p>"He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p>
            <p>"He has forbidden his Governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglected to attend to them.</p>
            <p>"He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation in the legislature; a right inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</p>
            <p>"He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:015472_0008_0F998471066E1288"/>"He has dissolved representative Houses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>
            <p>"He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the legislative powers, incapable of annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have returned to the people at large, for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p>
            <p>"He has endeavoured to prevent the popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these States; for that purpose obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to pass others to encourage their migrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hither, and raising the conditions of new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations of lands.</p>
            <p>"He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judiciary powers.</p>
            <p>"He has made judges dependant on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>
            <p>"He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.</p>
            <p>"He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislatures.</p>
            <p>"He has affected to render the military independant of, and superior to, the civil power.</p>
            <p>"He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation,</p>

            <p>"He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>

            <p>"In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress, in the most humble terms: Our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.

            <p>"Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connection and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them as we

            <p>"We, therefore, the Representatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERAL CONGRESS assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world, for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the good people of these colonies, solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publish and declare, That these United Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great-Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as FREE AND INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDENT STATES, they have full power to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which INDEPENDENT STATES may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honour."</p>
            <p>AND WHEREAS this Convention having taken this declaration into their most serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, did on the ninth day of July last past, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously resolve, that the reasons assigned by the Continental Congress, for declaring the United Colonies, free and independent States, are cogent and conclusive: And that while we lament the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el necessity which has rendered that measure una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable we approve the same, and will at the risque

of our lives and fortunes join the other Colonies in supporting it.</p>
            <p>By virtue of which several acts, declarations and proceedings, mentioned and contained in the afore recited resolves or resolutions of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Congress of the United American States, and of the Congresses or Conventions of this State, all power whatever therein hath reverted to the people thereof, and this Convention hath by their suffrages and free choice been appointed, and among other things authorized to institute and establish such a government, as they shall deem best calculated to secure the rights and liberties of the good people of this State, most conducive of the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular, and of America in general.</p>
            <p n="1">I. This Convention therefore, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State, doth ORDAIN, DETERMINE and DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLARE, that no authority shall on any pretence whatever be exercised over the people or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this State, but such as shall be derived from and granted by them.</p>

This Convention doth further in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State, ORDAIN, DETERMINE and DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLARE, that the supreme legislative power, within this State, shall be vested in two separate and distinct bodies of men; the one to be called the Assembly of the State of New-York; the other to be called the Senate of the State of New-York; who together shall form the legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

And that all bills which have passed the Senate and Assembly, shall, before they become laws, be presented to the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for their revisal and consideration; and if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such revision and consideration, it should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear improper to the said Council, or a majority of them, that the said bill should become a law of this State, that they return the same, together with their objections thereto, in writing, to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or House of Assembly, in whichsoever the same shall have originated, who shall enter the objections sent down by the Council, at large, in their minutes, and proceed to reconsider the said bill. But if after such reconsideration, two thirds of the said Senate or House of Assembly, shall, notwithstanding the said objections, agree to pass the same, it shall, together with the objections, be sent to the other branch of the legislature, where it shall also be reconsidered, and if approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

And further, that once in every seven years, after the taking of the said first Census, a just account of the electors resident in each county shall be taken; and if it shall thereupon appear, that the number of electors in any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, shall have encreased or diminished one or more seventieth parts of the whole number of electors, which on the said first Census shall be found in this State, the number of representatives for such county shall be increased or diminished accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, that is to say, one representative for every seventieth part as aforesaid.</p>
            <p n="6">VI.

            <p>BE IT ORDAINED, that as soon as may be, after the termination of the present war, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States of America and Great-Britain, an act, or acts be passed by the legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this State, for causing all elections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

            <p>IT IS FURTHER ORDAINED, that if after a full and fair experiment shall be made of voting by Ballot aforesaid, the same shall be found less conducive to the safety or interest of the State, than the method of voting <hi>viva voce,</hi> it shall be lawful and constitutional for the legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to abolish the same; provided two thirds of the members present in each House, respectively shall concur therein: And further, that during the continuance of the present war, and until the legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of this State shall provide for the election of Senators and Representatives in assembly by Ballot, the said elections shall be made <hi>viva voce.</hi>
