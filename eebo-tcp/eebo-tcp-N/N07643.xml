            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Importance of the liberal education of youth, both to church and ſtate, and the neceſſity of public ſchools and colleges for that end, is now ſo univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, as to render an enlargement upon it unneceſſary, by way of introduction to the following account. The main deſign of this publication, is to acquaint the world, with the riſe, progreſs, and preſent ſtate of the COLLEGE OF NEW-JERSEY, which for ſome Years paſt, hath been an Object of public Attention.</p>
            <p>THE great diſadvantages, this, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous provinces lay under, ſome years ago, for want of ſuch an inſtitution, are well known. The diſtance of the britiſh univerſities, and the expences
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009752_0004_0F7A47DE090D8528"/>
attending an education abroad, were, to the american coloniſts, inſuperable obſtacles. The two colleges of <hi>New-England,</hi> and that of <hi>Virginia,</hi> then the only ſeats of learning, in the wide-extended britiſh empire in America, were too remote from each other, to extend their influence through theſe intermediate colonies. Hence, in point of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a large tract of a well-peopled country, neceſſarily lay rude and uncultivated.</p>
            <p>AS the colonies encreaſed, the exigencies of affairs, both of an eccleſiaſtical and political nature, became more and more urgent. Religious ſocieties were annually formed, in various places; and had they long continued vacant, or been ſupplied with an ignorant illiterate clergy, chriſtianity itſelf, in a courſe of years, might have become extinct among them. Affairs of ſtate alſo became more embarraſſed for want of proper direction, and a competent number of men of letters, to fill the various political offices. The bench, the bar, and ſeats of legiſlation, required ſuch accompliſhments, as are ſeldom the ſpontaneous growth of nature, unimproved by education.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:009752_0005_0F7A47E04D3C7168"/>YET, even in this dark period, there were not wanting ſeveral gentlemen, both of the civil and ſacred character, who, forming a juſt eſtimate of the importance of learning, exerted their utmoſt efforts, to plant and cheriſh it in the province of <hi>New-Jerſey.</hi> After ſome diſappointments and fruitleſs attempts, application was at length made to his excellency <hi>Jonathan Belcher,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> at that time governor of the province, and, in the year 1748, he was pleaſed, with the approbation of his majeſty's council, to grant a CHARTER, incorporating ſundry gentlemen of the clergy and laity, to the number of twenty-three, as truſtees; inveſting them with ſuch powers, as were requiſite to carry the deſign into execution, and conſtituting his majeſty's governor for the time being, <hi>ex officio,</hi> their preſident.</p>
            <p>THAT the conſtitution of this college, is founded upon a free and catholic bottom, and calculated for the equal and general advantage, of every religious denomination of proteſtants, will clearly appear, by the following extract from this charter; <q>AND WHEREAS by the fundamental Conceſſions made at the firſt Settlement of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> by
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009752_0006_0F7A47E12AA79DE0"/>
the Lord <hi>Berkely</hi> and Sir <hi>George Carteret</hi> then Proprietors it was among other things conceded and granted that <hi>no Freemen within the ſaid Province ſhould at any time be moleſted puniſhed diſquieted or called in Queſtion for any Difference of Opinion or Practice in Matters of religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment who do not actually diſturb the Peace of the ſaid Province they behaving themſelves peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and quietly and not uſing this Liberty to Licenciouſneſs nor to the civil Injury or outward Diſturbance of others</hi> WHEREFORE and for that the ſaid Petitioners have alſo expreſſed their earneſt Deſire that thoſe of every religious Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination may have free and equal Liberty and Advantage of Education in the ſaid College any different Sentiments in Religion notwithſtanding &amp;c. &amp;c.</q> The world hath here the ſtrongeſt atteſtation, of the liberal principles, not only of the government in granting, but alſo of the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners themſelves in their application for a charter. The views of the latter, extended to the common benefit, of all their proteſtant brethren. Indeed, had they been otherwiſe diſpoſed, the conſtitution happily diſables them, from ever perverting the inſtitution, to any narrow or ſiniſter purpoſes: For
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009752_0007_0F7A47E1BB38D3E0"/>
the charter further contains the following clauſe, <q>And we do further will give and grant unto the Truſtees of the ſaid College that they and their Succeſſors or the major part of any thirteen of them which ſhall convene for that Purpoſe may make and they are hereby fully empowered to make and eſtabliſh ſuch Ordinances Orders and Laws as may tend to the good and wholſome Government of the ſaid College and all the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and ſeveral Officers and Miniſters thereof and to the public Benefit of the ſame not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Laws and Statutes of our Realm of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> or of this our Province of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> and not excluding any Perſon of any religious Denomination whatſoever from free and equal Liberty and Advantage of Education or from any of the Liberties Immunities or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the ſaid College on Account of his or their being of a religious Profeſſion different from the ſaid Truſtees of the ſaid College &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IF any unfavourable repreſentations, have been any where made of this inſtitution, as an illiberal ſcheme, contrived to ſubſerve the contracted inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of a religious party, it manifeſtly appears,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009752_0008_0F7A47E8D5AEEF10"/>
from the above view of its fundamental conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they are untrue and groundleſs. And, from its management hitherto, which is no ſecret, it may be affirmed in the face of the world, that the execution has been as fair, impartial, and generous, as the plan upon which it was originally founded.</p>
            <p>THUS were the truſtees poſſeſſed of a naked charter, without any fund at all to accompliſh the undertaking. This, in the eyes of ſome, gave it the appearance of an idle chimerical project. Their only reſource, indeed, under the ſmiles of Heaven, was in the beneficence of the advocates and friends of learning. After various ſolicitations in <hi>America,</hi> the contributions, tho' often generous and worthy of grateful acknowledgment, were found by no means adequate to the execution of ſo extenſive a deſign. Therefore, in the year 1753, two gentlemen were ſent as agents to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſolicit additional benefactions. There the inſtitution was honoured, beyond the moſt ſanguine expectations, with the approbation and liberality of ſeveral political and eccleſiaſtical bodies; and of many private perſons
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009752_0009_0F7A47E94FE09EF8"/>
of the nobility and gentry, among the laity and clergy of various denominations.</p>
            <p>THE ſtudents, in the mean time, who, in the beginning, were few in number, lived diſperſed in private lodgings, in the town of <hi>Newark;</hi> at which place, the college was firſt opened; the public academical exerciſes being generally performed in the county court-houſe. The difficulties and danger of theſe circumſtances, both with regard to the morals and literary improvement of the youth, could ſcarcely have been encountered ſo long, had it not been for the indefatigable induſtry and vigilance of Mr. PRESIDENT BURR, the firſt who officiated in that ſtation. And it was much owing to his unremitted zeal and activity, that this college ſo ſuddenly roſe to ſuch a flouriſhing condition.</p>
            <p>THE truſtees, thus generouſly aſſiſted, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſet about erecting a building, in which the ſtudents might be boarded as well as taught, and live always under the inſpection of the college officers, more ſequeſtred from the various tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, attending a promiſcuous converſe with the world, that theatre of folly and diſſipation. The
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009752_0010_0F7A47EB841BC200"/>
little village of <hi>Princeton</hi> was fixed upon, as the moſt convenient ſituation; being near the center of the colony, on the public road between <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and not inferior in the ſalubrity of its air, to any village upon the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
            <p>THE edifice being nearly finiſhed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſacred to liberty and revolution-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, was denominated NASSAU-HALL, from that great deliverer of <hi>Britain,</hi> and aſſertor of proteſtant liberty, K. WILLIAM the IIId, prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Naſſau.</hi> It will accommodate about 147 ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, computing three to a chamber. Theſe are 20 feet ſquare, having two large cloſets, with a window in each, for retirement. It has alſo an elegant hall, of genteel workmanſhip, being a ſquare of near 40 feet, with a neatly finiſhed front gallery. Here is a ſmall, tho' exceeding good organ, which was obtained by a voluntary ſubſcription: Oppoſite to which, and of the ſame height, is erected a ſtage, for the uſe of the ſtudents, in their public exhibitions. It is alſo ornamented, on one ſide, with a portrait of his late majeſty, at full length; and, on the other,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009752_0011_0F7A47EC4590F510"/>
with a like picture, (and above it the family-arms neatly carved and gilt,) of his excellency governor BELCHER. Theſe were bequeathed by the latter to this college. The library, which is on the ſecond floor, is a ſpacious room, furniſhed at preſent with about 1200 volumes, all which have been the gifts of the patrons and friends of the inſtitution, both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> There is, on the lower ſtory, a commodious dining hall, large enough to accommodate as many as the houſe will contain, together with a large kitchen, ſteward's apartments, &amp;c. The whole ſtructure, which is of durable ſtone, having a neat cupola on its top, makes a hanſome appearance; and is eſteemed to be the moſt conveniently plan'd for the purpoſes of a college, of any in <hi>North-America;</hi> being deſigned and executed by that approved architect Mr. <hi>Robert Smith,</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the year 1757, the ſtudents, to about the number of 70, removed from <hi>Newark,</hi> the houſe being then ſo far completed, as to be ready for their reception. Experience ſoon taught the ſociety, the ſuperior convenience of their new circumſtances. The numbers encreaſed very faſt. The country
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009752_0012_0F7A47ED05517EF8"/>
became more and more convinced of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of learning, in general, and the utility of ſuch a ſeat of education in particular; both from the regularity of its adminiſtration, and the figure which ſeveral of its ſons already made, in the various literary profeſſions. But it was not long before it ſuffered, what was then looked upon, as an almoſt irretrievable loſs. For this ſame year died, univerſally deplored, Mr. PRESIDENT BURR.<note n="*" place="bottom">

eulogium, publiſhed ſoon after his deceaſe.<note n="‡" place="bottom">By WILLIAM LIVINGSTON, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </note> The ſame year died alſo his excellency governor BELCHER, who continued, to the laſt, a zealous patron of religion and learning. His library, conſiſting of 474 volumes, together with ſeveral other uſeful and ornamental articles, he left to this college, of which he was himſelf the founder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:009752_0015_0F7A47EF4BA8F858"/>THE REV. MR. JONATHAN EDWARDS ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the preſidentſhip. Great were the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the public, from the adminiſtration of a clergyman of his very diſtinguiſhed rank in the literary world. But in a few days after his arrival at <hi>Naſſau-Hall,</hi> he was ſeized with a mortal diſtemper: And it pleaſed the ſovereign of the univerſe to call him from this ſtage of action, before he could apply his ſkilful hand to the work, which his predeceſſor had ſo dexterouſly forwarded.</p>
            <p>THUS a vacancy again enſued, which continued near eighteen months; when the Rev. Mr. SAMUEL DAVIES, of <hi>Virginia,</hi> was choſen to the Office: A gentleman, well known on both ſides the atlantic; but who was, perhaps, no where more eſteemed and beloved than at <hi>Naſſau-Hall;</hi> His fine talents, added not a little, to the dignity and reputation of the ſociety, which received many improvements, from his ingenuity and polite taſte. The repeated ſtrokes it had lately ſuffered, in the loſs of two ſuch excellent heads, extremely affected the well-wiſhers to the intereſts of virtue and literature. But the cloud now ſeemed to be diſperſed, and all things to revive within. For,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009752_0016_0F7A47F1A465F670"/>
tho', in the vacancy of the chair, there always had been one of the board of truſtees, appointed to act, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> yet, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that as to any new improvements in the education of the youth, matters were, in a great meaſure, at a ſtand.—But how uncertain are human things! How precarious the moſt elevated hopes! In the month of <hi>February,</hi> 1761, this brilliant genius, in the midſt of his riſing reputation and growing uſefulneſs, ſuddenly reſigned his breath, to the inconſolable grief of the whole ſociety, and univerſal lamentation of all good men.</p>
            <p>SOON after his death, the Rev. Dr. SAMUEL FINLEY, was elected to the preſident's chair: a gentleman, who for many years, had diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf in the management of a private academy at <hi>Nottingham</hi> in <hi>Penſylvania;</hi> and in the month of <hi>July</hi> following, he arrived at NASSAU-HALL, and entered upon his office. As to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this ſucceſſion, the preſent flouriſhing ſtate of the college, the general diligence of the youth in their literary purſuits, and the internal harmony and good order ſo obſervable in the ſociety, are ſufficient atteſtations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:009752_0017_0F7A47F27A8166D8"/>WE ſhall now give the world ſome account of the modes of government and inſtruction, together with the whole plan of education, the manner and expences of boarding, the circumſtances of the fund, and whatever elſe may be requiſite to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a view of the preſent ſtate of the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>IT would be unneceſſary and tedious, to trouble the reader, with a minute detail of all the private laws and ſtatutes, which have been made, from time to time, for the better regulation of its members. They are intended, in general, to ſettle the terms of admiſſion, to preſcribe the duties, and adjuſt the powers of the officers, who are univerſally accountable to the truſtees: and eſpecially to direct the conduct and ſtudies of the youth; and to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train them from ſuch liberties and indulgencies, as would tend to corrupt their morals, or alienate their minds from a ſteady application. In theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, it hath been the deſign to fix upon a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, between too great a licentiouſneſs on the one hand, or an exceſſive preciſion on the other. The penalties are generally of the more humane kind; ſuch as are at once expreſſive of compaſſion to the offender, and indignation at the offence; ſuch
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009752_0018_0F7A47F2FA767228"/>
as are adapted to work upon the nobler principles of humanity, and to move the more honourable ſprings of good order and ſubmiſſion to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The laws indeed authoriſe the infliction of pecuniary mulcts, according to the practice of other colleges; but they are ſeldom executed, as it would ſeem to be puniſhing the parents for the offences of the children. It cannot be recollected, that there have been above three or four ſines impoſed, for upwards of three years laſt paſt; nor even one, ſince Dr. FINLEY hath preſided. And in thoſe few ſingular caſes, it was done, rather for the ſake of variety, as another particular method, of fixing a brand of odium upon a bad action, than as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary puniſhment. A ſmall fine will anſwer that end, as well as a larger.</p>
            <p>IN the exerciſe of diſcipline, the more uſual proceſs is this.—The preſident or tutors, ſeparately or in conjunction, privately reaſon with the offender, in order to make him ſenſible of his ill conduct; and endeavour, by their manner of addreſs, to convince him, that in their proceedings againſt him, they are actuated from motives of ſincere regard to his own welfare, and that their ſeverity is
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009752_0019_0F7A47F9F7279160"/>
not the effect of moroſeneſs, ill-nature, or perſonal reſentment. If the offence charged, be denied, evidences are adduced in proof of it. But if the youth diſcovers an ingenuous temper, by an open frank acknowledgment, ſuch a diſpoſition is encouraged, by a mitigation of the puniſhment. On the other hand, all low and diſhoneſt artifices, particularly lying and wilful equivocation, are reſented as the higheſt aggravations. In the reſult, if found guilty, according to the nature of the offence, he is diſmiſſed either with a private reprimand, or required to ſubmit to a public formal admonition;—or, to make a penitent confeſſion in the hail, before the whole houſe;— or, deprived of ſome of the peculiar privileges of his claſs;—or, for ſome limited time, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a free converſation with his fellow ſtudents, and admiſſion into their chambers, as unworthy of their ſociety;—or, ſuſpended from reſidence, and all the privileges of the college, until the matter be laid before a committee of ſix of the truſtees. In theſe ſeveral kinds and degrees of puniſhment, an impartial regard is had, not only to the nature of the offence, but alſo to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, age, rank in college, habitual conduct,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009752_0020_0F7A47FD106B4710"/>
and other circumſtances of the offender. Suſpenſion is the higheſt cenſure the preſident and tutors can inflict. The power of expulſion is veſted in any ſix of the truſtees convened; who, having had no connections with the offender, cannot be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of prepoſſeſſion or partiality. It may not be amiſs, in this place to remark, that among one hundred and twenty pupils, who, for this year paſt, have been under the care of the immediate governors of the college, there have been but very few, whoſe conduct hath rendered them obnoxious even to the milder methods of puniſhment. This is mentioned, particularly, in due reſpect to the gentleman who now preſides; government being the moſt difficult and delicate part of the preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal office. To teach a claſſic author, or ſyſtem of philoſophy is a much eaſier taſk, than to govern a ſociety of youth, in the gay and volatile period of life, when the paſſions are predominant, and reaſon but in a forming ſtate; a ſociety, collected from almoſt all the ſeveral colonies on this continent, educated in different manners, with different views, and an endleſs variety of tempers and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. To govern ſuch a ſociety, ſo as at once to command their veneration, and conciliate their
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009752_0021_0F7A47FD87955C48"/>
love: To grant every innocent liberty, and, at the ſame time, to reſtrain from every enſnaring indulgence: To habituate them to ſubjection, and yet maintain their reſpective ranks without inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or ſervility: To cheriſh a ſenſe of honour, without ſelf-ſufficiency and arrogance: In a word, to inſpire them with ſuch principles, and form them to ſuch a conduct, as will prepare for ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more extenſive connections, with the grand community of mankind; and introduce them on the theatre of the world, as uſeful ſervants of their country.—This is the taſk, the arduous taſk, of a governor of the college: To which, how few are equal!</p>
            <p>AS to the branches of literature taught here, they are the ſame with thoſe which are made parts of education in the European colleges, ſave only ſuch, as may be occaſioned by the infancy of this inſtitution. The ſtudents are divided into four diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct claſſes, which are called the <hi>Freſhman,</hi> the <hi>Sophomore,</hi> the <hi>Junior,</hi> and the <hi>Senior.</hi> In each of theſe, they continue one year; giving and receiving, in their turns, thoſe tokens of reſpect and ſubjection, which belong to their ſtandings; in order to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009752_0022_0F7A47FE41AE7350"/>
preſerve a due ſubordination. The <hi>Freſhman</hi> year is ſpent in the latin and greek languages, particularly in reading <hi>Horace, Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Orations,</hi> the <hi>Greek Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Lucian</hi>'s <hi>dialogues,</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s <hi>Cyropaedia.</hi> In the <hi>Sophomore</hi> year, they ſtill proſecute the ſtudy of the languages, particularly <hi>Homer, Longinus,</hi>  and enter upon the ſciences, geography, rhetoric, logic, and the mathematics. They continue their mathematical ſtudies throughout the <hi>Junior</hi> year; and alſo paſs through a courſe of natural and moral philoſophy, metaphyſics, chronology, &amp;c. and the greater number, eſpecially ſuch as are educating for the ſervice of the church, are initiated into the hebrew. As to this ſo unhappily unpopular lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, no conſtraint is laid upon the youth to the ſtudy of it. But it is to be wiſhed, it may ſoon be more univerſally eſteemed, a uſeful and important acquiſition, as we are told it already is, among the politeſt literati in <hi>Europe.</hi> It opens an inexhauſtible fund of criticiſm, both to the divine, and the poet. But the reader is referred to Mr. <hi>Addiſon, Spec.</hi> vol. 6. N. 405, where are diſplayed the ſuperior beauties of the ſacred poeſy.—To return, the <hi>Senior</hi> year is entirely employed in reviews and compoſition. They now reviſe the moſt improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009752_0023_0F7A47FF17F5C230"/>
parts of the latin and greek claſſics, part of the hebrew bible, and all the arts and ſciences. The weekly courſe of diſputation is continued, which which was alſo carried on through the preceeding year. They diſcuſs two or three theſes in a week; ſome in the ſyllogiſtic, and others in the forenſic manner, alternately; the forenſic being always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the engliſh tongue. A ſeries of queſtions is alſo prepared, on the principal ſubjects of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and revealed religion. Theſe are delivered publicly, on ſundays, before a promiſcuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as well as the college, in order to habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate them early to face an aſſembly, as alſo for other important and religious ends, to which they are found conducive. There is likewiſe a monthly oration-day, when harrangues, or orations of their own compoſition, are pronounced before a mixt auditory. All theſe compoſitions before mentioned, are critically examined with reſpect to the language, orthography, pointing, capitalizing, with the other minutiae, as well as more material properties of accurate writing.</p>
            <p>BESIDE theſe exerciſes in writing and ſpeaking, moſt of which are proper to the <hi>Senior</hi> claſs, on
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009752_0024_0F7A47FFC79E2A30"/>
every monday three, and on the other evenings of the week, excepting ſaturdays and ſundays, two out of each of the three inferior claſſes, in rotation, pronounce declamations of their own compoſing, on the ſtage. Theſe too are previouſly examined and corrected, and occaſion taken from them, early to form a taſte for good writing. The ſame claſſes alſo, in rotation, three on tueſday evenings, and two on the other evenings, with the exceptions juſt mentioned, pronounce, in like manner, ſuch ſelect pieces from <hi>Cicero, Demoſthenes, Livy,</hi> and other ancient authors; and from <hi>Shakeſpear, Milton, Addiſon,</hi> and ſuch illuſtrious moderns, as are beſt adapted to diſplay the various paſſions, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify the graces of utterance and geſture. A good addreſs, and agreeable elocution, are accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo ingratiating, and ſo neceſſary to render a public ſpeaker, eſpecially, popular; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſeful, that they are eſteemed here, as conſiderable parts of education, in the cultivation of which no little pains are employed.</p>
            <p>THE claſſics are taught, for the three firſt years, in nearer the uſual method of grammar ſchools, than in the laſt. The ſtudents then
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009752_0025_0F7A48008CCA3350"/>
reviſe them, principally as examples of fine compoſition. They firſt give a more literal tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a paragraph, afterwards the ſenſe in a paraphraſe of their own, and then criticiſe upon the beauties of the author: In which work they are aſſiſted by the preſident. No authors are read more particularly with this view, than <hi>Homer, Horace,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Longinus</hi>—
<q>
                  <l>"Whoſe own example ſtrengthens all his laws,</l>
                  <l>"And is himſelf the great ſublime he draws.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>EACH claſs recites twice a day; and have always free acceſs to their teachers, to ſolve any difficulties that may occur. The bell rings for morning prayer at ſix o'clock, when the ſenior claſs read off a chapter from the original into engliſh. The preſident then propoſes a few critical queſtions upon it, which, after their conciſe anſwers, he illuſtrates more at large. The times of relaxation from ſtudy, are about one hour in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening: And in theſe are included the public meals. Evening prayer is always introduced with pſalmody; and care is taken to improve the youth in the art of ſacred muſic.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:009752_0026_0F7A480143772948"/>THE uſual method of inſtruction in the ſciences is this.—The pupils frequently and deliberately read over ſuch a portion of the author, they are ſtudying, on a particular ſcience, as it is judged, they can be able thoroughly to impreſs upon their memories. When they attend their recitations, the tutor propoſes queſtions on every particular they have been reading. After they have given, in their turns, ſuch anſwers, as ſhew their general acquaintance with the ſubject, he explains it more at large; allows them to propoſe any difficulties; and takes pains to diſcover whether his explications be fully comprehended. Advantages, which are ſeldom attainable, in the uſual method of teaching by lecture.</p>
            <p>IN the inſtruction of the youth, care is taken to cheriſh a ſpirit of liberty, and free enquiry; and not only to permit, but even encourage their right of private judgment, without preſuming to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with an air of infallability, or demanding an implicit aſſent to the deciſions of the preceptor.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Senior, Junior,</hi> and (towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of their year) the <hi>Sophomore</hi> claſſes, are
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009752_0027_0F7A4801FAB84D88"/>
allowed the free uſe of the college library, that they may make excurſions beyond the limits of their ſtated ſtudies, into the unbounded and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated fields of knowledge; and, eſpecially, to aſſiſt them in preparing their diſputations, and other compoſitions. But the comparatively ſmall aſſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of modern authors, in the library, is one of thoſe remedileſs diſadvantages, this inſtitution muſt lie under, until its funds will afford an enlargement. The preſent collection entirely conſiſts of the donations of the charitable, both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> However, ſhould the truſtees themſelves remain incapable of making additions; it is yet encouraging, that valuable benefactions of this ſort are ſtill, now and then received. Gentlemen who are liberally diſpoſed, but know not what books the library is already poſſeſſed of, may peruſe the catalogue, lately publiſhed, for the information of the public in this matter.—</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed—On the third <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> annually, the <hi>Senior</hi> claſs are examined by the truſtees, the college officers, and other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of learning then preſent, throughout all the branches of literature, they have been here taught.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009752_0028_0F7A4802C09EDBF8"/>
And if approved, as worthy of academical honours, the preſident aſſigns them the parts, they are reſpectively to perform at the anniverſary commencement; the general proceedings of which, are ſo publicly known, as to ſuperceed all neceſſity of deſcription. They are then graduated <hi>Bachelors of Arts.</hi> After an interval of three years, they are uſually admitted to the <hi>Maſter</hi>'s degree. But to this latter, the terms of admiſſion, for theſe few years paſt, have not been ſo lax and indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as formerly. In the year 1760, the truſtees made a reſolve upon this head, which it may not be improper to inſert here, as it ſtands recorded in in the minutes of their proceedings, and is as follows.—</p>
            <q>
               <p>THE conferring academical Honours, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as an Incentive to a laudable Ambition in Study, and as a Reward of literary Merit. And the different Degrees of theſe honorary Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conferred ſucceſſively, at different periods, ſuppoſe a proportioned Increaſe of literary Merit; and conſequently a ſufficient Time of Reſidence in College, for the further Proſecution of Study; and a proper previous Examination to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009752_0029_0F7A48050F14B3D8"/>
diſcover the Improvement of the Candidates. But when promiſcuouſly diſtributed, as curſory Formalities after the uſual Time, without any previous Evidence of ſuitable Qualifications, they ſink into Contempt, as inſignificant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; and no longer anſwer their original Deſign. Therefore the Truſtees determine to admit none to the Degree of <hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> but upon the following Terms.</p>
               <p>ALL Candidates for a <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Degree, ſhall reſide in or near the College, at leaſt one Week immediately preceeding that Commencement, at which they expect to receive their Degrees: during which Time, they ſhall ſubmit to the Laws and Orders of the College: and on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, immediately preceeding the laſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> (on which Day the Anniverſary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement is held,) they ſhall attend in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, in order to paſs ſuch an Examination, as the Truſtees, then preſent, ſhall think neceſſary; eſpecially in ſuch Branches of Literature, as have a more direct Connection with that Profeſſion of Life, which they have entered upon, or have in View; whether Divinity, Law, or Phyſic.

And ſhall make ſuch Preparations for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, as the Officers of the College ſhall judge proper.</p>
               <p>AS ſo ſhort a Reſidence can be an intolerable Inconvenience to but very few, and will render a ſecond Degree a real Honour, the Truſtees will not diſpenſe with it in ordinary Caſes. Yet as the Circumſtances of ſome Perſons, of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Accompliſhments, may render them inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Reſidence, they are to inform the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident by Letter, ſome convenient Time before the Commencement, at which they intend to offer themſelves Candidates, of the Reaſons of their Incapacity, that the Truſtees may judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are ſufficient for a Diſpenſation for the whole, or any Part of the Time required.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THIS law, as is declared in another place, extends alſo to the bachelors from other colleges, who ſtand candidates for a higher degree, than they have yet been admitted to. Graduates from other colleges, upon producing their diplomas, or other ſufficient teſtimonials, are admitted AD EUNDEM, without any previous examination: But
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009752_0031_0F7A48067B10D1B0"/>
then, it is inſerted in their diplomas, and publicly declared by the preſident, to be conferred HONORIS CAUSA, according to the practice of ſome uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities abroad. And with regard to all.—None are admitted without teſtimonials of their good moral conduct, while abſent, ſigned by two or more gentlemen of note and veracity, in the place where they have reſided; or, unleſs recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by one of the truſtees, or college officers, from perſonal knowledge.</p>
            <p>AS to admiſſion into the ſeveral claſſes, theſe are the regulations.—Candidates for admiſſion into the loweſt or freſhman-claſs, muſt be capable of compoſing grammatical latin, tranſlating <hi>Virgil, Cicero's Orations,</hi> and the four evangeliſts in greek, and, by a late order, muſt underſtand the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal rules of vulgar arithmetic. Candidates for any of the higher claſſes, are not only previouſly examined, but recite a fortnight upon tryal, in that particular claſs for which they offer themſelves; and are then fixed in that, or a lower, as they happen to be judged qualified: But, unleſs in very ſingular and extraordinary caſes, none are received after the junior year.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:009752_0032_0F7A480DBAC614E0"/>BESIDE theſe examinations for admiſſion into the reſpective claſſes, and the laſt examination of the ſenior claſs, previous to their obtaining the firſt collegiate honours; the three inferior claſſes, at the end of every year, are examined in ſuch of the claſſics, arts and ſciences, as they have ſtudied, in order for admiſſion into the next: And ſuch as are found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified, are not allowed to riſe in the uſual courſe. Theſe, in like manner as the laſt examination of the ſenior-claſs, are attended upon by the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and tutors, in conjunction with any other gentlemen of liberal education, who chuſe to be preſent. Dr. <hi>Finley</hi> hath alſo inſtituted quarterly examinations of the three claſſes, before mentioned: But theſe are not ſo univerſal as the former, being reſtricted only to what they have ſtudied, during the quarter. They have been found to anſwer excellent purpoſes; for thereby, the inſtructors can eaſily obſerve the gradual progreſs each one makes; and are thence enabled, either to encourage or warn them, as their ſeveral caſes require. Hence alſo, as it may be imagined, it hath not a little conduced, to the aſſiduity and carefulneſs of the ſtudents, in their daily preparations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:009752_0033_0F7A480E316F0B68"/>THERE is a grammar-ſchool annexed to the college, as a nurſery for it, under the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the preſident, though not a part of the original conſtitution. This was firſt ſet up by preſident BURR, and has been handed down to his ſucceſſors, the truſtees taking it under their patronage, during the ſeveral vacancies in that office. Beſides the latin and greek languages, into which the youth are here initiated, they have been alſo early taught the graces of a good delivery, and ſpent a ſmall portion of every day in improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hand-writing; for which purpoſe, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per attendant hath been hitherto provided. But this expedient being found by experience not fully to anſwer thoſe purpoſes, it was lately judged proper that an engliſh ſchool ſhould be alſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, for the ſole intention of teaching young lads to write well, to cypher, and to pronounce and read the engliſh tongue with accuracy and preciſion. The truſtees, in conſequence, have engaged in their ſervice, a young gentleman, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly well accompliſhed as a teacher; who hath now opened this ſchool; which, in like manner with the grammar-ſchool, is put under the general ſuperintendency of the preſident of the College.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:009752_0034_0F7A48105EA88E78"/>INTO theſe ſchools, there are no other terms of admiſſion, than the payment of twenty ſhillings, entrance money; according to the cuſtom of moſt academies. Standing inſtitutions of this nature muſt have maſters to ſupport and manage them, whether there be few or many ſcholars, hence the propriety and neceſſity of requiring ſomething ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional at their entrance. The caſe is ſomewhat ſimilar alſo in the college; the officers of which are, in a great meaſure, ſupported from the tuition money; the fund being quite inadequate to that purpoſe. But what is here previouſly paid, is not ſo properly entrance money, as a ſmall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for the diſpenſation, in regard to the proper charges of the foregoing year or years, which, according to the cuſtom of other colleges, ought to have been ſpent here. This is required of thoſe only, who at their firſt coming, enter into the <hi>Sophomore</hi> or <hi>Junior</hi> claſſes: For later, none are received, unleſs in very ſingular caſes, as hath been already mentioned. At entering into the former, twenty ſhillings is paid, being the fourth part of the tuition money for the preceeding year: And on admiſſion into the latter, forty ſhillings, the fourth part of ſame, for the two foregoing years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:009752_0035_0F7A4811058986B8"/>WE come now to give ſome account of the manner, together with the expences of boarding. It is true, ſo minute a detail of the little affairs of a college, affords but a dry and unentertaining ſtory: And a relation of the oeconomy of a kitchen and dining room, would be ſtill more low and vulgar. But as the judicious reader muſt be ſenſible, that a proper regulation of theſe matters, is of more conſequence to ſuch a community, than a thouſand things that would make a more ſhining figure in deſcription; it is preſumed, that ſome account of them may be expected; and then he will excuſe the dulneſs of the narrative, for the ſake of the importance of the information, to thoſe eſpecially, who may encline to educate their ſons at this college.</p>
            <p>IT is the buſineſs of the ſteward to provide all neceſſaries for the uſe of the ſociety, to employ cooks and other ſervants to cleanſe the chambers, make the beds, &amp;c. The tutors, and all the ſtudents, and ſometimes the preſident, eat together in the dining hall, always ſeated according to rank and ſeniority. No private meals are allowed in their chambers, except with expreſs licenſe on
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009752_0036_0F7A4811C83CD748"/>
ſpecial occaſions. Tea and coffee are ſerved up for breakfaſt. At dinner, they have, in turn, almoſt all the variety of fiſh and fleſh the country here affords, and ſometimes pyes; every diſh of the ſame ſort, and alike dreſſed, on one day; but with as great difference, as to the kinds of proviſion, and manner of cookery, on different days, as the market, and other circumſtances will admit. Indeed, no luxurious dainties, or coſtly delicacies can be looked for among the viands of a college, where health and oeconomy are alone conſulted in the furniture of the tables. Theſe, however, are plentifully ſupplied, without weight or meaſure allowance: And the meals are conducted with regularity and decorum; waiters being conſtantly in attendance. The general table-drink is ſmall-beer or cyder. For ſupper, milk only is the ſtanding allowance; chocolate is ſometimes ſerved as a change. Some of the young gentlemen chuſe, at times, and are indulged, to make a diſh of tea in their apartments, provided it be done after evening prayer; that the time ſpent therein, may not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the hours of ſtudy; except in caſes of indiſpoſition, or other circumſtances, which are previouſly laid before one of the officers, in order to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009752_0037_0F7A48128481EA58"/>
a permit. But this is an article wholly of private expence.</p>
            <p>THE annual charge of education, including tuition money, chamber rent, ſteward's ſalary, ſervants wages, waſhing, fire-wood, and candles, with contingencies, may amount, <hi>communibus annis,</hi> to about twenty five pounds ſix ſhillings lawful money of <hi>New-Jerſey;</hi> for the market riſes and falls; and on ſome of thoſe articles, the expences are arbitrary. Hence frugality in the ſtudent, may ſometimes, without meanneſs, reduce the accompt. The particulars, as they ſtand, for the moſt part, in the ſteward's books, are here ſpecified, and charged upon an average.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:009752_0038_0F7A481345DFE030"/>THO' this inſtitution has ſucceeded, beyond the expectation of its warmeſt friends, notwithſtanding the ſevere ſhocks it received, by the death of three preſidents, in ſo quick ſucceſſion; and its unſettled ſtate, till the chair was filled; yet it ſtill labours under ſeveral deficiencies, which nothing but the beneficent hand of charity can relieve. With mathematical inſtruments, and an apparatus for experiments in natural philoſophy, it is but very indifferently furniſhed. The library wants many of the moſt approved modern writers, as hath been already hinted. It would be alſo of eminent ſervice, had it revenues ample enough, to ſupport profeſſors in ſome of the diſtinct branches of literature; who might each make a figure in his own province, could his ſtudies and inſtructions be confined to his peculiar department. A profeſſor of divinity, eſpecially, for the benefit of the theological ſtudents, would be of ſingular utility. At preſent, there are three tutors, beſides the preſident. To theſe, the college fund, can as yet, afford but ſcanty livings; the tutors particularly, unleſs they aſſume a vow of celibacy, are unable to continue in their offices for life. Hence it happens, that when a young gentleman has, by ſtudy and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009752_0039_0F7A48140127F988"/>
experience, thoroughly qualified himſelf for the employment, he often reſigns it; and the truſtees are then obliged to elect another, perhaps out equally fit for it. Affluent revenues are, indeed, too often fatal ſnares to political bodies, as well as individuals. And ſhould a profeſſorſhip be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a money-jobb, or lucrative poſt, and the ſalaries be ſo conſiderable as to become objects of avarice and ambition to unworthy men, it might be a much greater misfortune to the ſociety, than its preſent indigent ſtate. Hence an income, juſt ſufficient to ſupply the abovementioned defects, and to afford ſuch livings to a proper number of tutors or profeſſors, as would enable them, decently to maintain their families, ſeems only to be deſirable and requiſite.</p>
            <p>THE fund, until within about a year paſt, hath not much exceeded 1300 <abbr>l.</abbr> but from a lottery, which was generouſly ſet on foot by a number of gentlemen in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in favour of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was increaſed to nearly 2800 <abbr>l.</abbr> the neat produce of the ſame, after neceſſary charges, and loſſes which uſually happen, beſides what was diſburſed to pay urgent debts, being about 1500 <abbr>l.</abbr>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:009752_0040_0F7A4814BA4E2D90"/>
Excluſive of the annual ſupport of officers, the expences from other quarters are not inconſiderable; nay, do yearly increaſe, as the number of ſtudents increaſe. The truſtees have been obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the chambers of one whole ſtory of the building, which were at firſt left unfiniſhed, not being then wanted; and to build a large kitchen, with ſervants apartments, both to anſwer its peculiar intention, and, at the ſame time, to leave more room for lodgings in the college itſelf. This too ſtill remains without a proper incloſure of its court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard and back grounds; which would greatly add to the beauty, as well as real convenience of the hall.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the plate hereunto annexed, the court-yard is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as incloſed by a pale-ſence, in like manner with that of the preſident's houſe: But this is done only from the fancy of the engraver.</note> Theſe, together with ſeveral other mediums of expence, will unavoidably exhauſt all the caſh, that can poſſibly be ſpared from its ſlender fund. Hence, is eaſily ſeen, the impoſſibility under preſent circumſtances, of making new additions or improvements, either in regard to books, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus, or eſtabliſhment of profeſſorſhips. Indeed, from the countenance of the general aſſembly of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009752_0041_0F7A481726B178C8"/>
this province, in paſſing an act for a lottery of three thouſand pounds, for the benefit of this college, ſome good addition will probably be made to its revenues. But the returns of this lottery, which was lately drawn, are not yet made; the accompts being ſtill unſettled. However, much greater loſſes have accrued therein, than might have been reaſonably expected, eſpecially from the very unfortunate iſſue of the tickets left, on the riſque of the college, at the time of drawing. So that the managers have reaſon to think, that, on the cloſe of their books, the clear profits will not much exceed <abbr>l.</abbr> 2200. Such an acceſſion can only enable the truſtees, to make ſome addition, perhaps, to the annual allowances of the college officers; tho' not ſuch as will be ſufficient to retain them for life, in the character of profeſſors, much leſs to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a greater number. Beſides, it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that by the time they reap the intereſt of it, another building may become neceſſary: For an addition of 25 or 30 ſtudents more would fill the preſent houſe, in ſuch a manner, as that by no poſſible contrivance, it could be made to contain a greater number, with any tolerable convenience or comfort. And ſhould the numbers increaſe,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009752_0042_0F7A481802388EC8"/>
in the ſame proportion they have done, for theſe three years paſt, (which is as 50 to 70) the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſuch additional building, will be no diſtant event. This, however, would be a work im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be carried into execution, upon the ſtrength of the preſent funds.</p>
            <p>BUT beſide the occaſions of public encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abovementioned, and the many private benefactions received, ſince the foundation of this ſeminary; it is matter of pleaſure to acquaint its friends, that, not long ſince, a very generous legacy was ordered in the will of the late col. <hi>Alford,</hi> of <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay:</hi> The ſum deſigned for this college, is not yet preciſely aſcertained, that being left to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his executors: It is preſumed however, from good intelligence, that the appropriation here will not be leſs in value than <abbr>l.</abbr> 500 ſterling. Benefactions of this ſort are peculiarly honourable,— an indubitable indication of a warm regard for the intereſts of learning, and of the teſtator's high ſenſe of the utility of this ſeat of education in particular. No actions of a man's life are more memorable, than his deeds of liberality, before
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009752_0043_0F7A481879EA0108"/>
the hour of death; when chiefly he conſiders, what diſtribution of the gifts of Heaven, may be moſt agreeable to the will of his divine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. May providence excite an emulation in the breaſts of others, among the virtuous and opulent, to follow an example of ſuch laudable and chriſtian benevolence: A benevolence, which will extend its influence to remote poſterity, and advance the genuine felicity of their country, when they are received into <hi>everlaſting habitations,</hi> and are triumphing in the enjoyment of a glorious RECOMPENSE OF REWARD.</p>
            <p>THUS is exhibited a faithful account of the origin and preſent ſtate of the college of <hi>New-Jerſey:</hi>—A college, originally deſigned for the promotion of the general intereſts of chriſtianity, as well as the cultivation of human ſcience. This end therefore is kept in view, in all the inſtructions and modes of diſcipline: To inculcate or even recommend the diſcriminating opinions of any one proteſtant denomination in preference to another, is carefully avoided. In thoſe matters, the ſtudents are left without any byaſs offered to their private judgments; and are always allowed, without
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009752_0044_0F7A481E8645E948"/>
reſtraint, to attend the religious worſhip of any proteſtant ſociety, whenever they have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, it is preſumed it muſt appear manifeſt upon reflection, to every ſerious obſerver, that providence hath, in a peculiar manner, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended the affairs of this nurſery, from its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the preſent time. And indeed, it is eſteemed by its directors their higheſt honour and happineſs, that the almighty hath vouchſafed ſo remarkably to countenance and ſucceed their undertaking, and thereby to encourage their humble expectations of his continued benediction. To the ſingular favour of Heaven, on the means of inſtruction here uſed, it muſt be gratefully aſcribed, that many youth who have come to <hi>Naſſau-Hall</hi> for education, without any juſt ſenſe of the obligations either of natural or revealed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have been here effectually reformed, become men of ſolid and rational piety, and now appear upon the ſtage of public action, employing their talents to the honour of the ſupreme Beſtower, and in promoting the good of mankind. Hence the managers of this ſeminary are emboldened to hope,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009752_0045_0F7A4820E9132AD0"/>
that while the original deſign of its eſtabliſhment is ſteadily purſued, the ſame indulgent providence which hath hitherto ſupported it, amidſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of envy, and the oppoſitions of malice, will ſtill raiſe up benefactors to ſupply its defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies; and ſucceed their diſintereſted endeavours to train up our youth in the paths of piety and erudition, for the future ſervice of their country, in any civil or eccleſiaſtical employments.</p>
