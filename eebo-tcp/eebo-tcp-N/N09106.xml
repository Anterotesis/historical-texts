            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE puzzle' attending diſputes on ſuch kind of ſubjects as Mr. EDWARDS's book treats of, is probably the principal reaſon why no animadverſions on his diſcourſe have been yet publiſhed. It was preſumed that few who might read it would beſtow attention enough to underſtand it; and of thoſe who ſhould atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively read and underſtand it, few would admit its foundation principles. The author of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent examination is not without apprehenſion, that the reaſon, which hath diſſuaded others, will be thought ſufficient to have diſſuaded him, from ſuch an undertaking. He acknowledgeth that he was diſcouraged with <hi>only reading</hi> this elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and intricate performance ſome years ſince. Yet from the great reputation of Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and prevalence of his doctrine, he came to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of giving this book another and attentive reading: In conſequence of which, the following remarks were drawn up 'the motive' of his 'preſent writing' and publication 'is a perſuaſion of the falſhood of' Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s 'ſcheme; and this perſuaſion' he 'grants and ſees is <hi>neceſſary,</hi>' he 'cannot help this judgment.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Jackſon on human liberty, in anſwer to Cato's letters.</note> And as he hath no manner of doubt but the foundation princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the book before him are falſe, ſo he eſteems them of moſt dangerous tendency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:011623_0004_0F877775DA842988"/>IN a <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>metaphyſical</hi> view, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hath been largely diſcuſſed by ſome of the ableſt writers. The reader may be aſſured, that as little metaphyſical reaſoning as poſſible is uſed in the following pages. For ſuch reaſoning the author hath neither abilities, inclination or leiſure; beſides that there is no great occaſion, and that he perſuades himſelf it would not be edifying. His principal aim is to conſider the ſubject in a <hi>practical</hi> view. In <hi>this</hi> view of liberty and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there is no puzzle, whatever difficulties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſubject when conſidered abſtractly. The inquiſitive may find a full anſwer to the principal arguments of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book, ſpeculatively conſidered, in Dr. <hi>Samuel Clark</hi>'s demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the being and attributes of GOD, in anſwer to <hi>Hobbs, Spinoza,</hi> and their followers; in the ſame learned writer's replies to papers from Mr. <hi>Leibnitz,</hi> and remarks on Mr. <hi>Collin</hi>'s book on human liberty; in <hi>Jackſon</hi>'s defence of liberty againſt <hi>Cato</hi>'s letters, and vindication of the ſame ſubject in anſwer to <hi>Collins.</hi> To whom the author gladly refers, as having ſaved him a taſk to which he pretends not to be equal. Others might be mentioned, who have anſwered ſimilar arguments two thouſand years ago.</p>
            <p>AS we are immediately conſcious of liberty, as it is a truth of the higheſt importance, no embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſsments in theory attending the admiſſion of it, can oblige us to give it up—eſpecially as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it plungeth us into a deeper labyrinth. The human intellect is imperfect; conſequently, things may be conſiſtent though we cannot ſee <hi>how.</hi> The principal purpoſe metaphyſicks can ſerve on practical ſubjects is to obſcure them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:011623_0005_0F8777779C17CD90"/>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> indeed profeſſeth himſelf an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for liberty. Had he profeſſedly denied it, the author would not have engaged in this intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate diſpute: For he eſteems the denial of liberty a like abſurdity and extravagance as the denial of <hi>motion;</hi> or a <hi>material world;</hi> both which have been denied, and the contrary pretended to be demonſtrated, againſt the univerſal experience of mankind. Thoſe things which no man can deny without impeachment of abſurdity and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; it ſeems abſurd to attempt a formal proof of. Should a man, for example, endeavour to convince one who might require a ſtring of ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſms to prove, that the ſun ſhines in a clear day, at twelve o'clock, he would have a very idle imployment: Let him that queſtions it open his eyes, and he cannot want conviction. Let a man look into his own breaſt, and he cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inward freedom—<hi>Inward freedom</hi>—For if freedom be not in the <hi>mind,</hi> it is no where. And liberty in the mind implies <hi>ſelf-determination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This kind</hi> of liberty our author denies. In this ſenſe of liberty alone hath he any controverſy with the writers he oppoſeth. His diſagreement with Lord <hi>Kaims,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Author of the eſſays on the principles of morality and natural religion.</note> is rather in <hi>words</hi> than any thing <hi>real,</hi> notwithſtanding what our author hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to ſcreen himſelf from the imputation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame ſcheme. Their general reaſoning is the ſame. They reaſon on the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and only differ about the meaning of the word <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and a few other words and phraſes. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> affirms, that every volition and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral action is determined by a moral neceſſity, which is as abſolute as natural; and that moral habits
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:011623_0006_0F8777781F375158"/>
are owing to <hi>the nature of things.</hi> He allows on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>external</hi> liberty, ſuch as is the effect of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in the will—and conſtantly denies a power of ſelf-determination. Lord <hi>Kaims</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> affirm, 'that man hath, in no caſe, a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſelf-determination; but is, in all his actions, determined by a moral neceſſity'—which neceſſity they hold to be as real as any other. The only difference is, that Lord <hi>Kaims,</hi> while he allows that GOD has implanted in man's nature an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible feeling of liberty, maintains, that this feeling is <hi>fallacious:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> denies the ſubſiſtence of any ſuch relation as we ſignify by the words cauſe and effect. But whether liberty, as maintained by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> be not altogether <hi>hypothetic,</hi> may appear from the following pages. And as to his notion of cauſe and of effect, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he uſes the former word for any <hi>antecedent,</hi> or the <hi>occaſion</hi> of an event or thing, and the latter for the <hi>conſequence</hi> of another thing (as he tells us he ſometimes doth, p. 58.59.) he ſo far agrees with Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> in <hi>words</hi> as well as <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE author hath only given the outlines of ſome (among many other) arguments which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd to his mind to evince the aſpect Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>'s ſcheme hath on the moral perfections and government of GOD, and its conſequent practical tendency. Had he enlarged on them, it would have lengthened out the enſuing exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination much beyond what either he or the reader would chuſe. The number of pages is now double to what he at firſt deſigned. He hopes for the patience and candor of the public, to whoſe opinion he ſubmits theſe remarks. If they are juſt, they need no apology; if not, no apology can be of any ſervice. If any ſhould
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:011623_0007_0F8777799BE13118"/>
ſuppoſe that in one reſpect at leſt an apology ſhould be made, viz for undertaking to criticize the writings of ſo diſtinguiſhed an author as Mr. <hi>Edwards;</hi> the anſwer is, that if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſign of the propoſed examination is properly purſued and executed, and that reſpect preſerved which is due to the character of a gentleman of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s merit and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, the author hath not tranſgreſſed: But of theſe he is not <hi>himſelf</hi> the proper judge; though he hopes to be acquitted (in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of theſe reſpects eſpecially) by every one that is. Whatever reception his performance may meet with, he is conſcious of the rectitude of his own intentions.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION, Exhibiting a general view of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſcheme; with the deſign and method propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe remarks.</head>
            <p>IT is quite beſide the purpoſe of the following remarks to enquire, Whether the general ſcheme of doctrine Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> intended to eſtabliſh in his enquiry be rational and ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. It is only the <hi>foundation principle</hi> we aim to conſider: The ſyſtem built hereupon, whether true or falſe, is not, by the generality of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſtic Divines, made to depend on the <hi>ſame</hi> baſis.</p>
            <p>THE principal ſubject of the book before us is, 'What determines the will?' And through the whole performance great pains is taken to demonſtrate, that moral neceſſity and liberty are convertible terms. The perplexity, confuſion, and uncertainty, which diſquiſitions of this ſort are attended with, is ſufficiently known. We ſhall endeavour to keep out of the clouds as much as the nature of the ſubject will admit.</p>
            <p>'THE poſition of chief importance,' we are told is, <hi>That the will is neceſſarily determined by the ſtrongeſt motive;</hi> meaning by the ſtrongeſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive 'that, which, in the mind's preſent view, hath the greateſt appearance of good.' 'Every act of the will hath a certain fixed connection herewith, and depends hereupon, as it's cauſe—
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:011623_0010_0F8777801EE512A8"/>
or the ground and reaſon of it.' <note n="*" place="bottom">Enquiry part I. ſect. 2.</note> In ſupport of which it is ſaid, that 'nothing ever comes to paſs without a proportionable cauſe—that the acts of the will, and material things, have a like neceſſary dependance on a cauſe without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves—that moral cauſes may be cauſes in as proper a ſenſe as any cauſes whatever—and moral neceſſity may be as abſolute as natural.' <note n="†" place="bottom">Enquiry p 30, 40, 48, 58, 52, 66, and paſſim.</note>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED, by the word <hi>cauſe</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf to mean, not only 'that which hath a poſitive <hi>efficiency,</hi> or influence to <hi>produce</hi> a thing, or bring it to paſs;' but 'ſometimes any <hi>antecedent,</hi> either natural or moral, poſitive or negative, on which an event, either a thing, or the manner and circumſtance of a thing, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, that it is the <hi>ground and reaſon,</hi> in whole, or in part, why it is rather than not; or why it is as it is, rather than otherwiſe.'<note n="‡" place="bottom">Enquiry p. 57, 58, 9.</note> At the ſame time he aſſerts, that every act of the will is an 'effect neceſſarily dependent and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent on a cauſe, which he calls an <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe; to whoſe' determination and command volition is as much <hi>ſubject,</hi> as the motions of the hands and feet to the volitions which determine and command them—that the acts of the will are as '<hi>paſſive</hi> with reſpect to the antecedent cauſe, ground, or reaſon of them.' <note n="§" place="bottom">P. 183, 184.</note> He maintains, upon the whole, an univerſal neceſſity—that all beings, all events, the manner and all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of things are neceſſarily determined. Yet be profeſſeth himſelf an advocate for liberty, and labours a diſtinction between natural and
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:011623_0011_0F87778136FA2478"/>
moral neceſſity, which diſtinction he apprehends important—natural neceſſity being inconſiſtent with praiſe or blame, while moral is not. The liberty he admits is, however, merely <hi>external,</hi> and the reſult of <hi>neceſſity in the mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a general idea of his plan, ſo far as it will fall under preſent conſideration. In purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our remarks on which, we ſhall,</p>
            <p>FIRST, Examine the ſuppoſed connection of volition with the higheſt motive.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, The indiſſoluble connection of moral cauſes and effects.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Shew that internal, moral liberty, as diſtinguiſhed from external, or natural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to moral agents: Or admitting Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>'s ſcheme of neceſſity to be true in <hi>theory,</hi> it is not applicable to <hi>practice.</hi> It is alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to add, in an appendix, a ſpecimen of coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence between Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and ſome cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated infidels, antient and modern.</p>

            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECT. I. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath not ſhewn wherein the <hi>ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> of motive conſiſts.</head>
               <p>THE enquiry in this place is not, Whether the higheſt motive hath always a cauſal influence on the will? But, admitting this to be the caſe, what it is that <hi>cauſeth</hi> any ſuppoſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to <hi>be</hi> higheſt in the mind's view? wherein doth its <hi>energy,</hi> or power conſiſt? In the next ſection, we ſhall examine, whether the will is indeed determined, in every act, by the higheſt motive.</p>
               <p>WHEN, between two or more objects in the mind's view, one appears moſt agreable; (from whatever cauſe,) this appearance is the higheſt or ſtrongeſt motive, according to our author. Now as there is a manifeſt difference between an object's <hi>actually appearing</hi> moſt agreable, and the <hi>cauſe</hi> of this appearance; the proper queſtion, in the firſt place, is, What is the ground, reaſon, or cauſe of the agreable appearance <hi>itſelf.</hi> For admitting the ſtrongeſt motive to be the more <hi>immediate</hi> cauſe of volition, how doth this prove that it is the <hi>original</hi> cauſe? <hi>Whence</hi> is it that any propoſed object hath the greateſt appearance of good? From what cauſe? Hither we muſt <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:011623_0013_0F8777829AA3FDF8"/>
recur for the ground of volition; [Poſſibly not ſtop here.] Till the anſwer to this queſtion is found, the original ground of volition is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. For if every circumſtance of things hath an anſwerable cauſe, that there is a cauſe why this or that motive is higheſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">'In the queſtion, <hi>What determines the will?</hi> it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted, that <hi>ſomething</hi> determines it. And the controverſy on this head is, where the <hi>foundation</hi> of the will's determination is,' (p. 56.) Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> ſaith expreſly, 'That the act of volition itſelf (or the will) is <hi>always</hi> determined by that in the mind's view of an object, which <hi>cauſes it to appear</hi> moſt agreable.' (p. 12) Here, then, is the FOUNDATION of the will's determination. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s buſineſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to his own ſtate of the queſtion, was, to point out what <hi>cauſeth an object to appear</hi> moſt agreable. For if that which CAUSETH <hi>this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> be the real cauſe of volition, then the agreable appearance ITSELF cannot be the cauſe. The agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearance, or higheſt motive, as he obſerves, is nothing <hi>diſtinct</hi> from volition, but the <hi>very thing,</hi> as will be particularly ſhewn in the next ſection. We would here juſt hint, by the way, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath given ample teſtimony againſt 'the poſition of chief importance in his diſcourſe.' For that the higheſt motive doth not <hi>always</hi> determine volition, is pretty apparent, if it is <hi>always</hi> determined by that in or about an object which <hi>cauſeth</hi> it to be, and appear, moſt agreable. The will, in no inſtance whatſoever, is determined by the agreable appearance, but by the cauſe of ſuch appearance.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THOUGH Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſuppoſed the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this queſtion was 'not neceſſary to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,' <note n="‡" place="bottom">p. 12.—16.</note> yet he hath, in ſeveral particulars, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked what he apprehended may 'have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence' in <hi>cauſing</hi> 'the objects of volition to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear agreable to the mind.' He aſſigns, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011623_0014_0F8777835D785790"/>
'the apparent nature and circumſtances of the object—the manner of the mind's view of it—the ſtate of the mind, by nature or educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—or the frame it is in on a particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.' But how is this any anſwer? Doth not the queſtion immediately ariſe, <hi>How</hi> comes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to have ſuch a particular <hi>appearance</hi> to the mind? <hi>Whence</hi> is it apparently <hi>circumſtanced</hi> as it is? <hi>Whence</hi> doth the mind view it in ſuch a particular <hi>manner?</hi> Or from ſuch a particular <hi>idea</hi> of it, whether 'faint, or clear, ſtrong and lively?' <hi>Whence</hi> is the <hi>ſtate, temper,</hi> or <hi>frame</hi> of the mind what it is? Until theſe things are ſolved, the queſtion, Whence is it that 'a perſon's pleaſure is wrong' or right? hath received no anſwer, unleſs 'a very impertinent one.'</p>
               <p>THERE is no great difficulty, ſaith Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> in ſhewing, not only that it <hi>muſt needs be ſo,</hi> but alſo <hi>how it is ſo,</hi> that the mind muſt be influenced in it's choice by ſomething that hath a <hi>preponderating</hi> influence upon it.' <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 83.</note> But if 'a preponderating influence on the mind' implies that the choice is <hi>already made,</hi> it may 'be a matter of no ſmall difficulty' to ſhew, how the mind, in <hi>making</hi> it's choice, can 'be influenced by ſomething that hath a preponderating influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon it.'</p>
               <p>While writing the firſt part of his book, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſeems to have been ſenſible, is was no very eaſy matter 'to ſhew <hi>how it is ſo,</hi>' or why, that the mind is always determined by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt motive. His words are, (p. 12.) 'Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to enumerate all things pertaining to the mind's view of the objects of volition, which
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011623_0015_0F87778441F25E08"/>
have influence in their appearing agreable to the mind, <hi>would be a matter of no ſmall difficulty,</hi> and might require a treatiſe by itſelf, and is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to my preſent purpoſe.' But (without tarrying to reconcile this <hi>ſeeming</hi> contraſt) is this a matter attended with greater difficulty, or of leſs importance, or would it require a larger trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, than to ſhew, what determines the will to this ſide, or that?</p>
               <p>WE allow, that 'the <hi>common people</hi> do not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up in their reflections and abſtractions to the <hi>metaphyſical ſources, relations</hi> and <hi>dependencies</hi> of things, in order to form their notion of faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—They do not wait till they have decided by their <hi>refinings,</hi> what firſt determines the will; whether it be determined by ſomething <hi>extrinſic</hi> or <hi>intrinſic.</hi> If this were the caſe, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, yea, the far greater part of mankind, nine hundred and ninety nine out of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand would live and die without having any ſuch notion as that of fault ever entering into their heads; or without ſo much as once having any conception, that any body was to be either blamed or commended for any thing. They do not take any part of their notion of fault or blame from the reſolution of any ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.'<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 298, 99.</note> A fuller acknowledgment Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> could not have made, that the grand queſtion, the main ſubject of his book, <hi>What determines the will?</hi> is a ſubtle and unprofitable one. We are therefore at a loſs for the motive of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an elaborate volume to determine a point not to be determined—at leaſt, by his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, of no uſe to <hi>one out of a thouſand of mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:011623_0016_0F877784E02F8C38"/>P. 39, 40. Our author obſerves, that 'into the meaning of the word <hi>liberty</hi> is not taken any thing of the <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>original</hi> of choice—<hi>how</hi> the perſon came to have ſuch a volition; whether it was cauſed by ſome external motive, or internal, habitual bias; whether it was neceſſarily connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſomething foregoing, or not connected. Let the perſon come by his volition or choice how he will, yet, if he is able, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the way to hinder his purſuing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting his will, the man is fully and perfectly free, according to the primary and common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of freedom'.</p>
               <p>IT hence appears, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it neither neceſſary nor uſeful for us to know the <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>origin</hi> of the will's determination— '<hi>how</hi> a perſon comes to have ſuch a volition.' And yet it was a main point in his view to ſhew, that the ſtrongeſt motive is the <hi>immediate</hi> cauſe of every act of choice. Now, as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it is juſt as neceſſary and important to know the <hi>original</hi> and <hi>ultimate,</hi> as the next and more immediate cauſe of volition. The next and immediate cauſe is but the effect of ſome <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> cauſe; this of another, and ſo on. 'The determination of the will, ſaith Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> ſuppoſeth an <hi>effect,</hi> which muſt have a <hi>cauſe.</hi> If the will be <hi>determined,</hi> there muſt be a <hi>determiner.</hi>' <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 7.</note>Granted. And if the ſtrongeſt motive be the determiner, this alſo muſt be determined by ſome preceeding cauſe. There is a cauſe or reaſon of its being ſtrongeſt—ſomething from which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives, and wherein lies, its great ſtrength. If therefore, it was of any importance to ſhew, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011623_0017_0F8777859CFBB168"/>
to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s deſign) what deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the will, and to prove that the ſtrongeſt motive doth it; it was at leaſt of equal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to point out, what it is that cauſeth ſuch motive to be, or appear, ſtrongeſt. The real cauſe of volition is not found, till this matter is explained. The enquiry is not purſued to the end, and the plan of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book but half executed.</p>
               <p>'SUPPOSE a <hi>chain</hi> hung down out of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, from an <hi>unknown</hi> height; and although every link of it gravitated toward the earth, and what it hung upon was not viſible, yet it did not deſcend, but kept its ſituation: And, upon this, a queſtion ſhould ariſe, What ſupported or kept up this chain? Would it be a ſufficient anſwer, to ſay, that the <hi>firſt,</hi> or loweſt link hung upon the ſecond, or that next above it?' without proceeding to ſhew what the ſecond hung upon'; 'or rather, the <hi>firſt and ſecond together;</hi>' and ſo on, until it was found 'what ſupported the <hi>whole.</hi> Thus it is in a chain of cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. The laſt or loweſt is <hi>ſuſpended</hi> upon the cauſe above it. This again, if it be not the firſt cauſe, is ſuſpended, as an effect, upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Wollaſton,</hi> p. 67.</note> The original (that is, the <hi>true and real</hi>) cauſe of volition is, therefore, yet to be explained. For if it be the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate effect of motive, ſtill this cauſe is an effect in regard to ſomething preceeding—and whatever is the next or immediate cauſe of the ſtrength or energy of motive itſelf, this again is an effect in relation to a cauſe preceeding, as well as a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011623_0018_0F87778756BCB590"/>
cauſe in relation to motive—And thus the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry may be <hi>purſued in infinitum.</hi> (Which ſhews, by the way, the <hi>futility,</hi> at leaſt, of entering on ſuch an enquiry as that which is the ſubject of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book.) Should it be ſaid, that the energy of motive, in every caſe, is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the firſt and ſupreme cauſe, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate efficient—this, indeed, is making ſhort work; but it is cutting the knot, rather than untying it. However, when it ſhall be ſhewn, that every act of will, in every creature, is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, neceſſary effect of the ſupreme cauſe, the diſpute will at once be at an end.</p>
               <p>'THE vulgar notion of blameworthineſs, ſays Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> is, a perſon's having his heart wrong, and doing wrong from the heart.'<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 298.</note> Now hath he ſhewn, <hi>whence</hi> a perſon's heart comes to be wrong? He takes notice of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in 'the author of the eſſay on the freedom of the will in GOD and the creatures,' that he had not given <hi>a reaſon why an act of the will is, or why it is in this manner, rather than another.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 72, 77.</note> Now how hath Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſupplyed this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? Is what he hath ſaid 'a reaſon why an act of the will is, or why it is in this manner?' Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the higheſt motive determines the will, he explains motive to be the apparent good in an object—Now what is it that makes, or cauſes an object to appear good? For this, by his own principles, is what determines the will. He 'ſpeaks of a certain <hi>ſovereignty</hi> in motive, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it has power to determine volition. Wherein conſiſts 'this ſuppoſed ſovereignty?' From what
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011623_0019_0F877787DA058B78"/>
cauſe doth it proceed? From what 'exerciſe' of it can either its ſovereignty, or its cauſe, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred?<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 51. ‡</note> 'And ſo the queſtion returns <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum,</hi> and the like anſwer muſt be made <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum.</hi>' For granting that an object's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreable to the mind is the ground of the mind's choice, what account is this of the agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearance itſelf? Is it a reaſon why an object appears beautiful or deformed, agreable or diſagreable? Doth it ſhew us, <hi>why</hi> 'it is moſt agreable to ſome men, to follow their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? and to others, to follow their appetites?' Not at all. Nor conſequently, doth it ſhew us 'wherein conſiſts the ſtrength of motive'— whence the motive that determines the will <hi>is</hi> prepollent—of what antecedent cauſe its deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining power is the effect. Every circumſtance of things, it is pleaded, muſt have a cauſe. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition then is the effect of motive—the latter the effect of ſome prior cauſe—this of another—and this again of another, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> Where then are we to ſeek for the true and original cauſe of volition?</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> curſorily paſſeth the queſtion, Wherein conſiſts the <hi>energy</hi> of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? as beſide 'the purpoſe of his diſcourſe;' yet we muſt think, that his main 'poſition,' and 'the thing of chief importance' upon his ſcheme, abſolutely required a clear 'explanation' and full diſcuſſion of this queſtion. It is the hinge, on which the controverſy, as ſtated by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> muſt finally turn. He appears to have been ſcrupulous, whether he had not 'failed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011623_0020_0F8777945A702870"/>
this thing,' from his hint that if he had, it did 'not overthrow the poſition itſelf, which was the thing of chief importance' in his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 'viz. That <hi>the will is always determined by the ſtrongeſt motive,'</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 17, 18.</note> This poſition may not be <hi>overthrown</hi> by a failure in 'explaining where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſtrength of motives conſiſts;' but we might have expected, and ſhould have been glad to have ſeen, a <hi>rationale</hi> of the poſition. If true, there is a cauſe, ground, or reaſon of its truth. That cauſe hath not been aſſigned, or diſcovered to our apprehenſion. It is ſoon enough to ſay, whether the poſition is true or falſe, when the foundation of it is underſtood. But whether it hath a ſolid ſupport, or is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> himſelf, may appear in the following ſection: We conclude the preſent with this remark.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH we have no right to require an anſwer to ſo ſubtil a queſtion as this [What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the will?] from any but ſuch as <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their own accord</hi> to explain the matter; yet, from Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s known abilities, we might have expected a more ſatisfactory and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional anſwer—eſpecially as he ſeems to have apprehended, that the general queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberty was thoroughly examined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in his diſcourſe upon it. But ſince, after what Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath ſaid, it ſtill remains ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe and undetermined, we conclude it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo. For no author we have ſeen hath wrote upon the ſubject with greater ſtrength. And we cannot but obſerve; that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>

               <head>SECT. II. The will not neceſſarily determined by the ſtrongeſt Motive.</head>
               <p>IT is not always the <hi>nature</hi> of the object <hi>in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> or 'what <hi>reaſon</hi> dictates to be beſt, and moſt for the perſon's <hi>happineſs,</hi> taking in the whole of his duration,' that is the ſtrongeſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; ſince the dictate of reaſon 'is often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the greater weight of' other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 17.</note> And indeed were the dictate of reaſon always the ſtrongeſt motive, and were the will invariably determined by motive taken in this ſenſe, it is plain, that ſin would never have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the world. Now the preferableneſs of the object in its own nature, and as appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by reaſon, not being always the ground or cauſe of its appearing moſt agreable, but ſomething diverſe or contrary, in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the queſtion is, How came beings made upright to miſtake their happineſs upon the whole? For miſtake it they muſt; (by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) or otherwiſe in the <hi>firſt</hi> act of ſin they could not be determined by the greateſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent good.</p>
               <p>HERE we may enquire, Whether <hi>in innocence</hi> any thing but conformity and ſubjection to the Creator could appear to be the greateſt good? If not, then, on Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s hypotheſis, an innocent creature could never rebel. If, on the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011623_0023_0F877797A42714C8"/>
other hand, rebellion againſt the ſupreme cauſe had the appearance of the greateſt good to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocence, and to apoſtate angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their fall, how doth this conſiſt with the general opinion that hath been entertained of the original extent of their rational faculties, and the ſpiritual image of GOD with which they were endowed? The powers of intellect in innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> for example, have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo great, that conſiſtently herewith it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted but he had the fulleſt view of duty, and of his higheſt intereſt as connected with it; and conſequently could have no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſuperior motive to tranſgreſs. If in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence he could not heſitate but it was his higheſt duty to refrain from the forbidden fruit, he could not, (by ſuppoſition) heſitate but ſuch act of forbearance was alſo his higheſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Therefore the greateſt <hi>apparent</hi> good was to retain his integrity. Conſequently, in tranſgreſſing, his will was not determined <hi>by,</hi> but <hi>againſt,</hi> the higheſt motive. Nor can we conceive of a <hi>preſumptuous</hi> ſinner, on any other ſuppoſition—meaning hereby, one who acts againſt <hi>preſent conviction</hi>—or <hi>directly in oppoſition to the light he hath in the very article of ſinning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT will, perhaps, be ſaid, that innocent <hi>Adam</hi>'s higheſt good was to <hi>forfeit his integrity.</hi> And indeed, on any other hypotheſis, the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſeems to be brought to an iſſue, and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of being always neceſſarily determined by the higheſt motive given up. Now ſhould this be ſaid, (which is at leaſt imply'd, if not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in what Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath remarked <note n="*" place="bottom">Part iv. Sect. 9.</note> on
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011623_0024_0F87779863E74CA8"/>
the advantage of ſin to the creation) we might aſk, whether ſin could appear moſt agreable to an innocent creature from the <hi>nature of the object in itſelf?</hi> This, we preſume Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> would not ſay. And if it could not thus appear from its nature, it will be difficult to ſhew how ſin could be, in any ſenſe, the creature's higheſt good—Or how an <hi>innocent</hi> creature could <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi> it to be ſo. But whenever it can be ſhewn, that innocent man, or rebel angels before their fall, had a full view of the ſuperior advantages of ſin above innocence and righteouſneſs, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no body will think it worth while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert farther about any doctrine of religion. An hypotheſis ſo extraordinary, requires extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary proof. We ſhall have occaſion to reſume this point under another part of our remarks.</p>
               <p>IN regard to the firſt entrance of ſin into the world, we acknowledge it is an event, which <hi>all</hi> denominations of profeſſing <hi>chriſtians</hi> are <hi>equally</hi> holden to account for—yea, <hi>deiſts</hi> as much as chriſtians. Even <hi>atheiſts</hi> are no otherwiſe excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed than as, by their principles, they are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to account for any thing The truth is, no body can ſolve this matter. But if the <hi>firſt ſinful volition</hi> was the neceſſary product of the higheſt motive; then rebellion againſt GOD was diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be the higheſt good, <hi>when reaſon and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment freely dictated and governed;</hi> which they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did <hi>while the creature continued innocent.</hi> Yea, it follows, that the higheſt motive to the <hi>Creator,</hi> as well as creature, was in behalf of moral evil. How then is ſin ſuch an <hi>infinite evil</hi> as we have been taught to believe it? Does it not turn out an infinite <hi>good?</hi> Rather, how can that deſerve the name of <hi>ſin,</hi> which appears
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011623_0025_0F8777992F0892B8"/>
                  <hi>moſt agreable</hi> even to the Deity himſelf? Or allowing ſin to be the greateſt evil, that man muſt have an hard taſk, who undertakes to ſhew, that it is alſo the greateſt good: And if not the greateſt good, how it could have this appearance to creatures in a ſtate of rectitude—and even to Almighty GOD himſelf. Or if it could not have this appearance to any being in a ſtate of rectitude, how was it then poſſible for beings made upright to fall; on ſuppoſition that no inſtance of volition can be mentioned but what is the effect of, or determined by, the greateſt apparent good? The very idea of <hi>moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> appears to be loſt, if we purſue to the end ſuch an enquiry as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath led us into.</p>
               <p>"THAT the will always follows the laſt prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical judgment of the underſtanding, hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed current as a maxim in the ſchools: So that if a ſick man ſhall, in contradiction to his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician's judgment, and his own, indulge his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for meat or drink, he muſt be ſuppoſed previouſly to have convinced himſelf, that his preſent indulgence is of more value to him than his health, or even his life. If other men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their unreaſonable inclinations at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of intereſt, reputation, inward peace, and everlaſting ſalvation, they muſt be ſuppoſed to judge with themſelves, that this vicious indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ought to be preferred to intereſt, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, peace of conſcience, and everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: This way of thinking, which paſſeth ſo eaſily with the learned, goes mighty ill down with men of plain underſtanding; who, on the contrary, incline to believe, that in the practice of vice men either do not think at all, but act

like mere animals by the blind impulſe of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and affection; or if they attend to what they are doing, that they baſely and abſurdly prefer a preſent gratification to what they <hi>know</hi> to be their moſt valuable intereſts in this life and the next.</p>
               <p>THE truth is, that man is a compound of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and animal affections, that without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to himſelf, ſometimes the one, and at other times the other, muſt of neceſſity prevail, as they happen to be ſtrongeſt; and that, through the love of preſent pleaſure, and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to preſent pain, or through mere puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, we too often decline the combat; and, in contradiction to our reaſon, our conſcience, and all the moſt weighty conſiderations of honour and intereſt, reſpecting this life and the next, ſuffer the animal to prevail over the rational affections.</p>
               <p>FOR the remedy, then, of this greateſt of all evils, it is not enough the judgment be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,; becauſe however deſirous we are of having the authority of our judgment for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we do, and however much we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reconcile our judgment with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; yet when that cannot be done, we will too often purſue our inclination in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to our judgment. The only remedy therefore under heaven is, to endeavour, by all means in our power, to make our rational a match, and, as much as poſſible, an overmatch, for our animal affections: In which employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have a title to all the aſſiſtance, which the teachers of mankind can afford us; and to

               <p>AS no authority can be of equal weight to overthrow this main poſition as the author's own, we beg the reader would conſider the following paſſage; which is ſo <hi>full</hi> to our purpoſe, that we are ſaved the trouble of a laboured confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the principle alluded to. 'I have rather choſe to expreſs myſelf thus, that the will always is AS the greateſt apparent good, or AS what appears moſt agreable, is, than to ſay, that the will IS DETERMINED BY the greateſt apparent good, or <hi>by</hi> what ſeems moſt agreable: Becauſe an <hi>appearing moſt agreable;</hi> or <hi>pleaſing</hi> to the mind, and the mind's <hi>preferring and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> ſeem hardly to be properly and perfectly DISTINCT.

               </p>
               <p>HERE it is fully declared, that, 'properly ſpeaking,' volition and the higheſt motive are not DISTINCT things—that the former is only <hi>as</hi> the latter, and not <hi>determined by</hi> it. Motive cannot be the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>determiner</hi> of volition, and at the ſame time the <hi>act</hi> of volition <hi>itſelf.</hi> It is not the <hi>cauſe</hi> of volition, but the <hi>thing,</hi> 'if ſtrict propriety of ſpeech be inſiſted on.' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the ſtrongeſt <hi>motive</hi>'s being the cauſe of volition, the real truth is, that <hi>volition</hi> is the cauſe of <hi>external action.</hi> It is this only, 'which is the immediate <hi>fruit and conſequence</hi> of the mind's volition, that is <hi>determined by'</hi> the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt motive.

himſelf, 'the voluntary action, which is the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>conſequence</hi> of the mind's volition or choice'—expreſsly diſtinguiſhing it (as in the next following words) from 'the act of voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the preference and choice itſelf.' Inſtead of ſhewing, therefore, (as he undertook) what determines the <hi>will,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath only la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to prove, that the will determines the actions of the <hi>body</hi>—For inſtance, 'the will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines, by an act of volition or choice, which way the hands and feet ſhall move.'<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 47.</note> Bodily action is the <hi>effect, fruit, conſequence</hi> of the will's determination, dependent on it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with it, as its cauſe and determiner.

               <p>THUS volition being nothing diverſe from the ſtrongeſt motive, but the ſame thing with it—it being improper to ſay, that the will is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the ſtrongeſt motive; there can be 'no ſuch relation between' motive and volition 'as is ſignified by the terms <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>effect.</hi>' We are 'brought to the contradiction of a cauſe and no cauſe; that which is the ground and reaſon of the exiſtence of a thing, and at the ſame time is not the ground and reaſon of its exiſtence'—(p. 103, 105) the ſtrongeſt motive 'is determiner and determined; mover and mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a cauſe that acts and produceth effects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on itſelf'—(p. 7) 'volition is from a cauſe, and no cauſe; the fruit of motive, and not the fruit

Cauſe and effect,' though, 'terms of oppoſite ſignification,' are the ſame thing— 'Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition is the effect of volition, and the cauſe of volition—choice is ſubject to choice, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, and the produce of, an antecedent act of choice.' Motive 'is the <hi>previous ground</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of the acts of the will—Yea, the neceſſary ground and reaſon of their exertion; without which they will not be exerted, and cannot, in the nature of things, take place: And they do excite theſe acts of the will, and do this by a prevailing influence; yea, an influence which prevails to the production of the act of the will, and for the diſpoſing of the mind to it. Now if motives diſpoſe the mind to action, then they cauſe the mind to be diſpoſed; and to cauſe the mind to be diſpoſed, is to cauſe it to be willing; and to cauſe it to be willing, is to cauſe it to will; and that is the ſame thing as to be the cauſe of an act of the will. And yet it is hardly proper to ſuppoſe motive to be a cauſe of an act of the will; or that a principle of will is moved, or cauſed to be exerted by it; or that it has any cauſality in the production of it:' And that for this very good reaſon, that they are not DISTINCT. <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 130,—136.</note>

Yet Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſays, 'There is ſuch a thing as a <hi>diverſity</hi> of ſtrength in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to choice <hi>previous</hi> to the choice, itſelf.' (p. 125) He has not ſhewn us wherein this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity lies; or how motives have a ſtrength <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi> to choice, and yet are not <hi>diſtinct</hi> from it. Would he ſay, that motives have a ſuperior ſtrength <hi>previous to their ſtanding in the mind's view?</hi> or is their appearing ſtrongeſt to the mind <hi>antecedent</hi> to the choice; or <hi>co-temporary</hi> with it. The latter doubtleſs: For this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is not diſtinct from the mind's choice. Had Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> proved, (as he aſſerts) that there is a '<hi>preponderancy</hi> of the inclination <hi>previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to the act of choice,' (p. 260) it might have cleared the matter. But 'certainly, there is no need of multiplying words. We preſume there is nothing more unintelligible, and void of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, conſiſtent meaning, in all the writings of

(p. 82) Motive goes <hi>before,</hi> and is the <hi>producer</hi> of volition, which <hi>follows</hi> it, but is not <hi>distinct</hi> from it. By his argument, 'the <hi>firſt</hi> ſinful volition was determined by a <hi>foregoing</hi> ſinful volition; the firſt ſinful act of choice was before the firſt ſinful act of choice 'and choſen and determined by it.' (p. 377, 8.) For the higheſt motive is the ſame as volition, and the firſt ſinful volition ſprang from the higheſt motive: Mr, <hi>Edwards</hi> alſo ſpeaks of chuſing as a man <hi>pleaſeth</hi>—i. e. as he <hi>chuſeth.</hi>

               <p>THAT we have not taken advantage of a paſſage in advertently wrote by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> the reader may ſee by turning to it. (p. 11, 12) He is there <hi>exhibiting his plan,</hi> and intimates his care to expreſs himſelf with <hi>preciſion,</hi> and ſo as not to be miſapprehended. It is at his <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi> on his work. Says he, '<hi>I have rather choſen to expreſs myſelf thus,</hi> that the will always is <hi>as</hi> the greateſt apparent good, than to ſay, the will <hi>is determined</hi> by the greateſt apparent good'; and proceeds to aſſign a <hi>reaſon</hi> for his thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing himſelf: 'Becauſe an appearing moſt agreable to the mind, and the mind's chuſing, ſeem hardly to be properly and perfectly <hi>diſtinct. If ſtrict propriety of ſpeech</hi> be inſiſted on, it may more properly be ſaid, that the <hi>voluntary action,</hi> which is the <hi>fruit and conſequence</hi> of the mind's choice, <hi>is determined</hi> by that which appears moſt agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than the preference or choice <hi>itſelf.</hi>' Who will ſay Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath not here 'expreſſed himſelf with ſtrict propriety,' and given a good reaſon for 'expreſſing himſelf thus?'</p>
               <p>'FROM things that have been' remarked, we
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011623_0035_0F8777A7459AB528"/>
think it clearly follows, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath equally failed in pointing out the more <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> cauſe of volition, as its <hi>original</hi> cauſe. By his own declaration, the will is not determined <hi>by,</hi> but the <hi>ſame</hi> thing with, the ſtrongeſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. He hath only ſhewn what determines <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal action or conduct</hi>—a point very different from the determination of the <hi>will.</hi> And hence (according to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own reaſoning) the enquiry, 'What determines the will?' is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame with this, 'What <hi>cauſeth</hi> an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to appear moſt agreable?' A very different enquiry, ſurely, from this, Whether volition is <hi>as,</hi> or according to, the agreable appearance of an object? unleſs we will confound cauſe and effect. The agreable appearance, ſaith Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> is the mind's preference, choice, or determination. But <hi>antecedent</hi> to the mind's view of the object, there muſt be ſomething in it [the object] to cauſe it to appear agreable when viewed—ſomething independent on, and prior to the view—or the mind muſt be in ſuch a particular ſtate, frame, or temper—or view the object under ſuch and ſuch circumſtances, in order to it's appearing thus and thus agreable. Now when it can be diſtinctly ſhewn, what <hi>that</hi> is in any object itſelf, or in the ſtate, manner, and circumſtances of the mind viewing it, which cauſeth <hi>(produceth)</hi> the agreable appearance; then, perhaps, the <hi>determining</hi> cauſe of volition may be diſcovered. That which cauſeth the agreable appearance, produceth the higheſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that is, volition. Upon Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own ſtate of the queſtion, there is no making any ſenſe of his words, to ſay, that the higheſt motive is the cauſe, or determiner of volition.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011623_0036_0F8777A8C6A2E9E0"/>
This he hath, in <hi>expreſs</hi> terms denied. And yet great part of his book was wrote to prove it. It is the 'poſition of chief importance in his diſcourſe.'</p>
               <p>IT will poſſibly be ſaid, 'There is no need of ſuppoſing the ſtrongeſt motive to be <hi>prior</hi> to, or <hi>diſtinct</hi> from, volition; but that the latter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the former in the very act of voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'. To this it is ſufficient to anſwer in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own words, 'that the will <hi>is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by</hi> the greateſt apparent good, but the action, which is the <hi>fruit</hi> of volition, is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined hereby'. Though we may inſiſt on this as a full reply to the objection; yet we may alſo add, with much propriety, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s remarks <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 53,—56,</note> on the ſcheme of his opponents, with the ſmall alteration, which the reader will obſerve by the words not included under inverted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</p>
               <p>FIRST, 'IF the determining act' (the higheſt motive) 'be before the determined in order of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> being the cauſe, ground, or reaſon of its exiſtence, this as much proves it to be <hi>diſtinct</hi> from it, and <hi>independent</hi> on it, as if it were in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>time'.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY, 'If the determining act' (the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt motive)' is not before the determined, in order of time or nature, nor diſtinct from it—I would on this obſerve, that the thing in queſtion ſeems to be forgotten, or kept out of ſight, <hi>in a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unintelligibleneſs of ſpeech.</hi> The queſtion
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011623_0037_0F8777A8ECF8CD58"/>
is, What influenceth, directs, or determines the mind or will to come to ſuch a choice as it does? or what is the cauſe, ground, or reaſon, why it concludes thus, and not otherwiſe? Now it muſt be anſwered, according to, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s 'no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the will influences, orders, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines itſelf'. For the will is determined by the ſtrongeſt motive, and this is nothing <hi>diſtinct</hi> from volition. Now that the ſtrongeſt motive 'cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, influenceth, and determineth the will, and yet is not antecedent to it;' nor diſtinct from it, 'is a contradiction.' To ſay that one 'thing is the cauſe or reaſon of another, is to ſay, that the former is prior to the latter. The cauſe is diſtinct from the effect, and prior to it. To ſay, that the ſtrongeſt motive, 'orders, influences, determines the act of volition,' and yet is not 'properly diſtinct, is to make the exertion both cauſe and effect. The queſtion is, What is the cauſe and reaſon of the ſoul's exerting ſuch an act? To which the anſwer is, the ſoul exerts ſuch an act, and that is the cauſe of it. And ſo, by this, the exertion muſt be prior to, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from itſelf.'</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, 'If the meaning be, that volition has no cauſe, and is no effect, but comes into exiſtence <hi>of itſelf,</hi> without any ground or reaſon'; Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> then, 'doth nothing but confound himſelf and others with words without a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had a common right with others to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his thoughts in his own way. But we ſhould have been glad, if he had fixed a preciſe meaning to his own terms. And though he hath ſpent a large number of pages (from p. 1,—43) in explaining terms, yet his definitions are ſo lengthy and lax, his uſe of ſome words ſo different from what is common, yea, ſo differently does he himſelf uſe the ſame terms, that the reader is almoſt unavoidably confounded in a jumble of indeterminate words and phraſes. We ſhall give a few inſtances. The term <hi>will</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed for an <hi>abſtract</hi> power, property, or faculty; (p. 38, 39.) Sometimes it is confounded with <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> (p. 11, 12.) while at other times, and indeed more generally, it is uſed to denote the <hi>agent</hi>—As where the will is ſaid to be <hi>the ſubject of commands,</hi> &amp;c —where the <hi>acts</hi> of the will are ſpoken of— where motives are repreſented as <hi>influencing</hi> and <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining</hi> it, i. e. the agent. (For motives do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence meer properties.)</p>
                     <p>By <hi>motive</hi> (the higheſt) he explains himſelf to mean the ſame as <hi>volition;</hi> (p. 11. 12.) while he alſo underſtands by it ſomething <hi>extrinſic</hi> ſtanding in the mind's view, and having a <hi>tendency,</hi> by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance it makes, to excite and engage the mind to ſuch and ſuch volitions—i. e. to incline and diſpoſe it to ſuch and ſuch a choice. Again, he means by motives, <hi>inclination</hi> or <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> and expreſly blends 'moral motives and inducements' with <hi>'habits and diſpoſitions</hi> of the heart,' making them the ſame. (p. 29, 31.) That is, motives are ſomething <hi>without</hi> themſelves, and have a <hi>tendency</hi> to excite and engage to themſelves, and are not <hi>diſtinct</hi> from themſelves. (p. 8, 9, 11.)</p>
                     <p>In like manner, while he is taking pains to make out a diſtinction between <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral neceſſity,</hi> he confounds them—(at leaſt in our apprehenſion, Part I. Sect. 4.)</p>
                     <p>THE term <hi>cauſe,</hi> as it hath been generally uſed, denotes <hi>efficiency,</hi> and has relation to an effect produced—And Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> himſelf ſays (after <hi>Spinoza and Hobbs</hi>) 'that if it be not ſufficient to produce the effect, or doth not always <hi>neceſſarily</hi> produce it, there is no ſuch relation ſubſiſting as we ſignify by the terms cauſe and effect. That which ſeems to be the cauſe, can be no cauſe.' Yet he tells us, 'that he ſometimes uſes the word cauſe to ſignify any <hi>antecedent,</hi> which is perhaps rather an <hi>occaſion</hi> than a cauſe of an event or thing; and the word <hi>effect,</hi> for the <hi>conſequence</hi> of another thing'. (p. 58, 59, 103.) But who ever ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the meer <hi>occaſion</hi> of a thing or event to be the cauſe thereof, in ſuch a ſenſe as that the thing or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent is <hi>neceſſarily</hi> dependent on, connected with, and proceeds from the occaſion of it? Our Lord's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming was the antecedent and occaſion of diſcord and war. Did theſe neceſſarily proceed from his coming? Was there no more in the conſequent than in the antecedent? Had Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> uſed the terms occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and conſequence, inſtead of cauſe and effect, in thoſe parts of his book, where (by his own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement) the former would have been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he might have been better underſtood, and would have taken a likelier method to 'cut off occaſion from cavillers and objectors.' (p. 59, 393, 394, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.)</p>
                     <p>THE reader will alſo take notice of the <hi>promiſcuous</hi> uſe of the words <hi>cauſe, ground, reaſon.</hi> So far as an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is conformable to right reaſon, ſo much <hi>reaſon</hi> there is for it, and no more. Every inſtance of the divine conduct hath a <hi>ſufficient</hi> reaſon: It is not ſo with the conduct of the creature. As much <hi>ſin</hi> as there is in the world, ſo much action there is <hi>without reaſon.</hi>

ſovereignty and energy', as the ſource of all acts of the will; but when the matter comes to be explained, the meaning is, that theſe acts ariſe from nothing, no cauſe, no power, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, being at all concerned in the matter.'
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011623_0039_0F8777ABDF447C70"/>
And yet it is maintained, that 'all acts of voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have a prior ground and reaſon of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exiſtence; a cauſe; which antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently determines them to be, and to be juſt as they are. Now how can theſe things hang together?'</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Edwards</hi> criticiſeth Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting 'the neceſſary connection of volition with the laſt dictate of the underſtanding;' and yet 'ſuppoſing the latter not to be <hi>diverſe</hi> from the act of the will itſelf.' He hath this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark on the Doctor. 'If the dictate of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding be the very <hi>ſame</hi> with the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the will or choice, then this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is no <hi>fruit or effect</hi> of choice.' And on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: If theſe 'be the <hi>ſame,</hi> then liberty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the mind's having power to have what dictates of the underſtanding it pleaſes, having opportunity to chuſe its own dictates of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.'
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011623_0040_0F8777AC9F2B56F0"/>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 114, 115.</note> Might not one in Dr. <hi>Clark</hi>'s behalf thus reply? 'Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſuppoſeth that volition hath a neceſſary connection with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt motive—and that the later is not properly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from the act of the will. If the higheſt motive be the very <hi>ſame</hi> with the determination of the will or choice, then this determination is no <hi>fruit</hi> or <hi>effect</hi> of motive. Moreover, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath <q>expreſſed himſelf thus, it is not proper to ſay, that the act of volition itſelf is determined by the higheſt motive.</q> If theſe be the ſame, then liberty conſiſts in a man's having power to have what <hi>motives</hi> he pleaſes, having opportunity to

chuſe his own motives. But this is abſurd: For it ſuppoſeth the choice is already made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the motive has its effect; and that the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition is <hi>already exerted:</hi> That is, choice is prior to choice. Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> recurs to the old ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of one determination before another, and the cauſe of it; and another before that, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that; and ſo on <hi>in infinitum.</hi>' Thus might his criticiſm on Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> be replied to.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole: The queſtion, What deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the will? is 'unanſwered, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns.' For aught that appears from Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>'s diſcourſe, the will is not properly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at all. 'Inſtead of ſolving the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or anſwering the queſtion with regard to volition, namely, How it comes to exiſt?

The queſtion, What determineth the motions and actions of the body? is quite <hi>foreign</hi> to the ſubject. But as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> affirms, that the will is the true cauſe of external action or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and makes the whole of liberty to lie here, we will examine this poſition, on his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>'THE voluntary action, which is the fruit and conſequence of volition, is determined by that which appears moſt agreable;' or by the will which 'always is as the greateſt apparent good,' and 'not properly diſtinct' from it. 'Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is a power, opportunity any one has of doing, or conducting according to his will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from external hindrance or compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—Or a power of <hi>executing</hi> his will.

How is corporeal action determined by the will, when 'the will in no inſtance is its own determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er', conſequently not in the particular determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to move the body? At leaſt, the will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines this no otherwiſe than as it is itſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined hereto by an antecedent, neceſſary cauſe. Or how can that be called a voluntary determination, which is the effect of neceſſity? or that a voluntary action to which a man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily determined? If the act of the will, which is ſuppoſed to determine and fix the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acts of the body, be not itſelf free, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own reaſoning, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proceeding herefrom cannot be ſo. <note n="*" place="bottom">HAD Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> attended to his <hi>own</hi> reaſoning, he would not have affirmed, that external actions might be free, when the will, which determines them, is ſubject to neceſſity. For, ſays he, 'if the <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining</hi> act be neceſſary, the man cannot be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of command or government in his <hi>external actions;</hi> becauſe theſe are all neceſſary, being the neceſſary effects of the acts of the will themſelves'. (P. 224, 225, 256, alſo p. 46, 47, 48.)</note> 'An act of the will is an act of choice'. Now if there
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011623_0046_0F8777B1DBA40108"/>
be no liberty exerciſed in chuſing; preferring, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is liberty exerciſed at all? What is choice diſtinct from liberty? Yet we are told, that liberty is exerciſed only in the <hi>execution</hi> of choice. That we have not a power of election or liberty in the act of volition, at leaſt not in the firſt and leading act of choice, which determines all the reſt.</p>
               <p>IF, therefore, freedom be not <hi>in the will,</hi> we ſhould be glad to know <hi>where</hi> it is? Whether any being can be ſaid to <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>conduct</hi> according to <hi>his pleaſure</hi> or <hi>choice.</hi> Choice and pleaſure (ſo called) is fixed by a previous neceſſary cauſe—and doing or conducting fixed by volition—Now the immediate fruit and conſequences of volition muſt be of the ſame nature with their cauſe—alike neceſſary. In other words, the will is no cauſe at all. For a neceſſary cauſe is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking a cauſe; it is nothing diſtinct from a meer inſtrument. A cauſe, ſtrictly ſo called, muſt be <hi>free;</hi> at leaſt ſo far as praiſe or blame, reward or puniſhment, belong to it.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole, external actions muſt ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately be determined, not by the will, but by that cauſe which determineth the will, agreable to our author's own principles. The will being in no inſtance it's own determiner, there is in no inſtance a power or capacity of choice in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. For choice is the ſame as the will's deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: A power or capacity of choice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would be a power of ſelf-determination, which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s whole ſcheme is deſigned to ſhew the abſurdity of.</p>
               <p>THE ſum of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſcheme appears to be this. Liberty conſiſts in a man's power to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011623_0047_0F8777B629A12678"/>
                  <hi>execute</hi> his will—to <hi>do</hi> or <hi>conduct</hi> according to what is willed. His will <hi>is</hi> (not <hi>determined by,</hi> but is) the greateſt apparent good. And yet every volition is the neceſſary <hi>effect</hi> of the greateſt apparent good, <hi>produced and determined</hi> by it as the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe—which cauſe, however, is nothing diſtinct from the effect produced. From what particular cauſe any object comes to have the greateſt appearance of good is yet a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, of no uſe to be known to nine hundred and ninety nine out a thouſand of mankind For the ſatisfaction of the thouſandth perſon, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has laboured to explore this ſecret; and yet his 'having failed here doth not overthrow the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which was the thing of chief importance in his diſcourſe;' for it only remains to be— explained and proved. Antecedent neceſſity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the will; this determines corporeal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and action is voluntary; i. e. is willed, or cauſed to be willed—there is no <hi>outward compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> or reſtraint in the caſe, but <hi>only</hi> a <hi>neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward determination.</hi> Liberty is indeed neceſſary to praiſe or blame. But the acts of the <hi>body</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from outward coaction or impediment, there is no need of liberty in the <hi>mind,</hi> as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of moral government.</p>
               <p>THESE, as near as we can come at them, are Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſentiments: The mention of which ſufficiently expoſeth the abſurdity of the ſcheme— it's repugnancy to itſelf; to common ſenſe, to all morality and religion; and conſequently the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and folly of applying metaphyſical reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a ſubject, which can be obſcured only by the ſubtilty of argument.</p>

               <hi>PART II.</hi> An examination of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the indiſſoluble connection of moral cauſes and effects.</head>
            <p>WERE we remarking on the writings of an avowed FATALIST, a ſomewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent method might be expected from what we ſhall purſue. But our controversy being with an <hi>eminent</hi> CHRISTIAN DIVINE ſeveral things may be taken for granted, which, in arguing, with a fataliſt, would need proof. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we deſire theſe few obvious principles of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> religion not leſs than <hi>chriſtianity,</hi> may be conſidered as <hi>data</hi> in the preſent argument.</p>
            <p>FIRST, That there is an <hi>intelligent, deſigning</hi> author of nature; or original cauſe of all beings and things; who (by the terms) is <hi>uncauſed</hi>—ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting prior to, and excluſive of, all deſign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to his exiſtence. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has intimated, indeed, that there is <hi>in the nature of things</hi> a foundation for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the being of a GOD, without any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it <hi>from his works</hi>'—but adds, 'We have not ſtrength of mind to comprehend 'his exiſtence' in this '<hi>independent</hi> manner'. The way that mankind come to the knowledge of his being is that which the apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. We firſt <hi>aſcend</hi> and prove a <hi>poſteriori,</hi> or from <hi>effects,</hi> that there muſt be an eternal cauſe. And then, ſecondly, prove by argumentation, not intuition, that this being muſt be neceſſarily exiſtent. And then, thirdly, from the proved neceſſity of his exiſtence, we may <hi>deſcend,</hi> and prove many of his perfections <hi>à priori'</hi> (P. 60, 61.)</p>
                  <p>But is it arguing <hi>à priori</hi> to argue from <hi>effects?</hi> 'If ſtrict propriety of ſpeech be inſiſted on,' doth not this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind of argument ſuppoſe, that the being of a GOD may be proved 'without ANY evidence of it from his <hi>works?'</hi> If ſo, there ſeems to be ſome jumble in <hi>deſcending</hi> to this argument 'from the <hi>proved</hi> neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of GOD's exiſtence'. We cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in what we have here extracted, the terms are changed in the latter part of the paragraph from what they were in the beginning of it. It is firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the author's opinion, that there is a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in nature for our coming to the knowledge of the BEING of a GOD, <hi>without any evidence of it from his works.</hi> But at the cloſe of the paragraph it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that 'from the <hi>proved</hi> neceſſity of his <hi>exiſtence,</hi> we may prove <hi>many of his</hi> PERFECTIONS <hi>á priori.'</hi> In the ſame place Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> obſerves, 'we argue his <hi>being, from</hi> our own being, and the being of other things'—which is the only <hi>medium</hi> to prove the <hi>being</hi> of a GOD (p. 386.) What 'foundation is there then, in the nature of things, for the knowledge of the BEING of a GOD, without <hi>any</hi> evidence of it <hi>from his works'?</hi> What <hi>medium</hi> of proof?</p>
                  <p>Dr. SAMUEL CLARK, in his 'demonſtration of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and attributes of GOD,' undertakes to prove, that he 'exiſts by a neceſſity abſolute in the nature of the thing itſelf'—'a neceſſity antecedent. (in the order of nature, and of our ideas, though not of time) to the ſuppoſition of his exiſtence'—which neceſſity he aſſigns as 'the natural <hi>ground, foundation, cauſe,</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> of GOD's being.'</p>
                  <p>Now though we would not chuſe to diſſent from ſuch a maſter of reaſon, yet the enquiry in a manner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth itſelf upon us, Where is the propriety of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing any thing, in any ſenſe, to be the PRIOR ground of the exiſtence of the <hi>firſt</hi> cauſe? Doth not this convey the idea of an <hi>effect produced?</hi> The Dr. remarks on <hi>Spinoza's</hi> doctrine of neceſſity, (or 'the neceſſary following of an effect from it's cauſe') that 'this neceſſity muſt ſtill be determined by ſomething <hi>antecedent,</hi> and <hi>ſo on infinitely.'</hi> Might not a Spinoziſt reply, that <hi>that</hi> neceſſity, which Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> faith is the cauſe of the exiſtence of GOD muſt be determined by ſomething antecedent? and ſo on'?</p>
                  <p>The Dr. takes his riſe to the neceſſity of the divine exiſtence from hence, That 'there hath exiſted from eternity ſome one independent being, the author of all other beings.' (vid. p. 8,—15. Edit. 10th.) On this <hi>poſtulatum</hi> he proceeds. Hence, and from things ſaid in his ſeventh letter, it is probable he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meant not to prove the <hi>certain exiſtence</hi> of GOD <hi>à priori,</hi> but his particular <hi>perfections.</hi> 'The infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eternity, unity of GOD, &amp;c muſt be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the nature of neceſſary exiſtence; from the nature and conſequences of that neceſſity, by which the firſt cauſe exiſts' And yet, ſpeaking of the 'ſcholaſtic way of proving the EXISTENCE of the ſelf-exiſtent being, from the abſolute perfection of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,' the Dr. remarks, 'All or any perfections <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe</hi> exiſtence; which is <hi>petitio principii.</hi> But bare neceſſity of exiſtence doth not <hi>preſuppoſe,</hi> but <hi>infer</hi> exiſtence. In this caſe, here muſt <hi>nothing be preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, no nature whatſoever,'</hi> (Letter 6th, p. 490, 491.)</p>
                  <p>WHY then did the Dr. lay down his two firſt propoſitions (p. 8, 11.) as the <hi>media</hi> of proof? If neceſſity 'doth not <hi>preſuppoſe,</hi> but <hi>infer</hi> exiſtence; yet the <hi>method</hi> the Dr. takes to prove this neceſſity PRESUPPOSES a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and exiſtence: it ſuppoſeth that there <hi>exiſts</hi> an eternal, independent being—the author of all other beings. The very thing to be proved.</p>
                  <p>ADMITTING the Dr's poſition, that neceſſity is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the divine exiſtence; to what purpoſe is it with an atheiſt? It takes for granted the thing in queſtion. The enquiry is not, <hi>How</hi> GOD exiſts? but, <hi>Whether</hi> he exiſts? Exiſtence, and the <hi>cauſe</hi> of exiſtence, are very diſtinct. An enquiry about the latter plainly preſuppoſeth the former. So that while the Dr. endeavours to prove, that GOD exiſts 'from a cauſe within himſelf,' he takes for granted, that <hi>there is a GOD;</hi> and only accounts for a peculiar <hi>circumſtance,</hi> or this <hi>mode</hi> of his exiſtence, that it is 'by a neceſſity of nature.' Whereas the ſubject of enquiry between an atheiſt and a theiſt is not the <hi>modus</hi> of exiſtence, but the ſimple truth or <hi>fact</hi>—is there in <hi>reality</hi> 'an eternal, independent being, the author of all other beings? Now from what can this point poſſibly be argued but from the <hi>phaenomena of nature?</hi> If, from ſurveying viſible creation, the atheiſt is not convinced that GOD IS, how can we go a ſtep farther with him? Muſt he not think it imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and <hi>petitio principii,</hi> if we undertake to ſhew him,—HOW GOD exiſts? Or to aſſign a <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of an exiſtence, which he believes nothing of? But if from the frame of nature he is convinced of the <hi>certain exiſtence</hi> of GOD, he is no longer an atheiſt, and therefore needs not the argument <hi>à priori</hi> for his conviction.</p>
                  <p>Or ſuppoſe the atheiſt, for argument's ſake, to admit that GOD is, but demands to have the <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>ground</hi> of his exiſtence aſſign'd and explained. Is any theiſt holden to ſhew him, <hi>how</hi> the divine being exiſted from eternity? Can this be done? Hath Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> attempted it? In one word, are the phaenomena of nature ſufficient to prove the being and perfections of GOD? If they are; what need of any other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument than that <hi>á poſteriori?</hi> If they are not, it is certain the argument <hi>á priori</hi> can produce no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction: For this reſolves itſelf into the argument <hi>á poſteriori.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT the being of a GOD is indeed neceſſary, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing round us declares. If the things that are ſeen were <hi>created and made,</hi> the ſelf-exiſtence and eternity of the creator is proved beyond doubt. For whatever hath a <hi>beginning</hi> exiſts from ſome cauſe <hi>without</hi> itſelf. Now as this cannot be ſaid of the <hi>creator</hi> of all things and beings, it follows, that he muſt be <hi>ſelf-exiſtent and eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Dr. tells us, that 'the <hi>eternity</hi> of GOD' (either <hi>á parte ante,</hi> or <hi>á parte poſt)</hi> 'can no otherwiſe be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than by the argument <hi>à priori.'</hi> But, admitting <hi>an author of nature,</hi> doth it not follow, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, not meerly from the beginning of the phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena of nature, but from <hi>everlaſting?</hi> and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, muſt always continue to exiſt? Do not theſe things follow, without conſidering the 'intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic nature of <hi>neceſſary exiſtence'?</hi> (which is allowed to be <hi>inexplicable.</hi>) Do not they follow from this ſimple conſideration, that the original cauſe exiſts from no <hi>external</hi> cauſe? St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth the <hi>eternity</hi> of GOD is no leſs evident from the things that are made, than his exiſtence, power, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. <hi>The inviſible things of him, from the creation of the world, are</hi> CLEARLY <hi>ſeen, being underſtood by the the things that are made,</hi> EVEN HIS ETERNAL POWER AND GODHEAD; ſo that they are <hi>without excuſe,</hi> who will not admit this proof.</p>
                  <p>THE Dr. obſerves upon the whole, that 'the proof <hi>à priori</hi> is capable of being underſtood only by a <hi>few attentive minds;</hi> becauſe it is of uſe only againſt <hi>learned and metaphyſical difficulties</hi>'—while the proof <hi>á poſteriori</hi> is level to <hi>all</hi> men's capacities'—that this, therefore, 'is by far the <hi>moſt generally</hi> uſeful argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what GOD expects moral agents ſhould be <hi>determined by'</hi> But if the eternity and immortality of GOD cannot be proved <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> how is this argument ſufficient with <hi>common people?</hi> Do not they need an argument to prove that GOD is eternal and immortal as well as <hi>philoſophers?</hi> Are the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incapable of receiving any proof of this point? Or is it the privilege of the learned, that 'GOD, as moral governor,' does not 'expect they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by' that evidence, whereby '<hi>moral agents</hi> ſhould be determined'?</p>
                  <p>WHAT the Dr. ſays concerning the <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>infinity</hi> of GOD, that they are proveable only <hi>à priori,</hi> we think liable to much the ſame exceptions. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical reaſoning on this ſubject, as well as <hi>ſome other</hi> points of theology, inſtead of relieving any phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic difficulty, hath, on the contrary, given great advantage to infidelity.</p>
               </note> Whence it follows,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:011623_0049_0F8777B889C3F060"/>SECONDLY, That all things are originally <hi>what the creator made them, and intended they ſhould be.</hi> Whether animate or inanimate, rational or irrational, throughout all worlds—they have all ſuch powers and properties, ſuch relations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections

and deſtination, as the great former of them has given and intended. Cauſes and effects can be traced no higher. We muſt ſtop at the author of nature, the firſt and original cauſe.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Beſides abſolute or <hi>natural</hi> perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions (as eternity, ſelf exiſtence, independance, infinity, &amp;c.) the firſt cauſe is a being of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>moral</hi> character—is immutably juſt, holy good, true, &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:011623_0051_0F8777BB75BD2808"/>FOURTHLY, That the moral perfections of GOD correſpond to the <hi>moral diſcernment he hath given to us.</hi> For when we ſay, God is holy, juſt, good &amp;c, we ſpeak altogether unintelligibly, if we ſuppoſe theſe perfections in him to be eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011623_0052_0F8777BB9E4924B0"/>
different from the perceptions implanted in us. Not but the deity poſſeſſeth theſe moral perfections in a <hi>degree</hi> far above finite concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet as in theſe he propoſeth his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to our imitation, ſo that which may be
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011623_0053_0F8777BC64FEFA50"/>
known of God in this regard is manifeſt from the moral faculty in man, whereby he is a law to himſelf. (Not meaning to exclude the help and improvement derived from <hi>revelation.</hi>)</p>
            <p>FIFTHLY, That the moral character of God is that <hi>foundation of religion,</hi> as the moral nature of man is of his accountableneſs.</p>
            <p>ON the footing of theſe principles, we ſhall proceed to examine Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine of neceſſity.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">

                  <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Whether the will be neceſſarily determined by an <hi>extrinſic</hi> cauſe?</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Edwards</hi> would have his readers 'ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that when he ſpeaks of <hi>connection of cauſes and effects,</hi> he hath reſpect to <hi>moral</hi> cauſes, as well as thoſe that are called <hi>natural</hi> in diſtinction from them—that the acts of the will may be as <hi>certainly and indiſſolubly</hi> connected with the moral cauſe, as natural effects with their natural cauſes—that the connection is as <hi>ſure and perfect</hi> between moral cauſes and effects, as natural; that moral neceſſity may be as <hi>abſolute</hi> as natural neceſſity.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Part I. Sect. 4. p. 30, 31, 32.</note> Yea, he advertiſeth us, that 'where he uſeth this diſtinction of moral and natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, he would not be underſtood to ſuppoſe, that if any thing comes to paſs by the former kind of neceſſity, <hi>the nature of things</hi> is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, as well as in the latter. I do not mean to determine, that when a moral motive is ſo ſtrong, that the act of the will infallibly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, this is not owing to the nature of things. I ſuppoſe that neceſſity, which is called natural, in diſtinction from moral, is ſo called becauſe <hi>meer</hi> nature is concerned, without any thing of <hi>choice;</hi> not becauſe nature has never any hand in our choice: For, choice ariſes from nature as truly as other events.' So that, upon the whole, much the ſame rules are ſuppoſed to take place in the moral world, in GOD's government of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011623_0055_0F8777BDDAE59308"/>
moral agents <hi>(ſo called)</hi> as in the adjuſtment and diſpoſal of natural things. What Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> intended by a <hi>moral</hi> cauſe, we cannot ſatisfy our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Sometimes he appears to reaſon as if he ſuppoſed there was <hi>really no diſtinction</hi> between a moral and natural cauſe, (31, 32.) or none to be perceived; while more generally he ſeems to ſuppoſe a diſtinction of great importance; which, however, he hath not ſo clearly pointed out as were to be wiſhed.</p>
               <p>INDEED, if there be not a real and important diſtinction between moral cauſes and natural, it plainly follows, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath taken pains to no purpoſe to ſhew, that natural neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wholly precludes from praiſe or blame, while moral neceſſity doth not at all. And if there be a real and important diſtinction, it is of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that it be clearly ſeen.</p>
               <p>IN the ſection laſt referred to, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſuggeſts, that 'when we ſpeak of choice as <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct</hi> from nature, it is without <hi>reflection and reſearch;</hi> names being given to things according to what is moſt <hi>obvious.</hi> But though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance and connection between acts of volition or choice, and their cauſes, according to <hi>eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed laws,</hi> is not ſo ſenſible and obvious, as that eſtabliſhed law and order which is ſeen in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial world; and though men make a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between nature and choice <hi>as if they were</hi> compleatly and univerſally diſtinct; yet choice ariſes from nature as truly as other events How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe are the names that theſe two kinds of neceſſity have uſually been called by; (viz. natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral) and they muſt be diſtinguiſhed by ſome names or other; for there is a diſtinction
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011623_0056_0F8777BF81924C48"/>
or difference between them, that is very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in it's conſequences: Which difference does not lie ſo much in the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>connection,</hi> as in the two <hi>terms connected.'</hi> The difference is <hi>important,</hi> but not <hi>ſenſible and obvious.</hi> 'The cauſe, with which the effect is connected, is of a particular kind, viz of a <hi>moral</hi> nature—the effect alſo is of a particular kind, being of a moral nature.' But are we not told in this ſame place, that the effect is alſo connected with the <hi>natural</hi> cauſe, and is owing to the nature of things? There is the <hi>joint</hi> influence of moral and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neceſſity in moral events—their influence is cloſely linked together. Now till the <hi>meaſure</hi> of influence to be aſcribed to <hi>moral</hi> neceſſity is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly apprehended, it is impoſſible to tell when, and how far, a perſon is rewardable or puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—natural neceſſity (by ſuppoſition) being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with reward or puniſhment. But let any one examine Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book, and ſay, whether he hath ſhewn when and how far the acts of the will proceed from natural neceſſity, and when, or how far from moral. Whether the ſo much labour'd diſtinction, or difference between natural and moral cauſes is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and exploded?</p>
               <p>IT is difficult to determine whether Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> ſuppoſed the acts of the will to be the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary effects of an <hi>intrinſic</hi> cauſe, or an <hi>extrinſic.</hi> Theſe are uſed ſo promiſcuouſly and indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately through his book, volition being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſcribed to the one, ſometimes to the other, that, though they are eſſentially different and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, it is hard to ſay which he more eſpecially intended by that moral neceſſity, to which he every where ſuppoſeth the will is ſubject. Either
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011623_0057_0F8777C019A765E8"/>
internal, original bias, or ſomething extrinſic, is the cauſe, to whoſe efficiency, determination, command, deciſion, the will is as much ſubject, as the motion of the body to the will—this being 'as <hi>paſſive</hi> and neceſſary with reſpect to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent determining cauſe of it,' as the motions of the hands and feet with reſpect to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the will. (183, 184)</p>
               <p>WE rather think it was Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s opinion, that the will is determined by an <hi>extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic</hi> cauſe. But ſince this is by no means certain from his book—ſince he hath not expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf clearly, or we are incapable judges of this intricate ſubject, we ſhall take liberty to examine his doctrine on both ſuppoſitions—either of an <hi>extrinſic,</hi> or <hi>intrinſic</hi> cauſe. The former ſhall be the ſubject of the preſent ſection.</p>
               <p>WHETHER volition is neceſſarily determined by an <hi>extrinſic</hi> cauſe? Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> aſſerts, that the acts of the will are not neceſſary <hi>in themſelves,</hi> or in their own <hi>nature;</hi> but by their <hi>connection</hi> with ſome cauſe that is neceſſary <hi>in itſelf.</hi> In his own words, they 'are neceſſary by a neceſſity of <hi>conſequence.'</hi> The only way that any thing that is to come to paſs <hi>hereafter,</hi> is, or can be, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, is by a <hi>connection</hi> with ſomething that is neceſſary in it's own nature, or ſomething that already is, or has been; ſo that the one being ſuppoſed, the other certainly follows. This alſo is the only way that all things <hi>paſt,</hi> (excepting thoſe which were from eternity) could be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>before they came to paſs,</hi> or could come to paſs neceſſarily; and therefore the only way in which <hi>any</hi> effect or event, or any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that ever has had, or will have a beginning,

Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> teacheth, that men muſt be the authors of <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> actions, by being the cauſes of them <hi>by an act of will or choice,</hi> in order to praiſe or blame; but that <hi>no ſuch thing holds with reſpect to the acts

of the will</hi> THEMSELVES, that they are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, voluntary cauſe of them. (277.) In the <hi>internal</hi> act, (viz. volition) the agent, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſubject,</hi> is not ſelf-determined; i. e. is not the cauſe of it.

               <p>'IN <hi>external</hi> actions men are ſelf-directed, ſelf-determined; and their wills are the cauſe of the motions of their bodies, and the external things that are done; ſo that unleſs men do them vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and the action be determined by their antecedent volition, it is no action or doing of theirs.' (286. 287.) That is, they are the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary cauſe, not of the evil will in them, which is the <hi>eſſence</hi> of vice, but only of the external action, which is the meer <hi>body</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of it. The cauſe of ſin is <hi>without</hi> themſelves. In what conſtitutes it's nature, they are directed, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, by ſome ſuperior agent, who is the cauſe of every internal act of the will. For volition hath a cauſe itſelf, as well as is the cauſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal action Any one ſees, that men's being the authors of corporeal action <hi>meerly,</hi> 'is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil, any more than ſickneſs, or ſome other natural calamity, which ariſes from a' natural 'cauſe'.</p>
               <p>ESPECIALLY when it is farther conſidered, in what ſenſe men are the authors of corporeal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſcheme, will it appear, that they cannot, on this account, be chargeable with moral evil. 'Every act or the will is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe dependent and conſequent on a neceſſary cauſe.' <note n="*" place="bottom">"There is as much reaſon to believe that <hi>all</hi> things are voluntary, as that all things are <hi>neceſſary;</hi> and I deſire any one to ſhew me that the one is more clear and certain than the other.

               <p>TO what extrinſic cauſe then, or to whom, are the volitions of men to be aſcribed, ſince they
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011623_0061_0F8777C91D372810"/>
are not the cauſe of them themſelves? By whom or what is the ſtate of men's will determined? According to Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> it is the ſtrongeſt motive from without. But motives to choice are exhibited to the mind by ſome agent: By whom are they exhibited? In regard to ſinful volitions we know that one man enticeth another, and Satan enticeth all mankind. But this will not be given as an anſwer to our queſtion; ſince the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful act of one ſinner in enticing another, and of Satan in tempting all men, muſt be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a previous cauſe—an antecedent higheſt motive exhibited by ſome other agent. (Though, by the way, it may be difficult to ſhew, how one man can be the cauſe of ſin in another, when he cannot be the cauſe of it himſelf.) What we are enquiring after is, the cauſe of 'the <hi>firſt and leading</hi> ſinful volition, <hi>which determines the whole affair.'</hi> Nor is there any ſtop, till we arrive at the firſt cauſe, 'whoſe immediate conduct Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> ſaith, is firſt in the ſeries of events, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with nothing preceeding.'</p>
               <p>WILL it now be ſaid, that GOD is the cauſe of thoſe diſpoſitions of heart, and acts of the will, which are ſo odious in their own nature? On Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſcheme this muſt be ſaid. For the acts of the will, not being neceſſary in their <hi>own</hi> nature, but by connection with a cauſe that is ſo; and no cauſe being thus neceſſary but he who exiſted from eternity, it undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that every ſinful volition proceeds ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him, as the cauſe and ſource <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>. And to ſay, that the volitions themſelves are vicious, but that the cauſe is not ſo, equally militates againſt Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own ſcheme, and common ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:011623_0062_0F8777C9F17DD878"/>ON reading ſection I. part IV. of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book, it was matter of much ſurprize to find a gentleman of his abilities uſing ſo weak an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſcending to ſo thin a ſubtility, as this, "that the eſſence of virtue and vice is not in their <hi>cauſe,</hi> but in their <hi>nature.</hi>" The pains taken with this, (argument ſhall we call it?) the ſtreſs laid upon it, is indeed no mark of a good cauſe. But ſince every thing advanced by ſo eminent a writer may be thought to merit attention, we ſhall briefly conſider the ſubject of this ſection. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own reaſoning will aſſiſt us here, as in other parts of theſe remarks.</p>
               <p>FOR 'there cannot be more in the effect than in the cauſe.' (62.) Volition therefore cannot be virtuous or vicious farther than it's cauſe is ſo. We may not detach the nature of effects from the efficient. 'It may be wickedneſs in the cauſe, that it produceth wickedneſs.' Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then, that 'the wicked act of the cauſe in producing wickedneſs, is <hi>one</hi> wickedneſs; and the wickedneſs produced another'—what follows is, that in every ſinful volition there are <hi>two</hi> wickedneſſes—one chargeable to the cauſe, the other to the ſubject of the volition. Now if the cauſe be 'diverſe from the ſubject of' volition, how doth it relieve the difficulty at all, if upon the ſcheme of neceſſary connection, GOD ſtands chargeable with doing wickedly? And is not this the plain conſequence of the doctrine, 'that the acts of the will are indiſſolubly connected with a cauſe that is neceſſary in it's own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture'? And if it will be allowed, that GOD can do wickedly conſidered as the <hi>cauſe</hi> of ſinful volitions, we may juſt as well aſcribe all moral evil to him.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Whether the will be neceſſarily determined by an <hi>intrinſic</hi> cauſe.</head>
               <p>HOWEVER repugnant this hypotheſis is to that already examined, yet it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book. Our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not to reconcile him with himſelf, But to remark on what we find. His meaning would doubtleſs have been clearer, had the ſubject he undertook been intelligible. He appears to have been bewildered at times in his own ſubtilty.</p>
               <p>TO ſay, that the acts of the will are neceſſary from internal, original bias, is not very conſiſtent with ſaying, they are the neceſſary effects of an extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic cauſe. For what is this but ſaying, they are neceſſary in their <hi>own nature?</hi> therefore not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by a neceſſity of conſequence? Yet Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> expreſly aſſerts, that every thing which ever had, or will have a <hi>beginning,</hi> is neceſſary only by a neceſſity of conſequence. Now if the acts of the will are effects of an extrinſic cauſe <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> then they cannot be the effects of an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic cauſe <hi>alſo.</hi> But <hi>original bias and inclination</hi> is intrinſic. If this therefore neceſſarily determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth volition, then the other poſition of it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an extrinſic, conſequential neceſſity, (an eternal, neceſſary cauſe) muſt be given up. For 'how can theſe things hang together'? Or will any ſuppoſe, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> when he faith, 'the ſtate or act of the will is from the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011623_0064_0F8777CB59E09E58"/>
determination of an intrinſic cauſe,' meant by this cauſe the Deity inhabiting and actuating eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intelligent creature? by a poſitive efficiency producing every volition of theirs? Such a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, we cannot believe any one will make, however neceſſary to reconcile Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> to himſelf. This is a ſenſe of GOD's <hi>working in men to will, and to do; of our living, moving, and having our being</hi> in him, which we preſume none will eſpouſe. For if it makes him the author of <hi>virtuous</hi> diſpoſitions in men, in the moſt <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>abſolute</hi> ſenſe; it will be remembered, that it alſo makes him, in the ſame ſenſe, the author of every <hi>vicious</hi> inclination and propenſity. On this hypotheſis, there is properly but <hi>one</hi> agent in the univerſe.</p>
               <p>'MORAL neceſſity,' ſaith Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> 'lies <hi>in</hi> the will, and is the will's <hi>propenſity'.</hi> How then does it lie in ſomething exhibited to the mind from without, which is <hi>prior</hi> to the will, and gives it a neceſſary determination? Surely the will's propenſity is not prior to its propenſity. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>in the will itſelf</hi> can be the moral neceſſity by which it is determined, if this neceſſity be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>prior</hi> to will. Beſides, to be determined by a cauſe in itſelf, is to be <hi>ſelf determined,</hi> if words have any meaning. And moreover, this is making the will neceſſary in it's <hi>own nature.</hi> Both which are contrary to ſuppoſition. What confounding again of cauſe and effect! Volition is the antecedent, neceſſary cauſe of volition! The will is neceſſarily determined in every act by a neceſſity prior and ſuperior to it; and yet this neceſſity is nothing diverſe or diſtinct from volition!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:011623_0065_0F8777CCE3CA8190"/>MOREOVER, if an intrinſic cauſe, or origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bias and propenſity, be that neceſſity by which the will is determined, what is this but being determined by <hi>nature?</hi> For original propenſity is <hi>natural</hi> propenſity. Original neceſſity is <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> neceſſity. Agreably Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſaith, 'Moral neceſſity is a ſpecies of philoſophical'—<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Natural</hi> philoſophy, we conclude he means—though indeed it is alike applicable to his <hi>moral</hi> philoſophy, and that of many ſcepticks in our nation.</note> (294, 295. 30<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.) that 'moral events a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from nature as truly as others.' (31, 32.) Therefore, as was hinted before, moral neceſſity, as truly as natural, precludes from praiſe or blame—and that for this good reaſon, that moral neceſſity is natural. This is applicable to the neceſſity of the <hi>firſt</hi> ſinful volition, if indeed it was neceſſary before it came to paſs—And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ſinful volitions being the effects of the firſt, it equally holds as to <hi>theſe</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>THERE ſeems, indeed, to be ſome difficulty, in regard to the principle implanted in the <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> by the Spirit of GOD, upon this hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of Mr. <hi>Edwards.</hi> For he, we preſume, would not deny, that they were born in ſin; and that the bias in regeneration is <hi>changed</hi> from what it was by <hi>nature.</hi> Conſequently, the holineſs and perſeverance of the ſaints is not neceſſary from native, original propenſity, but from ſome other cauſe.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER may be ſaid in regard to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of <hi>fallen</hi> man; Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s principle hath equal reſpect to the moral power of man in <hi>innocence,</hi> and of the rebel angels before their fall. <hi>Their</hi> original bias and inclination, it will be allowed, proceeded immediately from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011623_0066_0F8777D0237D28C8"/>
If then their ſin was the effect of a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty originally in their will, or was their will's ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal propenſity, it was ſo entirely owing to the <hi>nature of things,</hi> that (by ſuppoſition) it could not involve them in guilt—Or if connected with the eternal cauſe, who alone is neceſſary in his own nature, it could not upon our author's own ſcheme; be <hi>their</hi> ſin. The whole guilt, if any, muſt be imputed to the firſt cauſe. For the firſt ſin, of angels and man, was once future; and therefore could not be neceſſary in itſelf, but only by the aforeſaid neceſſity of conſequence. (p. 25.) And then, whatever moral impotency now cleaves to mankind, or damned ſpirits, this being connected with the firſt ſin, which was connected with the original, neceſſary bias of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; it follows, that the ſins of fallen crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are neceſſary in the ſame way that the firſt ſinful volition was—the only way in which all things and events whatſoever, which are not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, are, or can be neceſſary. They do not therefore partake of the eſſence of ſin; or if they do, involve the creator in it.</p>
               <p>INDEED the ſuppoſition of being neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by original, internal bias, does, upon the whole, lead to much the ſame conſequences with that of ſuppoſing the acts of the will to be neceſſary by a neceſſity of conſequence—ſince, agreable to the ſecond preliminary propoſition, <hi>original</hi> bias muſt be ultimately aſcribed to the original cauſe of all things. What is natural is the conſtitution of the author of nature. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral events, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> inſtructs us, are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, partly at leaſt, to the nature of things—pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, at leaſt in part, from natural cauſes. Now, by his own principles, ſo far as the nature of
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011623_0067_0F8777D0308737C0"/>
things operates to their production, neither good nor ill deſert is applicable to the ſubject of voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Had he told us in what reſpects, and how far, volition is owing to natural neceſſity, we might have known wherein, and how far, the creature is accountable. For herein, and ſo far, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> grants, it [volition] is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly his own act—he is not the proper ſubject of command, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IF volition be partly owing to natural cauſes, and the ſubject ſo far is not anſwerable; what is this but charging the moral turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a ſinful volition on GOD, <hi>ſo far as it is the effect of natural neceſſity?</hi> Now as well may we attribute the <hi>whole</hi> moral turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God, as the <hi>leaſt meaſure</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>IT moreover follows, that the holineſs of the angels, who never ſinned, being among thoſe moral events which are owing to the nature of things, is no holineſs; unworthy of praiſe. The ſame thing follows with reſpect ſo the holineſs of the man CHRIST JESUS, and of GOD himſelf. For 'natural neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is wholly inconſiſtent with juſt praiſe and blame.' And would Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> deny, that the holineſs of GOD, his moral rectitude in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is neceſſary <hi>in it's own nature?</hi> And what is this, but to be neceſſary by a <hi>natural</hi> neceſſity?</p>
               <p>FARTHER, by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s principles, all virtue and vice in creatures is <hi>native</hi> or <hi>original.</hi> For every act of volition is the neceſſary effect of internal, original bias—i. e. is owing to the original frame of the mind. The angels that ſelf, and our common progenitors, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011623_0068_0F8777D09FC289F8"/>
'made with a fixed, prevailing principle of ſin in the heart.' Otherwiſe their ſin proceeded not from internal, original bias—any more than from an 'indiſſoluble <hi>connection</hi> with a cauſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in it's own nature.' If in truth their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal bias was not to evil—if they were endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>moral</hi> image of GOD, then their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful volition was not the effect of original pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity—nor did the neceſſity of it lie <hi>in the will,</hi> in it's primitive ſtate. Nor conſequently will this account for the permanency of holineſs in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven. This cannot be the <hi>rationale</hi> of the abiding principle of holineſs in them; ſince it appears from fact, that creatures endowed with the moral image of GOD, may deface and forfeit it.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE 'the eſſence of virtue and vice lies in the <hi>nature</hi> of volition, not in the cauſe'; it then follows, that the intrinſic cauſe, the internal bias or propenſity (which is ſuppoſed to be the moral neceſſity that determines the will) is not that which <hi>conſtitutes</hi> the goodneſs, or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of the acts of the will. A vicious man's bias and inclination to ſin, is not that which <hi>makes</hi> him ſinful; the eſſence of his ſin lying not in ſuch bias or inclination, but in the <hi>nature</hi> of the wicked thing. A ſhrewd ſolution! as if the character of moral agents were not always eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated from their propenſity to good or evil. If 'moral neceſſity lies in the will, and is the will's propenſity,' it either follows, that there is no good or evil in any diſpoſitions implanted in the hearts of men <hi>by nature;</hi> (contrary to aſſertion, p. 303.) or if there be any good or evil in ſuch diſpoſitions, this is entirely a diſtinct goodneſs or wickedneſs from the volitions themſelves, which they are the cauſe of. 'It would imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011623_0069_0F8777D2564B9C70"/>
to ſuppoſe, that theſe two are the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual' goodneſs or 'wickedneſs. The' good or 'wicked act of the cauſe, in producing' goodneſs or 'wickedneſs is one' goodneſs or 'wickedneſs; and the' goodneſs or 'wickedneſs produced, if there be any produced, is another.' Will this be called arguing! What doth it amount to? The plain truth is, that when we ſet ourſelves to judge of human actions, we muſt have no conſideration of the ſource of them, but entirely detach them from their cauſes. Be the efficient who or what it will, all we have to attend to is, the effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced—by this we muſt eſtimate the goodneſs or wickedneſs of men, whether they determine themſelves, or are determined <hi>ab extra</hi>—whether they have power over their own wills, or have not. He therefore that with one original talent makes as great improvement as another with five, is no more praiſeworthy—that is, is not <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted according to that he hath.</hi> He that offends againſt five degrees of light originally given, is guilty in no higher degree than he that offends againſt but one degree of light. The volition, or act, in both caſes, we ſuppoſe to be the ſame in regard to the ſubject matter of duty or ſin—the ſame alſo in the general nature thereof. What then is the reaſon of different degrees of puniſhment for the ſame crime in different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Not the nature of the crime as abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of the agent, but as connected and compared herewith. Now if men are not the cauſe of their own volitions, then a determination to ſin againſt ten degrees of light differs nothing from the like determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt a ſingle degree of light: In both caſes, the determination itſelf is alike neceſſary and unavoidable. So that there is no foundation
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011623_0070_0F8777D2D98A9AD0"/>
for different degrees of guilt; becauſe, though we are won't to ſpeak of ſuperior and leſſer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, yet there is no real ground for this diſtinction, intelligent creatures being in no caſe the authors, the voluntary deſigning cauſe of their inward determinations; at leaſt not of the firſt and leading act, which decides the whole matter. How then, without having recourſe to the cauſe, can we judge of the natute of ſin?</p>
               <p>INDEED had Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſucceeded in his attempt to ſhew, that the "eſſence of virtue and vice is not in their cauſe, but in their nature", he would not have obviated the objection ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made to the doctrine of neceſſity, but never anſwered, that it is charging GOD with ſin.</p>
               <p>FOR admitting GOD to be the original cauſe of volition, but that being the cauſe of a ſinful volition in the creature is a diſtinct wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from that which the cauſe produceth in the effect; ſtill the ſupreme cauſe is ſuppoſed in fault; is charged with <hi>producing</hi> ſin. There is no evading the conſequence, indeed, that the <hi>whole</hi> guilt of men's evil diſpoſitions is chargeable on GOD, not themſelves, or on blind neceſſity and fatality, if the things Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> advanceth be true. For who will charge another with what he is acknowledged not to be the author or cauſe of? If therefore men's volitions are virtuous or vicious, and they not the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſes of them themſelves; (which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> throughout his book ſaith they are not) it follows, that the virtue or vice of their volitions is to be aſcribed to the cauſe, whoever or whatever this cauſe is. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence may appear more plainly to follow from the ſcheme of neceſſity we are exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the ſucceeding ſections.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Upon Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own Scheme, there cannot be <hi>natural</hi> Liberty without <hi>moral.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE acknowledge the title of this ſection contains a poſition directly repugnant to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s whole ſcheme, and yet truſt we ſhall make it appear that the thing aſſerted plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows from things he hath advanced.</p>
               <p>LIBERTY with reſpect to <hi>natural</hi> actions can be neither more nor leſs than according to the freedom of the <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>mind.</hi> For natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by ſuppoſition, are dependent and conſequent on, the fruits and effects of, the will's determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which is the cauſe of them. Now 'there cannot be more in the effect than in the cauſe. Thoſe things which are indiſſolubly connected with other things that are neceſſary, are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves neceſſary.' Therefore if the acts of the will are neceſſary, thoſe outward acts, which are the effects of neceſſity in the will, muſt be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary 'by a neceſſity of <hi>conſequence.'</hi> Now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of the will is ſaid to be neceſſary. 'The ſoul itſelf is the object of ſomething acting upon, and influencing it. The firſt and determining act of choice, which decides the whole affair, is out of our power.' So that in natural actions we are <hi>'cauſed</hi> to act by ſome other agent.' Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> faith, 'it is no more a contradiction, to ſuppoſe that action may be the effect of ſome <hi>other</hi> cauſe, beſides the <hi>agent</hi> or <hi>being</hi> that acts,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011623_0072_0F8777D88A9FDD28"/>
than to ſuppoſe that life may be the effect of ſome other cauſe beſides the liver, or being that lives, in whom life is cauſed to be.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Is a man active in that act by which he is brought into being?</note> (286.) The acts of the ſoul or will being, therefore, neceſſary effects of ſome other cauſe than the agent, let it be ſhewn how there can be ſo much as natural liberty—meaning hereby a freedom from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſtraint or reſtraint.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Edwards</hi> aſſerts, 'The liberty of the will is not exerciſed in any thing but what the will <hi>does'.</hi> (99.) 'The will in no inſtance whatever is it's <hi>own</hi> determiner'. Therefore the liberty of the will is not exerciſed in any of the <hi>determinations</hi> of the will. Therefore not in determining to move the <hi>body.</hi> Therefore corporeal action is not <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</hi> Therefore the will <hi>does</hi> nothing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is <hi>exerciſed</hi> in nothing. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> promiſeth to 'demonſtrate', that 'if the <hi>firſt</hi> act in the train, determining and fixing the reſt, be not free, none of them all are free.' And aſſerts, that '<hi>GOD</hi>'s own immediate conduct is <hi>original</hi> in the ſeries.'</p>
               <p>In one word, external action is no more in our power than internal. To ſay that the will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the former is not true: For this would be to ſuppoſe it is its own determiner at leaſt in this particular determination to move the body; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to aſſertion, that it is in no inſtance whatever it's own determiner. But ſuppoſe material actions to be determined by the will, that herein men are the voluntary cauſes of their own actions—this is really attributing no power to the will or agent—ſince all the acts of the will ſuppoſe an anſwerable
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011623_0073_0F8777D8FA132448"/>
cauſe without, as much as creation ſuppoſeth a creator. (62.)</p>
               <p>If material actions are ſubject to, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, the will, ſtill this is ſubject to and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by preceeding neceſſity. So that natural liberty is given up. For that is a ſtrange kind of liberty, which is founded in, and reſults out of, neceſſity. Whether this neceſſity be natural or moral—whether it proceeds from an extrinſic or intrinſic cauſe, it equally militates againſt the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of freedom. The intelligent ſyſtem is a curious piece of mechaniſm.</p>
               <p>Page 232 (and elſewhere) Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath an evaſion, which ſcarce deſerves a ſerious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer It is this, 'that a man may be ſaid to have a thing in his power, if he has it at his <hi>election;</hi> i. e. if he <hi>now</hi> pleaſeth, and has a <hi>direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> deſire for it, he is not unable to do it.' This, in moſt writers, would be eſteemed meer quibbling. For if a man is morally incapable of a 'direct and immediate deſire' to a thing, how can he be ſaid to have it in his power? Would Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſay, that things are in or out of men's power, farther than <hi>chuſing or refuſing</hi> is ſo, as well as the conſequent acts depending hereon? It is not improper to ſay, 'that a perſon' <hi>cannot</hi> 'perform thoſe actions, which depend on an act of will, when the act of will itſelf cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,' but is forever impoſſible'—when the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the contrary is 'as ſtrong and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable as the bars of a caſtle,' by <hi>nature</hi>—when want of inclination proceeds from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or original bias. For 'the event is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on it's cauſe.' And the cauſe not being put, the event cannot take place. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that ſuch a ſtate of the will may be
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011623_0074_0F8777D9A397EC58"/>
required as is forever impoſſible; this can be only on a ſuppoſition of an ability once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and poſſeſſed, but loſt. Who will ſay, that a man has in his power what is and muſt be impoſſible? So that when we are told, 'that the common people, in their notion of a faulty or praise-worthy deed, ſuppoſe the man does it in the exerciſe of <hi>liberty;</hi> but that their notion of liberty is only a perſon's having opportunity of doing as he pleaſes'—i. e. of <hi>executing</hi> a choice already made, we muſt eſteem this trifting. For what liberty is there when choice itſelf is out of a man's power—is the effect of an antecedent neceſſary cauſe? 'In the <hi>firſt</hi> act of choice, which decides the whole matter,' he is neceſſarily determined. In this Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> conſtantly aſſerts a man has not power, or liberty of choice, while he grants him a power or capacity of <hi>conſequent</hi> choice. That is, in other words, a capacity of being acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſome other cauſe or agent.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole: Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> allows, that liberty is eſſential to praiſe or blame, reward or puniſhment; but teacheth, that the internal ſtate of the mind or will proceeds not from, is not determined by, ourſelves. <note n="*" place="bottom">Quaere, Whether Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s motto at all favors this opinion? It is taken from Rom. ix.xvi. <hi>It is not of him that willeth.</hi> That is, (if we attend to the words taken by themſelves, or in their connection) <hi>outward action</hi> is not of him that willeth. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he hath <hi>willed,</hi> and that the will is <hi>from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>—HIM <hi>that willeth.</hi> But he hath not power or opportunity to <hi>execute</hi> his will. <hi>Iſaac</hi> did really will to give the bleſſing to <hi>Eſau—Eſau</hi> did run for veniſon to obtain it. But the will of the one, and the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the other, were over-ruled.</note> External action on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is determimed by us. With what truth and propriety even this can be ſaid on Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſcheme, we truſt is ſufficiently manifeſt.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> Of GOD's being <hi>the Author of Sin,</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Scheme of neceſſity; and in what Senſe he admits this to be the Conſequence of his Doctrine.</head>
               <p>MR <hi>Edwards</hi> teacheth, 'That GOD, when he had made man, ſo ordered his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that <hi>from theſe circumſtances,</hi> together with the withholding divine influence and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his ſin <hi>infallibly followed.</hi>' And when it is aſked hereupon, 'why might not GOD as well have firſt made man with a fixed, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle of ſin in his heart?' Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> intimates in his anſwer, that GOD might indeed have done ſo; but adds, that if man had been thus made at firſt, 'it would not have been ſo <hi>viſible,</hi> that ſin did not ariſe from GOD, as the poſitive cauſe, and real ſource of it—that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>it was meet</hi> man ſhould not be made with ſin in his heart, that ſin might appear to ariſe from the imperfection of the creature, 'and not from GOD as the efficient or fountain.' He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows GOD to be the author of ſin in any ſenſe but being 'the <hi>agent,</hi> or <hi>actor</hi> of ſin, or <hi>doer</hi> of the wicked thing.' He 'diſpoſeth the ſtate of events in ſuch a manner, that ſin moſt certainly follows therefrom. In ſuch a ſenſe, I do not deny, that GOD is the author of ſin. It is no reproach for the moſt high to be thus the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin. In ſuch a manner GOD is the <hi>orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and diſpoſer</hi> of ſin, though not the <hi>actor</hi> of it, or <hi>doer</hi> of the wicked thing.' (Part iv. ſect. 9, 10. and p. 402, 408.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:011623_0076_0F8777DBE9FB8B18"/>Now how doth it appear, on theſe principles, that God is not the poſitive cauſe, and real ſource of moral evil? Every one perceives a difference between <hi>doing</hi> (or being the <hi>ſubject</hi> of) a wicked thing, and being the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> of it—Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> allows, that the moral turpitude lies wholly in the inward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity, and can no farther be applied to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal action, than as a vicious principle is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the ſource of it. If then we have no power of ſelf-determination in relation to the internal acts and exerciſes of the mind—if the only thing wherein human liberty conſiſts, is, a power of <hi>executing</hi> what is already willed—if volition ſprings not from man as the ſource, cauſe, or efficient of it—if he is only the <hi>ſubject,</hi> the <hi>doer,</hi> the <hi>actor</hi> of ſin—Who then is the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive cauſe and fountain</hi> of it? if not the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who but the creator? Every thing but the <hi>action</hi> or <hi>doing</hi> of wickedneſs, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> expreſly affirms GOD to be the author of, and ſaith it is no reproach to him. So that unleſs he would confound cauſe and effect—unleſs he would allow men to be 'the deſigning volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary cauſe of their own volitions;' (which he conſtantly denies) there is no evading the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that GOD is the ſource and fountain, the poſitive cauſe and efficient, of moral evil—yea, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſaith, that he 'deciſively or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all the volitions of moral agents by a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive influence'—(40.) which is nothing leſs than ſaying in expreſs terms, that he is the poſitive cauſe and efficient of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s notion of human liberty, as being exerciſed and concerned in <hi>outward</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only, in contradiſtinction from an inward power of ſelf-determination (or activity <hi>in voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:011623_0077_0F8777DD741A12E0"/>
—or liberty in the <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>will</hi>) if viewed in it's direct and immediate conſequences, we think muſt appear to ſubvert the very foundation of religion and morality. This appears to be the plain conſequence by his own principles. For he very juſtly obſerves, that 'the eſſence of all moral good or evil lies in the internal inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſpoſitions, volitions'—that as theſe 'are the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>outward</hi> actions, ſo the moral good or evil of ſuch actions doth not lie at all in the actions <hi>themſelves,</hi> which taken by themſelves are nothing of a moral nature; but in the <hi>internal</hi> inclinations and volitions which are the cauſe of them'—(276) that 'vice and virtue lie in the ſtate or frame of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and in this only'—that 'the very <hi>willing</hi> is the <hi>doing;</hi> when once a man has willed, the thing is performed, and nothing elſe remains to be done—that the will <hi>itſelf</hi> is the proper object of commands, as well as thoſe <hi>actions</hi> which are the <hi>effects</hi> of the will. It is manifeſt the <hi>ſoul</hi> only is properly and directly the ſubject of precepts or commands, that only being capable of receiving or perceiving them. The motions or ſtate of the <hi>body</hi> are matter of command only as they are <hi>ſubject</hi> to the ſoul, and connected with it's acts.' <note n="*" place="bottom">Part 3. Sect. 4. &amp; 5.</note> Now if <hi>inward</hi> freedom enters not into the notion of human liberty (33, 38, 39, 40, 131, 132, 189, 194, 213,—215, 234, 236, 256,—289, <hi>and paſſim.</hi>) then we are not free in that wherein lies the <hi>eſſence</hi> of virtue and vice: And if we are not free in this reſpect eſpecially, how are we free in any ſenſe that is of the leaſt importance? how can we be virtuous or vicious, if liberty (as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> grants) is neceſſary to moral good or evil? Yea, if we are not free with reſpect to the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:011623_0078_0F8777DD84B6D920"/>
thoughts, affections and purpoſes of our hearts, our inward inclinations and volitions, hath not Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſhewn undeniably that we cannot be free in regard to outward actions? 'If there be a ſeries of acts, the <hi>determining</hi> act is more eſpecially the ſubject of command—becauſe it is this act that determines the whole affair.' So that we are not at liberty in that which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the <hi>whole character.</hi> Nothing can be more futile than the evaſion, that 'the eſſence of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and vice lies in the <hi>nature</hi> of volition, not in the <hi>cauſe</hi>'—as if meer effects might be virtuous or vicious, and the cauſe that produceth them not ſo—Or ſuppoſing the cauſe (of a ſinful vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, for inſtance) to be vicious, as if the <hi>paſſive</hi> effect would be another and diſtinct wickedneſs. Beſides, if the ſubject of ſuch a volition, who is altogether paſſive herein, is vicious notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then how is liberty neceſſary to praiſe or blame? If he is vicious at all, he is ſo on account of the volition itſelf, and on this account only— Whether he has power or opportunity to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the volition, does not come into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER, outward actions being determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the will, and partaking of the nature of moral good or evil only with reference to their cauſe, viz. internal volition—how is <hi>this</hi> (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal volition) virtuous <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> in it's <hi>own nature,</hi> when the acts of the <hi>body</hi> are not? Volition hath a cauſe, a prior determiner, no leſs than external conduct. Why then are outward acts declared virtuous or vicious only with reference to their cauſe, while this is denied of volition? Hath every act of volition an antecedent, neceſſary
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011623_0079_0F8777DE1DB01CE8"/>
cauſe, which determineth not only volition, but, of conſequence, outward actions? And is not the virtue or vice of volition to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its cauſe, as much as the evil of external acts to the inward diſpoſition and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? 'Thus' Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s 'notion of liberty, conſiſting' in external freedom, 'is repugnant to itſelf, and ſhuts itſelf wholly out of the world.'</p>
               <p>WERE it indeed true, as Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally obſerves, (contrary to the general doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of his book, and his whole ſcheme) that we 'have command over our <hi>thoughts</hi>'—(p. 894) that 'the acts of the <hi>will</hi> are free'—that 'the <hi>ſoul</hi> has freedom'—(p. 116, 224) this might ſolve the difficulty, as it would be to make men the voluntary deſigning cauſe of thoſe inward acts wherein the nature of virtue and vice conſiſts. But, as before obſerved, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> conſtantly denies an inward principle, ſource, or power of activity—and blames thoſe divines who contend for the freedom of the ſoul <hi>in willing.</hi> He allows, that a man hath 'pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to move his body agreably to an antecedent act of choice, but not to uſe or exert the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his ſoul.' (p. 131) How then 'hath the ſoul a power of volition or choice?' (p. 39) of chuſing for inſtance, to move the body, when it hath not a power of exerting its own facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? How much more conſiſtent would it have been for Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> to have ſaid, that the will's determining is a <hi>neceſſary</hi> determining— for the ſoul to act <hi>neceſſarily</hi> is evermore to act neceſſarily?—(that is, the will does not determine, the ſoul does not act) than to ſay, 'the will's determining is a <hi>free</hi> determining—for the ſoul to act <hi>voluntarily</hi> is evermore to act <hi>electively'?</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:011623_0080_0F8777DEE9FBD938"/>
The will, the ſoul, may be <hi>acted upon,</hi> and have ſuch a volition or choice produced in it, <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,</hi> and as the <hi>effect,</hi> of ſome cauſe operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, <hi>deciding</hi> and <hi>determining</hi> the volition. What Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> calls the ſoul's <hi>voluntary, elective</hi> acts, are the effects of a cauſe indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on man. The acts and exerciſes of the human mind (if they may be called its acts) are owing not to any active power in the mind, to any thing within its power, but entirely to the energy of a neceſſary cauſe, which is prior to what are called its own acts. Volition is free or voluntary <hi>with a freedom of moral neceſſity</hi>— a neceſſity <hi>as abſolute as natural.</hi> And thus it is, that a man's heart comes to be wrong or right.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Edwards</hi> teacheth, that GOD 'orders the volitions of moral agents, among other events, with ſuch a <hi>deciſive</hi> diſpoſal, that the events are infallibly connected with his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal—that an univerſal, <hi>determining</hi> providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers an infallible, previous fixedneſs of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents—that GOD's own immediate conduct is firſt in the ſeries, and this alone unconnected with any thing preceeding—that he cauſeth the diſpoſition of the mind to be more in favour of ſuch acts'—(vicious no leſs than virtuous) 'or bringeth the mind more into view of powerful motives and inducements'—that all things are invariably ſettled—and 'neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all moral agents.' His ſcheme, upon the whole, appears to be nearly the ſame with that exhibited by the celebrated Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> an <hi>epicurean atheiſt,</hi> which we ſhall give the reader in his own words. 'There is a continued chain of neceſſary cauſes, fore-ordained, and pre-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011623_0081_0F8777DFA6636C50"/>
reaching from the original cauſe of all to every ſingle volition of every human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. While we act, we are, at the ſame time, acted upon. The ultimate author of all our volitions is the Creator of the world, who firſt beſtowed motion on this immenſe machine, and placed all beings in that poſition, whence eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſequent event, by an inevitable neceſſity, muſt reſult.'</p>
               <p>TO this ſcheme, Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> ſuppoſeth it will be objected in the following form. 'Human actions, therefore, either can have no moral turpitude at all, as proceeding from ſo good a cauſe; or if they have any turpitude, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve our Creator in the ſame guilt, while he is acknowledged to be their ultimate cauſe and author. Wherever a continued chain of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſes is fixed, that being, either finite or infinite, who produces the firſt, is likewiſe the author of all the reſt, and muſt both bear the blame, and acquire the praiſe, which belong to them. Our cleareſt and moſt unalterable ideas of morality eſtabliſh this rule upon unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reaſons, when we examine the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of any <hi>human</hi> action; and theſe reaſons muſt ſtill have greater force, when applied to the volitions and intentions of a being <hi>infinitely wiſe and powerful.</hi> Ignorance or impotence may be pleaded for ſo limited a creature as man; but thoſe imperfections have no place in our Creator He foreſaw, he ordained, he intended all thoſe actions of men, which we ſo raſhly pronounce criminal. And we muſt conclude, therefore, either that they are not criminal, or that the Deity, not man, is accountable for them. But as either of theſe poſitions is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011623_0082_0F8777E05BBDCA98"/>
and impious, it follows that the doctrine from which they are deduced cannot poſſibly be true, as being liable to all the ſame objections. An abſurd conſequence, if neceſſary, proves the original doctrine to be abſurd, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that criminal actions render criminal the original cauſe, if the connection between them be neceſſary and inevitable.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſays by <hi>David Hume,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THIS objection, which Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> ſtates to himſelf, may be made with the ſame propriety to the general ſcheme of our author. From Mr <hi>Hume</hi>'s anſwer, it is ſufficiently manifeſt what his principles were. He tells us, 'It is not poſſible to explain diſtinctly, how the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be the immediate cauſe of all the actions of men, without being the author of ſin and moral turpitude. Theſe are myſteries, <hi>which meer natural and unaſſiſted reaſon is very unfit to handle;</hi> and whatever ſyſtem it embraces it muſt find itſelf involved in inextricable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and even contradictions, at every ſtep which it takes with regard to ſuch ſubjects.'<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid p. 156.</note>
               </p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Hume</hi> acknowledgeth, that upon his ſcheme, the Deity is the <hi>mediate, original</hi> cauſe or all the actions of men; and virtually admits the conſequence; (that he is therefore the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin and moral turpitude) by obſerving, that it is not poſſible diſtinctly to explain, how he can be the one, and not the other. Now let it be ſhewn, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſcheme is not
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011623_0083_0F8777E1D9603B28"/>
liable to the foregoing objection, or admitting the objection, let the conſequence be ſhewn not to follow, and it will afford no ſmall ſatisfaction to many, who are greatly embarraſſed with Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſcheme or neceſſary connection. Whoever examines part ii. ſect. 3d, 4th, 9th, 12th, and 13th. Part iii. ſect. 3d, 4th, and 6th. Part iv. ſect. 9th and 10th, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of his diſcourſe, muſt, we are perſuaded, ſee the objection, as above ſtated, to be juſt— And if the conſequence alſo be fairly drawn, doth it not prove the doctrine againſt which the objection lies to be falſe and abſurd? abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irreconcilable with the moral character of GOD?</p>

               <p>HAVING taken notice of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine, in aſſerting GOD to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin, except that he is not 'the <hi>actor</hi> of it, or <hi>doer</hi> of the wicked thing; and the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which ſuch a doctrine <hi>needed,</hi> that 'the eſſence of a ſinful volition is in its nature, not in its <hi>cauſe</hi>'; the next advance he makes, in order to reconcile the exiſtence of ſin with the divine choice and determination, in the invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity or it, is, that moral evil is <hi>beſt</hi> for the world—that therefore 'an infinitely wiſe being, who always chuſes what is beſt, muſt chuſe there ſhould be ſuch a thing'—that this is not chuſing what is properly evil upon the whole, becauſe 'of the great good which is the conſequence of ſin, for the ſake' of which GOD is ſuppoſed to 'will ſin.' He therefore aſſerts, that 'moral evil is not of <hi>a bad, but good ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>'—that 'the coming to paſs of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual act of ſin is truly, all things conſidered, agreable to infinite wiſdom and goodneſs.' (Part iv. ſect. 9th.)</p>
               <p>FOR all this he quotes with approbation Dr. <hi>Turnbull,</hi> againſt whom he had before wrote and publiſhed part of an elaborate volume.
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011623_0085_0F8777E29AFAC4D0"/>
When it is aſked, <hi>Whence comes evil?</hi> this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman denies the hypotheſis, and anſwers, <hi>'There is no evil in the univerſe.</hi> What! is there no miſery, no vice in the world? or are not theſe <hi>evils?</hi> Evils indeed they are; that is, thoſe of one ſort are hurtful, and thoſe of the other ſort are equally hurtful and abominable; But they are <hi>not</hi> evil or miſchievous with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the <hi>whole.</hi> The evil which happens is requiſite to the <hi>greater good.'</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT GOD may, and does many times, overrule things ſo, as to bring good out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil, we deny not. From the apoſtacy of mankind, he hath taken occaſion to manifeſt <hi>the exceeding riches of his grace.</hi> He alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently improves vicious and profligate ſinners (beſide, and contrary to, their own intention) as inſtruments of great and general good. But doth it therefore follow, that profligate wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not of bad, but good <hi>tendency?</hi> That every individual act of it is agreable to perfect wiſdom and goodneſs, and beſt for the world?</p>
               <p>'THOUGH the conſtitution of our nature, from whence we are capable of vice and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may, as it undoubtedly does, contribute to the perfection and happineſs of the world; and though the actual permiſſion of evil may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to it: (that is, it would have been more miſchievous, not that a wicked perſon had <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> abſtained from his own wickedneſs, <hi>but that any one had forcibly prevented it,</hi> than that it was permitted:) Yet notwithſtanding, it might have been much better for the world, if this very evil had never been done. Nay, it is moſt clearly conceivable, that the very commiſſion
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011623_0086_0F8777E93A5891B8"/>
of wickedneſs may be beneficial to the world, and yet, that it would be infinitely more beneficial for men to refrain from it. For thus, in the wiſe and good conſtitution of the natural world, there are diſorders which bring their own cures; diſeaſes, which are themſelves remedies. Many a man would have died, had it not been for the gout or a fever; yet it would be thought madneſs to aſſert, that ſickneſs is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or a more perfect ſtate than health; though the like, with regard to the moral world, has been aſſerted.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>GOD's law, originally given to man, was doubtleſs good and perfect. It was doubtleſs agreable to perfect wiſdom and goodneſs, that he ſhould yield a ſteady and uniform obedience to it. Thus he would have glorified his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, anſwered the end of his being, and provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his own higheſt happineſs. But ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing moral evil to be no evil upon the whole, but a great good, ſuch conſequences as theſe will follow. That the law given to man at firſt was imperfect—that it was better, all things conſidered, that the divine law (the law of man's nature) ſhould be broke than kept—that GOD threatned diſobedience with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of death, and yet choſe man ſhould rebel, 'for the ſake of the great good conſequent on ſin'—that the ends of infinite wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could be anſwered, no poſſible way deviſed to advance the <hi>higheſt happineſs</hi> of the intelligent creation, but by the entrance of <hi>infinite evil</hi> into the world—that the revolt of men and angels was in compliance with the end of their being,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011623_0087_0F8777EA08A14250"/>
and the wiſe and gracious intention of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor—(and if ſo, 'why did not GOD make them at firſt with a fixed prevailing principle of ſin?') Yea, it follows, that intemperance, debauchery, oppreſſion, murther, malice, envy, all the luſts of the fleſh and ſpirit, greatly conduce to the good of the world, and are perfectly agreable to the wiſe and good governor of it. What obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations do mankind owe to drunkards and gluttons, to fornicators and adulterers, to the fraudulent and oppreſſors, to thieves and liars, and falſe ſwearers, to robbers and murtherers, and all that great multitude, whom the faithful and true witneſs hath expreſsly excluded from the heavenly Jeruſalem, and conſigned to one common lake of fire and brimſtone! <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xxi 8 and xxii 15.</note> Which judgment according to truth the world have been wont to teſtify their approbation of in their treatment of ſuch perſons—that is, their greateſt benefactors! Baſe ingratitude!</p>
               <p>HOW ſin came to be permitted is more than we can comprehend. To ſay it could not have been prevented is ſaying more than any one knows. To ſay that' GOD choſe it, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the will of the creature to it, is impious, even ſuppoſing it is in fact followed with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good, than otherwiſe would have been— which ſuppoſition is, however, but meer conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at beſt, and without any ſolid foundation. For unleſs we can tell what would have been had ſin never entered the world, it is impoſſible we ſhould be able to judge, by way of compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of the greater good conſequent upon it; or be able to ſay, that it was beſt upon the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:011623_0088_0F8777EB948D5A40"/>
whole. From the miſeries of it, which we ſee and feel, we have no ſpecial reaſon to infer its ſuperior advantages, and good tendency. And notwithſtanding the infinite reaſon we have to receive it as <hi>a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that JESUS CHRIST came into the world to ſave ſinners;</hi> yet that he came to reſtore mankind to a <hi>better</hi> ſtate than they would have been raiſed to, had they never ſinned, is more than we have yet learned from the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>BE this as it will: Suppoſe it to be indeed true, that the conſequence of ſin is the greater good of the univerſe, it will not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that GOD muſt chuſe and determine it. If an apoſtle ſuppoſed their damnation to be juſt, who do evil with a view to greater good; ſhall we venture to impute any thing like this to GOD? Suppoſe (in the inſtances Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> brings) <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren had foreſeen the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> of their treatment of him, would this have juſtified their conduct, and rendered it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious?—what as wiſe and good men they muſt have choſe? (p. 374, 375) The ſame queſtion, on the ſame ſuppoſition, offers itſelf in relation to the murderers of our Savior. To ſay that GOD wills evil for the ſake of its good tendency, is a reproach to an holy and good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who cannot chuſe moral evil at all—any more than a man of reaſon and conſcience can chuſe what he knows to be ſinful, from the cleareſt proſpect of great publick advantage. The moral Governor of the world will purſue the happineſs of it, in ſuch ways, and by ſuch means only, as are juſt and holy. And we might with more propriety ſuppoſe, he will not
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011623_0089_0F8777EBA0D18510"/>
take care of the happineſs of his creatures at all, than that he doth this by chuſing ſin as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſure means of the greateſt good. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>To admit that any created being can act in a manner contrary to what it does, or fulfil any other end, is tantamount, ſaith Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> to allowing it to be independent of the Deity; and conſequently, to have it in its election and power to thwart the ſchemes of the great author and ſuperintendent of all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His anſwerer very juſtly replies, 'All this is nothing but ſuppoſing it a contradiction that GOD ſhould endue the human <hi>mind,</hi> or any creature, with liberty of action. For if liberty is a perfection poſſible to be communicated to any creature, it follows from the nature of the thing, that it muſt be in the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>election</hi> of the <hi>ágent,</hi> to act in a manner <hi>contrary to what it does,</hi> and <hi>to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil another end.</hi> But this liberty does not at all infer that man is <hi>independent</hi> of the <hi>Deity;</hi> any more than the power of breaking human laws infers that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are independent of their governors. Man is ever ſubject to the providential government of GOD, and accountable to him for his actions; and, as he does good or evil to himſelf or others, is liable to receive rewards or puniſhments. This ſufficiently ſhews the <hi>dependency</hi> of man upon GOD; and as much ſo, as if his actions were <hi>neceſſary.</hi> For as in the latter caſe, he would <hi>depend</hi> upon GOD as an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> only in the hands of an agent; or, as the inanimate creation <hi>depends</hi> upon him, meerly as a machine upon the framer and director of it; ſo in the former caſe he depends upon GOD as a <hi>moral</hi> governor, who ſuperintends his actions, and from whom he has reaſon to expect to be recompenſed according to his work—And no power whatſoever can deliver him out of GOD's hands. Is ſuch a creature then <hi>independent of GOD?</hi> On the contrary, as his ſubjection to GOD's providential government and final judgment is the greateſt, ſo it is the only <hi>dependency</hi> which a <hi>rational</hi> creature as ſuch can be under unto GOD.</p>
                     <p>NOR again, if it any conſequence of liberty, that man will have it in his <hi>election</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to <hi>thwart the ſchemes,</hi> and <hi>reſiſt the will</hi> of the great author of his being—For, ſuppoſing <hi>human liberty,</hi> it muſt be ſuppoſed from the nature of it, that the <hi>will</hi> of GOD, and the ſcheme of his government formed by it, is a <hi>moral</hi> providence and ſuperintendency, like that of a <hi>rational</hi> monarch over his ſubjects, who gives them laws, enjoining obedience to them, and eſtabliſhing them with the ſanction of rewards and puniſhments. It is the <hi>will</hi> of GOD, that we ſhould <hi>act freely,</hi> and have it in our power either <hi>to do</hi> or <hi>not do</hi> his commandments, that he may appear to be a <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> governor, by rewarding thoſe who <hi>chuſe</hi> to do: at which is <hi>right and good,</hi> and by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thoſe who <hi>wilfully</hi> commit <hi>evil.'

vindication of the doctines of the New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land churches,' (p. 19) has exhibited 'a new ſcheme of religion,' which he apprehended was prevailing, in oppoſition to thoſe doctrines— Mentioning 'this fundamental principle' of the new ſcheme, <hi>'That the happineſs of the creature is the ſole end of the creation,'</hi> the worthy Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent remarks, <hi>'This</hi> naturally leads to <hi>moſt, if not all,</hi> of the reſt' (meaning all the other errors of the new ſcheme of divinity.) 'For this muſt be the <hi>ſole</hi> rule of all GOD's conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and of ours towards him; and it is certain, that GOD's <hi>ſole end</hi> and ultimate deſign can never be fruſtrated.'

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath ſaid upon the diſtinction between <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>moral neceſſity,</hi> we cannot but think this 'diſtinction altogether impertinent in the preſent controverſy.' For 'that which is neceſſary, is neceſſary, muſt be, and cannot be prevented.' If there be a real neceſſity on the mind in all its acts, it is quite immaterial whether this neceſſity, by which the mind is in every inſtance determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, be called natural or moral. Whether will and endeavour is overcome by external, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; or whether ſuch a ſtate of the will or ſoul is produced by ſome neceſſary cauſe, extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic or intrinſic, amounts to much the ſame thing in the end. There is exactly the ſame propriety in ſaying, that ſuch a thing <hi>cannot</hi> be done, is <hi>impoſſible, unavoidable, neceſſary,</hi> &amp;c, where there is a <hi>moral</hi> inability to it, as in applying theſe epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets to a <hi>phyſical</hi> inability: For if the act of the mind, on which the natural act depends, be for ever impoſſible, the natural act muſt be alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible—unleſs it be ſaid, that it is <hi>poſſible</hi> an effect may be produced without a cauſe. What Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath ſaid to ſhew, that natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:011623_0093_0F8777F02596E8D8"/>
which are determined by the mind, are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when the determination of the mind <hi>itſelf</hi> reſpecting them is forever impoſſible, is unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, and unintelligible to us. If no being can chuſe or act otherwiſe than he doth, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive of a neceſſity more abſolute; and ſuch is the neceſſity maintained by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>— only he approves not the terms <hi>natural neceſſity,</hi> and thinks the word <hi>certainty</hi> more proper— While he aſſerts all events to be <hi>morally</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry—and that in things thus neceſſary there is a 'connection <hi>prior</hi> and <hi>ſuperior</hi> to will and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.' (294.)</p>
               <p>AFTER all that hath been ſaid, <hi>moral neceſſity</hi> is, properly ſpeaking, <hi>natural neceſſity; moral</hi> power is <hi>natural</hi> power. The one is as <hi>original</hi> to us as the other. The latter is interwoven in our frame no otherwiſe than the former. The moral faculty, or power, which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſaith belongs to moral agency, is a natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or power. So that whatever moral capacity or incapacity is attributed to mankind, the ſame is natural. If man is a law to himſelf it is <hi>by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> that he is ſo, having the work of the law written on his heart. And as to the inability of man, Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> we preſume, believed this to be derived from <hi>nature</hi>—to have it's ſource in 'the want of original righteouſneſs, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the whole nature.' Now an inability which has it's ſource in the very <hi>nature</hi> of man may ſurely be called a <hi>natural</hi> inability.</p>
               <p>MUCH hath been ſaid to ſhew, that every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral event muſt have an anſwerable cauſe. Be it ſo. Every ſuch event muſt then have a <hi>moral</hi> cauſe. And whether any other than an <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011623_0094_0F8777F0DBCC41B8"/>
mind</hi> can be ſuch a cauſe, let thoſe who have common underſtanding judge. If it be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that a moral cauſe muſt be a moral agent, then it will follow, that we are the cauſes of our own volitions, or that our maker is the cauſe of them. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> denies the firſt—therefore our volitions are to be attributed to GOD as their proper cauſe. But however this might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of <hi>holy</hi> volitions, we cannot think it will be admitted of <hi>ſinful</hi> ones. And if not, what regard ſhould be had to a doctrine of which this is the direct conſequence? We are ſelf-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or determined by the deity. If there be any difference between a <hi>cauſe,</hi> and a meer <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,</hi> the former denotes a mind that hath wiſdom, power &amp;c, in a greater or leſs degree, according to the effects aſcribed to it. And if moral events, through a chain of ſecond cauſes, centre in the deity, as natural effects do, what is this but running up morals to <hi>mechaniſm?</hi> any pains Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath taken to avoid ſuch an imputation on his ſcheme notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>IN our author's ſcheme, neceſſity is <hi>univerſal.</hi> The divine will is always determined by it, and the will of every creature. Now GOD is either the author of this neceſſity, to which he himſelf is ſubject, or he is not. If he is, then all the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ects of it are to be aſcribed to him as their proper cauſe. If he is not, then there is ſome cauſe <hi>prior</hi> to the <hi>firſt</hi> cauſe, binding and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining him— he is cauſed to determine as he doth by ſomething <hi>extrinſic</hi> (For to ſay he is determined by ſometning <hi>intrinſic,</hi> is to ſay he is <hi>ſelf-determined</hi>—contrary to ſuppoſition.) His being and volitions are <hi>effects</hi> as much as thoſe of finite creatures. That neceſſity, which is
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011623_0095_0F8777F19B659490"/>
ſaid to be the cauſe of every determination of the divine will, the cauſe and ground of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence and perfections, is prior, by ſuppoſition, to his exiſtence and volitions. And this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity muſt be determined by ſomething preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo on. Yea, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> makes expreſs mention of the <hi>cauſe</hi> of moral neceſſity—and ſays, that the cauſe of this neceſſity is equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as of natural. That is, there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary cauſe of this cauſe, and ſo on <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Thus we are run back far into non-entity, and have to enquire, By what cauſe the firſt cauſe exiſts—which cauſe is an effect in relation to ſomething preceeding, and this an effect with relation to ſomething ſtill preceeding, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> And if ſomething exterior and prior to the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty determines him, what is this but affirming him to be the almighty miniſter of <hi>fate?</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath expreſſed his diſinclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to fataliſm, (in which we doubt not his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity) we think his reaſoning is plainly on the ſide of abſolute fatality; and ſuppoſe he was caught in his own ſubtilty. Upon his ſcheme it follows, that the actions of all finite beings are the agency of the Deity; and his is not properly ſpeaking <hi>agency,</hi> but <hi>inſtrumentality</hi>— a ſubjection to blind neceſſity and fate. There is no ſelf-mover, ſelf-direction, ſelf-determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſource of activity, in the univerſe. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is baniſhed out of the world—and the world muſt have been eternal.</p>
               <p>WHETHER GOD could have acted otherwiſe than he hath? is a curious rather than profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enquiry. And as to the notion' of 'fitneſs of things, independent of the things themſelves, and without reference to the ſovereign mind,'
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:011623_0096_0F8777F2E6551470"/>
it is difficult even to imagine it; to ſay nothing of the impiety implied in ſuch a thought.</p>
               <p>WE have repreſented what we apprehend is the plain tendency, and indeed only conſiſtent ſenſe, of the ſcheme of neceſſity before us. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was copied from Mr. <hi>Hume, Hobbs, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noza,</hi> or any of the old heathen Philoſophers we do not ſay. We hint the thing becauſe of a remarkable coincidence we have exhibited at the cloſe of theſe remarks, in ſome extracts from them, ſet over againſt ſimilar paſſages of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book. Though we have a right to renew valid objections, how oft ſoever they have been made before, until ſome tolerable anſwer is given to them (eſpecially when the old doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, to which the like objections were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, but not anſwered, are received.) Yet we would not repeat the charge, without giving a ſpecimen in ſupport of it. We really are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that there can be no poſſible confutation of fataliſm on the principles of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book. He ſpeaks with ſatisfaction of the progreſs of <hi>metaphyſic ſcience;</hi> (325) of which and its 'ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible doings,' his own book, among others on fatality, is an alarming proof. [<hi>Epicurus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> reminds us, was 'the father of <hi>atheiſm and licentiouſneſs,' David Hume,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of modern epicuriſm: And whoever hath read his eſſays and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s enquiry is better able to judge than one can from the few ſelect paſſages we have extracted, of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them.]</p>
               <p>NOT that we ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſaw, or allowed, the tendency and conſequences of his ſcheme to be ſuch as we have here repreſented;
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:011623_0097_0F8777F3559905B0"/>
he hath repeatedly declared the contrary. Still if the conſequences are fairly deduced—if in thoſe paſſages wherein he profeſſes himſelf a friend to liberty he is either repugnant to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or allows no liberty that is of any moment, or not connected with moral agency—let any man of reaſon ſay, whether his ſcheme can be ſafe. His doctrine of neceſſary connection, if plainly reducible to the conſequences we have mentioned, if conſiſtent with itſelf only in that ſenſe we have taken it, will be rejected by all who have a due regard to the moral perfections of GOD, for which we doubt not in the leaſt but Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had a ſupreme veneration. But great and good men are not always wiſe.</p>
               <p>IT is very much Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s method to anſwer objections by endeavouring to reduce the ſcheme of his adverſaries to the ſame abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; which, though it be a good argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> is by no means ſatisfactory. We might have expected ſome other anſwer in particular to the objections <hi>of the fate of the heathen,</hi> Hobbs<hi>'s neceſſity, making men machines, making GOD the author of ſin,</hi> as well as other objections, than he hath given. But as we may preſume Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> gave what appeared to him the beſt anſwer to theſe and ſuch like objections to the doctrine of neceſſity; ſo we conclude from his known ſkill in the ſubject, no ſolid anſwer can be given to theſe objections; otherwiſe he would have favoured the world with ſuch an anſwer, inſtead of evaſive ones. Though we will allow he might think thoſe anſwers to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections ſolid, which we muſt take the liberty to call evaſive.</p>

We know of none, who have contended for the freedom of the will, that have uſed the term will in this abſtracted ſenſe. This curious diſtinction (made to ſhew, that there it not liberty in the will) was not ſufficiently attended to by our author. For through his book, the term will is generally uſed to denote the ſoul, the man, the agent, the mind. He ſpeaks of the will's <hi>acts,</hi> and ſaith, The will is the proper object of <hi>commands, &amp;c.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> would not ſay, that a property acts, or is the object of command, &amp;c.</note> or to any particular faculty: The proper queſtion is, Whether there be <hi>internal</hi> liberty in moral agents, or <hi>moral</hi> liberty in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction

from <hi>natural?</hi> whether there be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the <hi>mind,</hi> or <hi>ſoul?</hi> If it can be ſhewn, that the mind or ſoul is free, it is to very little purpoſe to enquire, in what particular faculty of the agent freedom lies; or whether in any one faculty excluſively, or eſpecially. Such an enquiry cannot be very edifying. Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians may think it a fit ſubject of ſpeculation; but to common ſenſe it appears frivolous. The ſimple notion of liberty we ſhall argue for, is this, that <hi>mankind have inward moral freedom</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Some have ſuppoſed, that <hi>ſpontaneous animal motion</hi> proves liberty. But though this may be an evidence of ſuch kind of liberty as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> allows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to moral agents, yet we think it ſuggeſts not the idea of <hi>internal, moral</hi> liberty—the only liberty which properly belongs to the ſubject of religion and morals.</note>— a power of <hi>ſelf-determination.</hi> (Not meaning by ſelf-determination ſuch a power in 'the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or faculty of <hi>will,'</hi> but in the <hi>agent.</hi>) It may otherwiſe be called an inward principle or power of <hi>activity.</hi> That ſuch a power belongs to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents, particularly to mankind, is what we ſhall endeavour to evince; without endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtate the exact <hi>meaſure</hi> in which it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, or within what <hi>ſphere</hi> exerciſed by them. In ſome it may be in greater perfection, in others leſs. But ſome degree of it is eſſential to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agency. At leaſt all moral agents, during
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:011623_0101_0F8775B6E0663C38"/>
their probation, poſſeſs it in ſome meaſure and degree.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Edwards,</hi> as hath been ſhewn, denies all ſelf-determining power, and inward liberty—aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, that '<hi>every</hi> determination of the will in chuſing and refuſing is neceſſary.' (p 111, 113) But that an inward principle of activity, and power of volition or choice, belongs to mankind, we think is in a manner ſelf-evident. For it is granted on all hands, that moral good and evil lie in the ſtate of the mind, or prevailing internal diſpoſition of the agent. Liberty therefore, if at all neceſſary to virtue and vice, muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in that wherein the <hi>nature</hi> of morality and religion conſiſts—that is, in the inward man. A freedom from <hi>external conſtraint</hi> is a liberty belonging to fools and madmen, and to the brute creatures. Theſe, therefore, are as capable of virtue and vice, praiſe and blame, as beings endowed with, and in the exerciſe of reaſon, if this external (hypothetical) liberty is the only thing neceſſary to moral agency. Fools, madmen, and brutes, if they are not bound or impriſoned, have natural liberty. They have a power, faculty, or property called <hi>will.</hi> Their actions are as voluntary (in many reſpects) as thoſe of mankind, who are of a found under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding The actions of brutes proceed from inclination and deſign—an inclination and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign proceeding from nature, or internal, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal bias.</p>
               <p>IF then an action's being <hi>voluntary</hi> (in the ſenſe of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book) makes it virtuous or vicious, the lower animals are ſo as really as intelligent creatures. As we are not accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:011623_0102_0F8775B7A1BD0238"/>
to talk of virtuous or vicious herds of cattle, the epithets, as applied to them, may ſound ſomething odd and harſh at firſt; but by the help of metaphyſics we may in time be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to ſuch language. We are not, indeed, to ſuppoſe our oxen and horſes are morally good or bad in thoſe actions of theirs which are againſt their wills—to which they are externally <hi>impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>—Or in regard to any inſtances of forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which are owing to external <hi>impediment</hi>— to which they have a will, and endeavour to perform, but are hindered from doing as they would. But the caſes of <hi>coaction</hi> and <hi>reſtraint</hi> excepted, let it be ſhewn, on the preſent hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, that they are not proper ſubjects of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or blame, reward or puniſhment—and by the ſame arguments we preſume it may be ſhewn, that mankind are not. If power or opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>execute</hi> a will or choice already produced by ſome extrinſic cauſe, be all that is meant by liberty, or that is neceſſary to moral agency, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is perfectly <hi>ideal,</hi> and the controverſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it is about a meer <hi>word.</hi> But if liberty be <hi>really</hi> eſſential to moral agency, as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> admits; and if there cannot be liberty of acting or conducting farther than there is liberty of willing, chuſing, preferring, as hath been ſhewn—the plain conſequence is, that liberty in the <hi>mind</hi> is eſſential to moral agency. Upon Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſcheme of liberty, it is not for the acts and exerciſes of their minds that men are accountable, but only for their outward actions. There is no moral turpitude in ſuch a ſtate of the ſoul or will as our Saviour deſcribes, <hi>Matt.</hi> v. 28, 32, but only in the <hi>execution</hi> of ſuch a diſpoſition. We know, indeed, that Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> intended not to aſſert any ſuch thing as
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:011623_0103_0F8775B861111E50"/>
this, that malice, envy, pride, impure deſires, &amp;c. are innocent until they become effects: But is not this the conſequence of his allowing, that liberty is neceſſary to moral agency, while he makes this liberty conſiſt only in a power a man hath to <hi>execute</hi> his will. If Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to aſſert the above conſequence, (as it is plain he did not) then in the enquiry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the liberty of man conſiſts, ſomething farther is to be conſidered than material action—There muſt be internal liberty, if liberty enters into the notion of a praiſe-worthy deed, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The proper queſtion, is, <hi>Whether we have and exerciſe liberty in that wherein the nature of virtue and vice conſiſts?</hi> And one might think this would not be made a queſtion.</p>
               <p>TO ſay that the mind is neceſſarily determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all its acts, is making mankind neceſſary agents in <hi>that</hi> thing which diſtinguiſheth them from the inferior creatures. Without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral liberty, it is plain their actions cannot be of a moral nature, any more than thoſe can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led naturally free actions, which proceed from natural neceſſity. Abridge a man's natural li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ever ſo much, his moral freedom may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; and if it doth, the willing or unwilling mind is rewardable or puniſhable. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſuppoſe moral liberty taken away, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, never to have been poſſeſſed, and there is an utter incapacity of moral action. <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>DR. <hi>Clark,</hi> (in his 'demonſtration of the being and attributes of GOD,' (tenth edition p. 83, 86) has argued the <hi>poſſibility</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> of the communication of liberty to man in the following clear and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive manner. 'As a power of beginning motion, is not <hi>in itſelf</hi> an impoſſible thing; becauſe it muſt of neceſſity <hi>be</hi> in the ſupreme cauſe: So neither is it impoſſible to be <hi>communicated</hi> to created beings. The reaſon is plain: Becauſe no powers are impoſſible to be communicated, but only thoſe which imply <hi>ſelf-exiſtence,</hi> and abſolute <hi>indepedency</hi>—I know, the maintainers of fate are very confident, that a power of beginning motion, is nothing leſs than being really independent, or being able to act inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently from any ſuperior cauſe. But this is only a childiſh trifling with words: For a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of acting independently <hi>in this ſenſe,</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated at the pleaſure of the ſupreme cauſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued only during the ſame good pleaſure, is no more real and abſolute independency, than the power of <hi>exiſting</hi>—or than the power of <hi>being conſcious,</hi> or <hi>any other power</hi> whatſoever, can be ſaid to imply <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</hi> In reality, it is altogether as hard to conceive, how <hi>conſciouſneſs,</hi> or the power of <hi>perception,</hi> ſhould be communicated to a created being, as how the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>ſelf-motion</hi> ſhould be ſo—Yet no man doubts, but that he himſelf, and all others, have truly a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>perception.</hi> And therefore in like manner (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hard it may be to conceive, as to the <hi>manner</hi> of it; yet ſince, as has been now proved, it can never be ſhown to be impoſſible and expreſly contradictory, that a power of <hi>ſelf-motion</hi> ſhould be communicated.) I ſuppoſe no conſidering man can doubt, but that he actually has alſo a power of <hi>ſelf-motion.</hi> For the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from continual <hi>experience</hi> and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to prove that we <hi>have</hi> ſuch a power, are ſo ſtrong, that nothing leſs than a ſtrict demonſtration that the thing is abſolutely impoſſible, and implies an expreſs contradiction, can make us in the leaſt doubt that we have it not. We have all the ſame experience, the ſame marks and evidence exactly of our having real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a power of <hi>ſelf-motion;</hi> as the moſt rigid fataliſt could poſſibly contrive to require, if he was to make the <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> of a man's being endued with that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. There is no one thing that ſuch a man can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine <hi>ought</hi> to follow from the ſuppoſition of <hi>ſelf-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which every man does not now as much feel and <hi>actually</hi> experience in himſelf, as it can poſſibly be imagined any man <hi>would</hi> do, ſuppoſing the thing were true. Wherefore to affirm, notwithſtanding all this, that the ſpirits, by which a man moves the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, and ranges the thoughts of his mind, are themſelves moved wholly by air or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tler matter inſpired into the body; and that again by other external matter, and ſo on; as the wheels of a clock are moved by the weights, and thoſe weights by gravitation, and ſo on; without a man's having the leaſt power, by any <hi>principle within himſelf,</hi> to think any one thought, or impel his own ſpirits in order to move any member of his body: All this is ſo contrary to experience and the reaſon of things, that unleſs the idea of <hi>ſelf-motion</hi> were in itſelf as evidently and clearly a <hi>contradiction,</hi> as that two and two ſhould make five, a man ought to, be aſhamed to talk at that rate. Nay, a man of any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of modeſty, would even in that caſe be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tempted rather to doubt the truth of his facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than take upon him to aſſert one ſuch intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abſurdity, merely for the avoiding of another. There are ſome indeed, who denying men the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>beginning motion,</hi> would yet ſeem in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to account for their actions, by allowing them a power of <hi>determining</hi> motion. But this alſo is a mere ludicrous trifling with words. For if that power of <hi>determining</hi> motion, be no other in a man, than that which is in a ſtone to reflect a ball <hi>one certain way,</hi> this is juſt nothing at all. But if he has a power of determining the motion of his ſpirits <hi>any way,</hi> as he himſelf pleaſes; this is in all reſpects the very ſame as <hi>the power of beginning motion.'</hi>

<pb n="93" facs="unknown:011623_0105_0F8775BA8691CB10"/>
This moral diſcernment, it is allowed, is the principal power that diſtinguiſheth us from the brute creation: In reſpect of this our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker having taught us more than the beaſts of
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011623_0106_0F8775BB2CE09DF0"/>
the field, and made us wiſer than the fowls of heaven: In reſpect of this man is <hi>by nature a law to himſelf, having the work of the law written on his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:011623_0107_0F8775BC9746F048"/>THAT we have a power of deliberating, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preferring, will not be diſputed, being mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or experience. The perception of right and wrong, good and ill-deſert, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> juſtly obſerves, 'is one of the firſt ideas children have.'
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:011623_0108_0F8775BCDE81D850"/>
This faculty approves ſome actions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns others, detached from the conſideration of their effects and conſequences. The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of our minds, our thoughts, affections, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, are the object of this faculty, no leſs than the conduct they lead to. Yea, for theſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially (if not only) it approves or condemns us, as theſe are the foundation of life and conduct. In cenſuring or commending the conduct of others, we go upon a ſuppoſition of intelligence and deſign: For we judge very differently of the ſame actions as performed by an ideot, or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and by one in poſſeſſion of reaſon. And when it appears that an action proceeded not from deſign, or that a different and contrary purpoſe was intended from what is actually ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, our opinion of it is changed. We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove good intentions, and condemn evil ones, in ourſelves, (and in others ſo far as ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions can be known) though evil comes of what was meant for good, <hi>and vice verſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW our eſtimating the moral character from internal diſpoſitions is on a ſuppoſition that <hi>theſe</hi> are within the power of the agent. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall <hi>execute</hi> his will or not, depends not on himſelf. He may be hindered herefrom, or compelled to do contrary to his will—which alters not the internal character. If we are made the means or inſtruments of what we do not intend, or are externally hindered from what we do intend, we are judged according to what we <hi>would</hi> have done. The reaſon is, that we have internal liberty in many inſtances, when we have not external. It is therefore much more proper to ſay, that natural neceſſity, in any ſuppoſed caſe, though it excuſeth an external
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:011623_0109_0F8775BFDF2B9958"/>
act, or the omiſſion of ſuch an act, yet hinders not but the ſtate of the will may be right or wrong in ſuch caſe; than to ſay, that moral neceſſity is conſiſtent with praiſe or blame, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not attended with natural neceſſity.</hi> We are condemned or approved of ourſelves for a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or unwilling mind, and have a natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that the judgment of GOD will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond our own. But did ever any man commend or accuſe himſelf for what he knew to be neceſſary and unavoidable—not within his power, or not determined by himſelf? The inward perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vicious men feel proceeds from a convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they might have cultivated another frame of heart. If external conſtraint, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neceſſity, renders a perſon incapable of ſuch commands as reſpect <hi>material</hi> action, moral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or internal conſtraint, muſt render him equally incapable of ſuch commands as reſpect the exerciſes of the <hi>mind,</hi> or acts of volition— (admitting this to be <hi>original,</hi> and not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of internal liberty abuſed.) We are ſaid to be the 'voluntary, deſigning cauſes of corporeal action.' Be it ſo, 'the eſſence of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and vice lies not in their cauſe.' And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in a ſeries of acts, connected and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the praiſe or blame is to be attributed to the original act. But of this (which determines all the reſt) we are not the voluntary cauſes. (p. 48, 284, 256) To return from this ſhort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
               <p>THE moral capacity we have been ſpeaking of, including moral obligation undeniably proves the internal liberty of mankind. As it implies a rule or guide of life, with authority and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as we have an inward perception of good
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:011623_0110_0F8775C1627AE780"/>
or ill-deſert, according as we have followed, or departed from, the direction of this leading principle; ſo we could not perceive ourſelves to be under it as a <hi>law,</hi> and reproach ourſelves for diſobedience, were we fully perſuaded ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience was a matter of real neceſſity. We experience, that 'our happineſs or miſery is not our <hi>fate</hi>'—Meaning here by theſe terms, not ſo much that kind of happineſs or miſery which depends on a man's <hi>outward</hi> condition and circumſtances, as that which we ſignify by the words, <hi>peace, ſerenity,</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> of heart, on the one hand; and <hi>diſquietude</hi> of mind, <hi>vexation or anguiſh</hi> of ſpirit on the other. <hi>The good man is ſatiſfied from himſelf. The wicked is like the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt.</hi> Theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and oppoſite ſenſations, which conſtitute our chief happineſs or miſery in this world, and are accompanied more or leſs with hope or fear for futurity, it is impoſſible we ſhould have, were we not internally free. We may ſuppoſe them to be as ſtrong in thoſe who are wholly depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of external freedom, as in thoſe who are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed of it. So that however external ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity may wholly prevent our being rewarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or puniſhable for the outward action, it by no means doth for the inward diſpoſition, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided this depends on ourſelves. Hence the injunction, <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the iſſues of life.</hi> It is in the power of <hi>man</hi> to lay any external neceſſity upon us, but no internal one. No chains can bind the ſoul but thoſe of our own impoſing. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, priſoner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be as free, in the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſenſe, as any man. A perſon wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his bodily powers of action may yet be free in the nobleſt ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:011623_0111_0F8775C21FE089A8"/>WE ſhall now proceed to ſhew, that internal liberty, in finite beings placed upon trial, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an opportunity and capacity of <hi>chuſing and acting otherwiſe than they in fact do. Finite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> we ſay; becauſe we pretend not to know what the perfect liberty of the <hi>Infinite</hi> Being is 'So far as we are <hi>free,</hi> we are not <hi>neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,</hi> ſo that we could not but make the choice we do.'</p>
               <p>WHETHER the holy angels ever had a moral ability of falling, we need not enquire; though we have no ground to determine the contrary. Beings made upright, we know, have revoked. Now if the malignity of apoſtate ſpirits againſt GOD, their unalterable oppoſition to him, be the conſequence of perverting a moral power they once had, it ſhews that finite beings may poſſeſs a liberty of chuſing and acting otherwiſe than they do; and conſequently, that liberty may be diſtinguiſhed from, and oppoſed to, moral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. So with reſpect to apoſtate man, if he had originally a moral power of retaining his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, the inference is, that he poſſeſſed liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only as oppoſed to conſtraint from without, but as oppoſed to moral neceſſity. From the fall of angels and man, the inference therefore is not, that they were morally unable to keep their firſt eſtate; but that they had a moral power, and abuſed it, Indeed, in the caſe of their firſt ſin, moral neceſſity muſt have been ſtrictly <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>— Not, as we are won't to call habits, a <hi>ſecond</hi> nature, but a <hi>firſt</hi> nature. So that <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> inability ſuppoſeth a moral power once <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> but <hi>forfeited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF, on the contrary, it be ſuppoſed, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:011623_0112_0F8775C38CA07BA0"/>
man, nor the angels that fell, had a moral ability at firſt to continue in a ſtate of rectitude, to whom but their Creator muſt their fall be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed? Their original powers were ſuch as he endowed them with. They could be required to exert no other. Their abilities, relations, and deſtination being ſuch as their great Former gave and intended, they could be anſwerable only for what was given. If, therefore, the firſt act of ſin 'neceſſarily followed from GOD's withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſtance, or if that aſſiſtance was not afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was abſolutely neceſſary to the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing' the firſt tranſgreſſion, what is this but mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD the proper author of it? How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent this is with his moral character, or <hi>the poſſibility of ſin,</hi> we need not ſay. But if GOD be the immediate author of the firſt act of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in the creature, he is conſequentially the author of all the moral defilement and inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity proceeding therefrom; ſince 'the firſt act in the train determines and fixes the reſt.' So that if 'there is not, and never can be, either in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence or idea, a freedom from moral neceſſity, or a power of ſelf-determination—if every moral event is <hi>immediately</hi> or <hi>ultimately</hi> ordered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by GOD'—(403, 404.) the conſequence is, either that there is not, and never can be, ſin in the world; or if there is, it is wholly chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the firſt cauſe. The only way to evade this conſequence is to admit, that the duty of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and man, before their fall, was no other than they had a moral as well as natural power to do. To ſuppoſe their duty exceeded their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities would be the injuſtice, which the ſlothful ſervant charged his Lord with.</p>
               <p>FROM what hath been ſaid, it appears, that
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:011623_0113_0F8775C39D9614D8"/>
there is no need of our examining into any <hi>moral impotency</hi> derived from the fall, or the moral inability of <hi>fallen</hi> man. For Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this kind of impotency to have taken place in <hi>innocence,</hi> as really as ſince the apoſtacy. That is, there was a moral neceſſity of the firſt ſin—therefore a moral incapacity of refraining from it, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine manifeſtly implies a moral inability in man and angels <hi>before</hi> their fall. He ſaith he 'has demonſtrated, that the futurity of all events is eſtabliſhed by previous neceſſity, either natural or moral; and that it is manifeſt that the ſovereign Creator and Diſpoſer of the world has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this neceſſity, by ordering his own conduct, either in deſignedly acting, or forbearing to act. That the whole ſeries of events is connected with ſomething in the ſtate of things, either poſitive or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which is original in the ſeries; i. e. ſomething which is connected with nothing preceeding that, but GOD's own IMMEDIATE conduct'—and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard 'to the ſtate and acts of the will, EVERY event of this kind is neceſſary by a moral neceſſity' —(p. 402, 403, 405, 406) 'The will always has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to act otherwiſe than it does'; (p. 35) that is, the man, or agent, or ſoul—'for the faculty of will doth not act, but the agent that hath it.' GOD does deciſively in his providence deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all the volitions and actions of moral agents, either by poſitive influence or permiſſion—meaning by permiſſion, not only 'the not hindering ſin, but diſpoſing the ſtate and circumſtances of things in ſuch a manner, that ſin certainly and infallibly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from his diſpoſal— that GOD, <hi>when he had made man, ſo ordered his circumſtances, that from theſe circumſtances, together with the withholding divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and aſſiſtance, his ſin infallibly followed.</hi>' (p. 376)</p>
                     <p>THE firſt ſin of angels and man was then morally neceſſary, and proceeded from their original ſtate and circumſtances—from GOD's withholding neceſſary aſſiſtance. And this proves their original moral inability; which inability being 'connected with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preceeding, BUT GOD's OWN IMMEDIATE CONDUCT, which is ORIGINAL <hi>in the ſeries,</hi>' he muſt be the <hi>author</hi> of it. For if he himſelf neceſſitated them to ſin, by doing or forbearing what rendered the firſt ſin unavoidable—if ſin followed from his ordering and diſpoſal, that maxim in philoſophy is ſtrictly applicable, '<hi>Cauſa deficiens, in rebus neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                           </gap>s; not cauſam porſa efficientem reducenda eſt.</hi> In things neceſſary, the deficient cauſe muſt be reduced to the efficient. And in this caſe the reaſon is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; becauſe the not doing what is required, or not avoiding what is forbidden, muſt follow from the poſition of the neceſſary cauſe of the deficiency.' 'The moral neceſſity Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> contends for, as it runs up to the firſt entrance of ſin into the world, ſuppoſeth an inability in the <hi>time</hi> of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence—and that GOD's own immediate conduct is <hi>firſt</hi> in the ſeries of cauſes and effects; ſo to ſay the firſt ſin, or any other, was not neceſſary by a <hi>natural</hi> neceſſity, no way relieves the difficulty. For natural liberty depends on moral liberty, by his own principles. And to ſay that the firſt cauſe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme orderer of all things made angels and men ſo at firſt, as that their <hi>original</hi> ſin became neceſſary in conſequence of a moral inability they were created with, it making the ſupreme cauſe 'the proper au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor the efficient cauſe,' of all the ſins of men and devils. To which objection it is really ſurprizing to find Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> returning this anſwer, that the doctrine of his oppoſers is involved in the ſame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. For admit it to be ſo, is this a proper an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? If either his doctrine or theirs is juſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable with ſuch a conſequence, by all the regard we owe to a Deity and moral Governor we are bound to reject a ſcheme which contains ſuch an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him.</p>
                     <p>IT hence appears, that the caſe Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in, 'of a man for his rebellion caſt into priſon, and loaded with chains, on whom his Prince hath compaſſion, orders his chains to be knocked off, and the priſon doors to be ſet open—but who is full of ſuch malignity, that he cannot be willing to accept the offer of forgiveneſs'—(p. 305, 306) that this caſe is quite aliene from the purpoſe, and no way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine. For by his principles, there is a neceſſity on the minds of men, ſtrong as grates of braſs, and bars of iron—which neceſſity extends to the firſt entrance of ſin into the world. <hi>Hence</hi> the angels that fell, and our common progenitors, <hi>could not be willing</hi> to abide in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſtate. <hi>Hence</hi> ſinners continue impenitent. Internal chains, ſtrong as the bars of a caſtle bound the morning ſtars to revolt from Heaven—bound <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to ſin—and bind all who ſtand out againſt the goſpel invitation.</p>
                  </note> And if the moral neceſſity of the firſt ſin, though as <hi>real,</hi> (p. 230) was not in the ſame <hi>degree</hi> with that of ſubſequent ſins; yet the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed</hi>

divines have ever maintained, not that it was <hi>original,</hi> but <hi>conſequent to the fall</hi>—the judicial animadverſion of the Deity upon the firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. We are inclined to think Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> was in the ſame opinion upon the whole, though he hath expreſſed himſelf ſo as to give full rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for our attributing the contrary to him—that is, bringing a charge of ſelf-repugnancy. For Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> aſſerts, that man was 'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed at firſt with the moral or ſpiritual

image of GOD,' in diſtinction from his <hi>natural</hi> image—By the latter alſo he explains himſelf to mean, 'an underſtanding to perceive the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between moral good and evil; a capacity of diſcerning that moral worthineſs and demerit, by which ſome things are praiſe-worthy, others deſerving of blame and puniſhment; and alſo a <hi>capacity of choice,</hi> and choice guided by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and <hi>a power of acting</hi> according to choice.' (p. 41, 43) Conſequently, he had a capacity of making <hi>this</hi> choice, to continue in the ſtate of moral rectitude wherein he was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. Conſequently, a <hi>(moral)</hi> power of abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that ſtate. Conſequently, his fall from it was not an event morally <hi>neceſſary.</hi> Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, not <hi>infallibly connected with the divine diſpoſal and determination.</hi> Conſequently, the ſuppoſed fixed connection of <hi>every</hi> moral event with a previous moral cauſe, could not <hi>antecede</hi> the apoſtacy, but muſt (if real) be <hi>ſubſequent</hi> to it. Conſequently, in every ſuch event 'GOD's own immediate conduct' cannot be ſuppoſed to be <hi>'original</hi> in the ſeries.' The difficulty ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from divine preſcience we pretend not to be able to clear. It is ſufficient that it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lies againſt Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine.</p>
               <p>UPON admitting, with the generality of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſtic divines, <hi>original, internal</hi> freedom in man; that his moral imbecility was <hi>conſequent</hi> to, and the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of, the firſt offence; that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral impotency of apoſtate ſpirits alſo is the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>effect</hi> of their revolt; the moral perfections of GOD are vindicated, and he is freed from the impious charge of being the author of their ſin: But how this charge can be removed on the foundation Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> proceeds upon is difficult

to conceive; nor indeed has he taken much pains to remove it, though he allows it 'is infinitely to be abhorred, and denies it to be the conſequence of what he has laid down.' In what ſenſe he thought it was to be 'abhorred,' and will not allow it to be the 'conſequence' of what he hath ſaid, has been already remarked. <note n="*" place="bottom">Sect. iv. Part ii. of theſe remarks.</note> However great that impotency is which mankind derive from <hi>Adam,</hi> there is a manifeſt difference between a moral inability or neceſſity <hi>derived from the fall</hi> of man, and a like kind of inability or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity <hi>original</hi> to the human race. Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>'s doctrine of neceſſity is inconſiſtent with the opinion of our having loſt our power in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> ſince he could not <hi>loſe</hi> a power he never had.</p>
               <p>WE have but one thing farther to add. While we acknowledge the fallen ſtate of our nature, and the impotency derived from the fall, the proper queſtion on the <hi>goſpel</hi> plan is, Whether ſalvation is offered to ſinners on <hi>practicable</hi> terms? The offer preſuppoſeth our loſt and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate. Is it then adapted to <hi>this</hi> ſtate of mankind? Is there a poſſibility of accepting it? Rather, is there no impropriety, is there not a palpable contradiction, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an <hi>offer</hi> on terms known to be <hi>morally</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible? The preſent queſtion is not, Whether fallen man hath power, <hi>independently of the aids of grace,</hi> to accept the goſpel propoſals? but, Whether ſuch aſſiſtances are tendered with the call of the goſpel as that an acceptance of it is morally poſſible?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="unknown:011623_0118_0F8775C75DCDD260"/>OR ſuppoſe it morally impoſſible, that great numbers, who are externally called by the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhould accept the invitation of it—ſuppoſe their final condemnation to be juſt notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in conſequence of their relation to <hi>Adam,</hi> and the moral inability derived from him; yet who will ſay that they merit a <hi>ſorer</hi> puniſhment, a <hi>greater</hi> damnation, when their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the goſpel is ſuppoſed to be the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence of GOD's <hi>withholding that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,</hi> without which they cannot embrace it? A propoſal of pardon and life to rebels againſt heaven, on impracticable terms, accompanied with a threatening of aggravated condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeems hardly reconcileable with the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries GOD hath made of himſelf as having ſhewn <hi>the exceeding riches of his grace in CHRIST JESUS—Not willing any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance—Commanding all men every where to repent—Whoever will, let him come, and take the waters of life freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT may be ſaid, 'True indeed, whoſoever <hi>will</hi> let him come. We grant, if they have a will, they may come. But we aſſert, that none but ſuch as actually come can will to come.' Now what ſaith the ſcripture? When our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our upbraids the Jews, 'Ye <hi>will not</hi> come to me that ye might have life,' doth this imply that it was forever morally impoſſible for them to have come? or doth it ſuppoſe, on the contrary, that they might have willed to come? Why elſe are they upbraided for not coming? How oft would he have gathered them, but they would not? Was there not a time, therefore, when they might have known the things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their peace? I ſet before you life and
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:011623_0119_0F8775C8F5CDE148"/>
death, bleſſing and curſing; therefore CHUSE life—implying a moral capacity of <hi>chuſing</hi> as well as <hi>conducting</hi> according to choice: And indeed, without ſuppoſing the former, how can the latter be ſaid to be in any one's power? It is ſo only in <hi>conſequence</hi> of volition or choice. If the <hi>cauſe</hi> be out of our power, the <hi>effect</hi> muſt be of courſe. Beſides, 'the very willing or chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is the doing: When once a man hath wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or choſen, the thing is done.' Had not that ſervant, who received the ſingle talent, a moral power to have improved that talent well? In conſequence of ſuch improvement, would he not have received more? According to that, 'To him that hath, ſhall be given,' <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was he not condemned out of his own mouth?</p>
               <p>LET us add here, that the ſuppoſition of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being <hi>abandoned and given up of GOD,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that they <hi>once</hi> had a moral power to turn and live—Always remembering to include the means and influences of grace when we ſpeak of ſuch a power. <hi>For it is GOD that worketh in us to</hi> WILL <hi>and to</hi> DO; which is the argument to our <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our own ſalvation.</hi> Doth not the demand of the Prophet, <hi>What could have been done more to my vineyard?</hi> imply that means and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on GOD's part are afforded, or tendered, in ſuch meaſure to ſinners, as renders their compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the terms of ſalvation poſſible at leaſt? We have, indeed, no warrant to ſay <hi>abſolutely,</hi> that he could not have done more for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Jews—that he could not have converted them by an immediate, irreſiſtible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. He that 'is able to raiſe up children to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of the ſtones,' could, no doubt, have done this, had he ſeen fit. It is enough
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:011623_0120_0F8775C9A2817730"/>
that the means uſed with them were <hi>ſufficient,</hi> though not unconquerable.</p>
               <p>BUT we may diſmiſs this matter. Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>'s doctrine is, that the <hi>firſt</hi> ſin of angels and man as was <hi>really</hi> neceſſary, as the wickedneſs of abandoned ſinners and apoſtate ſpirits—So that what hath been laſt obſerved, relating to the neceſſity of the ſins of fallen creatures, while on probation, and in the time of GOD's grace and viſitation, no way affects our main argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath offered a chain of reaſoning in proof that man hath in no caſe, and never had, a power of ſelf-determination; but is, and always was, determined by a <hi>moral neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> which neceſſity is as real as any other. This neceſſity, he affirms, belongs to all finite beings, and to the Creator himſelf—At the ſame time he hath taken great pains to ſhew, that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the moſt perfect liberty.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Internal moral liberty, as diſtinct from external, conſiſtent with the influence of motives, and uſe of commands, exhortations, promiſes, warnings, threatenings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE readily grant, there can be no act of choice without ſome motive or induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if what hath been obſerved, with reſpect to the power of creatures made upright to retain or forfeit their innocence, be admitted, it clearly follows, that the application of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, invitations, monitions, &amp;c. is conſiſtent with a freedom to <hi>either</hi> ſide. For who queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but rebel angels had the higheſt induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before their fall, to abide in their firſt eſtate? We need not ſcruple to ſay, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible motives could not be wanting in the preſence of GOD—that it was the higheſt <hi>apparent</hi> good, as well as their higheſt duty, and what they had a moral ability for, to continue ſubject to the great Creator. And it is really one of the moſt inexplicable events, that beings in their ſituation ſhould fall. This event ſhews, beyond queſtion, that a liberty to either ſide is conſiſtent with the moſt powerful motives to bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as and incline the will to one ſide.</p>
               <p>SO in the caſe of innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> no one will ſay, that the motives in paradiſe, to hold faſt his integrity, were inſufficient—or that their not proving effectual neceſſarily proceeded from the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:011623_0122_0F8775CB1CE5E748"/>
original, moral ſtate of his will, poſſeſſed of the moral image of GOD. That he had a moral capacity to ſuſtain the federal trial is here taken for granted. Among other commands, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on his heart, or communicated by ſpecial intercourſe with Deity, he had one prohibition properly poſitive, which was made the teſt of his fidelity, accompanied with an expreſs threat, that he ſhould die in caſe of non-forbearance in that inſtance; and implying a promiſe of life, if he refrained in this article. Whatever be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the death threatened, the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ſufficiently awful. Yet againſt the cleareſt warning, againſt the higheſt motives to the contrary, he ventured to take and eat. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, invitations, promiſes, admonitions, &amp;c. are therefore conſiſtent with a moral ability to hearken or not hearken to them.</p>
               <p>FOR the ſame reaſon that <hi>ſin</hi> could not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neceſſary at firſt, it will be difficult to prove, that the continued <hi>holineſs</hi> of good angels was morally neceſſary from the beginning. Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> ſeems to ſuppoſe a difference as to the <hi>degree</hi> of moral neceſſity; but expreſsly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that the <hi>reality</hi> of it is the ſame in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.<note n="*" place="bottom">Part III. Sect. 4th.</note> That is to ſay, though every act of every creature is certain and fixed deciſively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, yet there are different degrees of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute certainty.</p>
               <p>FARTHER, with regard to fallen man, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> allows, that commands, &amp;c. are given to, and means uſed with ſinners, in unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. From hence he partly argues his doctrine
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:011623_0123_0F8775CF4E31E940"/>
of neceſſity.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid, and Sect. 7. and p. 384.</note> They have a moral underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the ſame natural powers of action, with holy and good men—To which end moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements of various kinds are laid before them.</p>
               <p>THE doctrine of neceſſary connection of means and ends, as ſtated by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> implies one or other of the following things: Either that no means are employed with the unregenerate in order to their converſion—or none that have a tendency to the end—or that they have not a moral power of uſing them—or their uſe of them is certainly and infallibly ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>THAT <hi>means are uſed with unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> grants. But ſince the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine he defends may ſeem to imply, that means are never uſed with the finally impenitent, (at leaſt not to bring them to repentance, but only to confirm them in wickedneſs, and lead them to deſtruction) we ſhall juſt hint, that the whole oeconomy of providence and grace is a means uſed with the righteous and wicked in common, for the confirmation, improvement and comfort of the former, and conviction and reformation of the latter. Extraordinary and ordinary means are uſed to this end. Of the former kind are miracles, prophecy, tongues, vouchſafed at ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſeaſons, and in divers manners; together with ſingular and alarming interpoſitions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. To the latter kind belong a written, ſtanding revelation, a public miniſtry and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of worſhip, the ſtrivings of the divine ſpirit, various providential allotments &amp;c. The word of truth in particular is an external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:011623_0124_0F8775D080B536A0"/>
means of regeneration, repentance from dead works, convertion, or that faith by which thoſe live who are paſſed from death to life. If any reject the tender of ſalvation, the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of it are directed to wipe off the duſt of their feet as a teſtimony againſt the deſpiſers of their meſſage; leaving with them this ſolemn proteſtation, 'Be ye ſure of this, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD is come unto you.' We might mention the patience of GOD towards ſinners, &amp;c.—whence it is apparent that means, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means, are uſed for the converſion even of thoſe, who are at length reſigned up to their own hearts luſt. But as this matter appears not to be conteſted by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> we ſhall paſs to the next thing above mentioned.</p>
               <p>WHETHER the means uſed with the unregen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate have any <hi>tendency</hi> to the end? The very propoſing of this queſtion is enough. For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we uſe the <hi>means,</hi> it is in relation to ſome end. We intend by it the <hi>media</hi> through which any end is attained. So that to ſpeak of means, and deny their conduciveneſs to the end, is an affront to common ſenſe, as nothing can properly be called a means farther than it hath, or is ſuppoſed to have, a tendency to accompliſh an end. And as all who maintain there are any inſtituted means of converſion, allow them to have been ordained by infinite wiſdom, it would be impeaching ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme wiſdom and goodneſs to ſay, they are not calculated <hi>in the beſt manner</hi> to lead ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>NOT that any external means are efficacious in themſelves, but only through the divine concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with them. So it is in temporal and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:011623_0125_0F8775D122590F70"/>
matters; and ſo it is in the concerns of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Means and endeavors do not enſure worldly ſucceſs. They are in vain except GOD worketh with them. Yet who heſitates one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether the divine concurrence is to be expected in the uſe, and through the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, of the means he hath preſcribed, or the contrary? Exempt caſes there are wherein means are ſuperſeded in mens temporal affairs: There may be like inſtances in the affairs of ſalvation. But theſe being <hi>exempt</hi> caſes is a reaſon why ſpiritual bleſſings are much rather to be expected in the uſe, than in the neglect of means.</p>
               <p>IT is the united voice of all Calviniſtic divines, that there is the greateſt poſſible encouragement to the endeavours of unconverted men in the uſe of the means of ſalvation. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that moral inducements are uſed with them; and ſays, 'it is of the nature of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, that they have ſomething <hi>inviting,</hi> ſome tendency to <hi>induce</hi> and <hi>diſpoſe</hi> to virtuous volition; to give the mind an <hi>inclination or bias</hi> to virtue—that they can operate only by biaſſing the will, and giving it a certain inclination one way—(p. 119, 125.) that motives have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves this nature and tendency in different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſome greater, others leſs.' Now by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s principles every inclination, however weak, is of the nature of a diſpoſition to virtue, and leading to it. (For there can be no induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to virtue but ſuch as operate by giving the mind an inclination to it) If then the motives uſed with the unregenerate may excite a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclination, though in the <hi>loweſt</hi> degree, we may, for the ſame reaſon, ſuppoſe this inclination increaſed to than degree as to become <hi>prepollent,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:011623_0126_0F8775D1E524A6D8"/>
through the influence of moral means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, in ſubordination to him who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all in all. And in proportion to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderation of the mind in favor of virtue, is the degree of virtue. How conſiſtent theſe things are with Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s 4th and 5th Sect. part 3d. and other things ſaid in his book, thoſe may judge, who will be at the pains to examine and compare them.</p>
               <p>IF it be ſaid, in the next place, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate have not a <hi>moral power to uſe the means of grace:</hi> This is the ſame abſurdity as to ſay, the means have no tendency to the end. For how can means be ſaid to be afforded, which cannot be uſed? At beſt, they are as if not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded. How then can the goſpel be preached for a <hi>witneſs</hi> to ſuch as finally reject it? Why is it taken from ſome, becauſe they bring not forth the fruit of the kingdom, when they never had it in their power to receive its teſtimony? Can they be liable to an aggravated puniſhment for not uſing means, which they could not improve to any purpoſe? We repeat it to prevent miſtakes that when we ſpeak of the ability of unregenerate men to uſe the means of grace, we mean not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent power in themſelves: (This the <hi>regenerate</hi> have not) But that ſuch influences of grace are vouchſafed, together with external means, as that thoſe might embrace the goſpel call, who, in event, reject it againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER, there is a wide difference in the characters of unregenerate men. Some ſuch are <hi>nearer</hi> the kingdom of GOD than others. There is more hope of ſome than others of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:011623_0127_0F8775D29F9CB278"/>
—Which things cannot be ſaid conſiſtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the ſuppoſition of unregenerate men's being utterly incapable of any good effect from the means of grace, through their own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in the uſe of them, and the common ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of GOD's ſpirit. And yet, what leſs is implied in the aſſertion, that they cannot uſe the means that are employed with them, cannot improve a ſuppoſed price in their hands? For how then is the goſpel a diſpenſation of <hi>grace</hi> to them? Is it not rather a diſpenſation of <hi>wrath?</hi> To ſay that their incapacity is not <hi>natural,</hi> but <hi>moral,</hi> is ſaying nothing to the purpoſe, as we truſt hath been ſhewn. If the incapacity be <hi>real,</hi> it is no matter under what name it go<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. Is it determined beforehand, that any of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſhall not uſe the means, of grace, or ſhall not ſucceed? If it is, let any man ſhew, how the goſpel can be a privilege to them, or they liable to a greater damnation for abuſing it.</p>
               <p>TO ſay laſtly, that the endeavours of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in the uſe of the means of grace are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly connected with <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> is to ſay, that no means are employed with thoſe who die in their ſins; contrary to what Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> expreſsly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. And yet he muſt either ſay this, or elſe that none but the regenerate can uſe the means of grace. We may juſt as well affirm, that all converted men muſt profit <hi>equally</hi> under the means of ſalvation, as that none can improve them at all but they who ſucceed. One may venture to aſſert, that ſuch as hear the word, and anon with joy receive it, uſe the means of grace, though they ſhould endure but a while.</p>
               <p>THE means of religion, as thoſe of this life, are uſed with different degrees of application by
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:011623_0128_0F8775D3835F6740"/>
different perſons; which is the true ground (ordinarily) of their different ſucceſs. But we deny that any are commanded, invited, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. to exert powers and faculties they are not poſſeſſed of—to act from principles they are not endowed with—to uſe means out of their power. Such faculties, principles, powers, and affections as they are poſſeſſed of, ſuch means as are within their power are the only ones they are poſſeſſed of, ſuch means as are within their power are the only ones they can be required to act from and improve. Arguments laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wicked men are adapted to operate on their reaſon and moral diſcernment—on the principle of ingenuity and gratitude—on their hope, fear, joy, ſorrow, and the various movements of the mind. Nor can it be propoſed they ſhould act from the higheſt ſpiritual principles while unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, but from ſuch as they are capable of being influenced by as reaſonable beings, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a moral faculty, and ſubjects of moral government—who have an advocate for GOD within them, to whom he hath deputed his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority—a principle which is by nature <hi>ſupreme,</hi> and implanted to give law to the animal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and appetites.</p>
               <p>'THE end of laws, we acknowledge, is to <hi>bind to one ſide;</hi> and the end of commands is to turn the will one way.' But we cannot agree with Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> 'that laws and commands are therefore of <hi>no uſe, unleſs they actually turn the will that way' which they require.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Part III. Sect. 4th p. 226.</note> Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> would not ſay, that any of GOD's laws or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are uſeleſs—that he might not juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſubjection to his anointed from thoſe who ſaid, <hi>Let us break their bands aſ under, and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:011623_0129_0F8775D4F52456F0"/>
caſt away their cords from us.</hi> The title of the ſection, from which we have extracted the above words, is, <hi>Commands conſiſtent with moral inability.</hi> Now is the will of thoſe, who are under moral neceſſity of diſobeying, turned and biaſſed that way the command is? Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has offered many reaſons why their will <hi>ought</hi> to be turned to this ſide—to evince the propriety of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands given them notwithſtanding their <hi>original inability to turn this way.</hi> But he hath not ſhewn clearly, that 'commands and laws are therefore of <hi>no uſe,'</hi> becauſe the ſubject will not be bound thereby. Or admitting he had ſhewn this, we need not ſay how much or how little it makes for his purpoſe. One thing is hence obvious, that by his own confeſſion and argument, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, invitations &amp;c, are of no uſe where there is a moral neceſſity of being biaſſed, or going, the contrary way.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER, as wicked men may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to virtue, conſiſtent with the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their perſiſting in vice; in like manner good men have allurements to vice. Such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements they meet with from the fleſh, the world, and the devil. Hence they are called to watch and pray, that they enter not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—to fight—to ſtrive for the maſtery—to deny themſelves, and take up the croſs—to take heed leſt they fall—and in general to work out their own ſalvation with fear and trembling. Now temptations and allurements to ſin 'operate by giving the mind an inclination to it—biaſſing the will this way.' So that as inducements to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be conſiſtently uſed with thoſe who at preſent are under the dominion of ſin, with a proſpect of changing their preſent prevailing bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as and inclination; allurements to ſin may alſo
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:011623_0130_0F8775D5A1980190"/>
be laid before thoſe whoſe prevailing bias is to holineſs, not without a poſſibility and proſpect of their being overcome—with which view they are always propoſed by the tempter. <hi>Adam,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with the moral image of GOD, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: And are his fallen ſons exempt from danger? The regenerate fall from virtue fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently through inadvertence, and the ſtrength of a preſent temptation. They are, therefore, under no moral neceſſity of being <hi>perfect,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can be free from ſin in this life. Or will any undertake to ſhew, that the ſins they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to are morally neceſſary? According to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine they are ſo indeed. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe farther, as his doctrine doth, that the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect</hi> holineſs of the ſaints in this life is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by a moral neceſſity, is a palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: For ſuch a neceſſity being ſuppoſed would prove them incapable of any lapſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Neceſſity is <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>uniform,</hi> admitting of no <hi>variety or diſſonancy</hi> of character: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the moral characters of good chriſtians are mixed, and in many inſtances contradictory. <hi>David</hi>'s murther and adultery were very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his general character, and cannot be ſuppoſed to have been morally neceſſary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the opinion, that by the ſame neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity he was a man after GOD's own heart.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole, powerful motives to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, joined with a prevailing propenſity this way are yet to be found where there are in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances contrary volitions; and in ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, on ſome occaſions, to an high degree. Nor have the maintainers of the doctrine of the ſaints perſeverance been wont to ground it on the ſuppoſed <hi>indefectibility</hi> of the ſpiritual princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in them, in itſelf conſidered, but on the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and power</hi> of GOD engaged to them.</p>

                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:011623_0131_0F8775D7362F23B8"/>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> very juſtly obſerves, that ſome crimes are <hi>more heinous</hi> than others in their own nature: Nor would he deny, but that of ſome <hi>more</hi> is required than of others. We may aſk, On what ground? if all volition and action is neceſſary, in the ſenſe of his book. How is a 'perſon under previous obligation to conſider beforehand in ſome caſes more than others?' (p. 262) Can he conſider without motives to conſideration preſented to his mind? Can he be the cauſe of new motives to himſelf? Doth he neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow thoſe exhibited <hi>ab extra?</hi> Could he, among many motives to choice, have viewed any one otherwiſe than he in fact doth? The whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, in a manner, terms on the reſolution of theſe queſtions. Every reader perceives on which ſide Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> was in regard to them: And every reader, 'from the bare propoſal of them, may ſee at once, whether or no, or how far Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine is reconcileable with the ſuppoſition of <hi>different degrees</hi> of guilt, and obligations to conſider previous to making choice. It ſeems hardly proper to ſpeak of <hi>tendency</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> in motives to choice, when all things are <hi>ſettled and determined beforehand by eſtabliſhed laws in nature,</hi> ſo that every intelligent creature is neceſſitated to chuſe and improve, or refuſe and neglect ſuch and ſuch things, called means. So <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> a connection of cauſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, antecedents and conſequents, as he hath endeavoured to make appear, leaves no room to ſpeak of a <hi>meer tendency</hi> in motives, which have a certain <hi>ſovereignty</hi> in determining every act of every being in the univerſe.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Allowing Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſcheme of neceſſity to be true in <hi>theory,</hi> it is not applicable to <hi>practice.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS we have ſuppoſed the doctrine of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty maintained in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s enquiry runs up to <hi>abſolute fatality,</hi> we ſhall in this ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſider it in this view. We ſhall ſuppoſe ſuch a neceſſity to be indeed agreable to philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic truth. Taking for granted the coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and a ſtrict fataliſt, Dr. <hi>Butler</hi>'s reaſoning with the latter is in a good meaſure applicable to the former. We ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly take the liberty to extract from the chapter of his analogy, entitled, 'Of the opinion of neceſſity, conſidered as influencing <hi>practice.</hi>' He introduces what he there obſerves with this apology to his readers: 'As the puzzle and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, which muſt unavoidably ariſe from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing upon ſo abſurd a ſuppoſition as that of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal neceſſity, will, I fear, eaſily be ſeen; it will, I hope, as eaſily be excuſed.'</p>
               <p>WHEN it is ſaid by a fataliſt, that the whole conſtitution of nature, and the actions of men, that every thing, and every mode and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of every thing, is neceſſary and could not poſſibly have been otherwiſe; it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that this neceſſity does not exclude delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, choice, preference, and acting from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain principles, and to certain ends: Becauſe all this is matter oi undoubted experience, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all, and what every man may, every moment, be conſcious of. And hence it follows,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:011623_0133_0F8775DB38C4E9C8"/>
that neceſſity, alone and of itſelf, is in no ſort an account of the conſtitution of nature, and how things came <hi>to be</hi> and <hi>to continue</hi> as they are, but only an account of this <hi>circumſtance,</hi> relating to their origin and continuance, that they could not have been otherwiſe than they are and have been.</p>
               <p>NECESSITY as much requires and ſuppoſes a neceſſary agent, as freedom requires and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a free agent, to be the former of the world. And the appearances of <hi>deſign</hi> and of <hi>final cauſes</hi> in the conſtitution of nature, as really prove this acting agent, to be an <hi>intelligent</hi> deſigner, or to act from choice, upon the ſcheme of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuppoſed poſſible, as upon that of freedom.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE then a fataliſt to educate any one, from his youth up, in his own principles, that the child ſhould reaſon upon them, and conclude that ſince he cannot poſſibly behave otherwiſe than he does, he is not a ſubject of blame or commendation, nor can deſerve to be rewarded or puniſhed: Imagine him to eradicate the very perceptions of blame and commendation out of his mind, by means of this ſyſtem; to form his temper, and character, and behaviour to it; and from it to judge of the treatment he was to expect, ſay, from reaſonable men, upon his coming abroad into the world—I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſtopping here to aſk, Whether anyone of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe would think fit, that a child ſhould be put upon theſe ſpeculations, and be left to apply them to practice? And a man has little pretence to reaſon, who is not ſenſible, that we are all children in ſpeculations of this kind. However, the child would doubtleſs be highly delighted to find himſelf freed from the reſtraints of fear and ſhame, with which his play-fellows were fettered
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:011623_0134_0F8775DC16AC5DF8"/>
and embarraſſed; and highly conceited in his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior knowledge ſo far beyond his years. But conceit and vanity would be the leaſt bad part of the influence, which theſe principles muſt have, when thus reaſoned and acted upon, during the courſe of his education. He muſt either be allowed to go on, and be the plague of all about him, and himſelf too, even to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: Or elſe correction muſt be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of, to ſupply the want of thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural perceptions of blame and commendation, which we have ſuppoſed to be removed; and to give him a practical impreſſion, of what he had reaſoned himſelf out of the belief of, that he was in fact an accountable child, and to be puniſhed for doing what he was forbid. It is therefore in reality impoſſible, but that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which he muſt meet with, in the courſe of his education, muſt convince him, that if the ſcheme he was inſtructed in were not falſe; yet that he reaſoned inconcluſively upon it, and ſome how or other miſapplied it to practice and common life. But ſuppoſing the child's temper could remain ſtill formed to the ſyſtem, and his expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the treatment he was to have in the world be regulated by it; ſo as to expect that no reaſonable man would blame or puniſh him, for any thing which he ſhould do, becauſe he could not help doing it: Upon this ſuppoſition, it is mainifeſt he would, upon his coming abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, be inſupportable to ſociety, and the treatment he would receive from it, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſo to him; and he could not fail of doing ſomewhat, very ſoon, for which he would be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over into the hands of civil juſtice. And thus, in the end, he would be convinced of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations he was under to his wiſe inſtructor. Or
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:011623_0135_0F8775DC63ACE770"/>
ſuppoſe this ſcheme of fatality, in any other way, applied to practice, ſuch practical application of it will be found equally abſurd; equally fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious in a practical ſenſe: For inſtance, that if a man be deſtined to live ſuch a time, he ſhall live to it, though he take no care of his own preſervation; or if he be deſtined to die before that time, no care can prevent it. Therefore all care to preſerve one's own life is to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, which is the fallacy inſtanced in by the ancients.</p>
               <p>BUT now on the contrary, none of theſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical abſurdities can be drawn, from reaſoning upon the ſuppoſition, that we are free, but all ſuch reaſoning with regard to the common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of life, is juſtified by experience. And therefore, though it were admitted that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of neceſſity were ſpeculatively true; yet, with regard to practice, it is as if it were falſe, ſo far as our experience reacheth; that is, to the whole of our preſent life. For, the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, and the condition in which we are actually placed, is, as if we were free. And it may perhaps juſtly be concluded, that ſince the whole proceſs of action, through every ſtep of it, ſuſpenſe, deliberation, inclining one way, determining, and at laſt doing as we determine; is as if we were free, therefore we are ſo. But the thing here inſiſted on is, that under the preſent natural government of the world, we find we are treated and dealt with, as if we were free, prior to all conſideration whether we are or not. Were this opinion therefore of neceſſity admitted to be ever ſo true; yet ſuch is in fact our condition and the natural courſe of things, that whenever we apply it to life and practice,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:011623_0136_0F8775DD1CD92D78"/>
this application of it always miſleads us, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but miſlead us, in a moſt dreadful manner, with regard to our preſent intereſt. And how can people think themſelves ſo very ſecure then, that the ſame application of the ſame opinion may not miſlead them alſo, in ſome analogous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with reſpect to a future, a more general and more important intereſt? For religion being a practical ſubject; and the analogy of nature ſhewing us, that we have not faculties to apply this opinion, were it a true one, to practical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; whenever we do apply it to the ſubject of religion, and thence conclude that we are free from its obligations, it is plain this concluſion cannot be depended upon.</p>
               <p>THE notion of neceſſity, with reſpect to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſubjects, therefore is as it were not true. Nor doth this contain any reflection upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but only upon what is unreaſonable. For to pretend to act upon reaſon, in oppoſition to practical principles, which the author of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gave us to act upon; and to pretend to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our reaſon to ſubjects, with regard to which, our own ſhort views, and even our experience, will ſhew us, it cannot be depended upon; and ſuch, at beſt, the ſubject of neceſſity muſt be; this is vanity, conceit and unreaſonableneſs.</p>
               <p>BUT this is not all. For we find within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a will, and are conſcious of a character. Now if this, in us, be reconcileable with fate, it is reconcileable with it, in the author of nature. And beſides, natural government and final cauſes imply a character and a will in the governor and deſigner; a will concerning the creatures whom he governs. The author of nature then being
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:011623_0137_0F8775DDDCCB0860"/>
certainly of ſome character or other, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding neceſſity; it is evident this neceſſity is as reconcileable with the particular character of benevolence, veracity, and juſtice in him, which attributes are the foundation of religion, as with any other character: Sure we find this neceſſity no more hinders <hi>men</hi> from being benevolent than cruel; true, than faultleſs; juſt than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
               <p>WE find GOD exerciſes the ſame kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over us, with that a father exerciſes over his children, and a civil magiſtrate over his ſubjects. Now, whatever becomes of abſtract queſtions concerning liberty and neceſſity, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears to us, that veracity and juſtice muſt be the natural rule and meaſure of exerciſing this government or authority, to a being, who can have no competitions, or interfering of intereſts, with his creatures and his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>WE have endeavoured to keep in view the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign we mentioned in the introduction, to examine only the <hi>ground-work</hi> of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entering into conſideration of the particular doctrines built thereupon. Whether they ſtand or fall with the foundation, is beſide our purpoſe to ſay—Or whether what has been offered at all weakens this foundation is not for us to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. One thing, perhaps, appears, that men of ſtrong powers and great abilities are wont to wade beyond their depth, and bewilder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others with ſpeculations abſtruſe and unprofitable—to ſay no worſe. Great geniuſes are fruitful, many times, of great errors. There is a ſhew of ſcience, falſely ſo called, which is
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:011623_0138_0F8775DEF6320218"/>
eſpecially incongruous in handling moral and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſubjects; wherein the ſimple (who make much the greater part of mankind) are alike concerned as the wiſe and learned—and which, therefore, ought to be treated with the utmoſt plainneſs.</p>
               <p>WE do not deny but Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> was 'wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the name of a <hi>Philoſopher:'</hi> (p. 401) But we appeal to the publick, whether ſome of the moſt famed Philoſophers in the Engliſh nation, for many years back, and at this day, have not philoſophiſed themſelves into ſcepticiſm? One of firſt diſtinction in particular (whoſe eſſays on ſome moral ſubjects are ſo nearly akin to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> on neceſſity, that a reader might think the latter copied from the former) appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a diſbeliever in natural religion, not leſs than revealed. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Hume</hi>'s eſſay, Vol. III. Sect. 7, 8, 10, 11. &amp;c.</note> However, we have not the leaſt ſuſpicion of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s inclination ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to atheiſm or deiſm. We doubt not he had a ſtrong practical ſenſe of religion, which overbalanced his theory. But when great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants are poſſeſſed of a particular hypotheſis, they are apt to defend it many times by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of reaſoning, which leads to moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences—without ſeeing or allowing thoſe conſequences, which, if fairly deduced, demonſtrate the hypotheſis itſelf to be wrong, or that they have argued wrong from it.</p>
               <p>IF we have miſrepreſented Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> it has not been through deſign; nor have we knowingly 'inſiſted on difficulties not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the controverſy.' Whether our 'indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:011623_0139_0F8775EAB893FA70"/>
or diſdain' hath been 'raiſed at the ſight of his diſcourſe,' others muſt be left to judge. No one, we may preſume, will ſay, that much pains have been uſed to 'ſet forth' the doctrines of his book 'in colours ſhocking to the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and moving to the paſſions of thoſe, who have either too little capacity, or too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the opinions they have imbibed, and contempt of the contrary, to try the matter by any ſerious and circumſpect examination.' Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> it ſeems, was aware of being charged with maintaining 'horrid and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous doctrines, the fate of the heathen, <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s neceſſity, making men meer machines,' &amp;c. Whether he had any reaſon to apprehend ſuch an indictment is a matter we refer to the reader: To whoſe judgment we alſo ſubmit the following propoſed ſpecimen of the coincidence between Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrines, and thoſe of ſome celebrated infidels.</p>

               <hi>THE APPENDIX.</hi> Exhibiting a ſpecimen of coincidence between the principles of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book, and thoſe of antient and modern <hi>Fataliſts.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A LEARNED writer, <note n="*" place="bottom">Jackſon.</note> who hath diſtinctly examined the opinion of the antients concerning fate, in a <hi>defence of human liberty in anſwer to</hi> Cato<hi>'s letters,</hi> hath clearly ſhewn, That the freedom of human actions was the almoſt unanimous doctrine of the philoſophers—that it was taught by the five great ſects among the heathen, which comprehended all the philoſophy of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>; viz. The <hi>Stoics, Platonics, Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Ariſtatelians</hi> and <hi>Academics</hi>—That the moſt <hi>reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of the antients, of all ſects, were agreed, on the one hand, that NECESSITY was to be excluded from <hi>human actions,</hi> that ſo the diſtinction of <hi>virtue and vice,</hi> and the <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>puniſhments</hi> both of divine and human laws founded upon them, might be preſerved inviolated: On the other hand, that <hi>fate,</hi> even with reſpect to human ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as well as to external events conſequent upon them, in which it was abſolute and uncontrolable) was ſo far to be retained, as that it was to be allowed that <hi>antecedent cauſes</hi> were motives of acting, though the <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe of action was a <hi>natural</hi> power and <hi>free exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the mind itſelf. <hi>Some</hi> things they held to be <hi>deſtined, others not;</hi> and diſtinguiſhed the cauſes of things into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent and efficient, that they might exempt ſome from neceſſity, and ſubject others to it; placing the <hi>human will</hi> among thoſe which they allowed not to be under neceſſity—always meaning by the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man actions a principle of <hi>ſelf-motion</hi> and <hi>exertion</hi> in the mind or agent—by the <hi>antecedent</hi> cauſe, the <hi>motive</hi> of action to the general efficient cauſe. <hi>Abſolute</hi> fatality or neceſſity, with reſpect to man, was underſtood only of <hi>external</hi> providential events, <hi>conſequential</hi> to the nature of their actions, preſuppoſed to be free, and <hi>in their own power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:011623_0141_0F8775F7E1E4A6A8"/>THEIR notion of liberty, upon the whole, was, Firſt, <hi>a principle or power of action, ſelf-motion, exertion, or cauſation in the mind.</hi> In other words, that the cauſe of voluntary motion is in the nature of the mind itſelf, whatever external motive may proceed, or concur to the exertion of it. Hence, Secondly, That motives are only <hi>aſſiſtant,</hi> not <hi>efficient</hi> cauſes. Thirdly, They main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a freedom from <hi>neceſſity,</hi> as well as from <hi>external conſtraint</hi> and <hi>coaction;</hi> allowing neceſſity only in regard to <hi>providential</hi> events. Fourthly, A power of <hi>acting or not acting,</hi> of chuſing and acting <hi>variouſly,</hi> or <hi>differently</hi> from what we do.</p>
            <p>THESE propoſitions expreſs the ſenſe in which liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was aſſerted by all the antient philoſophers of EMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NENCE. The oppoſers of this doctrine were chiefly <hi>Leucippus, Empedocles,</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> the firſt found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> ſect; <hi>Heraclitus, Diodorus,</hi> and ſome aſtrologers and fortune-tellers among the Stoics; who maintained <hi>univerſal, abſolute fate</hi>—To whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> joins <hi>Thales, Parmenides, Pythagoras,</hi> and others, who aſſerted, that 'neceſſity is <hi>omnipotent,</hi> and exerciſeth an empire over <hi>every</hi> thing'—'that the world is infeſted by neceſſity.'<note n="*" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>THE aſſerters of univerſal fate had different notions about it. <hi>Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> were of the <hi>atomical</hi> ſect, who made every thing the neceſſary effect of the eternal motion and concourſe of atoms, ſuppoſing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal chain of <hi>effects,</hi> without any original <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>agent</hi> at all. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> derived every thing from the <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> of the univerſe as the <hi>efficient,</hi> ſtiling it <hi>fate;</hi> and ſuppoſing not only all other things which exiſt, but <hi>the purpoſes of our minds</hi> alſo, proceed from the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power of it—Which was making no agent in the world but the ſupreme cauſe, and human actions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the operations of GOD in men, actuating them, and every thing elſe, as the ſoul doth the body.</p>
            <p>The <hi>aſtrological</hi> notion of fate was, that every thing was effected by the circumvolution of the univerſe, and the poſitions and appearances of the planets and fixed ſtars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="unknown:011623_0142_0F8775F866D96F40"/>ANOTHER notion of fatality was founded in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a <hi>mutual, eternal concatenation and chain of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> whereby things poſterior always follow thoſe which are antecedent, and are reſolved into them, as exiſting by them, and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> conſequent to thoſe which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede them. This was the moſt plauſible, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on by the maintainers of <hi>neceſſity</hi>—grounded on the ſuppoſition; that there was no internal principle or cauſe of motion or action in the mind at all: Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, that 'as it deprives the mind of it's <hi>free will,</hi> and ſubjects it to a <hi>neceſſary fatality,</hi> it is not tolerable.' Whether or how far this was Mr, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>'s opinion, thoſe who have read his book may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily judge: Alſo what preſumption of it's truth ariſeth from it's being rejected by the moſt reaſonable and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed philoſophers of all ſects, who were full in the four propoſitions above-mentioned—all which are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contradicted by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> who allows not of a principle of <hi>ſelf-motion</hi> in the mind—a freedom from <hi>neceſſity</hi>—a power of acting <hi>otherwiſe</hi> than we do—and aſcribes <hi>efficiency</hi> to motives.</p>
            <p>NOT that we ſuppoſe the oppugnation of Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s ſcheme to the doctrine of the moſt eminent phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and the agreement of it with their opinion who diſſented from the common belief, proves it to be falſe. The wiſeſt philoſophers had but rude notions of religion and morality in general; (<hi>The world by wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom knew not GOD</hi>) yet, on ſome things many of them expreſſed themſelves juſtly; and on a point ſo evident as human liberty, they were capable judges, if on any.</p>

                        <p>PART iv, ſect. ix, x.

                        <p>ON the ſcheme of ſelf-determination, the will of man is left to the guidance of nothing but blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence: So that if it makes any difference between men and machines, it is for the worſe; for machines are guided by an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe, by the ſkilful hand of the workman or owner.

            <p>UPON the whole: One of the famous objections of the <hi>fataliſts</hi> of old to the liberty of human actions, and which is urged for neceſſity by modern infidels, was, that every action reſults from a <hi>precedent motive or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which reaſon or motive is <hi>out of our power.</hi> (<hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s anſwer to <hi>Cato,</hi> p. 100.) We need not produce any paſſage from Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> to ſhew the coincidence. His whole ſcheme is founded on this principle.</p>
            <p>WE fear our quotations have already been too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, or it were eaſy to add to them. We preſume they have been ſufficient to ſatisfy the attentive and impartial in regard to the coincidence we propoſed to exhibit. What preſumption of the falſhood of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſcheme ariſeth from it's agreement with the doctrine of thoſe who reject the evidence of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an revelation, and even believed not (ſome of them) in the perfections and moral government of GOD, we ſhall not ſay; though the ſuſpicion that it is fallacious, ariſing from the compariſon we have made, will not, we truſt, be thought inconſiderable, whether it can or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſtinctly perceived where the fallacy lies. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, we ſhould not have troubled the reader with this appendix but for a reaſon already aſſigned. For if his ſcheme hath the tendency, and is reducible to the conſequences, we have attributed to it, all but infidels will allow this to be a full demonſtration of it's falſhood. Whether the fallacy of the reaſoning of his book can be diſtinctly traced, or with what claſs of writers it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incides, is not the queſtion—But whether the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are juſtly drawn.</p>

               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:011623_0152_0F87760B37B0C278"/>IF any, who may think the 'things which have been alledged worthy of being read, or of ſo much notice as to ſay much about them, ſhould have their indignation or diſdain raiſed,' we can truly ſay, that we meant to raiſe neither. We ſat down with a determination to avoid every thing perſonal. If we have broken through this determination, it is an inadvertence we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect. Whatever we think of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſyſtem, we doubt not the goodneſs of his heart; and believe he is entered into the reward of a good and faithful ſervant, where even great men ſee they knew but in part while they tabernacled in fleſh, and perhaps entertained ſome dangerous errors. For we have not ſo learned Chriſt as to infer the badneſs of any man's heart from the falſhood of his ſpeculative opinions.</p>
