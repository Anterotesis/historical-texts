            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE puzzle' attending di≈øputes on ≈øuch kind of ≈øubjects as Mr. EDWARDS's book treats of, is probably the principal rea≈øon why no animadver≈øions on his di≈øcour≈øe have been yet publi≈øhed. It was pre≈øumed that few who might read it would be≈øtow attention enough to under≈øtand it; and of tho≈øe who ≈øhould atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively read and under≈øtand it, few would admit its foundation principles. The author of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent examination is not without apprehen≈øion, that the rea≈øon, which hath di≈ø≈øuaded others, will be thought ≈øufficient to have di≈ø≈øuaded him, from ≈øuch an undertaking. He acknowledgeth that he was di≈øcouraged with <hi>only reading</hi> this elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and intricate performance ≈øome years ≈øince. Yet from the great reputation of Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and prevalence of his doctrine, he came to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution of giving this book another and attentive reading: In con≈øequence of which, the following remarks were drawn up 'the motive' of his 'pre≈øent writing' and publication 'is a per≈øua≈øion of the fal≈øhood of' Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s '≈øcheme; and this per≈øua≈øion' he 'grants and ≈øees is <hi>nece≈ø≈øary,</hi>' he 'cannot help this judgment.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Jack≈øon on human liberty, in an≈øwer to Cato's letters.</note> And as he hath no manner of doubt but the foundation princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the book before him are fal≈øe, ≈øo he e≈øteems them of mo≈øt dangerous tendency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:011623_0004_0F877775DA842988"/>IN a <hi>≈øpeculative</hi> and <hi>metaphy≈øical</hi> view, the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hath been largely di≈øcu≈ø≈øed by ≈øome of the able≈øt writers. The reader may be a≈ø≈øured, that as little metaphy≈øical rea≈øoning as po≈ø≈øible is u≈øed in the following pages. For ≈øuch rea≈øoning the author hath neither abilities, inclination or lei≈øure; be≈øides that there is no great occa≈øion, and that he per≈øuades him≈øelf it would not be edifying. His principal aim is to con≈øider the ≈øubject in a <hi>practical</hi> view. In <hi>this</hi> view of liberty and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity there is no puzzle, whatever difficulties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ≈øubject when con≈øidered ab≈øtractly. The inqui≈øitive may find a full an≈øwer to the principal arguments of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book, ≈øpeculatively con≈øidered, in Dr. <hi>Samuel Clark</hi>'s demon≈øtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the being and attributes of GOD, in an≈øwer to <hi>Hobbs, Spinoza,</hi> and their followers; in the ≈øame learned writer's replies to papers from Mr. <hi>Leibnitz,</hi> and remarks on Mr. <hi>Collin</hi>'s book on human liberty; in <hi>Jack≈øon</hi>'s defence of liberty again≈øt <hi>Cato</hi>'s letters, and vindication of the ≈øame ≈øubject in an≈øwer to <hi>Collins.</hi> To whom the author gladly refers, as having ≈øaved him a ta≈øk to which he pretends not to be equal. Others might be mentioned, who have an≈øwered ≈øimilar arguments two thou≈øand years ago.</p>
            <p>AS we are immediately con≈øcious of liberty, as it is a truth of the highe≈øt importance, no embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra≈øsments in theory attending the admi≈ø≈øion of it, can oblige us to give it up‚Äîe≈øpecially as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it plungeth us into a deeper labyrinth. The human intellect is imperfect; con≈øequently, things may be con≈øi≈øtent though we cannot ≈øee <hi>how.</hi> The principal purpo≈øe metaphy≈øicks can ≈øerve on practical ≈øubjects is to ob≈øcure them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:011623_0005_0F8777779C17CD90"/>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> indeed profe≈ø≈øeth him≈øelf an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for liberty. Had he profe≈ø≈øedly denied it, the author would not have engaged in this intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate di≈øpute: For he e≈øteems the denial of liberty a like ab≈øurdity and extravagance as the denial of <hi>motion;</hi> or a <hi>material world;</hi> both which have been denied, and the contrary pretended to be demon≈øtrated, again≈øt the univer≈øal experience of mankind. Tho≈øe things which no man can deny without impeachment of ab≈øurdity and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; it ≈øeems ab≈øurd to attempt a formal proof of. Should a man, for example, endeavour to convince one who might require a ≈øtring of ≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logi≈øms to prove, that the ≈øun ≈øhines in a clear day, at twelve o'clock, he would have a very idle imployment: Let him that que≈øtions it open his eyes, and he cannot want conviction. Let a man look into his own brea≈øt, and he cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inward freedom‚Äî<hi>Inward freedom</hi>‚ÄîFor if freedom be not in the <hi>mind,</hi> it is no where. And liberty in the mind implies <hi>≈øelf-determination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This kind</hi> of liberty our author denies. In this ≈øen≈øe of liberty alone hath he any controver≈øy with the writers he oppo≈øeth. His di≈øagreement with Lord <hi>Kaims,</hi> 
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Author of the e≈ø≈øays on the principles of morality and natural religion.</note> is rather in <hi>words</hi> than any thing <hi>real,</hi> notwith≈øtanding what our author hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed to ≈øcreen him≈øelf from the imputation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ≈øame ≈øcheme. Their general rea≈øoning is the ≈øame. They rea≈øon on the ≈øame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and only differ about the meaning of the word <hi>nece≈ø≈øity,</hi> and a few other words and phra≈øes. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> affirms, that every volition and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral action is determined by a moral nece≈ø≈øity, which is as ab≈øolute as natural; and that moral habits
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:011623_0006_0F8777781F375158"/>
are owing to <hi>the nature of things.</hi> He allows on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>external</hi> liberty, ≈øuch as is the effect of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity in the will‚Äîand con≈øtantly denies a power of ≈øelf-determination. Lord <hi>Kaims</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> affirm, 'that man hath, in no ca≈øe, a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ≈øelf-determination; but is, in all his actions, determined by a moral nece≈ø≈øity'‚Äîwhich nece≈ø≈øity they hold to be as real as any other. The only difference is, that Lord <hi>Kaims,</hi> while he allows that GOD has implanted in man's nature an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible feeling of liberty, maintains, that this feeling is <hi>fallacious:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> denies the ≈øub≈øi≈øtence of any ≈øuch relation as we ≈øignify by the words cau≈øe and effect. But whether liberty, as maintained by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> be not altogether <hi>hypothetic,</hi> may appear from the following pages. And as to his notion of cau≈øe and of effect, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he u≈øes the former word for any <hi>antecedent,</hi> or the <hi>occa≈øion</hi> of an event or thing, and the latter for the <hi>con≈øequence</hi> of another thing (as he tells us he ≈øometimes doth, p. 58.59.) he ≈øo far agrees with Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> in <hi>words</hi> as well as <hi>≈øen≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE author hath only given the outlines of ≈øome (among many other) arguments which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd to his mind to evince the a≈øpect Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>'s ≈øcheme hath on the moral perfections and government of GOD, and its con≈øequent practical tendency. Had he enlarged on them, it would have lengthened out the en≈øuing exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination much beyond what either he or the reader would chu≈øe. The number of pages is now double to what he at fir≈øt de≈øigned. He hopes for the patience and candor of the public, to who≈øe opinion he ≈øubmits the≈øe remarks. If they are ju≈øt, they need no apology; if not, no apology can be of any ≈øervice. If any ≈øhould
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:011623_0007_0F8777799BE13118"/>
≈øuppo≈øe that in one re≈øpect at le≈øt an apology ≈øhould be made, viz for undertaking to criticize the writings of ≈øo di≈øtingui≈øhed an author as Mr. <hi>Edwards;</hi> the an≈øwer is, that if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular de≈øign of the propo≈øed examination is properly pur≈øued and executed, and that re≈øpect pre≈øerved which is due to the character of a gentleman of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s merit and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, the author hath not tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed: But of the≈øe he is not <hi>him≈øelf</hi> the proper judge; though he hopes to be acquitted (in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the≈øe re≈øpects e≈øpecially) by every one that is. Whatever reception his performance may meet with, he is con≈øcious of the rectitude of his own intentions.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION, Exhibiting a general view of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ≈øcheme; with the de≈øign and method propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in the≈øe remarks.</head>
            <p>IT is quite be≈øide the purpo≈øe of the following remarks to enquire, Whether the general ≈øcheme of doctrine Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> intended to e≈øtabli≈øh in his enquiry be rational and ≈øcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. It is only the <hi>foundation principle</hi> we aim to con≈øider: The ≈øy≈øtem built hereupon, whether true or fal≈øe, is not, by the generality of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vini≈øtic Divines, made to depend on the <hi>≈øame</hi> ba≈øis.</p>
            <p>THE principal ≈øubject of the book before us is, 'What determines the will?' And through the whole performance great pains is taken to demon≈øtrate, that moral nece≈ø≈øity and liberty are convertible terms. The perplexity, confu≈øion, and uncertainty, which di≈øqui≈øitions of this ≈øort are attended with, is ≈øufficiently known. We ≈øhall endeavour to keep out of the clouds as much as the nature of the ≈øubject will admit.</p>
            <p>'THE po≈øition of chief importance,' we are told is, <hi>That the will is nece≈ø≈øarily determined by the ≈øtronge≈øt motive;</hi> meaning by the ≈øtronge≈øt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive 'that, which, in the mind's pre≈øent view, hath the greate≈øt appearance of good.' 'Every act of the will hath a certain fixed connection herewith, and depends hereupon, as it's cau≈øe‚Äî

or the ground and rea≈øon of it.' <note n="*" place="bottom">Enquiry part I. ≈øect. 2.</note> In ≈øupport of which it is ≈øaid, that 'nothing ever comes to pa≈øs without a proportionable cau≈øe‚Äîthat the acts of the will, and material things, have a like nece≈ø≈øary dependance on a cau≈øe without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves‚Äîthat moral cau≈øes may be cau≈øes in as proper a ≈øen≈øe as any cau≈øes whatever‚Äîand moral nece≈ø≈øity may be as ab≈øolute as natural.' <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Enquiry p 30, 40, 48, 58, 52, 66, and pa≈ø≈øim.</note>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED, by the word <hi>cau≈øe</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains him≈øelf to mean, not only 'that which hath a po≈øitive <hi>efficiency,</hi> or influence to <hi>produce</hi> a thing, or bring it to pa≈øs;' but '≈øometimes any <hi>antecedent,</hi> either natural or moral, po≈øitive or negative, on which an event, either a thing, or the manner and circum≈øtance of a thing, ≈øo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, that it is the <hi>ground and rea≈øon,</hi> in whole, or in part, why it is rather than not; or why it is as it is, rather than otherwi≈øe.'<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Enquiry p. 57, 58, 9.</note> At the ≈øame time he a≈ø≈øerts, that every act of the will is an 'effect nece≈ø≈øarily dependent and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent on a cau≈øe, which he calls an <hi>efficient</hi> cau≈øe; to who≈øe' determination and command volition is as much <hi>≈øubject,</hi> as the motions of the hands and feet to the volitions which determine and command them‚Äîthat the acts of the will are as '<hi>pa≈ø≈øive</hi> with re≈øpect to the antecedent cau≈øe, ground, or rea≈øon of them.' <note n="¬ß" place="bottom">P. 183, 184.</note> He maintains, upon the whole, an univer≈øal nece≈ø≈øity‚Äîthat all beings, all events, the manner and all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances of things are nece≈ø≈øarily determined. Yet be profe≈ø≈øeth him≈øelf an advocate for liberty, and labours a di≈øtinction between natural and
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:011623_0011_0F87778136FA2478"/>
moral nece≈ø≈øity, which di≈øtinction he apprehends important‚Äînatural nece≈ø≈øity being incon≈øi≈øtent with prai≈øe or blame, while moral is not. The liberty he admits is, however, merely <hi>external,</hi> and the re≈øult of <hi>nece≈ø≈øity in the mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a general idea of his plan, ≈øo far as it will fall under pre≈øent con≈øideration. In pur≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our remarks on which, we ≈øhall,</p>

            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECT. I. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath not ≈øhewn wherein the <hi>ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> of motive con≈øi≈øts.</head>
               <p>THE enquiry in this place is not, Whether the highe≈øt motive hath always a cau≈øal influence on the will? But, admitting this to be the ca≈øe, what it is that <hi>cau≈øeth</hi> any ≈øuppo≈øed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to <hi>be</hi> highe≈øt in the mind's view? wherein doth its <hi>energy,</hi> or power con≈øi≈øt? In the next ≈øection, we ≈øhall examine, whether the will is indeed determined, in every act, by the highe≈øt motive.</p>
               <p>WHEN, between two or more objects in the mind's view, one appears mo≈øt agreable; (from whatever cau≈øe,) this appearance is the highe≈øt or ≈øtronge≈øt motive, according to our author. Now as there is a manife≈øt difference between an object's <hi>actually appearing</hi> mo≈øt agreable, and the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of this appearance; the proper que≈øtion, in the fir≈øt place, is, What is the ground, rea≈øon, or cau≈øe of the agreable appearance <hi>it≈øelf.</hi> For admitting the ≈øtronge≈øt motive to be the more <hi>immediate</hi> cau≈øe of volition, how doth this prove that it is the <hi>original</hi> cau≈øe? <hi>Whence</hi> is it that any propo≈øed object hath the greate≈øt appearance of good? From what cau≈øe? Hither we mu≈øt <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:011623_0013_0F8777829AA3FDF8"/>
recur for the ground of volition; [Po≈ø≈øibly not ≈øtop here.] Till the an≈øwer to this que≈øtion is found, the original ground of volition is not di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. For if every circum≈øtance of things hath an an≈øwerable cau≈øe, that there is a cau≈øe why this or that motive is highe≈øt.<note n="*" place="bottom">'In the que≈øtion, <hi>What determines the will?</hi> it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted, that <hi>≈øomething</hi> determines it. And the controver≈øy on this head is, where the <hi>foundation</hi> of the will's determination is,' (p. 56.) Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> ≈øaith expre≈øly, 'That the act of volition it≈øelf (or the will) is <hi>always</hi> determined by that in the mind's view of an object, which <hi>cau≈øes it to appear</hi> mo≈øt agreable.' (p. 12) Here, then, is the FOUNDATION of the will's determination. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s bu≈øine≈øs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to his own ≈øtate of the que≈øtion, was, to point out what <hi>cau≈øeth an object to appear</hi> mo≈øt agreable. For if that which CAUSETH <hi>this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> be the real cau≈øe of volition, then the agreable appearance ITSELF cannot be the cau≈øe. The agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearance, or highe≈øt motive, as he ob≈øerves, is nothing <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> from volition, but the <hi>very thing,</hi> as will be particularly ≈øhewn in the next ≈øection. We would here ju≈øt hint, by the way, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath given ample te≈øtimony again≈øt 'the po≈øition of chief importance in his di≈øcour≈øe.' For that the highe≈øt motive doth not <hi>always</hi> determine volition, is pretty apparent, if it is <hi>always</hi> determined by that in or about an object which <hi>cau≈øeth</hi> it to be, and appear, mo≈øt agreable. The will, in no in≈øtance what≈øoever, is determined by the agreable appearance, but by the cau≈øe of ≈øuch appearance.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THOUGH Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ≈øuppo≈øed the re≈øoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this que≈øtion was 'not nece≈ø≈øary to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe,' <note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">p. 12.‚Äî16.</note> yet he hath, in ≈øeveral particulars, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked what he apprehended may 'have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence' in <hi>cau≈øing</hi> 'the objects of volition to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear agreable to the mind.' He a≈ø≈øigns, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011623_0014_0F8777835D785790"/>
'the apparent nature and circum≈øtances of the object‚Äîthe manner of the mind's view of it‚Äîthe ≈øtate of the mind, by nature or educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on‚Äîor the frame it is in on a particular occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.' But how is this any an≈øwer? Doth not the que≈øtion immediately ari≈øe, <hi>How</hi> comes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to have ≈øuch a particular <hi>appearance</hi> to the mind? <hi>Whence</hi> is it apparently <hi>circum≈øtanced</hi> as it is? <hi>Whence</hi> doth the mind view it in ≈øuch a particular <hi>manner?</hi> Or from ≈øuch a particular <hi>idea</hi> of it, whether 'faint, or clear, ≈øtrong and lively?' <hi>Whence</hi> is the <hi>≈øtate, temper,</hi> or <hi>frame</hi> of the mind what it is? Until the≈øe things are ≈øolved, the que≈øtion, Whence is it that 'a per≈øon's plea≈øure is wrong' or right? hath received no an≈øwer, unle≈øs 'a very impertinent one.'</p>
               <p>THERE is no great difficulty, ≈øaith Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> in ≈øhewing, not only that it <hi>mu≈øt needs be ≈øo,</hi> but al≈øo <hi>how it is ≈øo,</hi> that the mind mu≈øt be influenced in it's choice by ≈øomething that hath a <hi>preponderating</hi> influence upon it.' <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 83.</note> But if 'a preponderating influence on the mind' implies that the choice is <hi>already made,</hi> it may 'be a matter of no ≈ømall difficulty' to ≈øhew, how the mind, in <hi>making</hi> it's choice, can 'be influenced by ≈øomething that hath a preponderating influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon it.'</p>
               <p>While writing the fir≈øt part of his book, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ≈øeems to have been ≈øen≈øible, is was no very ea≈øy matter 'to ≈øhew <hi>how it is ≈øo,</hi>' or why, that the mind is always determined by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt motive. His words are, (p. 12.) 'Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to enumerate all things pertaining to the mind's view of the objects of volition, which
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011623_0015_0F87778441F25E08"/>
have influence in their appearing agreable to the mind, <hi>would be a matter of no ≈ømall difficulty,</hi> and might require a treati≈øe by it≈øelf, and is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to my pre≈øent purpo≈øe.' But (without tarrying to reconcile this <hi>≈øeeming</hi> contra≈øt) is this a matter attended with greater difficulty, or of le≈øs importance, or would it require a larger trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øe, than to ≈øhew, what determines the will to this ≈øide, or that?</p>
               <p>WE allow, that 'the <hi>common people</hi> do not a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up in their reflections and ab≈øtractions to the <hi>metaphy≈øical ≈øources, relations</hi> and <hi>dependencies</hi> of things, in order to form their notion of faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs‚ÄîThey do not wait till they have decided by their <hi>refinings,</hi> what fir≈øt determines the will; whether it be determined by ≈øomething <hi>extrin≈øic</hi> or <hi>intrin≈øic.</hi> If this were the ca≈øe, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, yea, the far greater part of mankind, nine hundred and ninety nine out of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand would live and die without having any ≈øuch notion as that of fault ever entering into their heads; or without ≈øo much as once having any conception, that any body was to be either blamed or commended for any thing. They do not take any part of their notion of fault or blame from the re≈øolution of any ≈øuch que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.'<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 298, 99.</note> A fuller acknowledgment Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> could not have made, that the grand que≈øtion, the main ≈øubject of his book, <hi>What determines the will?</hi> is a ≈øubtle and unprofitable one. We are therefore at a lo≈øs for the motive of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an elaborate volume to determine a point not to be determined‚Äîat lea≈øt, by his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, of no u≈øe to <hi>one out of a thou≈øand of mankind.</hi>

                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:011623_0016_0F877784E02F8C38"/>P. 39, 40. Our author ob≈øerves, that 'into the meaning of the word <hi>liberty</hi> is not taken any thing of the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> or <hi>original</hi> of choice‚Äî<hi>how</hi> the per≈øon came to have ≈øuch a volition; whether it was cau≈øed by ≈øome external motive, or internal, habitual bias; whether it was nece≈ø≈øarily connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ≈øomething foregoing, or not connected. Let the per≈øon come by his volition or choice how he will, yet, if he is able, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the way to hinder his pur≈øuing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting his will, the man is fully and perfectly free, according to the primary and common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of freedom'.</p>
               <p>IT hence appears, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> e≈øteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it neither nece≈ø≈øary nor u≈øeful for us to know the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> or <hi>origin</hi> of the will's determination‚Äî '<hi>how</hi> a per≈øon comes to have ≈øuch a volition.' And yet it was a main point in his view to ≈øhew, that the ≈øtronge≈øt motive is the <hi>immediate</hi> cau≈øe of every act of choice. Now, as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved, it is ju≈øt as nece≈ø≈øary and important to know the <hi>original</hi> and <hi>ultimate,</hi> as the next and more immediate cau≈øe of volition. The next and immediate cau≈øe is but the effect of ≈øome <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> cau≈øe; this of another, and ≈øo on. 'The determination of the will, ≈øaith Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> ≈øuppo≈øeth an <hi>effect,</hi> which mu≈øt have a <hi>cau≈øe.</hi> If the will be <hi>determined,</hi> there mu≈øt be a <hi>determiner.</hi>' <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 7.</note>Granted. And if the ≈øtronge≈øt motive be the determiner, this al≈øo mu≈øt be determined by ≈øome preceeding cau≈øe. There is a cau≈øe or rea≈øon of its being ≈øtronge≈øt‚Äî≈øomething from which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives, and wherein lies, its great ≈øtrength. If therefore, it was of any importance to ≈øhew, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable

to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s de≈øign) what deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the will, and to prove that the ≈øtronge≈øt motive doth it; it was at lea≈øt of equal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to point out, what it is that cau≈øeth ≈øuch motive to be, or appear, ≈øtronge≈øt. The real cau≈øe of volition is not found, till this matter is explained. The enquiry is not pur≈øued to the end, and the plan of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book but half executed.</p>
               <p>'SUPPOSE a <hi>chain</hi> hung down out of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, from an <hi>unknown</hi> height; and although every link of it gravitated toward the earth, and what it hung upon was not vi≈øible, yet it did not de≈øcend, but kept its ≈øituation: And, upon this, a que≈øtion ≈øhould ari≈øe, What ≈øupported or kept up this chain? Would it be a ≈øufficient an≈øwer, to ≈øay, that the <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> or lowe≈øt link hung upon the ≈øecond, or that next above it?' without proceeding to ≈øhew what the ≈øecond hung upon'; 'or rather, the <hi>fir≈øt and ≈øecond together;</hi>' and ≈øo on, until it was found 'what ≈øupported the <hi>whole.</hi> Thus it is in a chain of cau≈øes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.

Now the preferablene≈øs of the object in its own nature, and as appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by rea≈øon, not being always the ground or cau≈øe of its appearing mo≈øt agreable, but ≈øomething diver≈øe or contrary, in many in≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the que≈øtion is, How came beings made upright to mi≈øtake their happine≈øs upon the whole? For mi≈øtake it they mu≈øt; (by ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition) or otherwi≈øe in the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> act of ≈øin they could not be determined by the greate≈øt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent good.</p>
               <p>HERE we may enquire, Whether <hi>in innocence</hi> any thing but conformity and ≈øubjection to the Creator could appear to be the greate≈øt good? If not, then, on Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s hypothe≈øis, an innocent creature could never rebel. If, on the

other hand, rebellion again≈øt the ≈øupreme cau≈øe had the appearance of the greate≈øt good to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocence, and to apo≈øtate angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their fall, how doth this con≈øi≈øt with the general opinion that hath been entertained of the original extent of their rational faculties, and the ≈øpiritual image of GOD with which they were endowed? The powers of intellect in innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> for example, have been ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed ≈øo great, that con≈øi≈øtently herewith it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted but he had the fulle≈øt view of duty, and of his highe≈øt intere≈øt as connected with it; and con≈øequently could have no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ≈øuperior motive to tran≈øgre≈øs. If in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence he could not he≈øitate but it was his highe≈øt duty to refrain from the forbidden fruit, he could not, (by ≈øuppo≈øition) he≈øitate but ≈øuch act of forbearance was al≈øo his highe≈øt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs. Therefore the greate≈øt <hi>apparent</hi> good was to retain his integrity. Con≈øequently, in tran≈øgre≈ø≈øing, his will was not determined <hi>by,</hi> but <hi>again≈øt,</hi> the highe≈øt motive. Nor can we conceive of a <hi>pre≈øumptuous</hi> ≈øinner, on any other ≈øuppo≈øition‚Äîmeaning hereby, one who acts again≈øt <hi>pre≈øent conviction</hi>‚Äîor <hi>directly in oppo≈øition to the light he hath in the very article of ≈øinning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT will, perhaps, be ≈øaid, that innocent <hi>Adam</hi>'s highe≈øt good was to <hi>forfeit his integrity.</hi> And indeed, on any other hypothe≈øis, the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øy ≈øeems to be brought to an i≈ø≈øue, and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of being always nece≈ø≈øarily determined by the highe≈øt motive given up. Now ≈øhould this be ≈øaid, (which is at lea≈øt imply'd, if not expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, in what Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath remarked <note n="*" place="bottom">Part iv. Sect. 9.</note> on

the advantage of ≈øin to the creation) we might a≈øk, whether ≈øin could appear mo≈øt agreable to an innocent creature from the <hi>nature of the object in it≈øelf?</hi> This, we pre≈øume Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> would not ≈øay. And if it could not thus appear from its nature, it will be difficult to ≈øhew how ≈øin could be, in any ≈øen≈øe, the creature's highe≈øt good‚ÄîOr how an <hi>innocent</hi> creature could <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi> it to be ≈øo. But whenever it can be ≈øhewn, that innocent man, or rebel angels before their fall, had a full view of the ≈øuperior advantages of ≈øin above innocence and righteou≈øne≈øs, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no body will think it worth while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert farther about any doctrine of religion. An hypothe≈øis ≈øo extraordinary, requires extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary proof. We ≈øhall have occa≈øion to re≈øume this point under another part of our remarks.</p>
               <p>IN regard to the fir≈øt entrance of ≈øin into the world, we acknowledge it is an event, which <hi>all</hi> denominations of profe≈ø≈øing <hi>chri≈øtians</hi> are <hi>equally</hi> holden to account for‚Äîyea, <hi>dei≈øts</hi> as much as chri≈øtians.

But if the <hi>fir≈øt ≈øinful volition</hi> was the nece≈ø≈øary product of the highe≈øt motive; then rebellion again≈øt GOD was di≈øcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be the highe≈øt good, <hi>when rea≈øon and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment freely dictated and governed;</hi> which they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did <hi>while the creature continued innocent.</hi> Yea, it follows, that the highe≈øt motive to the <hi>Creator,</hi> as well as creature, was in behalf of moral evil. How then is ≈øin ≈øuch an <hi>infinite evil</hi> as we have been taught to believe it?

Or allowing ≈øin to be the greate≈øt evil, that man mu≈øt have an hard ta≈øk, who undertakes to ≈øhew, that it is al≈øo the greate≈øt good: And if not the greate≈øt good, how it could have this appearance to creatures in a ≈øtate of rectitude‚Äîand even to Almighty GOD him≈øelf. Or if it could not have this appearance to any being in a ≈øtate of rectitude, how was it then po≈ø≈øible for beings made upright to fall; on ≈øuppo≈øition that no in≈øtance of volition can be mentioned but what is the effect of, or determined by, the greate≈øt apparent good? The very idea of <hi>moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> appears to be lo≈øt, if we pur≈øue to the end ≈øuch an enquiry as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath led us into.</p>
               <p>"THAT the will always follows the la≈øt prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical judgment of the under≈øtanding, hath pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed current as a maxim in the ≈øchools: So that if a ≈øick man ≈øhall, in contradiction to his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øician's judgment, and his own, indulge his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for meat or drink, he mu≈øt be ≈øuppo≈øed previou≈øly to have convinced him≈øelf, that his pre≈øent indulgence is of more value to him than his health, or even his life. If other men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their unrea≈øonable inclinations at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of intere≈øt, reputation, inward peace, and everla≈øting ≈øalvation, they mu≈øt be ≈øuppo≈øed to judge with them≈øelves, that this vicious indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ought to be preferred to intere≈øt, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, peace of con≈øcience, and everla≈øting ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: This way of thinking, which pa≈ø≈øeth ≈øo ea≈øily with the learned, goes mighty ill down with men of plain under≈øtanding; who, on the contrary, incline to believe, that in the practice of vice men either do not think at all, but act
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011623_0026_0F877799DE6422D8"/>
like mere animals by the blind impul≈øe of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and affection; or if they attend to what they are doing, that they ba≈øely and ab≈øurdly prefer a pre≈øent gratification to what they <hi>know</hi> to be their mo≈øt valuable intere≈øts in this life and the next.</p>
               <p>THE truth is, that man is a compound of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and animal affections, that without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to him≈øelf, ≈øometimes the one, and at other times the other, mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity prevail, as they happen to be ≈øtronge≈øt; and that, through the love of pre≈øent plea≈øure, and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to pre≈øent pain, or through mere pu≈øillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, we too often decline the combat; and, in contradiction to our rea≈øon, our con≈øcience, and all the mo≈øt weighty con≈øiderations of honour and intere≈øt, re≈øpecting this life and the next, ≈øuffer the animal to prevail over the rational affections.</p>
               <p>FOR the remedy, then, of this greate≈øt of all evils, it is not enough the judgment be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,; becau≈øe however de≈øirous we are of having the authority of our judgment for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we do, and however much we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reconcile our judgment with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; yet when that cannot be done, we will too often pur≈øue our inclination in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to our judgment. The only remedy therefore under heaven is, to endeavour, by all means in our power, to make our rational a match, and, as much as po≈ø≈øible, an overmatch, for our animal affections: In which employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have a title to all the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, which the teachers of mankind can afford us; and to

think it clearly follows, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath equally failed in pointing out the more <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> cau≈øe of volition, as its <hi>original</hi> cau≈øe. By his own declaration, the will is not determined <hi>by,</hi> but the <hi>≈øame</hi> thing with, the ≈øtronge≈øt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. He hath only ≈øhewn what determines <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal action or conduct</hi>‚Äîa point very different from the determination of the <hi>will.</hi> And hence (according to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own rea≈øoning) the enquiry, 'What determines the will?' is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øely the ≈øame with this, 'What <hi>cau≈øeth</hi> an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to appear mo≈øt agreable?' A very different enquiry, ≈øurely, from this, Whether volition is <hi>as,</hi> or according to, the agreable appearance of an object? unle≈øs we will confound cau≈øe and effect. The agreable appearance, ≈øaith Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> is the mind's preference, choice, or determination. But <hi>antecedent</hi> to the mind's view of the object, there mu≈øt be ≈øomething in it [the object] to cau≈øe it to appear agreable when viewed‚Äî≈øomething independent on, and prior to the view‚Äîor the mind mu≈øt be in ≈øuch a particular ≈øtate, frame, or temper‚Äîor view the object under ≈øuch and ≈øuch circum≈øtances, in order to it's appearing thus and thus agreable.

That which cau≈øeth the agreable appearance, produceth the highe≈øt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that is, volition. Upon Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own ≈øtate of the que≈øtion, there is no making any ≈øen≈øe of his words, to ≈øay, that the highe≈øt motive is the cau≈øe, or determiner of volition.

This he hath, in <hi>expre≈øs</hi> terms denied. And yet great part of his book was wrote to prove it. It is the 'po≈øition of chief importance in his di≈øcour≈øe.'</p>
               <p>IT will po≈ø≈øibly be ≈øaid, 'There is no need of ≈øuppo≈øing the ≈øtronge≈øt motive to be <hi>prior</hi> to, or <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> from, volition; but that the latter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the former in the very act of voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'. To this it is ≈øufficient to an≈øwer in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own words, 'that the will <hi>is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by</hi> the greate≈øt apparent good, but the action, which is the <hi>fruit</hi> of volition, is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined hereby'. Though we may in≈øi≈øt on this as a full reply to the objection; yet we may al≈øo add, with much propriety, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s remarks <note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">P. 53,‚Äî56,</note> on the ≈øcheme of his opponents, with the ≈ømall alteration, which the reader will ob≈øerve by the words not included under inverted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</p>
               <p>FIRST, 'IF the determining act' (the highe≈øt motive) 'be before the determined in order of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> being the cau≈øe, ground, or rea≈øon of its exi≈øtence, this as much proves it to be <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> from it, and <hi>independent</hi> on it, as if it were in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>time'.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY, 'If the determining act' (the ≈øtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt motive)' is not before the determined, in order of time or nature, nor di≈øtinct from it‚ÄîI would on this ob≈øerve, that the thing in que≈øtion ≈øeems to be forgotten, or kept out of ≈øight, <hi>in a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and unintelligiblene≈øs of ≈øpeech.</hi> The que≈øtion
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011623_0037_0F8777A8ECF8CD58"/>
is, What influenceth, directs, or determines the mind or will to come to ≈øuch a choice as it does? or what is the cau≈øe, ground, or rea≈øon, why it concludes thus, and not otherwi≈øe? Now it mu≈øt be an≈øwered, according to, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s 'no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the will influences, orders, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it≈øelf'. For the will is determined by the ≈øtronge≈øt motive, and this is nothing <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> from volition. Now that the ≈øtronge≈øt motive 'cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth, influenceth, and determineth the will, and yet is not antecedent to it;' nor di≈øtinct from it, 'is a contradiction.' To ≈øay that one 'thing is the cau≈øe or rea≈øon of another, is to ≈øay, that the former is prior to the latter. The cau≈øe is di≈øtinct from the effect, and prior to it. To ≈øay, that the ≈øtronge≈øt motive, 'orders, influences, determines the act of volition,' and yet is not 'properly di≈øtinct, is to make the exertion both cau≈øe and effect. The que≈øtion is, What is the cau≈øe and rea≈øon of the ≈øoul's exerting ≈øuch an act? To which the an≈øwer is, the ≈øoul exerts ≈øuch an act, and that is the cau≈øe of it. And ≈øo, by this, the exertion mu≈øt be prior to, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from it≈øelf.'</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, 'If the meaning be, that volition has no cau≈øe, and is no effect, but comes into exi≈øtence <hi>of it≈øelf,</hi> without any ground or rea≈øon'; Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> then, 'doth nothing but confound him≈øelf and others with words without a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had a common right with others to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs his thoughts in his own way. But we ≈øhould have been glad, if he had fixed a preci≈øe meaning to his own terms. And though he hath ≈øpent a large number of pages (from p. 1,‚Äî43) in explaining terms, yet his definitions are ≈øo lengthy and lax, his u≈øe of ≈øome words ≈øo different from what is common, yea, ≈øo differently does he him≈øelf u≈øe the ≈øame terms, that the reader is almo≈øt unavoidably confounded in a jumble of indeterminate words and phra≈øes. We ≈øhall give a few in≈øtances. The term <hi>will</hi> is ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times u≈øed for an <hi>ab≈øtract</hi> power, property, or faculty; (p. 38, 39.) Sometimes it is confounded with <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> (p. 11, 12.) while at other times, and indeed more generally, it is u≈øed to denote the <hi>agent</hi>‚ÄîAs where the will is ≈øaid to be <hi>the ≈øubject of commands,</hi> &amp;c ‚Äîwhere the <hi>acts</hi> of the will are ≈øpoken of‚Äî where motives are repre≈øented as <hi>influencing</hi> and <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining</hi> it, i. e. the agent. (For motives do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence meer properties.)</p>
                     <p>By <hi>motive</hi> (the highe≈øt) he explains him≈øelf to mean the ≈øame as <hi>volition;</hi> (p. 11. 12.) while he al≈øo under≈øtands by it ≈øomething <hi>extrin≈øic</hi> ≈øtanding in the mind's view, and having a <hi>tendency,</hi> by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance it makes, to excite and engage the mind to ≈øuch and ≈øuch volitions‚Äîi. e. to incline and di≈øpo≈øe it to ≈øuch and ≈øuch a choice. Again, he means by motives, <hi>inclination</hi> or <hi>di≈øpo≈øition,</hi> and expre≈øly blends 'moral motives and inducements' with <hi>'habits and di≈øpo≈øitions</hi> of the heart,' making them the ≈øame. (p. 29, 31.) That is, motives are ≈øomething <hi>without</hi> them≈øelves, and have a <hi>tendency</hi> to excite and engage to them≈øelves, and are not <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> from them≈øelves. (p. 8, 9, 11.)</p>
                     <p>In like manner, while he is taking pains to make out a di≈øtinction between <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral nece≈ø≈øity,</hi> he confounds them‚Äî(at lea≈øt in our apprehen≈øion, Part I. Sect. 4.)</p>
                     <p>THE term <hi>cau≈øe,</hi> as it hath been generally u≈øed, denotes <hi>efficiency,</hi> and has relation to an effect produced‚ÄîAnd Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> him≈øelf ≈øays (after <hi>Spinoza and Hobbs</hi>) 'that if it be not ≈øufficient to produce the effect, or doth not always <hi>nece≈ø≈øarily</hi> produce it, there is no ≈øuch relation ≈øub≈øi≈øting as we ≈øignify by the terms cau≈øe and effect. That which ≈øeems to be the cau≈øe, can be no cau≈øe.' Yet he tells us, 'that he ≈øometimes u≈øes the word cau≈øe to ≈øignify any <hi>antecedent,</hi> which is perhaps rather an <hi>occa≈øion</hi> than a cau≈øe of an event or thing; and the word <hi>effect,</hi> for the <hi>con≈øequence</hi> of another thing'. (p. 58, 59, 103.) But who ever ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed the meer <hi>occa≈øion</hi> of a thing or event to be the cau≈øe thereof, in ≈øuch a ≈øen≈øe as that the thing or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent is <hi>nece≈ø≈øarily</hi> dependent on, connected with, and proceeds from the occa≈øion of it? Our Lord's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming was the antecedent and occa≈øion of di≈øcord and war. Did the≈øe nece≈ø≈øarily proceed from his coming? Was there no more in the con≈øequent than in the antecedent? Had Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> u≈øed the terms occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion and con≈øequence, in≈øtead of cau≈øe and effect, in tho≈øe parts of his book, where (by his own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement) the former would have been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he might have been better under≈øtood, and would have taken a likelier method to 'cut off occa≈øion from cavillers and objectors.' (p. 59, 393, 394, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.)</p>
                     <p>THE reader will al≈øo take notice of the <hi>promi≈øcuous</hi> u≈øe of the words <hi>cau≈øe, ground, rea≈øon.</hi> So far as an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is conformable to right rea≈øon, ≈øo much <hi>rea≈øon</hi> there is for it, and no more.

               <p>UPON the whole: The que≈øtion, What deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the will? is 'unan≈øwered, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns.'

Suppo≈øe this is indeed determined by the will, the enquiry of chief importance is, What determines the will it≈øelf.

But as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> affirms, that the will is the true cau≈øe of external action or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and makes the whole of liberty to lie here, we will examine this po≈øition, on his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>'THE voluntary action, which is the fruit and con≈øequence of volition, is determined by that which appears mo≈øt agreable;' or by the will which 'always is as the greate≈øt apparent good,' and 'not properly di≈øtinct' from it.

               <p>IF, therefore, freedom be not <hi>in the will,</hi> we ≈øhould be glad to know <hi>where</hi> it is?

In other words, the will is no cau≈øe at all. For a nece≈ø≈øary cau≈øe is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ≈øpeaking a cau≈øe; it is nothing di≈øtinct from a meer in≈øtrument. A cau≈øe, ≈øtrictly ≈øo called, mu≈øt be <hi>free;</hi> at lea≈øt ≈øo far as prai≈øe or blame, reward or puni≈øhment, belong to it.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole, external actions mu≈øt ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately be determined, not by the will, but by that cau≈øe which determineth the will, agreable to our author's own principles. The will being in no in≈øtance it's own determiner, there is in no in≈øtance a power or capacity of choice in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. For choice is the ≈øame as the will's deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: A power or capacity of choice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would be a power of ≈øelf-determination, which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s whole ≈øcheme is de≈øigned to ≈øhew the ab≈øurdity of.</p>
               <p>THE ≈øum of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ≈øcheme appears to be this. Liberty con≈øi≈øts in a man's power to

                  <hi>execute</hi> his will‚Äîto <hi>do</hi> or <hi>conduct</hi> according to what is willed. His will <hi>is</hi> (not <hi>determined by,</hi> but is) the greate≈øt apparent good. And yet every volition is the nece≈ø≈øary <hi>effect</hi> of the greate≈øt apparent good, <hi>produced and determined</hi> by it as the <hi>efficient</hi> cau≈øe‚Äîwhich cau≈øe, however, is nothing di≈øtinct from the effect produced. From what particular cau≈øe any object comes to have the greate≈øt appearance of good is yet a ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, of no u≈øe to be known to nine hundred and ninety nine out a thou≈øand of mankind For the ≈øatisfaction of the thou≈øandth per≈øon, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has laboured to explore this ≈øecret; and yet his 'having failed here doth not overthrow the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, which was the thing of chief importance in his di≈øcour≈øe;' for it only remains to be‚Äî explained and proved. Antecedent nece≈ø≈øity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the will; this determines corporeal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and action is voluntary; i. e. is willed, or cau≈øed to be willed‚Äîthere is no <hi>outward compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion</hi> or re≈øtraint in the ca≈øe, but <hi>only</hi> a <hi>nece≈ø≈øary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward determination.</hi> Liberty is indeed nece≈ø≈øary to prai≈øe or blame.

            <p>FIRST, That there is an <hi>intelligent, de≈øigning</hi> author of nature; or original cau≈øe of all beings and things; who (by the terms) is <hi>uncau≈øed</hi>‚Äîex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øting prior to, and exclu≈øive of, all de≈øign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to his exi≈øtence. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has intimated, indeed, that there is <hi>in the nature of things</hi> a foundation for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the being of a GOD, without any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it <hi>from his works</hi>'‚Äîbut adds, 'We have not ≈øtrength of mind to comprehend 'his exi≈øtence' in this '<hi>independent</hi> manner'. The way that mankind come to the knowledge of his being is that which the apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. We fir≈øt <hi>a≈øcend</hi> and prove a <hi>po≈øteriori,</hi> or from <hi>effects,</hi> that there mu≈øt be an eternal cau≈øe. And then, ≈øecondly, prove by argumentation, not intuition, that this being mu≈øt be nece≈ø≈øarily exi≈øtent. And then, thirdly, from the proved nece≈ø≈øity of his exi≈øtence, we may <hi>de≈øcend,</hi> and prove many of his perfections <hi>√† priori'</hi> (P. 60, 61.)</p>
                  <p>But is it arguing <hi>√† priori</hi> to argue from <hi>effects?</hi> 'If ≈øtrict propriety of ≈øpeech be in≈øi≈øted on,' doth not this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind of argument ≈øuppo≈øe, that the being of a GOD may be proved 'without ANY evidence of it from his <hi>works?'</hi> If ≈øo, there ≈øeems to be ≈øome jumble in <hi>de≈øcending</hi> to this argument 'from the <hi>proved</hi> nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of GOD's exi≈øtence'. We cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in what we have here extracted, the terms are changed in the latter part of the paragraph from what they were in the beginning of it. It is fir≈øt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the author's opinion, that there is a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in nature for our coming to the knowledge of the BEING of a GOD, <hi>without any evidence of it from his works.</hi> But at the clo≈øe of the paragraph it is ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that 'from the <hi>proved</hi> nece≈ø≈øity of his <hi>exi≈øtence,</hi> we may prove <hi>many of his</hi> PERFECTIONS <hi>√° priori.'</hi> In the ≈øame place Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ob≈øerves, 'we argue his <hi>being, from</hi> our own being, and the being of other things'‚Äîwhich is the only <hi>medium</hi> to prove the <hi>being</hi> of a GOD (p. 386.) What 'foundation is there then, in the nature of things, for the knowledge of the BEING of a GOD, without <hi>any</hi> evidence of it <hi>from his works'?</hi> What <hi>medium</hi> of proof?</p>
                  <p>Dr. SAMUEL CLARK, in his 'demon≈øtration of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and attributes of GOD,' undertakes to prove, that he 'exi≈øts by a nece≈ø≈øity ab≈øolute in the nature of the thing it≈øelf'‚Äî'a nece≈ø≈øity antecedent. (in the order of nature, and of our ideas, though not of time) to the ≈øuppo≈øition of his exi≈øtence'‚Äîwhich nece≈ø≈øity he a≈ø≈øigns as 'the natural <hi>ground, foundation, cau≈øe,</hi> or <hi>rea≈øon</hi> of GOD's being.'</p>
                  <p>Now though we would not chu≈øe to di≈ø≈øent from ≈øuch a ma≈øter of rea≈øon, yet the enquiry in a manner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it≈øelf upon us, Where is the propriety of ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing any thing, in any ≈øen≈øe, to be the PRIOR ground of the exi≈øtence of the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> cau≈øe? Doth not this convey the idea of an <hi>effect produced?</hi> The Dr. remarks on <hi>Spinoza's</hi> doctrine of nece≈ø≈øity, (or 'the nece≈ø≈øary following of an effect from it's cau≈øe') that 'this nece≈ø≈øity mu≈øt ≈øtill be determined by ≈øomething <hi>antecedent,</hi> and <hi>≈øo on infinitely.'</hi> Might not a Spinozi≈øt reply, that <hi>that</hi> nece≈ø≈øity, which Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> faith is the cau≈øe of the exi≈øtence of GOD mu≈øt be determined by ≈øomething antecedent? and ≈øo on'?</p>
                  <p>The Dr. takes his ri≈øe to the nece≈ø≈øity of the divine exi≈øtence from hence, That 'there hath exi≈øted from eternity ≈øome one independent being, the author of all other beings.' (vid. p. 8,‚Äî15. Edit. 10th.) On this <hi>po≈øtulatum</hi> he proceeds. Hence, and from things ≈øaid in his ≈øeventh letter, it is probable he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meant not to prove the <hi>certain exi≈øtence</hi> of GOD <hi>√† priori,</hi> but his particular <hi>perfections.</hi> 'The infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eternity, unity of GOD, &amp;c mu≈øt be demon≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the nature of nece≈ø≈øary exi≈øtence; from the nature and con≈øequences of that nece≈ø≈øity, by which the fir≈øt cau≈øe exi≈øts' And yet, ≈øpeaking of the '≈øchola≈øtic way of proving the EXISTENCE of the ≈øelf-exi≈øtent being, from the ab≈øolute perfection of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,' the Dr. remarks, 'All or any perfections <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuppo≈øe</hi> exi≈øtence; which is <hi>petitio principii.</hi> But bare nece≈ø≈øity of exi≈øtence doth not <hi>pre≈øuppo≈øe,</hi> but <hi>infer</hi> exi≈øtence. In this ca≈øe, here mu≈øt <hi>nothing be pre≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, no nature what≈øoever,'</hi> (Letter 6th, p. 490, 491.)</p>
                  <p>WHY then did the Dr. lay down his two fir≈øt propo≈øitions (p. 8, 11.) as the <hi>media</hi> of proof? If nece≈ø≈øity 'doth not <hi>pre≈øuppo≈øe,</hi> but <hi>infer</hi> exi≈øtence; yet the <hi>method</hi> the Dr. takes to prove this nece≈ø≈øity PRESUPPOSES a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and exi≈øtence: it ≈øuppo≈øeth that there <hi>exi≈øts</hi> an eternal, independent being‚Äîthe author of all other beings. The very thing to be proved.</p>
                  <p>ADMITTING the Dr's po≈øition, that nece≈ø≈øity is the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of the divine exi≈øtence; to what purpo≈øe is it with an athei≈øt? It takes for granted the thing in que≈øtion. The enquiry is not, <hi>How</hi> GOD exi≈øts? but, <hi>Whether</hi> he exi≈øts? Exi≈øtence, and the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of exi≈øtence, are very di≈øtinct. An enquiry about the latter plainly pre≈øuppo≈øeth the former. So that while the Dr. endeavours to prove, that GOD exi≈øts 'from a cau≈øe within him≈øelf,' he takes for granted, that <hi>there is a GOD;</hi> and only accounts for a peculiar <hi>circum≈øtance,</hi> or this <hi>mode</hi> of his exi≈øtence, that it is 'by a nece≈ø≈øity of nature.' Whereas the ≈øubject of enquiry between an athei≈øt and a thei≈øt is not the <hi>modus</hi> of exi≈øtence, but the ≈øimple truth or <hi>fact</hi>‚Äîis there in <hi>reality</hi> 'an eternal, independent being, the author of all other beings? Now from what can this point po≈ø≈øibly be argued but from the <hi>phaenomena of nature?</hi> If, from ≈øurveying vi≈øible creation, the athei≈øt is not convinced that GOD IS, how can we go a ≈øtep farther with him? Mu≈øt he not think it imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and <hi>petitio principii,</hi> if we undertake to ≈øhew him,‚ÄîHOW GOD exi≈øts? Or to a≈ø≈øign a <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>rea≈øon</hi> of an exi≈øtence, which he believes nothing of? But if from the frame of nature he is convinced of the <hi>certain exi≈øtence</hi> of GOD, he is no longer an athei≈øt, and therefore needs not the argument <hi>√† priori</hi> for his conviction.</p>
                  <p>Or ≈øuppo≈øe the athei≈øt, for argument's ≈øake, to admit that GOD is, but demands to have the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> or <hi>ground</hi> of his exi≈øtence a≈ø≈øign'd and explained. Is any thei≈øt holden to ≈øhew him, <hi>how</hi> the divine being exi≈øted from eternity? Can this be done? Hath Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> attempted it? In one word, are the phaenomena of nature ≈øufficient to prove the being and perfections of GOD? If they are; what need of any other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument than that <hi>√° po≈øteriori?</hi> If they are not, it is certain the argument <hi>√° priori</hi> can produce no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction: For this re≈øolves it≈øelf into the argument <hi>√° po≈øteriori.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT the being of a GOD is indeed nece≈ø≈øary, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing round us declares. If the things that are ≈øeen were <hi>created and made,</hi> the ≈øelf-exi≈øtence and eternity of the creator is proved beyond doubt. For whatever hath a <hi>beginning</hi> exi≈øts from ≈øome cau≈øe <hi>without</hi> it≈øelf. Now as this cannot be ≈øaid of the <hi>creator</hi> of all things and beings, it follows, that he mu≈øt be <hi>≈øelf-exi≈øtent and eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Dr. tells us, that 'the <hi>eternity</hi> of GOD' (either <hi>√° parte ante,</hi> or <hi>√° parte po≈øt)</hi> 'can no otherwi≈øe be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than by the argument <hi>√† priori.'</hi> But, admitting <hi>an author of nature,</hi> doth it not follow, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øted, not meerly from the beginning of the phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena of nature, but from <hi>everla≈øting?</hi> and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, mu≈øt always continue to exi≈øt? Do not the≈øe things follow, without con≈øidering the 'intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øic nature of <hi>nece≈ø≈øary exi≈øtence'?</hi> (which is allowed to be <hi>inexplicable.</hi>) Do not they follow from this ≈øimple con≈øideration, that the original cau≈øe exi≈øts from no <hi>external</hi> cau≈øe? St. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øuppo≈øeth the <hi>eternity</hi> of GOD is no le≈øs evident from the things that are made, than his exi≈øtence, power, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. <hi>The invi≈øible things of him, from the creation of the world, are</hi> CLEARLY <hi>≈øeen, being under≈øtood by the the things that are made,</hi> EVEN HIS ETERNAL POWER AND GODHEAD; ≈øo that they are <hi>without excu≈øe,</hi> who will not admit this proof.</p>
                  <p>THE Dr. ob≈øerves upon the whole, that 'the proof <hi>√† priori</hi> is capable of being under≈øtood only by a <hi>few attentive minds;</hi> becau≈øe it is of u≈øe only again≈øt <hi>learned and metaphy≈øical difficulties</hi>'‚Äîwhile the proof <hi>√° po≈øteriori</hi> is level to <hi>all</hi> men's capacities'‚Äîthat this, therefore, 'is by far the <hi>mo≈øt generally</hi> u≈øeful argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what GOD expects moral agents ≈øhould be <hi>determined by'</hi> But if the eternity and immortality of GOD cannot be proved <hi>√† po≈øteriori,</hi> how is this argument ≈øufficient with <hi>common people?</hi> Do not they need an argument to prove that GOD is eternal and immortal as well as <hi>philo≈øophers?</hi> Are the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incapable of receiving any proof of this point? Or is it the privilege of the learned, that 'GOD, as moral governor,' does not 'expect they ≈øhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by' that evidence, whereby '<hi>moral agents</hi> ≈øhould be determined'?</p>
                  <p>WHAT the Dr. ≈øays concerning the <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>infinity</hi> of GOD, that they are proveable only <hi>√† priori,</hi> we think liable to much the ≈øame exceptions.

                  <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Whether the will be nece≈ø≈øarily determined by an <hi>extrin≈øic</hi> cau≈øe?</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Edwards</hi> would have his readers 'ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve, that when he ≈øpeaks of <hi>connection of cau≈øes and effects,</hi> he hath re≈øpect to <hi>moral</hi> cau≈øes, as well as tho≈øe that are called <hi>natural</hi> in di≈øtinction from them‚Äîthat the acts of the will may be as <hi>certainly and indi≈ø≈øolubly</hi> connected with the moral cau≈øe, as natural effects with their natural cau≈øes‚Äîthat the connection is as <hi>≈øure and perfect</hi> between moral cau≈øes and effects, as natural; that moral nece≈ø≈øity may be as <hi>ab≈øolute</hi> as natural nece≈ø≈øity.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Part I. Sect. 4. p. 30, 31, 32.</note> Yea, he adverti≈øeth us, that 'where he u≈øeth this di≈øtinction of moral and natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity, he would not be under≈øtood to ≈øuppo≈øe, that if any thing comes to pa≈øs by the former kind of nece≈ø≈øity, <hi>the nature of things</hi> is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, as well as in the latter. I do not mean to determine, that when a moral motive is ≈øo ≈øtrong, that the act of the will infallibly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, this is not owing to the nature of things. I ≈øuppo≈øe that nece≈ø≈øity, which is called natural, in di≈øtinction from moral, is ≈øo called becau≈øe <hi>meer</hi> nature is concerned, without any thing of <hi>choice;</hi> not becau≈øe nature has never any hand in our choice: For, choice ari≈øes from nature as truly as other events.' So that, upon the whole, much the ≈øame rules are ≈øuppo≈øed to take place in the moral world, in GOD's government of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011623_0055_0F8777BDDAE59308"/>
moral agents <hi>(≈øo called)</hi> as in the adju≈øtment and di≈øpo≈øal of natural things. What Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> intended by a <hi>moral</hi> cau≈øe, we cannot ≈øatisfy our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves. Sometimes he appears to rea≈øon as if he ≈øuppo≈øed there was <hi>really no di≈øtinction</hi> between a moral and natural cau≈øe, (31, 32.) or none to be perceived; while more generally he ≈øeems to ≈øuppo≈øe a di≈øtinction of great importance; which, however, he hath not ≈øo clearly pointed out as were to be wi≈øhed.</p>
               <p>INDEED, if there be not a real and important di≈øtinction between moral cau≈øes and natural, it plainly follows, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath taken pains to no purpo≈øe to ≈øhew, that natural nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wholly precludes from prai≈øe or blame, while moral nece≈ø≈øity doth not at all. And if there be a real and important di≈øtinction, it is of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that it be clearly ≈øeen.</p>
               <p>IN the ≈øection la≈øt referred to, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ≈øugge≈øts, that 'when we ≈øpeak of choice as <hi>di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct</hi> from nature, it is without <hi>reflection and re≈øearch;</hi> names being given to things according to what is mo≈øt <hi>obvious.</hi> But though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance and connection between acts of volition or choice, and their cau≈øes, according to <hi>e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed laws,</hi> is not ≈øo ≈øen≈øible and obvious, as that e≈øtabli≈øhed law and order which is ≈øeen in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial world; and though men make a di≈øtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between nature and choice <hi>as if they were</hi> compleatly and univer≈øally di≈øtinct; yet choice ari≈øes from nature as truly as other events How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the≈øe are the names that the≈øe two kinds of nece≈ø≈øity have u≈øually been called by; (viz. natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral) and they mu≈øt be di≈øtingui≈øhed by ≈øome names or other; for there is a di≈øtinction
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011623_0056_0F8777BF81924C48"/>
or difference between them, that is very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in it's con≈øequences: Which difference does not lie ≈øo much in the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>connection,</hi> as in the two <hi>terms connected.'</hi> The difference is <hi>important,</hi> but not <hi>≈øen≈øible and obvious.</hi> 'The cau≈øe, with which the effect is connected, is of a particular kind, viz of a <hi>moral</hi> nature‚Äîthe effect al≈øo is of a particular kind, being of a moral nature.' But are we not told in this ≈øame place, that the effect is al≈øo connected with the <hi>natural</hi> cau≈øe, and is owing to the nature of things? There is the <hi>joint</hi> influence of moral and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nece≈ø≈øity in moral events‚Äîtheir influence is clo≈øely linked together. Now till the <hi>mea≈øure</hi> of influence to be a≈øcribed to <hi>moral</hi> nece≈ø≈øity is di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly apprehended, it is impo≈ø≈øible to tell when, and how far, a per≈øon is rewardable or puni≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble‚Äînatural nece≈ø≈øity (by ≈øuppo≈øition) being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øi≈øtent with reward or puni≈øhment. But let any one examine Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book, and ≈øay, whether he hath ≈øhewn when and how far the acts of the will proceed from natural nece≈ø≈øity, and when, or how far from moral. Whether the ≈øo much labour'd di≈øtinction, or difference between natural and moral cau≈øes is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and exploded?</p>
               <p>IT is difficult to determine whether Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> ≈øuppo≈øed the acts of the will to be the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary effects of an <hi>intrin≈øic</hi> cau≈øe, or an <hi>extrin≈øic.</hi> The≈øe are u≈øed ≈øo promi≈øcuou≈øly and indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately through his book, volition being ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a≈øcribed to the one, ≈øometimes to the other, that, though they are e≈ø≈øentially different and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øite, it is hard to ≈øay which he more e≈øpecially intended by that moral nece≈ø≈øity, to which he every where ≈øuppo≈øeth the will is ≈øubject. Either
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011623_0057_0F8777C019A765E8"/>
internal, original bias, or ≈øomething extrin≈øic, is the cau≈øe, to who≈øe efficiency, determination, command, deci≈øion, the will is as much ≈øubject, as the motion of the body to the will‚Äîthis being 'as <hi>pa≈ø≈øive</hi> and nece≈ø≈øary with re≈øpect to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent determining cau≈øe of it,' as the motions of the hands and feet with re≈øpect to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the will. (183, 184)</p>
               <p>WE rather think it was Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s opinion, that the will is determined by an <hi>extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øic</hi> cau≈øe. But ≈øince this is by no means certain from his book‚Äî≈øince he hath not expre≈ø≈øed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf clearly, or we are incapable judges of this intricate ≈øubject, we ≈øhall take liberty to examine his doctrine on both ≈øuppo≈øitions‚Äîeither of an <hi>extrin≈øic,</hi> or <hi>intrin≈øic</hi> cau≈øe. The former ≈øhall be the ≈øubject of the pre≈øent ≈øection.</p>
               <p>WHETHER volition is nece≈ø≈øarily determined by an <hi>extrin≈øic</hi> cau≈øe? Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> a≈ø≈øerts, that the acts of the will are not nece≈ø≈øary <hi>in them≈øelves,</hi> or in their own <hi>nature;</hi> but by their <hi>connection</hi> with ≈øome cau≈øe that is nece≈ø≈øary <hi>in it≈øelf.</hi> In his own words, they 'are nece≈ø≈øary by a nece≈ø≈øity of <hi>con≈øequence.'</hi> The only way that any thing that is to come to pa≈øs <hi>hereafter,</hi> is, or can be, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary, is by a <hi>connection</hi> with ≈øomething that is nece≈ø≈øary in it's own nature, or ≈øomething that already is, or has been; ≈øo that the one being ≈øuppo≈øed, the other certainly follows. This al≈øo is the only way that all things <hi>pa≈øt,</hi> (excepting tho≈øe which were from eternity) could be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary <hi>before they came to pa≈øs,</hi> or could come to pa≈øs nece≈ø≈øarily; and therefore the only way in which <hi>any</hi> effect or event, or any thing what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that ever has had, or will have a beginning,

But motives to choice are exhibited to the mind by ≈øome agent: By whom are they exhibited? In regard to ≈øinful volitions we know that one man enticeth another, and Satan enticeth all mankind. But this will not be given as an an≈øwer to our que≈øtion; ≈øince the ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful act of one ≈øinner in enticing another, and of Satan in tempting all men, mu≈øt be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a previous cau≈øe‚Äîan antecedent highe≈øt motive exhibited by ≈øome other agent. (Though, by the way, it may be difficult to ≈øhew, how one man can be the cau≈øe of ≈øin in another, when he cannot be the cau≈øe of it him≈øelf.)

But ≈øince every thing advanced by ≈øo eminent a writer may be thought to merit attention, we ≈øhall briefly con≈øider the ≈øubject of this ≈øection. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own rea≈øoning will a≈ø≈øi≈øt us here, as in other parts of the≈øe remarks.</p>
               <p>FOR 'there cannot be more in the effect than in the cau≈øe.' (62.) Volition therefore cannot be virtuous or vicious farther than it's cau≈øe is ≈øo. We may not detach the nature of effects from the efficient. 'It may be wickedne≈øs in the cau≈øe, that it produceth wickedne≈øs.' Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing then, that 'the wicked act of the cau≈øe in producing wickedne≈øs, is <hi>one</hi> wickedne≈øs; and the wickedne≈øs produced another'‚Äîwhat follows is, that in every ≈øinful volition there are <hi>two</hi> wickedne≈ø≈øes‚Äîone chargeable to the cau≈øe, the other to the ≈øubject of the volition. Now if the cau≈øe be 'diver≈øe from the ≈øubject of' volition, how doth it relieve the difficulty at all, if upon the ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øary connection, GOD ≈øtands chargeable with doing wickedly? And is not this the plain con≈øequence of the doctrine, 'that the acts of the will are indi≈ø≈øolubly connected with a cau≈øe that is nece≈ø≈øary in it's own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture'? And if it will be allowed, that GOD can do wickedly con≈øidered as the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of ≈øinful volitions, we may ju≈øt as well a≈øcribe all moral evil to him.</p>

               <p>HOWEVER repugnant this hypothe≈øis is to that already examined, yet it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book. Our bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs is not to reconcile him with him≈øelf, But to remark on what we find. His meaning would doubtle≈øs have been clearer, had the ≈øubject he undertook been intelligible. He appears to have been bewildered at times in his own ≈øubtilty.</p>
               <p>TO ≈øay, that the acts of the will are nece≈ø≈øary from internal, original bias, is not very con≈øi≈øtent with ≈øaying, they are the nece≈ø≈øary effects of an extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øic cau≈øe. For what is this but ≈øaying, they are nece≈ø≈øary in their <hi>own nature?</hi> therefore not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary by a nece≈ø≈øity of con≈øequence? Yet Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> expre≈øly a≈ø≈øerts, that every thing which ever had, or will have a <hi>beginning,</hi> is nece≈ø≈øary only by a nece≈ø≈øity of con≈øequence. Now if the acts of the will are effects of an extrin≈øic cau≈øe <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> then they cannot be the effects of an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øic cau≈øe <hi>al≈øo.</hi> But <hi>original bias and inclination</hi> is intrin≈øic. If this therefore nece≈ø≈øarily determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth volition, then the other po≈øition of it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an extrin≈øic, con≈øequential nece≈ø≈øity, (an eternal, nece≈ø≈øary cau≈øe) mu≈øt be given up. For 'how can the≈øe things hang together'? Or will any ≈øuppo≈øe, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> when he faith, 'the ≈øtate or act of the will is from the

determination of an intrin≈øic cau≈øe,' meant by this cau≈øe the Deity inhabiting and actuating eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intelligent creature? by a po≈øitive efficiency producing every volition of theirs? Such a ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition, we cannot believe any one will make, however nece≈ø≈øary to reconcile Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> to him≈øelf. This is a ≈øen≈øe of GOD's <hi>working in men to will, and to do; of our living, moving, and having our being</hi> in him, which we pre≈øume none will e≈øpou≈øe. For if it makes him the author of <hi>virtuous</hi> di≈øpo≈øitions in men, in the mo≈øt <hi>≈øtrict</hi> and <hi>ab≈øolute</hi> ≈øen≈øe; it will be remembered, that it al≈øo makes him, in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe, the author of every <hi>vicious</hi> inclination and propen≈øity. On this hypothe≈øis, there is properly but <hi>one</hi> agent in the univer≈øe.</p>
               <p>'MORAL nece≈ø≈øity,' ≈øaith Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> 'lies <hi>in</hi> the will, and is the will's <hi>propen≈øity'.</hi> How then does it lie in ≈øomething exhibited to the mind from without, which is <hi>prior</hi> to the will, and gives it a nece≈ø≈øary determination? Surely the will's propen≈øity is not prior to its propen≈øity. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>in the will it≈øelf</hi> can be the moral nece≈ø≈øity by which it is determined, if this nece≈ø≈øity be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>prior</hi> to will. Be≈øides, to be determined by a cau≈øe in it≈øelf, is to be <hi>≈øelf determined,</hi> if words have any meaning. And moreover, this is making the will nece≈ø≈øary in it's <hi>own nature.</hi> Both which are contrary to ≈øuppo≈øition. What confounding again of cau≈øe and effect! Volition is the antecedent, nece≈ø≈øary cau≈øe of volition! The will is nece≈ø≈øarily determined in every act by a nece≈ø≈øity prior and ≈øuperior to it; and yet this nece≈ø≈øity is nothing diver≈øe or di≈øtinct from volition!</p>

                  </gap>.) that 'moral events a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øe from nature as truly as others.' (31, 32.) Therefore, as was hinted before, moral nece≈ø≈øity, as truly as natural, precludes from prai≈øe or blame‚Äîand that for this good rea≈øon, that moral nece≈ø≈øity is natural. This is applicable to the nece≈ø≈øity of the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> ≈øinful volition, if indeed it was nece≈ø≈øary before it came to pa≈øs‚ÄîAnd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequent ≈øinful volitions being the effects of the fir≈øt, it equally holds as to <hi>the≈øe</hi> al≈øo.</p>
               <p>THERE ≈øeems, indeed, to be ≈øome difficulty, in regard to the principle implanted in the <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> by the Spirit of GOD, upon this hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis of Mr. <hi>Edwards.</hi> For he, we pre≈øume, would not deny, that they were born in ≈øin; and that the bias in regeneration is <hi>changed</hi> from what it was by <hi>nature.</hi> Con≈øequently, the holine≈øs and per≈øeverance of the ≈øaints is not nece≈ø≈øary from native, original propen≈øity, but from ≈øome other cau≈øe.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER may be ≈øaid in regard to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of <hi>fallen</hi> man; Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s principle hath equal re≈øpect to the moral power of man in <hi>innocence,</hi> and of the rebel angels before their fall. <hi>Their</hi> original bias and inclination, it will be allowed, proceeded immediately from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.

If then their ≈øin was the effect of a nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty originally in their will, or was their will's ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal propen≈øity, it was ≈øo entirely owing to the <hi>nature of things,</hi> that (by ≈øuppo≈øition) it could not involve them in guilt‚ÄîOr if connected with the eternal cau≈øe, who alone is nece≈ø≈øary in his own nature, it could not upon our author's own ≈øcheme; be <hi>their</hi> ≈øin. The whole guilt, if any, mu≈øt be imputed to the fir≈øt cau≈øe. For the fir≈øt ≈øin, of angels and man, was once future; and therefore could not be nece≈ø≈øary in it≈øelf, but only by the afore≈øaid nece≈ø≈øity of con≈øequence. (p. 25.) And then, whatever moral impotency now cleaves to mankind, or damned ≈øpirits, this being connected with the fir≈øt ≈øin, which was connected with the original, nece≈ø≈øary bias of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; it follows, that the ≈øins of fallen crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are nece≈ø≈øary in the ≈øame way that the fir≈øt ≈øinful volition was‚Äîthe only way in which all things and events what≈øoever, which are not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, are, or can be nece≈ø≈øary. They do not therefore partake of the e≈ø≈øence of ≈øin; or if they do, involve the creator in it.</p>
               <p>INDEED the ≈øuppo≈øition of being nece≈ø≈øarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by original, internal bias, does, upon the whole, lead to much the ≈øame con≈øequences with that of ≈øuppo≈øing the acts of the will to be nece≈ø≈øary by a nece≈ø≈øity of con≈øequence‚Äî≈øince, agreable to the ≈øecond preliminary propo≈øition, <hi>original</hi> bias mu≈øt be ultimately a≈øcribed to the original cau≈øe of all things. What is natural is the con≈øtitution of the author of nature. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral events, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in≈øtructs us, are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, partly at lea≈øt, to the nature of things‚Äîpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, at lea≈øt in part, from natural cau≈øes. Now, by his own principles, ≈øo far as the nature of
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011623_0067_0F8777D0308737C0"/>
things operates to their production, neither good nor ill de≈øert is applicable to the ≈øubject of voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Had he told us in what re≈øpects, and how far, volition is owing to natural nece≈ø≈øity, we might have known wherein, and how far, the creature is accountable. For herein, and ≈øo far, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> grants, it [volition] is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly his own act‚Äîhe is not the proper ≈øubject of command, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IF volition be partly owing to natural cau≈øes, and the ≈øubject ≈øo far is not an≈øwerable; what is this but charging the moral turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a ≈øinful volition on GOD, <hi>≈øo far as it is the effect of natural nece≈ø≈øity?</hi> Now as well may we attribute the <hi>whole</hi> moral turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God, as the <hi>lea≈øt mea≈øure</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>IT moreover follows, that the holine≈øs of the angels, who never ≈øinned, being among tho≈øe moral events which are owing to the nature of things, is no holine≈øs; unworthy of prai≈øe. The ≈øame thing follows with re≈øpect ≈øo the holine≈øs of the man CHRIST JESUS, and of GOD him≈øelf. For 'natural nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is wholly incon≈øi≈øtent with ju≈øt prai≈øe and blame.' And would Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> deny, that the holine≈øs of GOD, his moral rectitude in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is nece≈ø≈øary <hi>in it's own nature?</hi> And what is this, but to be nece≈ø≈øary by a <hi>natural</hi> nece≈ø≈øity?</p>
               <p>FARTHER, by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s principles, all virtue and vice in creatures is <hi>native</hi> or <hi>original.</hi> For every act of volition is the nece≈ø≈øary effect of internal, original bias‚Äîi. e. is owing to the original frame of the mind. The angels that ≈øelf, and our common progenitors, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011623_0068_0F8777D09FC289F8"/>
'made with a fixed, prevailing principle of ≈øin in the heart.' Otherwi≈øe their ≈øin proceeded not from internal, original bias‚Äîany more than from an 'indi≈ø≈øoluble <hi>connection</hi> with a cau≈øe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary in it's own nature.' If in truth their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal bias was not to evil‚Äîif they were endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>moral</hi> image of GOD, then their ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful volition was not the effect of original pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øity‚Äînor did the nece≈ø≈øity of it lie <hi>in the will,</hi> in it's primitive ≈øtate. Nor con≈øequently will this account for the permanency of holine≈øs in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven. This cannot be the <hi>rationale</hi> of the abiding principle of holine≈øs in them; ≈øince it appears from fact, that creatures endowed with the moral image of GOD, may deface and forfeit it.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE 'the e≈ø≈øence of virtue and vice lies in the <hi>nature</hi> of volition, not in the cau≈øe'; it then follows, that the intrin≈øic cau≈øe, the internal bias or propen≈øity (which is ≈øuppo≈øed to be the moral nece≈ø≈øity that determines the will) is not that which <hi>con≈øtitutes</hi> the goodne≈øs, or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, of the acts of the will. A vicious man's bias and inclination to ≈øin, is not that which <hi>makes</hi> him ≈øinful; the e≈ø≈øence of his ≈øin lying not in ≈øuch bias or inclination, but in the <hi>nature</hi> of the wicked thing. A ≈øhrewd ≈øolution! as if the character of moral agents were not always e≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated from their propen≈øity to good or evil. If 'moral nece≈ø≈øity lies in the will, and is the will's propen≈øity,' it either follows, that there is no good or evil in any di≈øpo≈øitions implanted in the hearts of men <hi>by nature;</hi> (contrary to a≈ø≈øertion, p. 303.) or if there be any good or evil in ≈øuch di≈øpo≈øitions, this is entirely a di≈øtinct goodne≈øs or wickedne≈øs from the volitions them≈øelves, which they are the cau≈øe of. 'It would imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011623_0069_0F8777D2564B9C70"/>
to ≈øuppo≈øe, that the≈øe two are the ≈øame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual' goodne≈øs or 'wickedne≈øs. The' good or 'wicked act of the cau≈øe, in producing' goodne≈øs or 'wickedne≈øs is one' goodne≈øs or 'wickedne≈øs; and the' goodne≈øs or 'wickedne≈øs produced, if there be any produced, is another.' Will this be called arguing! What doth it amount to? The plain truth is, that when we ≈øet our≈øelves to judge of human actions, we mu≈øt have no con≈øideration of the ≈øource of them, but entirely detach them from their cau≈øes. Be the efficient who or what it will, all we have to attend to is, the effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced‚Äîby this we mu≈øt e≈øtimate the goodne≈øs or wickedne≈øs of men, whether they determine them≈øelves, or are determined <hi>ab extra</hi>‚Äîwhether they have power over their own wills, or have not. He therefore that with one original talent makes as great improvement as another with five, is no more prai≈øeworthy‚Äîthat is, is not <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted according to that he hath.</hi> He that offends again≈øt five degrees of light originally given, is guilty in no higher degree than he that offends again≈øt but one degree of light.

for different degrees of guilt; becau≈øe, though we are won't to ≈øpeak of ≈øuperior and le≈ø≈øer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, yet there is no real ground for this di≈øtinction, intelligent creatures being in no ca≈øe the authors, the voluntary de≈øigning cau≈øe of their inward determinations; at lea≈øt not of the fir≈øt and leading act, which decides the whole matter. How then, without having recour≈øe to the cau≈øe, can we judge of the natute of ≈øin?</p>
               <p>INDEED had Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ≈øucceeded in his attempt to ≈øhew, that the "e≈ø≈øence of virtue and vice is not in their cau≈øe, but in their nature", he would not have obviated the objection ≈øo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made to the doctrine of nece≈ø≈øity, but never an≈øwered, that it is charging GOD with ≈øin.</p>
               <p>FOR admitting GOD to be the original cau≈øe of volition, but that being the cau≈øe of a ≈øinful volition in the creature is a di≈øtinct wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs from that which the cau≈øe produceth in the effect; ≈øtill the ≈øupreme cau≈øe is ≈øuppo≈øed in fault; is charged with <hi>producing</hi> ≈øin. There is no evading the con≈øequence, indeed, that the <hi>whole</hi> guilt of men's evil di≈øpo≈øitions is chargeable on GOD, not them≈øelves, or on blind nece≈ø≈øity and fatality, if the things Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> advanceth be true. For who will charge another with what he is acknowledged not to be the author or cau≈øe of? If therefore men's volitions are virtuous or vicious, and they not the de≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cau≈øes of them them≈øelves; (which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> throughout his book ≈øaith they are not) it follows, that the virtue or vice of their volitions is to be a≈øcribed to the cau≈øe, whoever or whatever this cau≈øe is.

                  <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Upon Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s own Scheme, there cannot be <hi>natural</hi> Liberty without <hi>moral.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE acknowledge the title of this ≈øection contains a po≈øition directly repugnant to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s whole ≈øcheme, and yet tru≈øt we ≈øhall make it appear that the thing a≈ø≈øerted plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows from things he hath advanced.</p>
               <p>LIBERTY with re≈øpect to <hi>natural</hi> actions can be neither more nor le≈øs than according to the freedom of the <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>mind.</hi> For natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by ≈øuppo≈øition, are dependent and con≈øequent on, the fruits and effects of, the will's determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which is the cau≈øe of them. Now 'there cannot be more in the effect than in the cau≈øe. Tho≈øe things which are indi≈ø≈øolubly connected with other things that are nece≈ø≈øary, are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves nece≈ø≈øary.' Therefore if the acts of the will are nece≈ø≈øary, tho≈øe outward acts, which are the effects of nece≈ø≈øity in the will, mu≈øt be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary 'by a nece≈ø≈øity of <hi>con≈øequence.'</hi> Now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of the will is ≈øaid to be nece≈ø≈øary. 'The ≈øoul it≈øelf is the object of ≈øomething acting upon, and influencing it. The fir≈øt and determining act of choice, which decides the whole affair, is out of our power.' So that in natural actions we are <hi>'cau≈øed</hi> to act by ≈øome other agent.' Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> faith, 'it is no more a contradiction, to ≈øuppo≈øe that action may be the effect of ≈øome <hi>other</hi> cau≈øe, be≈øides the <hi>agent</hi> or <hi>being</hi> that acts,

than to ≈øuppo≈øe that life may be the effect of ≈øome other cau≈øe be≈øides the liver, or being that lives, in whom life is cau≈øed to be.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Is a man active in that act by which he is brought into being?</note> (286.) The acts of the ≈øoul or will being, therefore, nece≈ø≈øary effects of ≈øome other cau≈øe than the agent, let it be ≈øhewn how there can be ≈øo much as natural liberty‚Äîmeaning hereby a freedom from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward con≈øtraint or re≈øtraint.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Edwards</hi> a≈ø≈øerts, 'The liberty of the will is not exerci≈øed in any thing but what the will <hi>does'.</hi> (99.) 'The will in no in≈øtance whatever is it's <hi>own</hi> determiner'. Therefore the liberty of the will is not exerci≈øed in any of the <hi>determinations</hi> of the will. Therefore not in determining to move the <hi>body.</hi> Therefore corporeal action is not <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</hi> Therefore the will <hi>does</hi> nothing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is <hi>exerci≈øed</hi> in nothing. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> promi≈øeth to 'demon≈øtrate', that 'if the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> act in the train, determining and fixing the re≈øt, be not free, none of them all are free.' And a≈ø≈øerts, that '<hi>GOD</hi>'s own immediate conduct is <hi>original</hi> in the ≈øeries.'</p>
               <p>In one word, external action is no more in our power than internal. To ≈øay that the will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the former is not true: For this would be to ≈øuppo≈øe it is its own determiner at lea≈øt in this particular determination to move the body; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a≈ø≈øertion, that it is in no in≈øtance whatever it's own determiner. But ≈øuppo≈øe material actions to be determined by the will, that herein men are the voluntary cau≈øes of their own actions‚Äîthis is really attributing no power to the will or agent‚Äî≈øince all the acts of the will ≈øuppo≈øe an an≈øwerable

cau≈øe without, as much as creation ≈øuppo≈øeth a creator. (62.)</p>
               <p>If material actions are ≈øubject to, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, the will, ≈øtill this is ≈øubject to and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by preceeding nece≈ø≈øity. So that natural liberty is given up. For that is a ≈øtrange kind of liberty, which is founded in, and re≈øults out of, nece≈ø≈øity. Whether this nece≈ø≈øity be natural or moral‚Äîwhether it proceeds from an extrin≈øic or intrin≈øic cau≈øe, it equally militates again≈øt the ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of freedom. The intelligent ≈øy≈øtem is a curious piece of mechani≈øm.</p>
               <p>Page 232 (and el≈øewhere) Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath an eva≈øion, which ≈øcarce de≈øerves a ≈øerious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer It is this, 'that a man may be ≈øaid to have a thing in his power, if he has it at his <hi>election;</hi> i. e. if he <hi>now</hi> plea≈øeth, and has a <hi>direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> de≈øire for it, he is not unable to do it.' This, in mo≈øt writers, would be e≈øteemed meer quibbling. For if a man is morally incapable of a 'direct and immediate de≈øire' to a thing, how can he be ≈øaid to have it in his power? Would Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ≈øay, that things are in or out of men's power, farther than <hi>chu≈øing or refu≈øing</hi> is ≈øo, as well as the con≈øequent acts depending hereon? It is not improper to ≈øay, 'that a per≈øon' <hi>cannot</hi> 'perform tho≈øe actions, which depend on an act of will, when the act of will it≈øelf cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent,' but is forever impo≈ø≈øible'‚Äîwhen the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition to the contrary is 'as ≈øtrong and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable as the bars of a ca≈øtle,' by <hi>nature</hi>‚Äîwhen want of inclination proceeds from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or original bias. For 'the event is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on it's cau≈øe.' And the cau≈øe not being put, the event cannot take place. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that ≈øuch a ≈øtate of the will may be

required as is forever impo≈ø≈øible; this can be only on a ≈øuppo≈øition of an ability once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, but lo≈øt. Who will ≈øay, that a man has in his power what is and mu≈øt be impo≈ø≈øible? So that when we are told, 'that the common people, in their notion of a faulty or praise-worthy deed, ≈øuppo≈øe the man does it in the exerci≈øe of <hi>liberty;</hi> but that their notion of liberty is only a per≈øon's having opportunity of doing as he plea≈øes'‚Äîi. e. of <hi>executing</hi> a choice already made, we mu≈øt e≈øteem this trifting. For what liberty is there when choice it≈øelf is out of a man's power‚Äîis the effect of an antecedent nece≈ø≈øary cau≈øe? 'In the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> act of choice, which decides the whole matter,' he is nece≈ø≈øarily determined. In this Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> con≈øtantly a≈ø≈øerts a man has not power, or liberty of choice, while he grants him a power or capacity of <hi>con≈øequent</hi> choice. That is, in other words, a capacity of being acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ≈øome other cau≈øe or agent.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole: Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> allows, that liberty is e≈ø≈øential to prai≈øe or blame, reward or puni≈øhment; but teacheth, that the internal ≈øtate of the mind or will proceeds not from, is not determined by, our≈øelves. <note n="*" place="bottom">Quaere, Whether Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s motto at all favors this opinion? It is taken from Rom. ix.xvi. <hi>It is not of him that willeth.</hi> That is, (if we attend to the words taken by them≈øelves, or in their connection) <hi>outward action</hi> is not of him that willeth. It is ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed he hath <hi>willed,</hi> and that the will is <hi>from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf</hi>‚ÄîHIM <hi>that willeth.</hi> But he hath not power or opportunity to <hi>execute</hi> his will. <hi>I≈øaac</hi> did really will to give the ble≈ø≈øing to <hi>E≈øau‚ÄîE≈øau</hi> did run for veni≈øon to obtain it.

With what truth and propriety even this can be ≈øaid on Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ≈øcheme, we tru≈øt is ≈øufficiently manife≈øt.</p>

               <p>MR <hi>Edwards</hi> teacheth, 'That GOD, when he had made man, ≈øo ordered his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, that <hi>from the≈øe circum≈øtances,</hi> together with the withholding divine influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his ≈øin <hi>infallibly followed.</hi>' And when it is a≈øked hereupon, 'why might not GOD as well have fir≈øt made man with a fixed, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle of ≈øin in his heart?' Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> intimates in his an≈øwer, that GOD might indeed have done ≈øo; but adds, that if man had been thus made at fir≈øt, 'it would not have been ≈øo <hi>vi≈øible,</hi> that ≈øin did not ari≈øe from GOD, as the po≈øitive cau≈øe, and real ≈øource of it‚Äîthat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>it was meet</hi> man ≈øhould not be made with ≈øin in his heart, that ≈øin might appear to ari≈øe from the imperfection of the creature, 'and not from GOD as the efficient or fountain.' He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows GOD to be the author of ≈øin in any ≈øen≈øe but being 'the <hi>agent,</hi> or <hi>actor</hi> of ≈øin, or <hi>doer</hi> of the wicked thing.' He 'di≈øpo≈øeth the ≈øtate of events in ≈øuch a manner, that ≈øin mo≈øt certainly follows therefrom. In ≈øuch a ≈øen≈øe, I do not deny, that GOD is the author of ≈øin.

'If there be a ≈øeries of acts, the <hi>determining</hi> act is more e≈øpecially the ≈øubject of command‚Äîbecau≈øe it is this act that determines the whole affair.'

cau≈øe, which determineth not only volition, but, of con≈øequence, outward actions? And is not the virtue or vice of volition to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its cau≈øe, as much as the evil of external acts to the inward di≈øpo≈øition and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

How much more con≈øi≈øtent would it have been for Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> to have ≈øaid, that the will's determining is a <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> determining‚Äî for the ≈øoul to act <hi>nece≈ø≈øarily</hi> is evermore to act nece≈ø≈øarily?‚Äî(that is, the will does not determine, the ≈øoul does not act) than to ≈øay, 'the will's determining is a <hi>free</hi> determining‚Äîfor the ≈øoul to act <hi>voluntarily</hi> is evermore to act <hi>electively'?</hi>

The will, the ≈øoul, may be <hi>acted upon,</hi> and have ≈øuch a volition or choice produced in it, <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence,</hi> and as the <hi>effect,</hi> of ≈øome cau≈øe operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, <hi>deciding</hi> and <hi>determining</hi> the volition.

The acts and exerci≈øes of the human mind (if they may be called its acts) are owing not to any active power in the mind, to any thing within its power, but entirely to the energy of a nece≈ø≈øary cau≈øe, which is prior to what are called its own acts. Volition is free or voluntary <hi>with a freedom of moral nece≈ø≈øity</hi>‚Äî a nece≈ø≈øity <hi>as ab≈øolute as natural.</hi> And thus it is, that a man's heart comes to be wrong or right.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Edwards</hi> teacheth, that GOD 'orders the volitions of moral agents, among other events, with ≈øuch a <hi>deci≈øive</hi> di≈øpo≈øal, that the events are infallibly connected with his di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal‚Äîthat an univer≈øal, <hi>determining</hi> providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers an infallible, previous fixedne≈øs of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents‚Äîthat GOD's own immediate conduct is fir≈øt in the ≈øeries, and this alone unconnected with any thing preceeding‚Äîthat he cau≈øeth the di≈øpo≈øition of the mind to be more in favour of ≈øuch acts'‚Äî(vicious no le≈øs than virtuous) 'or bringeth the mind more into view of powerful motives and inducements'‚Äîthat all things are invariably ≈øettled‚Äîand 'nece≈ø≈øity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all moral agents.' His ≈øcheme, upon the whole, appears to be nearly the ≈øame with that exhibited by the celebrated Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> an <hi>epicurean athei≈øt,</hi> which we ≈øhall give the reader in his own words. 'There is a continued chain of nece≈ø≈øary cau≈øes, fore-ordained, and pre-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011623_0081_0F8777DFA6636C50"/>
reaching from the original cau≈øe of all to every ≈øingle volition of every human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. While we act, we are, at the ≈øame time, acted upon. The ultimate author of all our volitions is the Creator of the world, who fir≈øt be≈øtowed motion on this immen≈øe machine, and placed all beings in that po≈øition, whence eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øub≈øequent event, by an inevitable nece≈ø≈øity, mu≈øt re≈øult.'</p>
               <p>TO this ≈øcheme, Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> ≈øuppo≈øeth it will be objected in the following form. 'Human actions, therefore, either can have no moral turpitude at all, as proceeding from ≈øo good a cau≈øe; or if they have any turpitude, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve our Creator in the ≈øame guilt, while he is acknowledged to be their ultimate cau≈øe and author. Wherever a continued chain of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary cau≈øes is fixed, that being, either finite or infinite, who produces the fir≈øt, is likewi≈øe the author of all the re≈øt, and mu≈øt both bear the blame, and acquire the prai≈øe, which belong to them. Our cleare≈øt and mo≈øt unalterable ideas of morality e≈øtabli≈øh this rule upon unque≈øtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rea≈øons, when we examine the con≈øequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of any <hi>human</hi> action; and the≈øe rea≈øons mu≈øt ≈øtill have greater force, when applied to the volitions and intentions of a being <hi>infinitely wi≈øe and powerful.</hi> Ignorance or impotence may be pleaded for ≈øo limited a creature as man; but tho≈øe imperfections have no place in our Creator He fore≈øaw, he ordained, he intended all tho≈øe actions of men, which we ≈øo ra≈øhly pronounce criminal. And we mu≈øt conclude, therefore, either that they are not criminal, or that the Deity, not man, is accountable for them. But as either of the≈øe po≈øitions is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurd
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011623_0082_0F8777E05BBDCA98"/>
and impious, it follows that the doctrine from which they are deduced cannot po≈ø≈øibly be true, as being liable to all the ≈øame objections. An ab≈øurd con≈øequence, if nece≈ø≈øary, proves the original doctrine to be ab≈øurd, in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that criminal actions render criminal the original cau≈øe, if the connection between them be nece≈ø≈øary and inevitable.'<note n="*" place="bottom">E≈ø≈øays by <hi>David Hume,</hi>

               <p>THIS objection, which Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> ≈øtates to him≈øelf, may be made with the ≈øame propriety to the general ≈øcheme of our author.

               <p>HAVING taken notice of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine, in a≈ø≈øerting GOD to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ≈øin, except that he is not 'the <hi>actor</hi> of it, or <hi>doer</hi> of the wicked thing; and the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion which ≈øuch a doctrine <hi>needed,</hi> that 'the e≈ø≈øence of a ≈øinful volition is in its nature, not in its <hi>cau≈øe</hi>'; the next advance he makes, in order to reconcile the exi≈øtence of ≈øin with the divine choice and determination, in the invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nece≈ø≈øity or it, is, that moral evil is <hi>be≈øt</hi> for the world‚Äîthat therefore 'an infinitely wi≈øe being, who always chu≈øes what is be≈øt, mu≈øt chu≈øe there ≈øhould be ≈øuch a thing'‚Äîthat this is not chu≈øing what is properly evil upon the whole, becau≈øe 'of the great good which is the con≈øequence of ≈øin, for the ≈øake' of which GOD is ≈øuppo≈øed to 'will ≈øin.' He therefore a≈ø≈øerts, that 'moral evil is not of <hi>a bad, but good ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>'‚Äîthat 'the coming to pa≈øs of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual act of ≈øin is truly, all things con≈øidered, agreable to infinite wi≈ødom and goodne≈øs.' (Part iv. ≈øect. 9th.)</p>
               <p>FOR all this he quotes with approbation Dr. <hi>Turnbull,</hi> again≈øt whom he had before wrote and publi≈øhed part of an elaborate volume.

When it is a≈øked, <hi>Whence comes evil?</hi> this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman denies the hypothe≈øis, and an≈øwers, <hi>'There is no evil in the univer≈øe.</hi> What! is there no mi≈øery, no vice in the world? or are not the≈øe <hi>evils?</hi> Evils indeed they are; that is, tho≈øe of one ≈øort are hurtful, and tho≈øe of the other ≈øort are equally hurtful and abominable; But they are <hi>not</hi> evil or mi≈øchievous with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect to the <hi>whole.</hi> The evil which happens is requi≈øite to the <hi>greater good.'</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT GOD may, and does many times, overrule things ≈øo, as to bring good out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil, we deny not. From the apo≈øtacy of mankind, he hath taken occa≈øion to manife≈øt <hi>the exceeding riches of his grace.</hi> He al≈øo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently improves vicious and profligate ≈øinners (be≈øide, and contrary to, their own intention) as in≈øtruments of great and general good. But doth it therefore follow, that profligate wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs is not of bad, but good <hi>tendency?</hi> That every individual act of it is agreable to perfect wi≈ødom and goodne≈øs, and be≈øt for the world?</p>
               <p>'THOUGH the con≈øtitution of our nature, from whence we are capable of vice and mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may, as it undoubtedly does, contribute to the perfection and happine≈øs of the world; and though the actual permi≈ø≈øion of evil may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to it: (that is, it would have been more mi≈øchievous, not that a wicked per≈øon had <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf</hi> ab≈øtained from his own wickedne≈øs, <hi>but that any one had forcibly prevented it,</hi> than that it was permitted:) Yet notwith≈øtanding, it might have been much better for the world, if this very evil had never been done. Nay, it is mo≈øt clearly conceivable, that the very commi≈ø≈øion
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011623_0086_0F8777E93A5891B8"/>
of wickedne≈øs may be beneficial to the world, and yet, that it would be infinitely more beneficial for men to refrain from it. For thus, in the wi≈øe and good con≈øtitution of the natural world, there are di≈øorders which bring their own cures; di≈øea≈øes, which are them≈øelves remedies. Many a man would have died, had it not been for the gout or a fever; yet it would be thought madne≈øs to a≈ø≈øert, that ≈øickne≈øs is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or a more perfect ≈øtate than health; though the like, with regard to the moral world, has been a≈ø≈øerted.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>GOD's law, originally given to man, was doubtle≈øs good and perfect. It was doubtle≈øs agreable to perfect wi≈ødom and goodne≈øs, that he ≈øhould yield a ≈øteady and uniform obedience to it.

That the law given to man at fir≈øt was imperfect‚Äîthat it was better, all things con≈øidered, that the divine law (the law of man's nature) ≈øhould be broke than kept‚Äîthat GOD threatned di≈øobedience with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of death, and yet cho≈øe man ≈øhould rebel, 'for the ≈øake of the great good con≈øequent on ≈øin'‚Äîthat the ends of infinite wi≈ødom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs could be an≈øwered, no po≈ø≈øible way devi≈øed to advance the <hi>highe≈øt happine≈øs</hi> of the intelligent creation, but by the entrance of <hi>infinite evil</hi> into the world‚Äîthat the revolt of men and angels was in compliance with the end of their being,

and the wi≈øe and gracious intention of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor‚Äî(and if ≈øo, 'why did not GOD make them at fir≈øt with a fixed prevailing principle of ≈øin?') Yea, it follows, that intemperance, debauchery, oppre≈ø≈øion, murther, malice, envy, all the lu≈øts of the fle≈øh and ≈øpirit, greatly conduce to the good of the world, and are perfectly agreable to the wi≈øe and good governor of it. What obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations do mankind owe to drunkards and gluttons, to fornicators and adulterers, to the fraudulent and oppre≈ø≈øors, to thieves and liars, and fal≈øe ≈øwearers, to robbers and murtherers, and all that great multitude, whom the faithful and true witne≈øs hath expre≈øsly excluded from the heavenly Jeru≈øalem, and con≈øigned to one common lake of fire and brim≈øtone! <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xxi 8 and xxii 15.</note> Which judgment according to truth the world have been wont to te≈øtify their approbation of in their treatment of ≈øuch per≈øons‚Äîthat is, their greate≈øt benefactors!

               <p>HOW ≈øin came to be permitted is more than we can comprehend. To ≈øay it could not have been prevented is ≈øaying more than any one knows. To ≈øay that' GOD cho≈øe it, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the will of the creature to it, is impious, even ≈øuppo≈øing it is in fact followed with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good, than otherwi≈øe would have been‚Äî which ≈øuppo≈øition is, however, but meer conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at be≈øt, and without any ≈øolid foundation. For unle≈øs we can tell what would have been had ≈øin never entered the world, it is impo≈ø≈øible we ≈øhould be able to judge, by way of compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, of the greater good con≈øequent upon it; or be able to ≈øay, that it was be≈øt upon the

whole. From the mi≈øeries of it, which we ≈øee and feel, we have no ≈øpecial rea≈øon to infer its ≈øuperior advantages, and good tendency. And notwith≈øtanding the infinite rea≈øon we have to receive it as <hi>a faithful ≈øaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that JESUS CHRIST came into the world to ≈øave ≈øinners;</hi> yet that he came to re≈øtore mankind to a <hi>better</hi> ≈øtate than they would have been rai≈øed to, had they never ≈øinned, is more than we have yet learned from the holy ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>BE this as it will: Suppo≈øe it to be indeed true, that the con≈øequence of ≈øin is the greater good of the univer≈øe, it will not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that GOD mu≈øt chu≈øe and determine it. If an apo≈øtle ≈øuppo≈øed their damnation to be ju≈øt, who do evil with a view to greater good; ≈øhall we venture to impute any thing like this to GOD? Suppo≈øe (in the in≈øtances Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> brings) <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi>'s brethren had fore≈øeen the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences</hi> of their treatment of him, would this have ju≈øtified their conduct, and rendered it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious?‚Äîwhat as wi≈øe and good men they mu≈øt have cho≈øe? (p. 374, 375) The ≈øame que≈øtion, on the ≈øame ≈øuppo≈øition, offers it≈øelf in relation to the murderers of our Savior. To ≈øay that GOD wills evil for the ≈øake of its good tendency, is a reproach to an holy and good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who cannot chu≈øe moral evil at all‚Äîany more than a man of rea≈øon and con≈øcience can chu≈øe what he knows to be ≈øinful, from the cleare≈øt pro≈øpect of great publick advantage. The moral Governor of the world will pur≈øue the happine≈øs of it, in ≈øuch ways, and by ≈øuch means only, as are ju≈øt and holy. And we might with more propriety ≈øuppo≈øe, he will not
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011623_0089_0F8777EBA0D18510"/>
take care of the happine≈øs of his creatures at all, than that he doth this by chu≈øing ≈øin as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øure means of the greate≈øt good. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>To admit that any created being can act in a manner contrary to what it does, or fulfil any other end, is tantamount, ≈øaith Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> to allowing it to be independent of the Deity; and con≈øequently, to have it in its election and power to thwart the ≈øchemes of the great author and ≈øuperintendent of all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His an≈øwerer very ju≈øtly replies, 'All this is nothing but ≈øuppo≈øing it a contradiction that GOD ≈øhould endue the human <hi>mind,</hi> or any creature, with liberty of action. For if liberty is a perfection po≈ø≈øible to be communicated to any creature, it follows from the nature of the thing, that it mu≈øt be in the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>election</hi> of the <hi>√°gent,</hi> to act in a manner <hi>contrary to what it does,</hi> and <hi>to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil another end.</hi> But this liberty does not at all infer that man is <hi>independent</hi> of the <hi>Deity;</hi> any more than the power of breaking human laws infers that ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are independent of their governors. Man is ever ≈øubject to the providential government of GOD, and accountable to him for his actions; and, as he does good or evil to him≈øelf or others, is liable to receive rewards or puni≈øhments. This ≈øufficiently ≈øhews the <hi>dependency</hi> of man upon GOD; and as much ≈øo, as if his actions were <hi>nece≈ø≈øary.</hi> For as in the latter ca≈øe, he would <hi>depend</hi> upon GOD as an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument</hi> only in the hands of an agent; or, as the inanimate creation <hi>depends</hi> upon him, meerly as a machine upon the framer and director of it; ≈øo in the former ca≈øe he depends upon GOD as a <hi>moral</hi> governor, who ≈øuperintends his actions, and from whom he has rea≈øon to expect to be recompen≈øed according to his work‚ÄîAnd no power what≈øoever can deliver him out of GOD's hands.

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:011623_0093_0F8777F02596E8D8"/>
which are determined by the mind, are po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when the determination of the mind <hi>it≈øelf</hi> re≈øpecting them is forever impo≈ø≈øible, is un≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, and unintelligible to us. If no being can chu≈øe or act otherwi≈øe than he doth, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive of a nece≈ø≈øity more ab≈øolute; and ≈øuch is the nece≈ø≈øity maintained by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>‚Äî only he approves not the terms <hi>natural nece≈ø≈øity,</hi> and thinks the word <hi>certainty</hi> more proper‚Äî While he a≈ø≈øerts all events to be <hi>morally</hi> nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry‚Äîand that in things thus nece≈ø≈øary there is a 'connection <hi>prior</hi> and <hi>≈øuperior</hi> to will and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.' (294.)</p>
               <p>AFTER all that hath been ≈øaid, <hi>moral nece≈ø≈øity</hi> is, properly ≈øpeaking, <hi>natural nece≈ø≈øity; moral</hi> power is <hi>natural</hi> power. The one is as <hi>original</hi> to us as the other. The latter is interwoven in our frame no otherwi≈øe than the former. The moral faculty, or power, which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ≈øaith belongs to moral agency, is a natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or power. So that whatever moral capacity or incapacity is attributed to mankind, the ≈øame is natural. If man is a law to him≈øelf it is <hi>by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> that he is ≈øo, having the work of the law written on his heart. And as to the inability of man, Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> we pre≈øume, believed this to be derived from <hi>nature</hi>‚Äîto have it's ≈øource in 'the want of original righteou≈øne≈øs, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the whole nature.' Now an inability which has it's ≈øource in the very <hi>nature</hi> of man may ≈øurely be called a <hi>natural</hi> inability.</p>
               <p>MUCH hath been ≈øaid to ≈øhew, that every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral event mu≈øt have an an≈øwerable cau≈øe. Be it ≈øo. Every ≈øuch event mu≈øt then have a <hi>moral</hi> cau≈øe. And whether any other than an <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011623_0094_0F8777F0DBCC41B8"/>
mind</hi> can be ≈øuch a cau≈øe, let tho≈øe who have common under≈øtanding judge. If it be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that a moral cau≈øe mu≈øt be a moral agent, then it will follow, that we are the cau≈øes of our own volitions, or that our maker is the cau≈øe of them. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> denies the fir≈øt‚Äîtherefore our volitions are to be attributed to GOD as their proper cau≈øe. But however this might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of <hi>holy</hi> volitions, we cannot think it will be admitted of <hi>≈øinful</hi> ones. And if not, what regard ≈øhould be had to a doctrine of which this is the direct con≈øequence? We are ≈øelf-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or determined by the deity. If there be any difference between a <hi>cau≈øe,</hi> and a meer <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument,</hi> the former denotes a mind that hath wi≈ødom, power &amp;c, in a greater or le≈øs degree, according to the effects a≈øcribed to it. And if moral events, through a chain of ≈øecond cau≈øes, centre in the deity, as natural effects do, what is this but running up morals to <hi>mechani≈øm?</hi> any pains Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath taken to avoid ≈øuch an imputation on his ≈øcheme notwith≈øtanding.</p>
               <p>IN our author's ≈øcheme, nece≈ø≈øity is <hi>univer≈øal.</hi> The divine will is always determined by it, and the will of every creature. Now GOD is either the author of this nece≈ø≈øity, to which he him≈øelf is ≈øubject, or he is not. If he is, then all the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ects of it are to be a≈øcribed to him as their proper cau≈øe. If he is not, then there is ≈øome cau≈øe <hi>prior</hi> to the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> cau≈øe, binding and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining him‚Äî he is cau≈øed to determine as he doth by ≈øomething <hi>extrin≈øic</hi> (For to ≈øay he is determined by ≈øometning <hi>intrin≈øic,</hi> is to ≈øay he is <hi>≈øelf-determined</hi>‚Äîcontrary to ≈øuppo≈øition.) His being and volitions are <hi>effects</hi> as much as tho≈øe of finite creatures. That nece≈ø≈øity, which is
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011623_0095_0F8777F19B659490"/>
≈øaid to be the cau≈øe of every determination of the divine will, the cau≈øe and ground of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence and perfections, is prior, by ≈øuppo≈øition, to his exi≈øtence and volitions. And this nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity mu≈øt be determined by ≈øomething preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ≈øo on. Yea, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> makes expre≈øs mention of the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of moral nece≈ø≈øity‚Äîand ≈øays, that the cau≈øe of this nece≈ø≈øity is equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary as of natural. That is, there is a nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary cau≈øe of this cau≈øe, and ≈øo on <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Thus we are run back far into non-entity, and have to enquire, By what cau≈øe the fir≈øt cau≈øe exi≈øts‚Äîwhich cau≈øe is an effect in relation to ≈øomething preceeding, and this an effect with relation to ≈øomething ≈øtill preceeding, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> And if ≈øomething exterior and prior to the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty determines him, what is this but affirming him to be the almighty mini≈øter of <hi>fate?</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath expre≈ø≈øed his di≈øinclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to fatali≈øm, (in which we doubt not his ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity) we think his rea≈øoning is plainly on the ≈øide of ab≈øolute fatality; and ≈øuppo≈øe he was caught in his own ≈øubtilty. Upon his ≈øcheme it follows, that the actions of all finite beings are the agency of the Deity; and his is not properly ≈øpeaking <hi>agency,</hi> but <hi>in≈øtrumentality</hi>‚Äî a ≈øubjection to blind nece≈ø≈øity and fate. There is no ≈øelf-mover, ≈øelf-direction, ≈øelf-determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ≈øource of activity, in the univer≈øe. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is bani≈øhed out of the world‚Äîand the world mu≈øt have been eternal.</p>
               <p>WHETHER GOD could have acted otherwi≈øe than he hath? is a curious rather than profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enquiry. And as to the notion' of 'fitne≈øs of things, independent of the things them≈øelves, and without reference to the ≈øovereign mind,'
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:011623_0096_0F8777F2E6551470"/>
it is difficult even to imagine it; to ≈øay nothing of the impiety implied in ≈øuch a thought.</p>
               <p>WE have repre≈øented what we apprehend is the plain tendency, and indeed only con≈øi≈øtent ≈øen≈øe, of the ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øity before us. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was copied from Mr. <hi>Hume, Hobbs, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noza,</hi> or any of the old heathen Philo≈øophers we do not ≈øay. We hint the thing becau≈øe of a remarkable coincidence we have exhibited at the clo≈øe of the≈øe remarks, in ≈øome extracts from them, ≈øet over again≈øt ≈øimilar pa≈ø≈øages of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book. Though we have a right to renew valid objections, how oft ≈øoever they have been made before, until ≈øome tolerable an≈øwer is given to them (e≈øpecially when the old doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, to which the like objections were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, but not an≈øwered, are received.) Yet we would not repeat the charge, without giving a ≈øpecimen in ≈øupport of it. We really are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuaded, that there can be no po≈ø≈øible confutation of fatali≈øm on the principles of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book. He ≈øpeaks with ≈øatisfaction of the progre≈øs of <hi>metaphy≈øic ≈øcience;</hi> (325) of which and its 'ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible doings,' his own book, among others on fatality, is an alarming proof. [<hi>Epicurus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> reminds us, was 'the father of <hi>athei≈øm and licentiou≈øne≈øs,' David Hume,</hi> 
                  <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of modern epicuri≈øm: And whoever hath read his e≈ø≈øays and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s enquiry is better able to judge than one can from the few ≈øelect pa≈ø≈øages we have extracted, of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them.]</p>
               <p>NOT that we ≈øuppo≈øe Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ≈øaw, or allowed, the tendency and con≈øequences of his ≈øcheme to be ≈øuch as we have here repre≈øented;
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:011623_0097_0F8777F3559905B0"/>
he hath repeatedly declared the contrary. Still if the con≈øequences are fairly deduced‚Äîif in tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øages wherein he profe≈ø≈øes him≈øelf a friend to liberty he is either repugnant to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, or allows no liberty that is of any moment, or not connected with moral agency‚Äîlet any man of rea≈øon ≈øay, whether his ≈øcheme can be ≈øafe. His doctrine of nece≈ø≈øary connection, if plainly reducible to the con≈øequences we have mentioned, if con≈øi≈øtent with it≈øelf only in that ≈øen≈øe we have taken it, will be rejected by all who have a due regard to the moral perfections of GOD, for which we doubt not in the lea≈øt but Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had a ≈øupreme veneration. But great and good men are not always wi≈øe.</p>
               <p>IT is very much Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s method to an≈øwer objections by endeavouring to reduce the ≈øcheme of his adver≈øaries to the ≈øame ab≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; which, though it be a good argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> is by no means ≈øatisfactory. We might have expected ≈øome other an≈øwer in particular to the objections <hi>of the fate of the heathen,</hi> Hobbs<hi>'s nece≈ø≈øity, making men machines, making GOD the author of ≈øin,</hi> as well as other objections, than he hath given. But as we may pre≈øume Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> gave what appeared to him the be≈øt an≈øwer to the≈øe and ≈øuch like objections to the doctrine of nece≈ø≈øity; ≈øo we conclude from his known ≈økill in the ≈øubject, no ≈øolid an≈øwer can be given to the≈øe objections; otherwi≈øe he would have favoured the world with ≈øuch an an≈øwer, in≈øtead of eva≈øive ones.

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ≈øugge≈øts, (p. 38, 39) that ≈øome have ≈øuppo≈øed liberty to belong to the 'faculty, power, or property called will, ab≈øtractedly con≈øidered; and ≈øaith 'To talk of liberty or the contrary, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>very will it≈øelf,</hi> is not to ≈øpeak good ≈øen≈øe.

We know of none, who have contended for the freedom of the will, that have u≈øed the term will in this ab≈øtracted ≈øen≈øe. This curious di≈øtinction (made to ≈øhew, that there it not liberty in the will) was not ≈øufficiently attended to by our author. For through his book, the term will is generally u≈øed to denote the ≈øoul, the man, the agent, the mind. He ≈øpeaks of the will's <hi>acts,</hi> and ≈øaith, The will is the proper object of <hi>commands, &amp;c.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> would not ≈øay, that a property acts, or is the object of command, &amp;c.</note> or to any particular faculty: The proper que≈øtion is, Whether there be <hi>internal</hi> liberty in moral agents, or <hi>moral</hi> liberty in di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction

Such an enquiry cannot be very edifying. Metaphy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians may think it a fit ≈øubject of ≈øpeculation; but to common ≈øen≈øe it appears frivolous. The ≈øimple notion of liberty we ≈øhall argue for, is this, that <hi>mankind have inward moral freedom</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Some have ≈øuppo≈øed, that <hi>≈øpontaneous animal motion</hi> proves liberty. But though this may be an evidence of ≈øuch kind of liberty as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> allows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to moral agents, yet we think it ≈øugge≈øts not the idea of <hi>internal, moral</hi> liberty‚Äîthe only liberty which properly belongs to the ≈øubject of religion and morals.</note>‚Äî a power of <hi>≈øelf-determination.</hi> (Not meaning by ≈øelf-determination ≈øuch a power in 'the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or faculty of <hi>will,'</hi> but in the <hi>agent.</hi>) It may otherwi≈øe be called an inward principle or power of <hi>activity.</hi> That ≈øuch a power belongs to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents, particularly to mankind, is what we ≈øhall endeavour to evince; without endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ≈øtate the exact <hi>mea≈øure</hi> in which it is po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed, or within what <hi>≈øphere</hi> exerci≈øed by them. In ≈øome it may be in greater perfection, in others le≈øs. But ≈øome degree of it is e≈ø≈øential to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agency. At lea≈øt all moral agents, during

their probation, po≈ø≈øe≈øs it in ≈øome mea≈øure and degree.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Edwards,</hi> as hath been ≈øhewn, denies all ≈øelf-determining power, and inward liberty‚Äîa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerting, that '<hi>every</hi> determination of the will in chu≈øing and refu≈øing is nece≈ø≈øary.' (p 111, 113) But that an inward principle of activity, and power of volition or choice, belongs to mankind, we think is in a manner ≈øelf-evident. For it is granted on all hands, that moral good and evil lie in the ≈øtate of the mind, or prevailing internal di≈øpo≈øition of the agent. Liberty therefore, if at all nece≈ø≈øary to virtue and vice, mu≈øt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øed in that wherein the <hi>nature</hi> of morality and religion con≈øi≈øts‚Äîthat is, in the inward man. A freedom from <hi>external con≈øtraint</hi> is a liberty belonging to fools and madmen, and to the brute creatures. The≈øe, therefore, are as capable of virtue and vice, prai≈øe and blame, as beings endowed with, and in the exerci≈øe of rea≈øon, if this external (hypothetical) liberty is the only thing nece≈ø≈øary to moral agency. Fools, madmen, and brutes, if they are not bound or impri≈øoned, have natural liberty. They have a power, faculty, or property called <hi>will.</hi> Their actions are as voluntary (in many re≈øpects) as tho≈øe of mankind, who are of a found under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding The actions of brutes proceed from inclination and de≈øign‚Äîan inclination and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign proceeding from nature, or internal, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal bias.</p>
               <p>IF then an action's being <hi>voluntary</hi> (in the ≈øen≈øe of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book) makes it virtuous or vicious, the lower animals are ≈øo as really as intelligent creatures. As we are not accu≈øtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:011623_0102_0F8775B7A1BD0238"/>
to talk of virtuous or vicious herds of cattle, the epithets, as applied to them, may ≈øound ≈øomething odd and har≈øh at fir≈øt; but by the help of metaphy≈øics we may in time be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to ≈øuch language. We are not, indeed, to ≈øuppo≈øe our oxen and hor≈øes are morally good or bad in tho≈øe actions of theirs which are again≈øt their wills‚Äîto which they are externally <hi>impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>‚ÄîOr in regard to any in≈øtances of forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which are owing to external <hi>impediment</hi>‚Äî to which they have a will, and endeavour to perform, but are hindered from doing as they would. But the ca≈øes of <hi>coaction</hi> and <hi>re≈øtraint</hi> excepted, let it be ≈øhewn, on the pre≈øent hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis, that they are not proper ≈øubjects of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or blame, reward or puni≈øhment‚Äîand by the ≈øame arguments we pre≈øume it may be ≈øhewn, that mankind are not. If power or opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>execute</hi> a will or choice already produced by ≈øome extrin≈øic cau≈øe, be all that is meant by liberty, or that is nece≈ø≈øary to moral agency, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is perfectly <hi>ideal,</hi> and the controver≈øy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it is about a meer <hi>word.</hi> But if liberty be <hi>really</hi> e≈ø≈øential to moral agency, as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> admits; and if there cannot be liberty of acting or conducting farther than there is liberty of willing, chu≈øing, preferring, as hath been ≈øhewn‚Äîthe plain con≈øequence is, that liberty in the <hi>mind</hi> is e≈ø≈øential to moral agency. Upon Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ≈øcheme of liberty, it is not for the acts and exerci≈øes of their minds that men are accountable, but only for their outward actions. There is no moral turpitude in ≈øuch a ≈øtate of the ≈øoul or will as our Saviour de≈øcribes, <hi>Matt.</hi> v. 28, 32, but only in the <hi>execution</hi> of ≈øuch a di≈øpo≈øition. We know, indeed, that Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> intended not to a≈ø≈øert any ≈øuch thing as
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:011623_0103_0F8775B861111E50"/>
this, that malice, envy, pride, impure de≈øires, &amp;c. are innocent until they become effects: But is not this the con≈øequence of his allowing, that liberty is nece≈ø≈øary to moral agency, while he makes this liberty con≈øi≈øt only in a power a man hath to <hi>execute</hi> his will. If Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to a≈ø≈øert the above con≈øequence, (as it is plain he did not) then in the enquiry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the liberty of man con≈øi≈øts, ≈øomething farther is to be con≈øidered than material action‚ÄîThere mu≈øt be internal liberty, if liberty enters into the notion of a prai≈øe-worthy deed, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The proper que≈øtion, is, <hi>Whether we have and exerci≈øe liberty in that wherein the nature of virtue and vice con≈øi≈øts?</hi> And one might think this would not be made a que≈øtion.</p>
               <p>TO ≈øay that the mind is nece≈ø≈øarily determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all its acts, is making mankind nece≈ø≈øary agents in <hi>that</hi> thing which di≈øtingui≈øheth them from the inferior creatures. Without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral liberty, it is plain their actions cannot be of a moral nature, any more than tho≈øe can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led naturally free actions, which proceed from natural nece≈ø≈øity. Abridge a man's natural li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ever ≈øo much, his moral freedom may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; and if it doth, the willing or unwilling mind is rewardable or puni≈øhable.

                     <p>DR. <hi>Clark,</hi> (in his 'demon≈øtration of the being and attributes of GOD,' (tenth edition p. 83, 86) has argued the <hi>po≈ø≈øibility</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> of the communication of liberty to man in the following clear and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive manner. 'As a power of beginning motion, is not <hi>in it≈øelf</hi> an impo≈ø≈øible thing; becau≈øe it mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity <hi>be</hi> in the ≈øupreme cau≈øe: So neither is it impo≈ø≈øible to be <hi>communicated</hi> to created beings. The rea≈øon is plain: Becau≈øe no powers are impo≈ø≈øible to be communicated, but only tho≈øe which imply <hi>≈øelf-exi≈øtence,</hi> and ab≈øolute <hi>indepedency</hi>‚ÄîI know, the maintainers of fate are very confident, that a power of beginning motion, is nothing le≈øs than being really independent, or being able to act inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently from any ≈øuperior cau≈øe. But this is only a childi≈øh trifling with words: For a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of acting independently <hi>in this ≈øen≈øe,</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated at the plea≈øure of the ≈øupreme cau≈øe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued only during the ≈øame good plea≈øure, is no more real and ab≈øolute independency, than the power of <hi>exi≈øting</hi>‚Äîor than the power of <hi>being con≈øcious,</hi> or <hi>any other power</hi> what≈øoever, can be ≈øaid to imply <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</hi> In reality, it is altogether as hard to conceive, how <hi>con≈øciou≈øne≈øs,</hi> or the power of <hi>perception,</hi> ≈øhould be communicated to a created being, as how the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>≈øelf-motion</hi> ≈øhould be ≈øo‚ÄîYet no man doubts, but that he him≈øelf, and all others, have truly a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>perception.</hi> And therefore in like manner (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hard it may be to conceive, as to the <hi>manner</hi> of it; yet ≈øince, as has been now proved, it can never be ≈øhown to be impo≈ø≈øible and expre≈øly contradictory, that a power of <hi>≈øelf-motion</hi> ≈øhould be communicated.) I ≈øuppo≈øe no con≈øidering man can doubt, but that he actually has al≈øo a power of <hi>≈øelf-motion.</hi> For the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from continual <hi>experience</hi> and ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to prove that we <hi>have</hi> ≈øuch a power, are ≈øo ≈øtrong, that nothing le≈øs than a ≈øtrict demon≈øtration that the thing is ab≈øolutely impo≈ø≈øible, and implies an expre≈øs contradiction, can make us in the lea≈øt doubt that we have it not. We have all the ≈øame experience, the ≈øame marks and evidence exactly of our having real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a power of <hi>≈øelf-motion;</hi> as the mo≈øt rigid fatali≈øt could po≈ø≈øibly contrive to require, if he was to make the <hi>≈øuppo≈øition</hi> of a man's being endued with that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. There is no one thing that ≈øuch a man can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine <hi>ought</hi> to follow from the ≈øuppo≈øition of <hi>≈øelf-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which every man does not now as much feel and <hi>actually</hi> experience in him≈øelf, as it can po≈ø≈øibly be imagined any man <hi>would</hi> do, ≈øuppo≈øing the thing were true. Wherefore to affirm, notwith≈øtanding all this, that the ≈øpirits, by which a man moves the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, and ranges the thoughts of his mind, are them≈øelves moved wholly by air or ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tler matter in≈øpired into the body; and that again by other external matter, and ≈øo on; as the wheels of a clock are moved by the weights, and tho≈øe weights by gravitation, and ≈øo on; without a man's having the lea≈øt power, by any <hi>principle within him≈øelf,</hi> to think any one thought, or impel his own ≈øpirits in order to move any member of his body: All this is ≈øo contrary to experience and the rea≈øon of things, that unle≈øs the idea of <hi>≈øelf-motion</hi> were in it≈øelf as evidently and clearly a <hi>contradiction,</hi> as that two and two ≈øhould make five, a man ought to, be a≈øhamed to talk at that rate. Nay, a man of any con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of mode≈øty, would even in that ca≈øe be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt tempted rather to doubt the truth of his facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than take upon him to a≈ø≈øert one ≈øuch intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ab≈øurdity, merely for the avoiding of another. There are ≈øome indeed, who denying men the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>beginning motion,</hi> would yet ≈øeem in ≈øome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to account for their actions, by allowing them a power of <hi>determining</hi> motion. But this al≈øo is a mere ludicrous trifling with words. For if that power of <hi>determining</hi> motion, be no other in a man, than that which is in a ≈øtone to reflect a ball <hi>one certain way,</hi> this is ju≈øt nothing at all.

This faculty approves ≈øome actions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns others, detached from the con≈øideration of their effects and con≈øequences.

Yea, for the≈øe e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially (if not only) it approves or condemns us, as the≈øe are the foundation of life and conduct. In cen≈øuring or commending the conduct of others, we go upon a ≈øuppo≈øition of intelligence and de≈øign: For we judge very differently of the ≈øame actions as performed by an ideot, or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and by one in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of rea≈øon.

               </p>
               <p>NOW our e≈øtimating the moral character from internal di≈øpo≈øitions is on a ≈øuppo≈øition that <hi>the≈øe</hi> are within the power of the agent.

If we are made the means or in≈øtruments of what we do not intend, or are externally hindered from what we do intend, we are judged according to what we <hi>would</hi> have done. The rea≈øon is, that we have internal liberty in many in≈øtances, when we have not external. It is therefore much more proper to ≈øay, that natural nece≈ø≈øity, in any ≈øuppo≈øed ca≈øe, though it excu≈øeth an external

But did ever any man commend or accu≈øe him≈øelf for what he knew to be nece≈ø≈øary and unavoidable‚Äînot within his power, or not determined by him≈øelf? The inward perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vicious men feel proceeds from a convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they might have cultivated another frame of heart. If external con≈øtraint, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nece≈ø≈øity, renders a per≈øon incapable of ≈øuch commands as re≈øpect <hi>material</hi> action, moral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity, or internal con≈øtraint, mu≈øt render him equally incapable of ≈øuch commands as re≈øpect the exerci≈øes of the <hi>mind,</hi> or acts of volition‚Äî (admitting this to be <hi>original,</hi> and not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence of internal liberty abu≈øed.)

And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in a ≈øeries of acts, connected and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the prai≈øe or blame is to be attributed to the original act.

               <p>THE moral capacity we have been ≈øpeaking of, including moral obligation undeniably proves the internal liberty of mankind. As it implies a rule or guide of life, with authority and ≈øanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as we have an inward perception of good

Hence the injunction, <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the i≈ø≈øues of life.</hi> It is in the power of <hi>man</hi> to lay any external nece≈ø≈øity upon us, but no internal one.

               <p>WHETHER the holy angels ever had a moral ability of falling, we need not enquire; though we have no ground to determine the contrary. Beings made upright, we know, have revoked. Now if the malignity of apo≈øtate ≈øpirits again≈øt GOD, their unalterable oppo≈øition to him, be the con≈øequence of perverting a moral power they once had, it ≈øhews that finite beings may po≈ø≈øe≈øs a liberty of chu≈øing and acting otherwi≈øe than they do; and con≈øequently, that liberty may be di≈øtingui≈øhed from, and oppo≈øed to, moral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity. So with re≈øpect to apo≈øtate man, if he had originally a moral power of retaining his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, the inference is, that he po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only as oppo≈øed to con≈øtraint from without, but as oppo≈øed to moral nece≈ø≈øity. From the fall of angels and man, the inference therefore is not, that they were morally unable to keep their fir≈øt e≈øtate; but that they had a moral power, and abu≈øed it, Indeed, in the ca≈øe of their fir≈øt ≈øin, moral nece≈ø≈øity mu≈øt have been ≈øtrictly <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>‚Äî Not, as we are won't to call habits, a <hi>≈øecond</hi> nature, but a <hi>fir≈øt</hi> nature.

man, nor the angels that fell, had a moral ability at fir≈øt to continue in a ≈øtate of rectitude, to whom but their Creator mu≈øt their fall be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed? Their original powers were ≈øuch as he endowed them with. They could be required to exert no other. Their abilities, relations, and de≈øtination being ≈øuch as their great Former gave and intended, they could be an≈øwerable only for what was given. If, therefore, the fir≈øt act of ≈øin 'nece≈ø≈øarily followed from GOD's withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, or if that a≈ø≈øi≈øtance was not afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing' the fir≈øt tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, what is this but mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD the proper author of it? How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent this is with his moral character, or <hi>the po≈ø≈øibility of ≈øin,</hi> we need not ≈øay.

So that if 'there is not, and never can be, either in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence or idea, a freedom from moral nece≈ø≈øity, or a power of ≈øelf-determination‚Äîif every moral event is <hi>immediately</hi> or <hi>ultimately</hi> ordered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by GOD'‚Äî(403, 404.) the con≈øequence is, either that there is not, and never can be, ≈øin in the world; or if there is, it is wholly chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the fir≈øt cau≈øe. The only way to evade this con≈øequence is to admit, that the duty of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and man, before their fall, was no other than they had a moral as well as natural power to do.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine manife≈øtly implies a moral inability in man and angels <hi>before</hi> their fall. He ≈øaith he 'has demon≈øtrated, that the futurity of all events is e≈øtabli≈øhed by previous nece≈ø≈øity, either natural or moral; and that it is manife≈øt that the ≈øovereign Creator and Di≈øpo≈øer of the world has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this nece≈ø≈øity, by ordering his own conduct, either in de≈øignedly acting, or forbearing to act. That the whole ≈øeries of events is connected with ≈øomething in the ≈øtate of things, either po≈øitive or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which is original in the ≈øeries; i. e. ≈øomething which is connected with nothing preceeding that, but GOD's own IMMEDIATE conduct'‚Äîand in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard 'to the ≈øtate and acts of the will, EVERY event of this kind is nece≈ø≈øary by a moral nece≈ø≈øity' ‚Äî(p. 402, 403, 405, 406) 'The will always has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to act otherwi≈øe than it does'; (p. 35) that is, the man, or agent, or ≈øoul‚Äî'for the faculty of will doth not act, but the agent that hath it.' GOD does deci≈øively in his providence deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all the volitions and actions of moral agents, either by po≈øitive influence or permi≈ø≈øion‚Äîmeaning by permi≈ø≈øion, not only 'the not hindering ≈øin, but di≈øpo≈øing the ≈øtate and circum≈øtances of things in ≈øuch a manner, that ≈øin certainly and infallibly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from his di≈øpo≈øal‚Äî that GOD, <hi>when he had made man, ≈øo ordered his circum≈øtances, that from the≈øe circum≈øtances, together with the withholding divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, his ≈øin infallibly followed.</hi>' (p. 376)</p>
                     <p>THE fir≈øt ≈øin of angels and man was then morally nece≈ø≈øary, and proceeded from their original ≈øtate and circum≈øtances‚Äîfrom GOD's withholding nece≈ø≈øary a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. And this proves their original moral inability; which inability being 'connected with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preceeding, BUT GOD's OWN IMMEDIATE CONDUCT, which is ORIGINAL <hi>in the ≈øeries,</hi>' he mu≈øt be the <hi>author</hi> of it. For if he him≈øelf nece≈ø≈øitated them to ≈øin, by doing or forbearing what rendered the fir≈øt ≈øin unavoidable‚Äîif ≈øin followed from his ordering and di≈øpo≈øal, that maxim in philo≈øophy is ≈øtrictly applicable, '<hi>Cau≈øa deficiens, in rebus nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to conceive; nor indeed has he taken much pains to remove it, though he allows it 'is infinitely to be abhorred, and denies it to be the con≈øequence of what he has laid down.' In what ≈øen≈øe he thought it was to be 'abhorred,' and will not allow it to be the 'con≈øequence' of what he hath ≈øaid, has been already remarked. <note n="*" place="bottom">Sect. iv. Part ii. of the≈øe remarks.</note> However great that impotency is which mankind derive from <hi>Adam,</hi> there is a manife≈øt difference between a moral inability or nece≈ø≈øity <hi>derived from the fall</hi> of man, and a like kind of inability or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity <hi>original</hi> to the human race.

               <p>WE have but one thing farther to add.

               <p>BUT we may di≈ømi≈øs this matter.

               <p>WE readily grant, there can be no act of choice without ≈øome motive or induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if what hath been ob≈øerved, with re≈øpect to the power of creatures made upright to retain or forfeit their innocence, be admitted, it clearly follows, that the application of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, invitations, monitions, &amp;c. is con≈øi≈øtent with a freedom to <hi>either</hi> ≈øide. For who que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but rebel angels had the highe≈øt induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before their fall, to abide in their fir≈øt e≈øtate? We need not ≈øcruple to ≈øay, the ≈øtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt po≈ø≈øible motives could not be wanting in the pre≈øence of GOD‚Äîthat it was the highe≈øt <hi>apparent</hi> good, as well as their highe≈øt duty, and what they had a moral ability for, to continue ≈øubject to the great Creator. And it is really one of the mo≈øt inexplicable events, that beings in their ≈øituation ≈øhould fall. This event ≈øhews, beyond que≈øtion, that a liberty to either ≈øide is con≈øi≈øtent with the mo≈øt powerful motives to bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as and incline the will to one ≈øide.</p>
               <p>SO in the ca≈øe of innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> no one will ≈øay, that the motives in paradi≈øe, to hold fa≈øt his integrity, were in≈øufficient‚Äîor that their not proving effectual nece≈ø≈øarily proceeded from the

original, moral ≈øtate of his will, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the moral image of GOD. That he had a moral capacity to ≈øu≈øtain the federal trial is here taken for granted. Among other commands, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on his heart, or communicated by ≈øpecial intercour≈øe with Deity, he had one prohibition properly po≈øitive, which was made the te≈øt of his fidelity, accompanied with an expre≈øs threat, that he ≈øhould die in ca≈øe of non-forbearance in that in≈øtance; and implying a promi≈øe of life, if he refrained in this article. Whatever be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood by the death threatened, the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ≈øufficiently awful.

Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, invitations, promi≈øes, admonitions, &amp;c. are therefore con≈øi≈øtent with a moral ability to hearken or not hearken to them.</p>
               <p>FOR the ≈øame rea≈øon that <hi>≈øin</hi> could not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally nece≈ø≈øary at fir≈øt, it will be difficult to prove, that the continued <hi>holine≈øs</hi> of good angels was morally nece≈ø≈øary from the beginning.

               <p>FARTHER, with regard to fallen man, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> allows, that commands, &amp;c. are given to, and means u≈øed with ≈øinners, in unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. From hence he partly argues his doctrine

               <p>THE doctrine of nece≈ø≈øary connection of means and ends, as ≈øtated by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> implies one or other of the following things: Either that no means are employed with the unregenerate in order to their conver≈øion‚Äîor none that have a tendency to the end‚Äîor that they have not a moral power of u≈øing them‚Äîor their u≈øe of them is certainly and infallibly ≈øucce≈øsful.</p>
               <p>THAT <hi>means are u≈øed with unregenerate ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> grants.

If any reject the tender of ≈øalvation, the me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of it are directed to wipe off the du≈øt of their feet as a te≈øtimony again≈øt the de≈øpi≈øers of their me≈ø≈øage; leaving with them this ≈øolemn prote≈øtation, 'Be ye ≈øure of this, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD is come unto you.' We might mention the patience of GOD towards ≈øinners, &amp;c.‚Äîwhence it is apparent that means, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means, are u≈øed for the conver≈øion even of tho≈øe, who are at length re≈øigned up to their own hearts lu≈øt. But as this matter appears not to be conte≈øted by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> we ≈øhall pa≈øs to the next thing above mentioned.</p>
               <p>WHETHER the means u≈øed with the unregen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate have any <hi>tendency</hi> to the end? The very propo≈øing of this que≈øtion is enough. For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we u≈øe the <hi>means,</hi> it is in relation to ≈øome end. We intend by it the <hi>media</hi> through which any end is attained. So that to ≈øpeak of means, and deny their conducivene≈øs to the end, is an affront to common ≈øen≈øe, as nothing can properly be called a means farther than it hath, or is ≈øuppo≈øed to have, a tendency to accompli≈øh an end. And as all who maintain there are any in≈øtituted means of conver≈øion, allow them to have been ordained by infinite wi≈ødom, it would be impeaching ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme wi≈ødom and goodne≈øs to ≈øay, they are not calculated <hi>in the be≈øt manner</hi> to lead ≈øinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>NOT that any external means are efficacious in them≈øelves, but only through the divine concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with them. So it is in temporal and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:011623_0125_0F8775D122590F70"/>
matters; and ≈øo it is in the concerns of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Means and endeavors do not en≈øure worldly ≈øucce≈øs. They are in vain except GOD worketh with them. Yet who he≈øitates one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether the divine concurrence is to be expected in the u≈øe, and through the in≈øtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, of the means he hath pre≈øcribed, or the contrary? Exempt ca≈øes there are wherein means are ≈øuper≈øeded in mens temporal affairs: There may be like in≈øtances in the affairs of ≈øalvation. But the≈øe being <hi>exempt</hi> ca≈øes is a rea≈øon why ≈øpiritual ble≈ø≈øings are much rather to be expected in the u≈øe, than in the neglect of means.</p>
               <p>IT is the united voice of all Calvini≈øtic divines, that there is the greate≈øt po≈ø≈øible encouragement to the endeavours of unconverted men in the u≈øe of the means of ≈øalvation. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that moral inducements are u≈øed with them; and ≈øays, 'it is of the nature of ≈øuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, that they have ≈øomething <hi>inviting,</hi> ≈øome tendency to <hi>induce</hi> and <hi>di≈øpo≈øe</hi> to virtuous volition; to give the mind an <hi>inclination or bias</hi> to virtue‚Äîthat they can operate only by bia≈ø≈øing the will, and giving it a certain inclination one way‚Äî(p. 119, 125.) that motives have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves this nature and tendency in different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ≈øome greater, others le≈øs.' Now by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s principles every inclination, however weak, is of the nature of a di≈øpo≈øition to virtue, and leading to it. (For there can be no induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to virtue but ≈øuch as operate by giving the mind an inclination to it) If then the motives u≈øed with the unregenerate may excite a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclination, though in the <hi>lowe≈øt</hi> degree, we may, for the ≈øame rea≈øon, ≈øuppo≈øe this inclination increa≈øed to than degree as to become <hi>prepollent,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:011623_0126_0F8775D1E524A6D8"/>
through the influence of moral means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, in ≈øubordination to him who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all in all. And in proportion to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderation of the mind in favor of virtue, is the degree of virtue. How con≈øi≈øtent the≈øe things are with Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s 4th and 5th Sect. part 3d. and other things ≈øaid in his book, tho≈øe may judge, who will be at the pains to examine and compare them.</p>
               <p>IF it be ≈øaid, in the next place, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate have not a <hi>moral power to u≈øe the means of grace:</hi> This is the ≈øame ab≈øurdity as to ≈øay, the means have no tendency to the end. For how can means be ≈øaid to be afforded, which cannot be u≈øed? At be≈øt, they are as if not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded. How then can the go≈øpel be preached for a <hi>witne≈øs</hi> to ≈øuch as finally reject it? Why is it taken from ≈øome, becau≈øe they bring not forth the fruit of the kingdom, when they never had it in their power to receive its te≈øtimony? Can they be liable to an aggravated puni≈øhment for not u≈øing means, which they could not improve to any purpo≈øe? We repeat it to prevent mi≈øtakes that when we ≈øpeak of the ability of unregenerate men to u≈øe the means of grace, we mean not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent power in them≈øelves: (This the <hi>regenerate</hi> have not) But that ≈øuch influences of grace are vouch≈øafed, together with external means, as that tho≈øe might embrace the go≈øpel call, who, in event, reject it again≈øt them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER, there is a wide difference in the characters of unregenerate men. Some ≈øuch are <hi>nearer</hi> the kingdom of GOD than others. There is more hope of ≈øome than others of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

‚ÄîWhich things cannot be ≈øaid con≈øi≈øtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the ≈øuppo≈øition of unregenerate men's being utterly incapable of any good effect from the means of grace, through their own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in the u≈øe of them, and the common ≈øtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of GOD's ≈øpirit. And yet, what le≈øs is implied in the a≈ø≈øertion, that they cannot u≈øe the means that are employed with them, cannot improve a ≈øuppo≈øed price in their hands? For how then is the go≈øpel a di≈øpen≈øation of <hi>grace</hi> to them? Is it not rather a di≈øpen≈øation of <hi>wrath?</hi> To ≈øay that their incapacity is not <hi>natural,</hi> but <hi>moral,</hi> is ≈øaying nothing to the purpo≈øe, as we tru≈øt hath been ≈øhewn.

                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>. Is it determined beforehand, that any of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ≈øhall not u≈øe the means, of grace, or ≈øhall not ≈øucceed? If it is, let any man ≈øhew, how the go≈øpel can be a privilege to them, or they liable to a greater damnation for abu≈øing it.</p>
               <p>TO ≈øay la≈øtly, that the endeavours of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in the u≈øe of the means of grace are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly connected with <hi>≈øucce≈øs,</hi> is to ≈øay, that no means are employed with tho≈øe who die in their ≈øins; contrary to what Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> expre≈øsly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. And yet he mu≈øt either ≈øay this, or el≈øe that none but the regenerate can u≈øe the means of grace. We may ju≈øt as well affirm, that all converted men mu≈øt profit <hi>equally</hi> under the means of ≈øalvation, as that none can improve them at all but they who ≈øucceed. One may venture to a≈ø≈øert, that ≈øuch as hear the word, and anon with joy receive it, u≈øe the means of grace, though they ≈øhould endure but a while.</p>
               <p>THE means of religion, as tho≈øe of this life, are u≈øed with different degrees of application by

different per≈øons; which is the true ground (ordinarily) of their different ≈øucce≈øs.

               <p>'THE end of laws, we acknowledge, is to <hi>bind to one ≈øide;</hi> and the end of commands is to turn the will one way.'

ca≈øt away their cords from us.</hi> The title of the ≈øection, from which we have extracted the above words, is, <hi>Commands con≈øi≈øtent with moral inability.</hi> Now is the will of tho≈øe, who are under moral nece≈ø≈øity of di≈øobeying, turned and bia≈ø≈øed that way the command is? Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has offered many rea≈øons why their will <hi>ought</hi> to be turned to this ≈øide‚Äîto evince the propriety of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands given them notwith≈øtanding their <hi>original inability to turn this way.</hi> But he hath not ≈øhewn clearly, that 'commands and laws are therefore of <hi>no u≈øe,'</hi> becau≈øe the ≈øubject will not be bound thereby. Or admitting he had ≈øhewn this, we need not ≈øay how much or how little it makes for his purpo≈øe. One thing is hence obvious, that by his own confe≈ø≈øion and argument, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, invitations &amp;c, are of no u≈øe where there is a moral nece≈ø≈øity of being bia≈ø≈øed, or going, the contrary way.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER, as wicked men may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to virtue, con≈øi≈øtent with the ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition of their per≈øi≈øting in vice; in like manner good men have allurements to vice. Such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements they meet with from the fle≈øh, the world, and the devil. Hence they are called to watch and pray, that they enter not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion‚Äîto fight‚Äîto ≈øtrive for the ma≈øtery‚Äîto deny them≈øelves, and take up the cro≈øs‚Äîto take heed le≈øt they fall‚Äîand in general to work out their own ≈øalvation with fear and trembling.

be laid before tho≈øe who≈øe prevailing bias is to holine≈øs, not without a po≈ø≈øibility and pro≈øpect of their being overcome‚Äîwith which view they are always propo≈øed by the tempter. <hi>Adam,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with the moral image of GOD, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: And are his fallen ≈øons exempt from danger? The regenerate fall from virtue fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently through inadvertence, and the ≈øtrength of a pre≈øent temptation. They are, therefore, under no moral nece≈ø≈øity of being <hi>perfect,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can be free from ≈øin in this life. Or will any undertake to ≈øhew, that the ≈øins they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to are morally nece≈ø≈øary? According to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s doctrine they are ≈øo indeed. To ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe farther, as his doctrine doth, that the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect</hi> holine≈øs of the ≈øaints in this life is nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary by a moral nece≈ø≈øity, is a palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: For ≈øuch a nece≈ø≈øity being ≈øuppo≈øed would prove them incapable of any lap≈øe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Nece≈ø≈øity is <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>uniform,</hi> admitting of no <hi>variety or di≈ø≈øonancy</hi> of character: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the moral characters of good chri≈øtians are mixed, and in many in≈øtances contradictory. <hi>David</hi>'s murther and adultery were very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with his general character, and cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed to have been morally nece≈ø≈øary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with the opinion, that by the ≈øame nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity he was a man after GOD's own heart.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole, powerful motives to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, joined with a prevailing propen≈øity this way are yet to be found where there are in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances contrary volitions; and in ≈øome in≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, on ≈øome occa≈øions, to an high degree.

We may a≈øk, On what ground? if all volition and action is nece≈ø≈øary, in the ≈øen≈øe of his book. How is a 'per≈øon under previous obligation to con≈øider beforehand in ≈øome ca≈øes more than others?' (p. 262) Can he con≈øider without motives to con≈øideration pre≈øented to his mind?

               </head>
               <p>AS we have ≈øuppo≈øed the doctrine of nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty maintained in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s enquiry runs up to <hi>ab≈øolute fatality,</hi> we ≈øhall in this ≈øecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on con≈øider it in this view. We ≈øhall ≈øuppo≈øe ≈øuch a nece≈ø≈øity to be indeed agreable to philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophic truth. Taking for granted the coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and a ≈øtrict fatali≈øt, Dr. <hi>Butler</hi>'s rea≈øoning with the latter is in a good mea≈øure applicable to the former. We ≈øhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly take the liberty to extract from the chapter of his analogy, entitled, 'Of the opinion of nece≈ø≈øity, con≈øidered as influencing <hi>practice.</hi>' He introduces what he there ob≈øerves with this apology to his readers: 'As the puzzle and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcurity, which mu≈øt unavoidably ari≈øe from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing upon ≈øo ab≈øurd a ≈øuppo≈øition as that of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal nece≈ø≈øity, will, I fear, ea≈øily be ≈øeen; it will, I hope, as ea≈øily be excu≈øed.'</p>
               <p>WHEN it is ≈øaid by a fatali≈øt, that the whole con≈øtitution of nature, and the actions of men, that every thing, and every mode and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of every thing, is nece≈ø≈øary and could not po≈ø≈øibly have been otherwi≈øe; it is to be ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that this nece≈ø≈øity does not exclude delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, choice, preference, and acting from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain principles, and to certain ends: Becau≈øe all this is matter oi undoubted experience, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all, and what every man may, every moment, be con≈øcious of. And hence it follows,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:011623_0133_0F8775DB38C4E9C8"/>
that nece≈ø≈øity, alone and of it≈øelf, is in no ≈øort an account of the con≈øtitution of nature, and how things came <hi>to be</hi> and <hi>to continue</hi> as they are, but only an account of this <hi>circum≈øtance,</hi> relating to their origin and continuance, that they could not have been otherwi≈øe than they are and have been.</p>
               <p>NECESSITY as much requires and ≈øuppo≈øes a nece≈ø≈øary agent, as freedom requires and ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes a free agent, to be the former of the world. And the appearances of <hi>de≈øign</hi> and of <hi>final cau≈øes</hi> in the con≈øtitution of nature, as really prove this acting agent, to be an <hi>intelligent</hi> de≈øigner, or to act from choice, upon the ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ≈øuppo≈øed po≈ø≈øible, as upon that of freedom.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE then a fatali≈øt to educate any one, from his youth up, in his own principles, that the child ≈øhould rea≈øon upon them, and conclude that ≈øince he cannot po≈ø≈øibly behave otherwi≈øe than he does, he is not a ≈øubject of blame or commendation, nor can de≈øerve to be rewarded or puni≈øhed: Imagine him to eradicate the very perceptions of blame and commendation out of his mind, by means of this ≈øy≈øtem; to form his temper, and character, and behaviour to it; and from it to judge of the treatment he was to expect, ≈øay, from rea≈øonable men, upon his coming abroad into the world‚ÄîI cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ≈øtopping here to a≈øk, Whether anyone of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ≈øen≈øe would think fit, that a child ≈øhould be put upon the≈øe ≈øpeculations, and be left to apply them to practice? And a man has little pretence to rea≈øon, who is not ≈øen≈øible, that we are all children in ≈øpeculations of this kind. However, the child would doubtle≈øs be highly delighted to find him≈øelf freed from the re≈øtraints of fear and ≈øhame, with which his play-fellows were fettered
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:011623_0134_0F8775DC16AC5DF8"/>
and embarra≈ø≈øed; and highly conceited in his ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior knowledge ≈øo far beyond his years. But conceit and vanity would be the lea≈øt bad part of the influence, which the≈øe principles mu≈øt have, when thus rea≈øoned and acted upon, during the cour≈øe of his education. He mu≈øt either be allowed to go on, and be the plague of all about him, and him≈øelf too, even to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction: Or el≈øe correction mu≈øt be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made u≈øe of, to ≈øupply the want of tho≈øe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural perceptions of blame and commendation, which we have ≈øuppo≈øed to be removed; and to give him a practical impre≈ø≈øion, of what he had rea≈øoned him≈øelf out of the belief of, that he was in fact an accountable child, and to be puni≈øhed for doing what he was forbid. It is therefore in reality impo≈ø≈øible, but that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which he mu≈øt meet with, in the cour≈øe of his education, mu≈øt convince him, that if the ≈øcheme he was in≈øtructed in were not fal≈øe; yet that he rea≈øoned inconclu≈øively upon it, and ≈øome how or other mi≈øapplied it to practice and common life. But ≈øuppo≈øing the child's temper could remain ≈øtill formed to the ≈øy≈øtem, and his expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the treatment he was to have in the world be regulated by it; ≈øo as to expect that no rea≈øonable man would blame or puni≈øh him, for any thing which he ≈øhould do, becau≈øe he could not help doing it: Upon this ≈øuppo≈øition, it is mainife≈øt he would, upon his coming abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, be in≈øupportable to ≈øociety, and the treatment he would receive from it, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ≈øo to him; and he could not fail of doing ≈øomewhat, very ≈øoon, for which he would be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over into the hands of civil ju≈øtice. And thus, in the end, he would be convinced of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations he was under to his wi≈øe in≈øtructor. Or

≈øuppo≈øe this ≈øcheme of fatality, in any other way, applied to practice, ≈øuch practical application of it will be found equally ab≈øurd; equally fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious in a practical ≈øen≈øe: For in≈øtance, that if a man be de≈øtined to live ≈øuch a time, he ≈øhall live to it, though he take no care of his own pre≈øervation; or if he be de≈øtined to die before that time, no care can prevent it. Therefore all care to pre≈øerve one's own life is to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, which is the fallacy in≈øtanced in by the ancients.</p>
               <p>BUT now on the contrary, none of the≈øe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ab≈øurdities can be drawn, from rea≈øoning upon the ≈øuppo≈øition, that we are free, but all ≈øuch rea≈øoning with regard to the common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of life, is ju≈øtified by experience. And therefore, though it were admitted that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of nece≈ø≈øity were ≈øpeculatively true; yet, with regard to practice, it is as if it were fal≈øe, ≈øo far as our experience reacheth; that is, to the whole of our pre≈øent life. For, the con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, and the condition in which we are actually placed, is, as if we were free. And it may perhaps ju≈øtly be concluded, that ≈øince the whole proce≈øs of action, through every ≈øtep of it, ≈øu≈øpen≈øe, deliberation, inclining one way, determining, and at la≈øt doing as we determine; is as if we were free, therefore we are ≈øo. But the thing here in≈øi≈øted on is, that under the pre≈øent natural government of the world, we find we are treated and dealt with, as if we were free, prior to all con≈øideration whether we are or not. Were this opinion therefore of nece≈ø≈øity admitted to be ever ≈øo true; yet ≈øuch is in fact our condition and the natural cour≈øe of things, that whenever we apply it to life and practice,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:011623_0136_0F8775DD1CD92D78"/>
this application of it always mi≈øleads us, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but mi≈ølead us, in a mo≈øt dreadful manner, with regard to our pre≈øent intere≈øt. And how can people think them≈øelves ≈øo very ≈øecure then, that the ≈øame application of the ≈øame opinion may not mi≈ølead them al≈øo, in ≈øome analogous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with re≈øpect to a future, a more general and more important intere≈øt? For religion being a practical ≈øubject; and the analogy of nature ≈øhewing us, that we have not faculties to apply this opinion, were it a true one, to practical ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; whenever we do apply it to the ≈øubject of religion, and thence conclude that we are free from its obligations, it is plain this conclu≈øion cannot be depended upon.</p>
               <p>THE notion of nece≈ø≈øity, with re≈øpect to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ≈øubjects, therefore is as it were not true. Nor doth this contain any reflection upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon; but only upon what is unrea≈øonable. For to pretend to act upon rea≈øon, in oppo≈øition to practical principles, which the author of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gave us to act upon; and to pretend to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our rea≈øon to ≈øubjects, with regard to which, our own ≈øhort views, and even our experience, will ≈øhew us, it cannot be depended upon; and ≈øuch, at be≈øt, the ≈øubject of nece≈ø≈øity mu≈øt be; this is vanity, conceit and unrea≈øonablene≈øs.</p>
               <p>BUT this is not all. For we find within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves a will, and are con≈øcious of a character. Now if this, in us, be reconcileable with fate, it is reconcileable with it, in the author of nature. And be≈øides, natural government and final cau≈øes imply a character and a will in the governor and de≈øigner; a will concerning the creatures whom he governs. The author of nature then being
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:011623_0137_0F8775DDDCCB0860"/>
certainly of ≈øome character or other, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding nece≈ø≈øity; it is evident this nece≈ø≈øity is as reconcileable with the particular character of benevolence, veracity, and ju≈øtice in him, which attributes are the foundation of religion, as with any other character: Sure we find this nece≈ø≈øity no more hinders <hi>men</hi> from being benevolent than cruel; true, than faultle≈øs; ju≈øt than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øt.</p>
               <p>WE find GOD exerci≈øes the ≈øame kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over us, with that a father exerci≈øes over his children, and a civil magi≈øtrate over his ≈øubjects. Now, whatever becomes of ab≈øtract que≈øtions concerning liberty and nece≈ø≈øity, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears to us, that veracity and ju≈øtice mu≈øt be the natural rule and mea≈øure of exerci≈øing this government or authority, to a being, who can have no competitions, or interfering of intere≈øts, with his creatures and his ≈øubjects.</p>
               <p>WE have endeavoured to keep in view the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign we mentioned in the introduction, to examine only the <hi>ground-work</hi> of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entering into con≈øideration of the particular doctrines built thereupon. Whether they ≈øtand or fall with the foundation, is be≈øide our purpo≈øe to ≈øay‚ÄîOr whether what has been offered at all weakens this foundation is not for us to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. One thing, perhaps, appears, that men of ≈øtrong powers and great abilities are wont to wade beyond their depth, and bewilder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves and others with ≈øpeculations ab≈øtru≈øe and unprofitable‚Äîto ≈øay no wor≈øe. Great geniu≈øes are fruitful, many times, of great errors. There is a ≈øhew of ≈øcience, fal≈øely ≈øo called, which is
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:011623_0138_0F8775DEF6320218"/>
e≈øpecially incongruous in handling moral and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ≈øubjects; wherein the ≈øimple (who make much the greater part of mankind) are alike concerned as the wi≈øe and learned‚Äîand which, therefore, ought to be treated with the utmo≈øt plainne≈øs.</p>
               <p>WE do not deny but Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> was 'wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the name of a <hi>Philo≈øopher:'</hi> (p. 401) But we appeal to the publick, whether ≈øome of the mo≈øt famed Philo≈øophers in the Engli≈øh nation, for many years back, and at this day, have not philo≈øophi≈øed them≈øelves into ≈øceptici≈øm? One of fir≈øt di≈øtinction in particular (who≈øe e≈ø≈øays on ≈øome moral ≈øubjects are ≈øo nearly akin to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> on nece≈ø≈øity, that a reader might think the latter copied from the former) appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a di≈øbeliever in natural religion, not le≈øs than revealed. <note n="*" place="bottom">

We doubt not he had a ≈øtrong practical ≈øen≈øe of religion, which overbalanced his theory. But when great di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants are po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of a particular hypothe≈øis, they are apt to defend it many times by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of rea≈øoning, which leads to mo≈øt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous con≈øequences‚Äîwithout ≈øeeing or allowing tho≈øe con≈øequences, which, if fairly deduced, demon≈øtrate the hypothe≈øis it≈øelf to be wrong, or that they have argued wrong from it.</p>

            <p>A LEARNED writer, <note n="*" place="bottom">Jack≈øon.</note> who hath di≈øtinctly examined the opinion of the antients concerning fate, in a <hi>defence of human liberty in an≈øwer to</hi> Cato<hi>'s letters,</hi> hath clearly ≈øhewn, That the freedom of human actions was the almo≈øt unanimous doctrine of the philo≈øophers‚Äîthat it was taught by the five great ≈øects among the heathen, which comprehended all the philo≈øophy of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>; viz. The <hi>Stoics, Platonics, Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Ari≈øtatelians</hi> and <hi>Academics</hi>‚ÄîThat the mo≈øt <hi>rea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of the antients, of all ≈øects, were agreed, on the one hand, that NECESSITY was to be excluded from <hi>human actions,</hi> that ≈øo the di≈øtinction of <hi>virtue and vice,</hi> and the <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>puni≈øhments</hi> both of divine and human laws founded upon them, might be pre≈øerved inviolated: On the other hand, that <hi>fate,</hi> even with re≈øpect to human ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as well as to external events con≈øequent upon them, in which it was ab≈øolute and uncontrolable) was ≈øo far to be retained, as that it was to be allowed that <hi>antecedent cau≈øes</hi> were motives of acting, though the <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>efficient</hi> cau≈øe of action was a <hi>natural</hi> power and <hi>free exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the mind it≈øelf. <hi>Some</hi> things they held to be <hi>de≈øtined, others not;</hi> and di≈øtingui≈øhed the cau≈øes of things into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent and efficient, that they might exempt ≈øome from nece≈ø≈øity, and ≈øubject others to it; placing the <hi>human will</hi> among tho≈øe which they allowed not to be under nece≈ø≈øity‚Äîalways meaning by the <hi>efficient</hi> cau≈øe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man actions a principle of <hi>≈øelf-motion</hi> and <hi>exertion</hi> in the mind or agent‚Äîby the <hi>antecedent</hi> cau≈øe, the <hi>motive</hi> of action to the general efficient cau≈øe. <hi>Ab≈øolute</hi> fatality or nece≈ø≈øity, with re≈øpect to man, was under≈øtood only of <hi>external</hi> providential events, <hi>con≈øequential</hi> to the nature of their actions, pre≈øuppo≈øed to be free, and <hi>in their own power.</hi>

               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:011623_0141_0F8775F7E1E4A6A8"/>THEIR notion of liberty, upon the whole, was, Fir≈øt, <hi>a principle or power of action, ≈øelf-motion, exertion, or cau≈øation in the mind.</hi> In other words, that the cau≈øe of voluntary motion is in the nature of the mind it≈øelf, whatever external motive may proceed, or concur to the exertion of it. Hence, Secondly, That motives are only <hi>a≈ø≈øi≈øtant,</hi> not <hi>efficient</hi> cau≈øes.

            </p>
            <p>THE a≈ø≈øerters of univer≈øal fate had different notions about it. <hi>Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> were of the <hi>atomical</hi> ≈øect, who made every thing the nece≈ø≈øary effect of the eternal motion and concour≈øe of atoms, ≈øuppo≈øing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal chain of <hi>effects,</hi> without any original <hi>cau≈øe</hi> or <hi>agent</hi> at all. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> derived every thing from the <hi>fir≈øt cau≈øe</hi> of the univer≈øe as the <hi>efficient,</hi> ≈øtiling it <hi>fate;</hi> and ≈øuppo≈øing not only all other things which exi≈øt, but <hi>the purpo≈øes of our minds</hi> al≈øo, proceed from the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power of it‚ÄîWhich was making no agent in the world but the ≈øupreme cau≈øe, and human actions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the operations of GOD in men, actuating them, and every thing el≈øe, as the ≈øoul doth the body.</p>
            <p>The <hi>a≈øtrological</hi> notion of fate was, that every thing was effected by the circumvolution of the univer≈øe, and the po≈øitions and appearances of the planets and fixed ≈øtars.</p>

               <pb n="130" facs="unknown:011623_0142_0F8775F866D96F40"/>ANOTHER notion of fatality was founded in the ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of a <hi>mutual, eternal concatenation and chain of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> whereby things po≈øterior always follow tho≈øe which are antecedent, and are re≈øolved into them, as exi≈øting by them, and <hi>nece≈ø≈øarily</hi> con≈øequent to tho≈øe which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede them.

            <p>UPON the whole: One of the famous objections of the <hi>fatali≈øts</hi> of old to the liberty of human actions, and which is urged for nece≈ø≈øity by modern infidels, was, that every action re≈øults from a <hi>precedent motive or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,</hi> which rea≈øon or motive is <hi>out of our power.</hi> (<hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi>'s an≈øwer to <hi>Cato,</hi> p. 100.) We need not produce any pa≈ø≈øage from Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> to ≈øhew the coincidence. His whole ≈øcheme is founded on this principle.</p>
            <p>WE fear our quotations have already been too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, or it were ea≈øy to add to them. We pre≈øume they have been ≈øufficient to ≈øatisfy the attentive and impartial in regard to the coincidence we propo≈øed to exhibit. What pre≈øumption of the fal≈øhood of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ≈øcheme ari≈øeth from it's agreement with the doctrine of tho≈øe who reject the evidence of the chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an revelation, and even believed not (≈øome of them) in the perfections and moral government of GOD, we ≈øhall not ≈øay; though the ≈øu≈øpicion that it is fallacious, ari≈øing from the compari≈øon we have made, will not, we tru≈øt, be thought incon≈øiderable, whether it can or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be di≈øtinctly perceived where the fallacy lies. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, we ≈øhould not have troubled the reader with this appendix but for a rea≈øon already a≈ø≈øigned. For if his ≈øcheme hath the tendency, and is reducible to the con≈øequences, we have attributed to it, all but infidels will allow this to be a full demon≈øtration of it's fal≈øhood. Whether the fallacy of the rea≈øoning of his book can be di≈øtinctly traced, or with what cla≈øs of writers it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incides, is not the que≈øtion‚ÄîBut whether the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are ju≈øtly drawn.</p>

               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:011623_0152_0F87760B37B0C278"/>IF any, who may think the 'things which have been alledged worthy of being read, or of ≈øo much notice as to ≈øay much about them, ≈øhould have their indignation or di≈ødain rai≈øed,' we can truly ≈øay, that we meant to rai≈øe neither. We ≈øat down with a determination to avoid every thing per≈øonal. If we have broken through this determination, it is an inadvertence we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect. Whatever we think of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ≈øy≈øtem, we doubt not the goodne≈øs of his heart; and believe he is entered into the reward of a good and faithful ≈øervant, where even great men ≈øee they knew but in part while they tabernacled in fle≈øh, and perhaps entertained ≈øome dangerous errors. For we have not ≈øo learned Chri≈øt as to infer the badne≈øs of any man's heart from the fal≈øhood of his ≈øpeculative opinions.</p>
