            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CAVERN OF DEATH.</head>
            <p>
               <q>HOW awful is the approach of night amid theſe dreary ſhades!</q>
cried the brave Sir Albert, as he traverſed the moſt deſolate part of the Black Foreſt. Theſe were the firſt words that eſcaped his lips, ſince, about mid-day, he had entered that wild deſart: and they were heard with ſatisfaction by Maurice, his Eſquire and only attendant, whom reſpect had for ſome time with difficulty reſtrained from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſilence, which, interrupted only at intervals by the ſhrieks of the owl, or the flutter of the bat, ſeemed to deepen the horrors of that gloomy ſcene, and impreſſed on his mind a ſuperſtitious dread, which had no viſible object, yet roſe to the moſt agonizing height.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028401_0005_0FD8F315AC6FBF68"/>"Ah, Sir!" cried he,
<q>what courage leſs intrepid than yours, would at this hour of darkneſs thus raſhly penetrate the receſſes of this Foreſt?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have ſeen thee bold in battle, Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</q>
ſaid Sir Albert:
<q>what mighty danger doſt thou apprehend in this ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which thou canſt deem it raſhneſs in me to encounter?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Such ſcenes as theſe," returned the Eſquire,
<q>bring every deed of horror to one's thought: in gloom like this, the Daemons of the Air, and Spirits of the Dead, have power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My conſcience is clear from every deed,</q>
ſaid Sir Albert:
<q>which ſhould make me dread the vengeance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Spirits; and I truſt that Heaven and good Angels will defend me from the malice of the Powers of Darkneſs. For any mortal foes I am armed, and fear not to encounter them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Would to heaven I had turned my back,</q>
cried Maurice,
<q>before I had reached this diſmal place!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"And how could we have avoided it?" demanded the knight.
<q>Thou haſt thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028401_0006_0FD8F318EC91C270"/>
been my guide towards the Caſtle of Dornheim.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I expected you would have reached it ere ſun-ſet, Sir,</q>
returned the Eſquire: "but you have rode ſo ſlowly"—</p>
            <p>"It is true," ſaid Sir Albert:
<q>my mind has been too much occupied with the thoughts of her on whoſe account, as to thee only I have confided, I have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled hither, to leave me any leiſure to recollect the tardy pace of my wearied horſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He was then beginning to relapſe into his former muſing; but Maurice, who, in the ſound of a human voice, had found ſome relief from the terrific phantaſms which haunted his imagination, was eager to engage him in further diſcourſe; and though already acquainted with the ſtory of his love, yet, ſince he knew the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with which on that ſubject his maſter would always enlarge, he would not miſs the opportunity of introducing it.</p>
            <p>"Did you not tell me, Sir," ſaid he,
<q>that it was three years ſince laſt you ſaw the Lady Conſtance?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:028401_0007_0FD8F31E22340310"/>"It is more," replied Sir Albert.
<q>My heart would perſuade me I had been ſeparated from her during countleſs ages. —Ah! could I but know with what aſpect ſhe would review me!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"It is impoſſible, Sir," ſaid Maurice,
<q>that to merit and conſtancy like yours, ſhe can be inſenſible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"While I was at a diſtance from her," ſaid Sir Albert,
<q>I was pleaſed at being thus flattered; my own heart flattered me. I knew indeed, that for me ſhe had never acknowledged any affection; but I knew that towards all others ſhe had ſhewn the moſt marked indifference; and even from the ſolicitude with which ſhe would often ſhun me, I could then draw a favourable inference, ſince, had ſhe not been conſcious that I adored her, ſhe could have had no cauſe to treat me with leſs courteſy than others; and love ſo carefully concealed as mine, what but reciprocal love could have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered? What other motive, have I vainly fancied, could have ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffuſed her check with bluſhes, if I gazed on her, perhaps too eagerly?
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028401_0008_0FD8F31F851646D0"/>
What elſe could have occaſioned her emotion when we parted? Had I been indifferent to her, would ſhe not—after ſo long an acquaintance with me, would ſhe not have bidden me adieu? But the unfiniſhed ſentence died upon her lips; and, though ſhe haſted from my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, I had ſeen the tear that was ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her eye.</q>
—Sir Albert pauſed, and was for ſome moments loſt in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der recollection; but preſently recovering himſelf— "Such," ſaid he, <q>have been the
ideas which have enabled me to live, while I have been exiled from her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but, now that I approach her dwelling, now that my heart once more beats with the expectation to review her, I dare no longer cheriſh theſe flattering illuſions. If I have deceived myſelf, how cruel will be my diſappointment! And though my fondeſt hopes ſhould have been juſt, ſhould ſhe have returned my tendereſt affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet, after ſo long a ſeparation, dare I believe that I ſtill retain a place in her remembrance? May not ſome Lover, more worthy to poſſeſs
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028401_0009_0FD8F323A65E1520"/>
her, have long ere this effaced every trace of me from her heart?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I have often wondered, Sir," ſaid Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
<q>how, with ſo ſtrong an attachment to the Lady Conſtance, you could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to quit Prague, where ſhe reſided, without declaring to her your ſentiments and endeavouring to obtain the avowal of hers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I have told thee, Maurice," returned
Sir Albert, <q>that I had rather have died than have engaged her whoſe happineſs I prized above my own, to ſhare the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of a man who had ſo little proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of being able to place her in a rank worthy of her merit.—I not now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any ſuch preſumptuous views: I wiſh but to ſee her: of what further I deſire, my own heart is unconſcious. Perhaps, ſince my Sword has purchaſed me ſome portion of renown; ſince I have received the honour of Knighthood from the imperial Frederick Barbaroſſa, and have acquired ſeveral noble friends who have promiſed me their ſervices—per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, at ſome future period, I may find myſelf in a ſituation—But I have already
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028401_0010_0FD8F324D2032138"/>
ſaid I will not indulge theſe thoughts. How far diſtant, Maurice, is the Caſtle of Hertzwald, where ſhe now reſides, from that of the Baron of Dornheim?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"It is little more than a league," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Eſquire.
<q>I was frequently there while I dwelt at the Caſtle of Dornheim. It was then occupied by her Uncle; at whoſe death, a few months ſince, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to her Father.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another interval of ſilence now enſued; but Maurice, again ſolicitous to break it—
<q>Did you never, Sir, acquaint Lord Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric with your love?</q>
ſaid he.</p>
            <p>"No, never," replied Sir Albert;
<q>for though, from the time when it was my fortune to ſave his life in battle he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways profeſſed for me the warmeſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet his own inſenſibility to the ſofter paſſions, deterred me from placing in him the ſame confidence on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as I readily ſhould on any other. It was by accident that he mentioned to me the arrival of the Father of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſettle ſo near the Caſtle of Dornheim, whither he had before ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently invited me. Had he ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028401_0011_0FD8F32B5EB8D670"/>
a paſſion like mine. I have often ſince reflected, that the eager emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which I then accepted his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation might ſufficiently have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him the ſecret of my ſoul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"From his childhood," ſaid Maurice,
<q>Lord Frederic was ever of a haughty and violent temper—a ſtranger to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and pity; and, though I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him many favours and was yet more ſecure of the protection of the Baron his Father, I account myſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in my removal from— But whence this ſudden ſtream of light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our paths?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Is it not the moon emerging from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a cloud?" ſaid Sir Albert.</p>
            <p>"The moon is already ſet," returned the Eſquire, trembling with renewed fears.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert looked up—the thick inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven branches of the trees in that ſpot obſtructed his view; but, advancing a few paces to a more open place, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſmall black cloud, which ſeemed to hang lower than the reſt, and hovered over his head with a tremulous motion, from the broken edges of which darted
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028401_0012_0FD8F32E94812158"/>
forth flaſhes of light ſufficiently ſtrong to diſſipate the darkneſs, which by this time completely overſpread the earth. Sir Albert gazed on it with wonder, and with that awe which any ſupernatural appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance neceſſarily impreſſes on the mind. The terrified Maurice dropped the reins, and in ſpeechleſs agony expected ſome event of horror.—Preſently they heard in the air a loud ſhriek, which ſeemed utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no mortal voice; and at the ſame moment the clouds burſt aſunder; and while the darker parts faded away, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſurrounding air, all the rays of light which had ſtreamed from it, ſeemed to unite in one large ball of fire, and, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending towards the earth with a rapid courſe, ſunk amid a thick cluſter of trees, and ſtill continued to gleam behind their branches. Sir Albert inſtantly ſpurred forward his horſe, and haſtened towards the ſpot. Maurice, with a trembling voice, urged him to forbear; but regardleſs of his fears the Knight advanced, and, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a paſſage through the trees, ſaw that the Meteor ſtill appeared ſuſpended over the entrance of a deep dark Cavern, which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028401_0013_0FD8F330D30C9258"/>
was illuminated by its ſplendour: but ere he could come quite up, it ſunk into the abyſs, and every object was enveloped in a thicker darkneſs than before.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert, for ſome moments, heſitated how to act: his mighty courage, which always impelled him to attempt every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous adventure, ſtrongly urged him to enter the Cavern, and explore the myſtery which ſome inward and inexplicable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion concurred with the appearance of the Meteor to perſuade him he ſhould diſcover within its receſſes; yet the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night, which ſeemed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the poſſibility of ſuch a diſcovery, and the probability that the Cavern might be the abode of ſavage beaſts or venomous ſerpents, to whoſe fury ſhould he, in that diſmal place, expoſe himſelf, he might periſh ingloriouſly, the victim of an unjuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable temerity, at laſt determined him to defer the attempt till the morrow, when he purpoſed to return with lights; and for the preſent to purſue his journey to the Caſtle of Dornheim, where he was already apprehenſive he ſhould arrive too late for admittance. On returning to Maurice,

he found him ſo overcome with terror, that he ſeemed ſcarcely to retain his ſenſes: he talked wildly of a Spirit who purſued him, and of voices iſſuing from the Cavern. Sir Albert, though ſeldom moved to anger by any trivial cauſe, was at laſt impatient of fears he deemed ſo groundleſs, and reproved his folly with a harſhneſs which ſeemed in ſome degree to recall him to himſelf.</p>
            <p>They had not proceeded far, before they diſcovered a light through the trees; Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice ſtarted, and would have turned back; for the Meteor ſtill haunted his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and left him no recollection of the vicinity of the Caſtle of Dornheim, whence Sir Albert concluded the light to proceed, and he ſoon found that his conjecture was juſt. On approaching nearer, he perceived that the whole front of the Caſtle was il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated; and, amid many voices which he heard within its walls, he could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the ſtrains of mirthful muſic. Though the ſoul of Sir Albert was little diſpoſed to ſhare in this apparent feſtivity, he was pleaſed to find that the drawbridge was not yet raiſed, nor the porter retired to reſt; which had he found to be the caſe,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028401_0015_0FD8F336CE88DEF8"/>
it had been his intention rather to take up his lodging for that night in the Foreſt, than to diſturb the family at an unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hour. On ſounding a horn which was ſuſpended by the gate, it was inſtantly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred, and a Seneſchal came forth, and invited him to enter, telling him, that on that day admittance was free to all. Sir Albert could not but demand what proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous event was the occaſion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing which he perceived in the Caſtle. The Seneſchal replied, that it was to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the approaching nuptials of the Baron with a Lady whom he had for ſome time courted, and which, it had been that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſettled, ſhould take place in three days time. The Knight then demanded to ſpeak with Lord Frederic; he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into a ſpacious apartment, where he had not waited long before Lord Frederic came.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert, having raiſed the vizor of his caſque, advanced to accoſt him; but he no ſooner recognized the Knight, than, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him time to ſpeak, he embraced him with an eagerneſs ſufficiently expreſſive of his joy. "Is it poſſible, my friend!"
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028401_0016_0FD8F3392E9078A0"/>
cried he, <q>that I behold thee here? Thy
arrival at this juncture was the object of my moſt ardent wiſhes; it was an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to which my hope durſt ſcarce aſpire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I conſider ſo kind a welcome, my Lord!</q>
replied Sir Albert,
<q>as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional proof of your friendſhip towards me; and it enhances the pleaſure this meeting has afforded me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Aſcribe not my joy to friendſhip on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</q>
replied Lord Frederic:
<q>my own intereſt has too principal a ſhare in it.— To ſee thee at any time I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice; but now, when to valour like thine I may owe the felicity of my life, thy fortunate arrival has recalled me from deſperation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"What mean you, my Lord?" ſaid the Knight;
<q>what cauſe can have reduced you to deſpair? and in what manner can I be ſo happy as to ſerve you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is not now a ſeaſon to explain myſelf more fully,</q>
ſaid Lord Frederic:
<q>among the crowds who now enter promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly every apartment in the Caſtle, I know not who may over-hear me. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028401_0017_0FD8F33931F663D8"/>
morning we will walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Foreſt. Meanwhile I will lead thee to the feaſt: after thy journey hither, refreſhment may be welcome to thee; but, amid the ſports and folly of my Father's ſervile train, let the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of our mutual amity poſſeſs thy mind; and let me find thee to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as thou haſt ever hitherto appeared to me, a friend on whom I may rely.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The words of Lord Frederic, and ſtill more the agitation of his manner, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and alarmed Sir Albert: he renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his aſſurances of his readineſs to ſerve him, and they walked together to the Great Hall of the Caſtle. Lord Frederic there preſented his newly arrived friend to his father, who was encircled by a crowd of the gueſts who were come to partake of his feſtival. The Baron on hearing his name announced, turned haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round; but, inſtead of bidding him welcome, he for ſome moments regarded him and continued ſilent.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert, who had expected a different reception, was in ſome degree confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at this; and Lord Frederic, viſibly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028401_0018_0FD8F33D0611C988"/>
offended at his father's coldneſs towards
friend to whom he owed ſo much— "I thought, my Lord,"
ſaid he,
<q>I had already informed you, that it was this valiant Cavalier who expoſed his own life to the moſt imminent danger, to reſcue me from the enemies againſt whom, wearied, and fainting with loſs of blood, I was no longer able to defend myſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And I will eagerly embrace every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, my Son!</q>
returned the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, ſtarting as if from a deep muſing,
<q>to prove to him and to the world, how dearly I prize that life which he then preſerved.—Moſt valiant Sir!</q>
conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, addreſſing himſelf to Sir Albert,
<q>I muſt entreat your forgiveneſs, if, at the moment of your approach, my thoughts were ſo far engroſſed by other matters, that I did not, immediately on the mention of your name, recollect the vaſt obligation I was under to you. It is with unfeigned joy that I embrace the deliverer of my Son, and perſonally expreſs to him the gratitude and eſteem which I long have borne him. You
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028401_0019_0FD8F34150C2EC90"/>
are moſt welcome to my Caſtle; and I flatter myſelf that you will ſhew, by the length of your abode in it, your perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſatisfaction your preſence affords me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir Albert made a ſuitable reply to this compliment; and, after a few more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of courteſy, the Baron entreated him to diſarm. The Knight at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; but on being further preſſed, he complied; and retiring to a private cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he was attended by his own Eſquire, and by one of the domeſtics of the Caſtle, who, by the Baron's command, brought him a rich robe to put on, after he ſhould have quitted his arms.</p>
            <p>As Maurice was unbuckling his corſlet. Sir Albert perceived that his hand trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled —"Thou haſt not yet," ſaid he,
<q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the terror which ſeized thee in the Foreſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Eſquire acknowledged he had not.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Did you meet with any alarming ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture there, Sir?</q>
ſaid the Baron's domeſtic.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We paſſed near the mouth of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</q>
returned Sir Albert:
<q>what
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028401_0020_0FD8F34152BAE430"/>
terrific viſions Maurice might behold there, himſelf can beſt inform you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"The mouth of a cavern?" exclaimed the domeſtic; "and near this Caſtle?"</p>
            <p>"Scarce a furlong diſtant," replied the Knight.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And did you then ſee nothing there, Sir?</q>
rejoined, the other.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What ſhould you ſuppoſe me to have ſeen?</q>
demanded Sir Albert, with ſome emotion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>So many ſights of terror have been ſeen in that ſpot,</q>
returned the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic, <q>that it is long ſince any of us have dared to approach it. That Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern is aſſuredly the habitation of the Infernal Spirits. Sometimes there have been heard in it hollow groans, or ſhrieks of anguiſh; ſometimes, noiſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the ruſhing of torrents, or the rumbling of pent-up vapours. There is a report, that ſome murder was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly perpetrated there, and that it is the avenging Spirit of the Dead who ſtill haunts the place where he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united from his body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:028401_0021_0FD8F342D1862520"/>
               <q>Were theſe opinions current, Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</q>
ſaid Sir Albert,
<q>during the time of thy abode at this Caſtle?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have heard ſome mention of them, Sir,</q>
returned the Eſquire, paler than before.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And how long is it ſince theſe ſtrange noiſes and appearances were firſt noticed in the Cavern? ſaid the Knight.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I have been told, Sir," returned the Baron's domeſtic,
<q>that the firſt porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous circumſtance obſerved there, was a light which ſhone round the mouth of it, ſome four or five and twenty years ago, nearly about the time when the Caſtle came into the poſſeſſion of the preſent Lord. But I can aver nothing on the ſubject with any certainty, as it is ſcarcely three months ſince I came hither myſelf; and all the events of that diſtant period have been variouſly related to me by different perſons belonging to the Caſtle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thou, Maurice, cameſt hither with the preſent Baron,</q>
ſaid Sir Albert—
<q>Doſt not thou remember any further particulars? Did no tradition point
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028401_0022_0FD8F3471BBB0B78"/>
out who this murdered perſon was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Some Traveller, wandering in the Foreſt, Sir,</q>
replied Maurice;
<q>but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the murder was only a vague re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and the Cavern had been dreaded equally by the neighbouring people, from a period far earlier than that of the acceſſion of the Baron.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Has this Cave any particular name?" demanded the Knight.</p>
            <p>"It is called the <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Die Hole des Todes,</hi> is the name which it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and the neighbouring Peaſantry at this day dread to approach it, and entertain many wild and ſuperſtitious ideas reſpecting it.</note> 
               <hi>Cavern of Death?</hi>" returned the domeſtic.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert made an end of attiring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſilence; for this account of a place where he had himſelf witneſſed a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which he believed to be ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, had made a deep impreſſion on his mind. —His deſire to penetrate the innermoſt receſſes of the Cavern was now ſtronger than ever: he judged it, however, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to forbear mentioning the deſign he had conceived, ſince he knew not who
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028401_0023_0FD8F34BC4DA3FA0"/>
might have an intereſt in preventing the dire diſcoveries to which he was inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded it would lead.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was ready, he returned to the Great Hall, where the Baron and his Son received him with new demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of joy. A magnificent banquet was now ſpread. The Baron placed Sir Albert in the moſt honourable ſeat, neareſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and treated him as a gueſt of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtinction. Sir Albert, however, could not but obſerve, that from time to time he fixed his eyes on him with a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intentneſs, but they were inſtantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted if his encountered them. For Lord Frederic, his ſtern and frowning brow ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently expreſſed the diſturbance of his mind; he joined in no diſcourſe with any of the gueſts; and if ever a momentary ſmile diſpelled the gloom of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it was when he looked towards his newly arrived friend. As Sir Albert extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand acroſs the table the luſtre of a ring he wore on his finger caught the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's eye. He praiſed its richneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted permiſſion to view it more cloſely. Sir Albert immediately took it off, and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028401_0024_0FD8F35082FD32A0"/>
preſented it to him. It was a large ruby, encircled with brilliants. The Baron ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined it with great attention, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ruby to be the moſt valuable he had ever ſeen.</p>
            <p>"I am myſelf, Sir Knight," added he,
<q>well ſkilled in jewels; and you have ſhewn yourſelf to be equally ſo, by the purchaſe of ſo fine a ſtone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I aſſure you my Lord," returned Sir Albert,
<q>I am totally unqualified to judge of its value: it bears, indeed, an high one to me—not on account of its own richneſs, but becauſe it is the only relic I retain of my deceaſed Father.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baron again praiſed the beauty of the ring, and returned it to its owner.</p>
            <p>The banquet was not ended till a very late hour. At laſt, when it was almoſt morning, the gueſts departed, well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the hoſpitality they had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced; and the Baron himſelf conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sir Albert to the chamber he had cauſed to be prepared for him, where, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many expreſſions of courteſy, he left him. In his way thence he met Maurice, who was going to attend upon his maſter.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028401_0025_0FD8F3520E4C6E50"/>
He immediately knew him, and expreſſed his ſatisfaction at his return to the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>"I was ſorry," added he,
<q>that you ſhould receive any cauſe for diſpleaſure in the ſervice of my Son: but though you choſe to quit him, you may remain aſſured of my friendſhip and protection.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Eſquire thanked him for this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; and the Baron, telling him he would gladly ſpeak further with him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to repair to his apartment in the morning, as early as he ſhould riſe.</p>
            <p>Maurice then attended his maſter, who ſoon diſmiſſed him, and retired to reſt; but it was long before ſleep cloſed his eyes. Lord Frederic's myſterious expreſſions and viſible melancholy, rendered him anxious for further diſcourſe with him; but he was yet more impatient to enter the Cavern, of which ſuch ſtrange accounts had been given him. He loſt himſelf in vain conjectures reſpecting the cauſe of the noiſes and extraordinary appearances reported to proceed from it, and was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that ſome deed of horror had been perpetrated there; though, had it not been for what he had himſelf obſerved, he might
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028401_0026_0FD8F3568EAF4700"/>
probably have treated the whole as the viſion of the idle ſuperſtition of the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants. At laſt his thoughts, ſeldom ſo long diverted from the object of his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affections, returned into their uſual channel: the idea of his vicinity to the dwelling of the Lady Conſtance poſſeſſed itſelf of his ſoul, and left him no recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of any thing beſide. His imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſeemed already to have exhauſted every poſſible circumſtance which might attend their meeting; yet he continued retracing each fond idea, till, overcome by wearineſs and watching, he at laſt fell into a ſlumber.</p>
            <p>His dreams did not correſpond with this lateſt ſubject of his meditations: they were diſmal, myſterious and terrific.—He imagined himſelf again ſeated at the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's feſtive board; the ſtrains of muſic again ſounded in his ears; mirth ſparkled in the eyes of every gueſt, and the light of innumerable tourches diffuſed an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial day: when ſuddenly their brightneſs was eclipſed by the interpoſition of a dark ſhadow, which ſkimmed along the table, and ſometimes ſeemed to reſt hovering
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028401_0027_0FD8F35948FAF340"/>
over the centre of it. Sir Albert and all the gueſts looked up, and beheld a moſt hideous Spectre, of a gigantic ſize, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing the air above their heads with a ſlow and melancholy flight; his ſtern and threatening aſpect appalled every heart. As they regarded him, an hollow voice proclaimed,</p>
            <l>—"The fated hour is come!</l>
            <l>"And the fell powers of vengeance are abroad!"</l>
            <p>The Caſtle ſhook from its foundations: tht Spectre waved his wings, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately a thick miſt aroſe, which in a few moments enveloped all who were preſent. Sir Albert could no longer diſtinguiſh any object; but, amid the general darkneſs, his ears were thrice aſſailed with ſkrieks of horror. On a ſudden, a vivid ray of light ſtreamed from the Eaſt upon the ſpot on which he ſtood; he turned his eyes, and beheld a cloud reſembling that which the preceding evening had directed his ſteps to the <hi>Cavern of Death</hi>; and by degrees he diſcerned, ſeated in the midſt, a warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, clad in refulgent arms, and bearing on his breaſt the enſign of the croſs. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diance
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028401_0028_0FD8F35E675778E0"/>
which ſurrounded him diſperſed the miſt and Sir Albert found, that of all the company who had been aſſembled at the feaſt, himſelf alone remained. The horrible Spectre had alſo diſappeared at the approach of this leſs terrific phantom, who, deſcending from the cloud, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding Sir Albert with a look of celeſtial benignity, extended his arms to embrace him. Sir Albert with an emotion which he had never before experienced, haſtened towards him; but no ſooner did the Phantom meet his touch, than its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeemed to fade away; its ſhining arms dropped off, and the Knight perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had folded a ſkeleton to his breaſt.—He ſtarted, and uncloſed his arms with horror! yet it fell not to the ground; but, waving in the air a bloody ſword, which at firſt it had not weilded, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly uttered, in a thin faint voice theſe words:</p>
            <l>"From this cold hand thou muſt receive this ſword,</l>
            <l>"Ere I can be aveng'd, or thou reſtor'd!"</l>
            <p>And immediately vaniſhed.</p>
            <p>The horror it had inſpired awoke Sir Albert. A dewy chill had invaded his
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028401_0029_0FD8F35F483DE0E8"/>
limbs;—for ſome moments he ſcarce durſt raiſe his eyes, left they ſhould meet ſome ſhape of terror; and the fear which now poſſeſſed his ſoul, was perhaps the more painful to him, becauſe it was the firſt time he had ever experienced its power. By degrees, he became ſenſible that it had no other object than a dream; but though he then ſoon ſhook it off, yet ſtill the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion continued which that dream had made on his mind; and he was perſuaded that it was ſome viſion of myſterious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and not any common creation of fancy, which had thus deeply moved him.—The morning was now far advanced. Sir Albert roſe, ſeated himſelf by the window, and muſed. The words of the apparition, who had ſo ſuddenly aſſumed a form ſo ghaſtly, ſtill reſounded in his ears; and he felt a ſtrong conviction that ſome event of futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would unfold to him their oracular meaning. He was unable to gueſs who the perſon ſhould be whoſe ſpirit thus ſeemed to call for vengeance; yet he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inclined to ſuppoſe it might be the ſame whom popular report averred to have been murdered in the <hi>Cavern of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:028401_0030_0FD8F360EAB9B6B0"/>His thoughts were ſtill wholly occupied by conjectures on this ſubject, when a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was brought to him from the Baron, inviting him to breakfaſt with him in his apartment. He complied, and found the Baron alone, and was received by him with the warmeſt expreſſions which courteſy could dictate. The compliments he paid to his character, and former heroic actions, were indeed ſuch as gave pain rather than pleaſure to Sir Albert, whoſe modeſty was ſuch as rendered all praiſes of himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely irkſome to him. He therefore availed himſelf of the earlieſt opportunity to turn the diſcourſe on other ſubjects, and readily anſwered ſuch queſtions as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron put to him, relative to the countries he had viſited in his travels. He aſked him, at laſt, of what place he was a native?</p>
            <p>
               <q>I was born in the city of Prague, my Lord,</q>
returned the Knight.</p>
            <p>"Was your Father, then a Bohemian?" demanded the Baron.</p>
            <p>"It may ſeem ſtrange, my Lord," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Sir Albert,
<q>to ſay, that I know not with any certainty what was my Father's country: my Mother, Iſabella Von
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028401_0031_0FD8F36572DBE9A8"/>
Glatzdorff, was of one of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient families in Bohemia; but I loſt both my parents too early to retain any recollection of them. I am only acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their misfortunes, and my own ſhare in them, from the report of an Uncle, to whom I owed my education.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Your words excite my curioſity," ſaid the Baron:
<q>may I enquire what thoſe misfortunes were, in which you were ſo early involved?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I can relate the ſtory but imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, My Lord,</q>
returned the Knight.
<q>My Uncle, in his youth, aſſumed the croſs, and engaged in the ſervice of Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win the Second of Jeruſalem, at that time much ſtraitened by his enemies; and in the battle in which that Prince was unfortunately taken priſoner by the Turkiſh Emir Balac, he was generally reported to have been ſlain; but fate had reſerved him for ſeverer ſufferings: he alſo had fallen alive into the power of the Infidels, among whom he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a rigorous captivity during eleven years. At laſt he contrived means to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape; but on his return to Prague, when
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028401_0032_0FD8F36817CC7FB0"/>
he expected to have been received with joy by his family, he experienced the moſt cruel diſappointment. His parents, and his elder Brother, were dead: the latter, believing him no more, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed all his eſtates to a diſtant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, omitting to make any reſervation in his favour, in the event of his return. His ſiſter alone ſurvived; but it was many days before he could diſcover the miſerable place of her abode; and, when his ſearch was at laſt ſucceſsful, what were the feelings of his generous heart, when he found her bereft of reaſon, and ſupported by the charity of ſtrangers? From them he learned, that after the death of her parents, ſhe had diſobliged the Brother on whom ſhe was left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, by her marriage with Rodolph Von Fahrenbach, a young ſtranger, of whom they could give no further account than that he had diſtinguiſhed his valour in a conteſt with a Bohemian Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who alſo courted her favour; and that ſhortly after their marriage, he had quitted her, to engage in a cruſade, in compliance with a vow he had made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028401_0033_0FD8F369106D5A50"/>
to his acquaintance with her: that he had been abſent two years: at the end of which time certain intelligence of his death was brought to her, the ſhock proved greater than ſhe was able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; it threw her into a delirious fever, from which, for many days, the utmoſt danger was apprehended; her life was however preſerved, but her ſenſes never returned to her. She had been for ſome months in this deplorable ſituation, when ſhe was viſited by her brother, who immediately took her and me (who had not been born till after my Father's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture) to his own houſe, when he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed every means for her recovery which the advice of the ableſt phyſicians could ſuggeſt; but his cares were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing; the deep melancholy which continually preyed upon her mind, ſoon threw her into a decline; and within a year after his return, ſhe died, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy victim of deſpair. From that time, all the affection which my Uncle had borne her, ſeemed transferred to me. He made many inquiries after my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's family, wiſhing to obtain their
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028401_0034_0FD8F36D8A60B148"/>
protection for me; but he could not diſcover in what part of Germany they were ſettled. My mother, in a moment of phrenzy, had deſtroyed all the letters ſhe had received from my father, and indeed every memorial of him, except this ring, which you, my Lord, laſt night obſerved: it had been his firſt gift to her; and, till the lateſt moment of her life, ſhe would never ſuffer it to be taken from her finger. But, if my uncle failed in diſcovering my other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, he never permitted me to feel their loſs. His income was ſmall; but he abridged his own expences, that he might be enabled to defray thoſe of my education; and, as ſoon as I was at an age to bear arms, he led me himſelf into the paths of glory. Unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my real father, I always venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this generous kinſman as ſuch: he has now been dead ſome years; but I ſhall ever reſpect and love his memory, and the ſenſe of the gratitude I owe him will remain with me to the laſt hour of my exiſtence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:028401_0035_0FD8F370A33F77D0"/>The Baron heard this narrative with much attention; and the various changes of his countenance expreſſed how deeply he intereſted himſelf in the misfortunes of the unhappy Iſabella. Sir Albert obſerved his concern, and felt himſelf under an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to him for it. They continued in diſcourſe for ſome time longer; when the Knight, recollecting the deſire Lord Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric had expreſſed to ſee him, thought it time to go in queſt of him: he roſe, and bade the baron adieu for the preſent; and with mutual courteſy they parted.</p>
            <p>In a long gallery which he paſſed through in his way from the Baron's apartment, he found Lord Frederic, walking to and fro with haſty ſteps.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What intereſting diſcourſes can have detained you ſo long with my Father?</q>
ſaid that impetuous youth:
<q>I have been here almoſt an hour, waiting till you ſhould quit him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I ſtaid the longer with him," replied Sir Albert,
<q>becauſe I expected you would meet me in his apartment: as you came not thither, I concluded you were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe engaged. I was now about to ſeek
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028401_0036_0FD8F374C6946ED8"/>
you; but I did not imagine I ſhould find you here awaiting me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I could not juſt now appear before my Father,</q>
ſaid Lord Frederic; <q>my mind
is too much agitated to allow me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble. But this is not a place for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conference; let us go where we may diſcourſe without danger of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</q>
—And, as he ſpoke, he took the arm of Sir Albert, and led him out of the gallery.</p>
            <p>They paſſed onwards to the caſtle gate: Lord Frederic threw it open, and went forth into the Foreſt.—Sir Albert ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him; and neither broke ſilence till they reached a deep glade, entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from all view of the Caſtle. Here they ſtopped—Lord Frederic quitted Sir Albert's arm, and regarding him earneſtly, "I would know," ſaid he,
<q>whether I might indeed accoſt thee by the title of my friend?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Can you think ſo meanly of me, my Lord,</q>
returned the Knight,
<q>as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I ſhould ever afford him for whom I had profeſſed a regard, any cauſe to queſtion its ſincerity? I ſhall certainly
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028401_0037_0FD8F37686A91400"/>
never be unmindful of the many cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies I have received from you; and I truſt I may appeal to more than words, to prove the reality of the friendſhip I have borne you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"It is true, dear Albert!" cried Lord Frederic;
<q>I have not forgotten that to thy friendſhip I have owed my life, while mine towards thee has hitherto had no opportunities of ſhewing itſelf but in words and vain profeſſions: hereafter, I truſt, I may be able to give thee more ſolid proofs of gratitude. But firſt, I muſt again have recourſe to the valour to which I am already ſo much indebted, for a ſervice, which, if it refuſe to render me, it were better it had never been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted in my cauſe —Life is only a bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the happy!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And what unexpected calamity, my Lord,</q>
ſaid Sir Albert,
<q>can have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you otherwiſe? Your perturbed looks, and many expreſſion which have fallen from you, lead me to apprehend ſome dreadful evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"But for thee," ſaid Lord Frederic,
<q>and I muſt endure the greateſt; I muſt
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028401_0038_0FD8F378083DAA38"/>
behold the miſtreſs whom I love to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, in another's arms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And have you then felt the power of love, my Lord?</q>
cried the Knight;—
<q>but who is your fair Miſtreſs? and how can I preſerve her to you?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Before I diſcloſe further, Sir Albert," ſaid the youth,
<q>you muſt ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me that you will aſſiſt my views.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It were unneceſſary to bind myſelf by any promiſe,</q>
returned he,
<q>ſince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that additional tie, I ſhall undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly act on this, and on every future oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as friendſhip and the laws of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhall require of me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Lord Frederic preſſed him further; but Sir Albert liked it not. His intimacy with that young Nobleman had ariſen, not from any ſimilarity of ſentiment or of temper, but ſolely from their having been compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in war; and it had aſſumed the name of friendſhip, ſince Lord Frederic, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Sir Albert from the moſt immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, and therefore conſidering him as the braveſt of men, had eagerly courted his ſociety, and had, on every occaſion, profeſſed for him the higheſt regard. But
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028401_0039_0FD8F37E71585300"/>
though his unremitted courteſies had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a conſiderable ſhare of the affection of Sir Albert, they had not ſo far blinded his judgment, as to induce him to concur implicitly, and without further informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the projects of a youth, whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous paſſions, but for his own more prudent counſels, would, he knew on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny former occaſions, have involved him in the greateſt indiſcretions. When Lord Frederic found that he perſiſted in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to engage himſelf by the promiſes he required, he at laſt ceaſed to inſiſt on it, and, telling him that he would evince to him how great a dependence he placed on his friendſhip, he proceeded to relate the circumſtances which had induced him to demand his aid.</p>
            <p>"Thou may'ſt remember," ſaid he
<q>that I was ſent for by my Father from the Camp, in a manner which led me to conclude that he had ſome motive of importance for requiring my return.— I came hither by haſty journeys; and, on my arrival, was informed of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended marriage, which I found he was deſirous of communicating to me in
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028401_0040_0FD8F37FB96348C0"/>
perſon, left, hearing of it from others, I might be induced to ſuppoſe my own intereſts endangered, and to attempt ſome oppoſition to his deſigns. I was the leſs ſurpriſed at this intelligence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I knew, that, ſince the death of his other Sons, it had been a conſtant ſubject of uneaſineſs to him to behold in me the laſt of his race: I have heard that he ſuffered himſelf to be alarmed by ſome prophecy or dream, I know not particularly what, which had denounced ſome dreadful fate to his family, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever one male ſhould be the only ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of it. He never clearly explained himſelf to me on this point; but he had often preſſed my marriage with a degree of earneſtneſs which was very irkſome to me, and had always appeared diſpleaſed at the invincible reluctance I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. When, therefore, he acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with his wiſh to preſent me to the Lady to whom he expected me to pay the duties of a ſon, I attended him to her abode, not without ſome ſatisfaction that he had rather choſen to offer her his own hand, than to attempt to compel me
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028401_0041_0FD8F37FBB4D9848"/>
to give her mine. But how can I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to you, Sir Albert! the ſudden change which, the ſight of this peerleſs beauty effected in my heart? That heart hitherto ſo inſenſible, in a moment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the power of her irreſiſtible charms. I had been too little intereſted in her to make any previous inquiries reſpecting her; I had not been even told ſhe was fair:—judge, therefore—if ever your temper, ſofter than my own, has felt the influence of beauty—judge what were my emotions, when in her to whom I was introduced as to my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Step-mother, I beheld the moſt lovely creature that the world certainly ever ſaw! With the idea of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's wife, I had connected that of proportionable age; but her's appeared not to exceed my own. Her form— her eyes—I cannot deſcribe them, Sir Albert!—If my hopes in you deceive me not, I truſt you will ere long behold her; and believe me, I do not mean to under-rake your ſervices, when I tell you that the ſight of ſuch charms were laone a recompenſe worthy of them.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028401_0042_0FD8F37FC19DC1E0"/>
The only embelliſhment of which her beauty was capable, it received when I was preſented to her; ſhe was deſired to conſider me as the Son of him to whom her hand was deſtined; ſhe ſighed as ſhe regarded me; and her cheek, before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt colourleſs, was ſuffuſed with a bluſh, as ſhe permitted me to take her hand, which, with an eagerneſs which baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my remembrance every idea of the character in which the ſalute was permitted me; I preſſed to my enraptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red lips. She ſighed more deeply than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and drew her hand ſuddenly from me; her eyes filled with tears, and ſhe turned away.—I do not ſurely flatter myſelf, Sir Albert, when I impute theſe marks of ſorrow to the impulſe of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents with which my appearance had inſpired her: ſhe regretted that it was to my Father, and not to myſelf, that ſhe was promiſed, and it was her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion left this emotion ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by thoſe in whoſe eyes it would be deemed a crime, which made her ſo haſtily quit a ſituation in which, if I may judge from my own feelings, ſhe would have found it ſo difficult to diſſemble
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028401_0043_0FD8F3840EC109E0"/>
hers. It was probably fortunate for me that her diſcretion, or perhaps her timidity exceeded mine: I ſhould queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs have otherwiſe betrayed to her Father and my own the new-born paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which, as ſoon as I had recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that kind of trance into which the firſt view of her charms had thrown me, every motive ſo ſtrongly urged me to conceal. Yet I think ſome infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, rather than my diſſimulation, muſt have ſo far blinded their eyes as to prevent their diſcovering it—I have reaſon to be perſuaded it has entirely eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped their obſervation. The deep me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy to which I have reſigned my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, has indeed attracted my Father's notice; but he aſcribes it to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions leſt my intereſt ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by this projected alliance. Nor indeed, where my mind free from other cares, would it perhaps be eaſy on that head; for, were he to have other ſons, it were by no means improbable but that ſo young and beautiful a wife might have ſufficient influence over him, to induce him to make ſuch diſpoſitions in
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028401_0044_0FD8F38410BE54C8"/>
their favour as would materially diminiſh the inheritance I have been long taught to expect. But ſuch conſiderations are too mean to engage at preſent my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—To attain the poſſeſſion of this incomparable Fair, I would joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign any riches, any honours; but the thought of beholding her in the arms of another, of ſeeing her ſacrificed to one whoſe age and grey hairs ought to have forbidden him to aſpire to the poſſeſſion of ſo lovely a maid—Sir Albert! it drives me to diſtraction! madneſs will ſeize my brain, if thou deny me thy compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—Doſt thou heſitate? Canſt thou refuſe to ſuccour me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I moſt ſincerely compaſſionate you, my Lord!</q>
returned the Knight;
<q>and I muſt grieve that you have reſigned your ſoul to a paſſion which involves you in ſo many difficulties.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"It involves me in no difficulties," cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lord Frederic eagerly,
<q>from which thou canſt not extricate me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Is it in any plan for carrying off this Lady,</q>
ſaid Sir Albert,
<q>that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire my aſſiſtance? Let me entreat you
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028401_0045_0FD8F38921F83A60"/>
my Lord, to conſider coolly the peculiar circumſtances in which—</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I have conſidered," interrupted Lord Frederic;
<q>and I know that there is but one poſſible means by which, without ruining my fortune, I can attain the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure poſſeſſion of my Love.—It is to the Baron of Dornheim that her hand is promiſſed by her ambitious parent.— Could it be poſſible for me to elude his vigilance, and to ſteal her from his Caſtle, I might be well aſſured that the eſtates of my incenſed Father never would be mine, but were that title, were thoſe eſtates now mine—Sir Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert! canſt thou term thyſelf my friend, and not recollect that thy hand might render them ſuch?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir Albert ſtarted! he regarded Lord Frederic with a look of ſurprize and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and read on his gloomy brow the confirmation of the fears his words had ſuggeſted.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I would myſelf be Baron of Dorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim,</q>
ſaid Lord Frederic, after a pauſe: <q>Doſt thou not underſtand me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:028401_0046_0FD8F38DC87B6EB8"/>"I dare not imagine I do," replied the Knight, turning from him with horror.</p>
            <p>"Hadſt thou ever loved, Sir Albert!" reſumed Lord Frederic,
<q>thou wouldſt have felt, that to know in any man a rival, ſuffices to obliterate from the mind every former ſentiment with which he may have been regarded.—I ſee thou haſt underſtood me; that thou knoweſt I wiſh my rival removed, and that thou art ſkocked at the idea of the relation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he bears me: but he is not thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!—I mean not to lift my own arm againſt him; but thou—thou, who art my friend, and who art bound to him by no tie of kindred or of duty—when thou conſidereſt that the whole future happineſs of my life depends on this ſhort anticipation of the fate which his years announce cannot be far diſtant—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What have you ever obſerved in my character, my Lord,</q>
ſaid Sir Albert, looking ſternly round,
<q>which can autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize you to offer me this inſult? Am I an aſſaſſin?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Do not ſuppoſe me capable of inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you,</q>
my friend! returned Lord
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028401_0047_0FD8F38F4B79CE20"/>
Frederic; <q>I know your high ſenſe of honour; and truſt me, I would employ your valour in no enterprize unworthy of it. Could the Baron be ſurprized at any diſadvantage, I ſhould never have had recourſe to your arm; among my own followers, I could have found thoſe who would faithfully have executed my purpoſe. But that were impoſſible—he never, even for a moment, is alone. I know not what is his motive; I have not heard that he has any enemy of whoſe deſigns he is apprehenſive; yet his conduct is ſuch as might induce ſuch a ſuppoſition. Throughout the day, ſome of his attendants are always with him; and at night, a prieſt and two domeſtics conſtantly ſleep in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. This circumſtance, as you will perceive, muſt render vain every hope of ſurpriſing him; and, if he has leiſure to defend himſelf, your proweſs only were a match for his. In his youth, you may have heard he was a warrior of the firſt renown; nor has age yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerved his arm. I know you would ſcorn to contend with an enemy of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028401_0048_0FD8F3939A015170"/>
inferior might; but be aſſured, my friend—</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Call me no longer ſuch?" cried Sir Albert;
<q>I diſclaim the friendſhip of a parricide!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Lord Frederic was provoked at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; but, having already ſo far put himſelf in Sir Albert's power, he durſt not expreſs his indignation, but rather fought, by new entreaties, to bend him to his purpoſe.
<q>Were my love leſs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</q>
ſaid he,
<q>my ſchemes would be leſs deſperate; but who, under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſo irreſiſtible a paſſion, could forbear the only means of attaining that felicity, which otherwiſe, within three ſhort days, muſt be forever placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his reach? If I loved a meaner beauty, it might perhaps be poſſible I ſhould reſign her; but who that adored the Lady Conſtance—</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Conſtance!" exclaimed Sir Albert, ſtarting wildly: "Is it Conſtance?"</p>
            <p>
               <q>Conſtance of Hertzwald, is the Lady deſtined to my Father's arms,</q>
return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lord Frederic,
<q>if thou refuſe, in pity to her and to thy friend, to reſcue her
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028401_0049_0FD8F39487409CF8"/>
youthful charms from ſuch a ſacrifice, and to give her to a lover more worthy to enjoy them!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And does the Lady Conſtance return thy love?</q>
ſaid Sir Albert, trembling, and ſcarcely able to pronounce the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>"I cannot doubt it," replied Lord Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric:
<q>I have never indeed received from her lips the tranſporting aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſince I have never been able to obtain an interview with her but in my Father's preſence; but one of her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who is my only confident, aſſures me that ſhe is very averſe to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage propoſed, and that many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have rendered it very evident that ſhe ſecretly loves another. That I was the man ſo bleſt, I durſt not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively aſſure myſelf till the laſt time I viſited her Father's Caſtle; but then, her looks, her whole demeanour, were ſuch as it were impoſſible to miſinterpret. She ſeemed unable to avert her eyes from my perſon; yet if I, or any other, appeared to notice the earneſtneſs with which ſhe regarded me, ſhe was covered
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028401_0050_0FD8F39B0067F160"/>
with confuſion; and many times a ſigh eſcaped her, which ſtill more ſtrongly ſpoke the tender ſentiments which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied her ſoul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While Lord Frederic was thus ſpeaking, the countenance of Sir Albert was fluſhed with a thouſand conflicting paſſions. Twice he laid his hand upon his ſword; and twice, even amid the tranſports of jealous fury, he recollected that he was the gueſt of him on whom he would have drawn it; that he was himſelf armed, and that his rival was not—he recollected, and he was maſter of the emotion.</p>
            <p>"We may meet again, Lord Frederic!" cried he—
<q>if we do, remember that we meet no more as friends!</q>
And, as he ſpoke, he turned from him, and walked with haſty ſtrides towards the thickeſt ſhades of the foreſt.</p>
            <p>Lord Frederic, aſtoniſhed at his demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, for which, ignorant that he had ever ſeen the Lady Conſtance, he could aſſign no adequate cauſe, ſtood for a moment ſurprized. He would then have called him back; but Sir Albert only quickened his pace.—Fired with rage, he would then
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028401_0051_0FD8F39CCC8CB138"/>
have followed him, to demand an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his words, and ſtill more of the menacing air with which they had been uttered; but he was now loſt among the trees, and Lord Frederic ſought him in vain.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert, mean-time, careleſs whither he went, walked on. He had fancied his own paſſion hopeleſs; but, at the moment in which he had heard that Conſtance loved his rival, he became conſcious that he had hitherto flattered himſelf with the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that her heart was his own. When he had reached a part of the Foreſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably diſtant from the ſpot where he had left Lord Frederic, he threw himſelf heavily on the graſs. and abandoned his ſoul to the deſponding thoughts which the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he had heard ſuggeſted to him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Lord Frederic is then beloved by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance!</q>
ſaid he to himſelf:
<q>the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt maid, whoſe eyes were caſt down if mine too fondly gazed upon her, has looked on him with tenderneſs! Falſe changeful Conſtance! yet why do I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her? what right had I to her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? what encouragement did ſhe
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028401_0052_0FD8F3A240FCB368"/>
ever afford to my hopes? To the love which I never avowed to her, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn could I expect?—Ah! why did I quit her without declaring myſelf? What idea could ſhe form of the ſtrength of a paſſion, of which, even in her preſence, I was ſufficiently maſter to bury it in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? During the years that have elapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince I parted from her, perhaps ſhe has never heard my name pronounced; and, if ſhe has afforded it any place in her remembrance, ſhe has perhaps thought of me as of one from whoſe heart the impreſſion of her charms was already ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced; ſhe has fancied herſelf more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the affection of every caſual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer who has told her ſhe is fair, than of him to whom ſhe is dearer than his life!—Ah? why did I quit her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring myſelf?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir Albert continued to dwell on this idea with infinite anguiſh, and would gladly have given years of his future life to recall but a few of the moments which he had formerly paſſed in the preſence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when certain of her indifference to every other, his heart had ſecretly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028401_0053_0FD8F3A38F372C10"/>
him ſhe was not without ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion, in his favour, and had not his generoſity forbidden him every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to improve that prepoſſeſſion, he might poſſibly have gained the love, of which one whoſe black and murderous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns rendered him ſo unworthy of her, now boaſted that he was the object. By degrees, as Sir Albert repeated to himſelf Lord Frederic's words, a faint hope aroſe in his breaſt, that the confidence with which that fierce youth had ſpoken of the favour of Conſtance, might have little other foundation than his own vanity; but the ſatisfaction which this idea afforded him, was almoſt inſtantly loſt in the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that, whatever might be the ſtate of her affections, the Baron of Dornheim was within three days to receive her hand. He ſtarted from the ground, and ſtood for ſome moments almoſt bereft of thought and reaſon. A wiſh preſently ruſhed upon his mind, to ſee her once more ere that fatal event for ever tore her from his hopes. He had not power to deny himſelf that laſt gratification; but determined imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to ſeek admiſſion to her preſence,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028401_0054_0FD8F3A555859908"/>
to tell her that his lateſt breath ſhould wiſh her happineſs; and then, bidding an eternal adieu, to his country, to join the armies of the Cruſaders, and ſeek, amid the ſwords of the Infidels, that death which would then be the only object of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
            <p>Animated by this deſign, he walked on; but he knew not which path would lead him to the Caſtle of Hertzwald, and in that wild Foreſt he had little chance of meeting with any one from whom he could obtain directions. He was provoked, to think that he might poſſibly have taken a road which would lead him a contrary way from that which he intended; yet he ſtill walked on. At laſt he deſcried ſome turrets through the trees: but much was he diſappointed, when, on a nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, he knew them for thoſe of Dorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim. He turned away with horror from the abode of his rivals, and ſtruck into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther path; in which fortunately he had not proceeded far, when he perceived a peaſant before him. He haſtened to overtake him, and inquired the road to the Caſtle of Hertzwald. The man was himſelf going
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028401_0055_0FD8F3ABF89F48F8"/>
part of the way thither, and offered to be his guide. As they walked together, the peaſant aſked Sir Albert many queſtions; but his anſwers were ſhort, and often fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the purpoſe: yet when his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor demanded of him where he meant to lodge that night, it ſuddenly occurred to him, that in the event of his not being ſo fortunate that day as to obtain an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with the Lady Conſtance, it would be his wiſh to remain in the Foreſt till the next; and he aſked the peaſant whether he dwelt near, and would afford him a lodging in his cottage? The peaſant replied, that he dwelt not far from the ſpot where they firſt had met; and readily agreed to give him ſuch accommodation as he was able. They ſoon came within ſight of the Caſtle of Hertzwald: Sir Albert parted from his guide, and proceeded towards it.</p>
            <p>He knew but little of the Father of the Lady Conſtance, who during the time of his former acquaintance with her, had been abſent on a journey, and her Mother, with whom ſhe had then reſided at Prague, was ſince dead. He was heſitating what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive he ſhould aſſign for his viſit, when he
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028401_0056_0FD8F3AD9638E378"/>
obſerved a domeſtic at the gate: of him he aſked ſome queſtions, and learned from his anſwers, that the Baron of Dornheim was at that time at the Caſtle, and was to dine there. This intelligence was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to deter Sir Albert from ſeeking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance till after his departure; for he felt that it would be impoſſible for him to command his emotions in the preſence of his rival. He therefore quitted the gate, and determined to wait in the vicinity of the Caſtle till the evening. He began to walk to and fro, often looking wiſtfully up at the windows, wiſhing he could know which were thoſe of the apartment of Conſtance. He meant to keep at ſome diſtance from the walls; yet often ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental ſhade on one of the caſements was magnified by his imagination into an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man figure; and he haſtily approached, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt expecting he ſhould find that it was the Lady Conſtance herſelf.</p>
            <p>At laſt, the reflection that he might be obſerved by the domeſtics, and incurſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, induced him to quit the front of the Caſtle, and turn into a path which wound behind it. The Caſtle of Hertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028401_0057_0FD8F3B25F2CC620"/>
was much inferior in ſize and ſtrength to that of Dornheim: pleaſure, rather than defence appeared to have been the object of its founder. A magnificent garden lay behind it, fenced from the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt by a high wall, ſurrounded with bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements. Sir Albert walked on under this wall, with no other view than to paſs away the time till the departure of his rival, whoſe happineſs mean while, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the preſence of the Lady Conſtance, diſtracted his ſoul with jealous pangs.— At an angle, of the wall was erected a ſquare turret, of which the windows looked out upon the Foreſt. Sir Albert was paſſing by it, when a voice caught his ear. He looked up; and a window being open, he could diſtinguiſh two female figures in the chamber within; but their faces were not turned towards him. With an invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary curioſity he approached nearer; and could then hear, that ſhe who ſpoke was endeavouring to comfort the other, who was weeping violently, and with many of the arguments ſo unavailing to thoſe whoſe affliction is real, was urging her to reſtrain her tears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:028401_0058_0FD8F3B40FC78530"/>"Suffer me to weep!" returned at laſt a gentle voice—it was the voice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and the heart of Sir Albert in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly acknowledged the ſound.—
<q>It was but to weep at liberty,</q>
purſued ſhe,
<q>that I ſo earneſtly ſued for permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to retire hither.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"You have never yet, Madam," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined the other,
<q>ſo totally reſigned yourſelf to grief as you do this day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"This is perhaps the laſt time," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſtance,
<q>when I may be permitted to indulge my ſorrows. Hitherto, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they have been mitigated by a faint hope that I might be able to move my Father's heart, and to obtain at leaſt a little longer reſpite from this dreaded marriage; but now that hope is loſt!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But, if this marriage be indeed ſo hateful to you, Madam,</q>
ſaid the other, "why will you ſubmit to it?"</p>
            <p>"Alas! Elinor," cried Conſtance,
<q>how canſt thou aſk me ſuch an idle queſtion? Have I not already done all that mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den modeſty would permit me, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it? Have I left any means untried to gain my Father from his purpoſe?
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028401_0059_0FD8F3B58E110F18"/>
Have not my unwearied ſupplications repeatedly awakened his fierceſt anger, and provoked him to treat me with a harſhneſs, which, but a few months ſince, I could not have ſuppoſed I ſhould have ſurvived? Thou knoweſt how little he regards my tears; and if to-day I have obtained this ſmall indulgence to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw myſelf from the Baron's preſence, I have owed it rather to the fear leſt he ſhould too plainly perceive, by my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, my reluctance to the marriage, than to any pity for my ſufferings: but the Baron does know my reluctance to the marriage. I one day collected ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient boldneſs to avow it to him, in the hope, that, if his ſoul were capable of any generous feelings, he would of his own accord reject the hand of a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den whoſe heart was averſe to him; but I ſoon found that I have judged too highly of him; and that the only effect of my avowal was, that he preſſed the marriage with greater eagerneſs than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leſt delay ſhould afford me time to deviſe ſome means of eſcaping it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:028401_0060_0FD8F3BC2AA59A40"/>"And I ſtill think, Madam," ſaid Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
<q>that thoſe means might be found. You are not watched—why ſhould you not fly from the Caſtle?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"And whither ſhould I fly?" returned Conſtance.
<q>Were any place of refuge open to me, thou may'ſt aſſure thyſelf I ſhould he watched. What friend have I, in whoſe protection I could truſt? In what Convent ſhould I find a ſecure aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, ſhould the Baron of Dornheim re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire me to be given up?—Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt how far his power extends.—And what dangers more dreaded than death might I not apprehend, ſhould I, an helpleſs maiden, encounter ſingly the terrors of this wild foreſt?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I muſt entreat you, Madam," ſaid Elinor,
<q>to forgive me for what I am about to ſay: the intereſt I feel in your concerns could alone urge me to a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I truſt you will be too well aſſured of my attachment, to aſcribe to impertinence or curioſity. The Baron of Dornheim is not indeed a man who could ever have been very likely to gain your love; but yet, pardon me if I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028401_0061_0FD8F3BD05157F98"/>
that, ſo ſubmiſſive as you have ever hitherto been to the will of your Father, you would not in this only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, have expreſſed ſo much reluctance to obey him, had not your averſion to the alliance propoſed, originated in ſome ſtronger motive than any perſonal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to your ſuitor. Though he is older than yourſelf, his perſon is ſtill hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and his air noble; his converſation I have heard yourſelf allow to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; of his character you have had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reaſon to think unfavourably, ſince the inſtance you have mentioned of his ungenerous conduct: but you were equally anxious to avoid the marriage while he was only known to you by the report of your Father, who ſo earneſtly ſought to prepoſſeſs you in his favour.— May I then avow to you the ſuſpicion which I have long entertained, that, had your affections not been otherwiſe enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the Baron of Dornheim would more eaſily have obtained your hand? And may I preſume to ſolicit you to repoſe in me a confidence, of which you might be aſſured my fidelity were worthy,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028401_0062_0FD8F3C2B082BB50"/>
which would certainly greatly eaſe your mind, and might poſſibly enable me to render you ſome ſervice?</q>
—</p>
            <p>Elinor pauſed—and the Lady Conſtance did not immediately return an anſwer.— At laſt,
<q>If I had hitherto confined ſuch a ſecret within my breaſt,</q>
ſaid ſhe, "were this a moment to declare it?"</p>
            <p>"This were the only moment," return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Elinor; <q>another may not be allowed you!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Thou ſayeſt true!" ſaid Conſtance, burſting afreſh into tears:
<q>after to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row—Heavens! what a thought!—af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to-morrow, it will be criminal to recollect that ever I have ſeen him?</q>
—</p>
            <p>"I have then judged rightly," cried Elinor;
<q>but, Madam, ſince you have avowed thus far, may I not aſk further, to whom is it that your affections are ſo deeply engaged?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"And what would it avail to tell thee?" returned Conſtance;—
<q>I cannot! my lips dare not pronounce his name.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Will you permit me to name him, Madam!</q>
ſaid the Damſel.</p>
            <p>"Thou canſt, not" cried Conſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:028401_0063_0FD8F3C4886E4788"/>"And yet I have at times fancied I had diſcovered him," rejoined Elinor.</p>
            <p>"Heavens! exclaimed Conſtance," and
<q>how have I then betrayed myſelf? What unguarded expreſſion has ever eſcaped me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Your lips, Madam," returned the Damſel,
<q>have indeed never betrayed you; but of the language of your eyes you have been leſs conſcious—when laſt Lord Frederic was here, you looked at him with an earneſtneſs</q>
—</p>
            <p>
               <q>Is it poſſible I ſhould have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved?</q>
cried Conſtance:
<q>O! Elinor, durſt I have ſpoken to Lord Frederic! Could I but have aſked him one queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!—I had once almoſt collected ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent courage; but I met my Father's eye, and I dreaded leſt I ſhould inſpire him with any ſuſpicion. Methought, could I have ſpoken with Lord Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric apart</q>
—</p>
            <p>Sir Albert liſtened, and the paleneſs of deſpair overſpread his cheek.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It would not be difficult to find an opportunity of ſpeaking with Lord Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric,</q>
ſaid Elinor;—"many ſuch"—
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028401_0064_0FD8F3C6644AB1F8"/>
               <q>Will occur in the caſtle of Dorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim,</q>
ſaid Conſtance impatiently;
<q>but it will then be too late.—I cannot, it is true, give my heart to the Baron; but, never, when my hand ſhall be his, will I indulge it in any voluntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of another—yet, could I but know he lived!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Who lived, Madam?" cried Elinor; "of whom are you ſpeaking?</p>
            <p>
               <q>Didſt thou obſerve the caſque Lord Frederick wore that day?</q>
ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Of which the creſt was a dragon with expanded wings?</q>
demanded Elinor.</p>
            <p>"I would I could know," ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<q>how that caſque came into his poſſeſſion?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And in what manner could that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt you?</q>
rejoined the Damſel.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert liſtened more eagerly than before.</p>
            <p>"If miſtake not greatly," returned the Lady Conſtance,
<q>that caſque had once another owner.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To whom then did it belong, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?</q>
ſaid Elinor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:028401_0065_0FD8F3CAF89DC640"/>"To one whom thou haſt never ſeen," replied Conſtance;— <q>to one whom I will never ſee again!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Was he then the lover who gained your affections?" demanded the damſel.</p>
            <p>"He loved me once," ſaid Conſtance,
<q>but he knew not with what ſentiments I regarded him. I was perſuaded that my Father would never conſent to our union; and I purpoſely ſlighted him, in the hope of eradicating from his breaſt a paſſion which could only render him miſerable. It is now ſome years ſince I have ſeen him; and by this time he has queſtionleſs forgotten me. I hope he has;—for my deſtined marriage would become doubly afflicting to myſelf, if I thought that the news of it would give his heart a pang.—It is impoſſible but that he muſt have forgotten me—yet I have not forgotten him!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And how can you imagine it poſſible he can have forgotten you?</q>
replied the enraptured Albert, preſenting himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the window.—
<q>Ah! lovelieſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance! how little are you acquainted with the power of your own charms, if
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028401_0066_0FD8F3CD8B805218"/>
you ſuppoſe that the heart which once confeſſed it, could ever know a ſecond love!</q>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſound of his well-known voice, Conſtance flew to the window; but when ſhe beheld him, ſhe trembled, and had nearly fainted; and, when ſhe would have ſpoken to him, his name was all that ſhe was able to pronounce.—He gazed on her with a tranſport which left him no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of any of the difficulties which ſtill remained to encounter.</p>
            <p>"My adored Conſtance!" exclaimed he,
<q>how infinitely am I repaid at this moment for all the ſufferings of my tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous abſence!—though baniſhed from your preſence I have been inſenſible to every pleaſure; though equally uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious and undeſerving of your, love, every anxious fear, every jealous doubt has diſtracted my ſoul!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"But whence—" cried ſhe, with an haſtening and interrupted voice—
<q>how came you—? in this remote Foreſt. I had not expected—I thought you far diſtant:—what chance has brought you hither?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:028401_0067_0FD8F3D41CEFA378"/>"My impatience to review you," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he,
<q>was the ſole motive of my journey. I could no longer ſupport the anguiſh of my ſeparation from you.— And at what a moment has my happy fortune led me to this Caſtle! at the moment, lovely Conſtance! in which your lips have declared, that, unworthy as I am of any place in your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, you have not forgotten me!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Heavens! exclaimed ſhe,
<q>and have you then heard what I have careleſsly ſpoken?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Can you forgive me, deareſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?</q>
ſaid Sir Albert:
<q>I expected to have heard you avow your preference of my rival; the apprehenſion was too painful to be borne; and I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to tear myſelf from the ſpot where your voice firſt caught my car, till the dreadful certainty ſhould free me from the torture of ſuſpence:—from that I indeed am freed; and the fear leſt I ſhould have incurred your diſpleaſure by preſuming to liſten to your diſcourſe, is now the only trouble of which my ſoul
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028401_0068_0FD8F3D51BE9D7F0"/>
is inſenſible.—Can you forgive me, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If you have occaſioned me any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,</q>
returned ſhe,
<q>it has been by the ſuſpicion which impelled you to liſten. I would not, methinks, that you ſhould have heard with what ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I thought of you;—but that you ſhould ſuppoſe I harboured ſuch for any other:</q>
—</p>
            <p>Overcome with joy at this unexpected meeting, Sir Albert ſpoke freely of the love which, for ſo many years, he had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in unbroken ſilence; and the Lady Conſtance, forgetful of the reſerve which had formerly induced her to reject even his moſt diſtant courteſies, acknowledged the affection with which he had long ſince inſpired her heart. She was, however, the firſt who awoke from this dream of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; ſhe recollected her ſituation, and burſt into tears.—He eagerly demanded their cauſe.</p>
            <p>"Alas!" cried ſhe,
<q>we have only met, that may the more ſeverely feel the pain of our eternal ſeparation!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:028401_0069_0FD8F3D688941F08"/>"Never! exclaimed he;
<q>never, my Conſtance! ſhalt thou be torn from me!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"But how," ſaid ſhe
<q>can I eſcape the dreadful fate to which they deſtine me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Fly from their power!" returned Sir Albert:
<q>this arm ſhall ſhield you from purſuit!—It is not my own intereſt.</q>
purſued he,
<q>which could ever have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to urge you to ſuch a ſtep. When I formerly knew you, encircled with proſperity, I would rather have died than have propoſed to you to ſhare my poorer fortunes; and had you but now given me reaſon to ſuppoſe you could be happy with my rival, believe me, my Conſtance! no diſtraction to which ſuch an idea would have driven me, could ever have inſpired me with any wiſh to diſturb that happineſs. But, ſituated as you are, it is to reſcue you from miſery, not to enſure to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the higheſt earthly bleſſing, that I intreat you to fly with me from him who would ſo unworthily avail himſelf of your father's power to force you to the marriage which you dread. I know the

delicacy of your mind; and I know how unavailing the ſplendor of the ſituation to which the Baron of Dornheim could raiſe you, would be to conſtitute your felicity.—I can offer you no riches; nor would I, even at this moment, my adored Conſtance! aſk your hand, could I any otherwiſe than by receiving it, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the character of your protector.</q>
The Lady Conſtance liſtened, and her heart acknowledged the generoſity of thoſe ſentiments, of which the former conduct of Sir Albert had left her no room to doubt the ſincerity: yet ſhe heſitated to comply. Never had ſhe hitherto diſobeyed her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; unleſs it had been by the involuntary affection ſhe entertained for him whoſe merits deſerved her tendereſt love, but whoſe ſituation, ſhe well knew, would preclude him from any chance in his favour. And now to fly the marriage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by his commands, and to give her hand in oppoſition to his will;—ſhe was alarmed at the idea, and her ſtrict ſenſe of duty forbade her to conſent. But Elinor, who had hitherto taken no part in the diſcourſe, now interpoſed, and in the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028401_0071_0FD8F3DC880CC698"/>
ſtrongeſt terms, ſupported the propoſal of Sir Albert. She urged every excuſe which the peculiar ſituation of the Lady Conſtance offered for her compliance; reminded her in how ſhort a time her eſcape from the Baron would be impoſſible; and placed before her in the moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous colours, every circumſtance of the projected marriage, which ſhe knew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired her with the greateſt dread. She even repreſented to her the guilt ſhe would incur by falſely plighting her faith to him, while ſhe was conſcious of the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of recalling her affections from their firſt and only object. Againſt theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, againſt the perſuaſions of Sir Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, and the pleadings of her own heart in his favour, the Lady Conſtance was unable to defend herſelf; ſhe yielded to their force, and conſented to entruſt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the protection of her lover. Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at her compliance, he would have had her inſtantly throw herſelf from the window where ſhe ſtood, which was not ſo high but that ſhe might have done it without danger; for he was anxious to avail himſelf of the preſent moment, as
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028401_0072_0FD8F3DEC7FBBB50"/>
well becauſe he feared leſt ſhe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from her intentions, as becauſe many circumſtances might intervene to render her eſcape, at any future time, leſs eaſy. But Elinor earneſtly diſſuaded her from this: ſhe ſaid that many of the Baron's attendants were wandering in the Foreſt, awaiting the time of his departure; and ſhe was urging many other difficulties, when Sir Albert himſelf recollected a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which obliged him to give up the idea; he had left his horſes at the Caſtle of Dornheim; and it was impoſſible for Conſtance to proceed ſo far on foot as to the neareſt town where others might be procured. He therefore concurred in the arrangement propoſed by Elinor, who offered, when all the family ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to reſt, to admit him into the garden, towards which looked the chamber of the Lady Conſtance, who, on ſeeing him, ſhould let herſelf down from the window, and ſhould be conveyed by him to his horſe. Elinor entreated that ſhe might be the companion of her flight; to which ſhe, with much ſatisfaction, agreed. It afterwards, however, occurred to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028401_0073_0FD8F3DF456CAC00"/>
that it would be better if Sir Albert had the key of the garden, and were to admit himſelf; ſince then ſhe need not quit her miſtreſs at the moment when her preſence might be of ſo much avail to ſupport her ſpirits, and confirm her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; ſhe could not at that time go in queſt of it, becauſe it lay in the room in which the Baron of Dornheim was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; but, as ſoon as he ſhould quit the Caſtle, ſhe ſaid ſhe could eaſily poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs herſelf of it; and ſhe requeſted Sir Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert to tell her where he might be found by her, when ſhe ſhould bring it to him. He deſcribed the ſituation of the Cottage of the Peaſant who had offered him a lodging; and there ſhe promiſed he ſhould ſee her ſoon after ſun-ſet.</p>
            <p>After a little further diſcourſe between him and the Lady Conſtance, which they terminated by the interchange of the moſt ſolemn promiſes of affection and fidelity, the neceſſity of his haſtening to recover his horſes, or to procure others in their ſtead, obliged him to tear himſelf from her. Ere he departed, ſhe drew a white
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028401_0074_0FD8F3DF4C0C26F8"/>
plume from her hair, and threw it to him from the window.</p>
            <p>"Wear this in your caſque," ſaid ſhe:
<q>I ſhall diſtinguiſh it by the light of the moon: and I ſhall fly without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of miſtake, to the only protector in whom I would confide!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir Albert kiſſed the plume, and placed it in his caſque.
<q>May I ever give you cauſe to continue that confidence in me, my beloved Conſtance!</q>
cried he:—
<q>And be aſſured that I ſhall value this pledge of your affection more highly than my life. Good Angels guard you till we meet again!—till we meet!— tranſporting thought!— to part no more!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Even that idea did not enable Sir Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert to quit the window without pain; but Elinor repeatedly reminding him of the importance of the expedition, he at laſt complied with her inſtances, and bade the Lady Conſtance a final adieu.</p>
            <p>It had been his intention to repair to the Cottage of the Peaſant, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome meſſenger whom he might thence diſpatch to the caſtle of Dorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim (whether he had reſolved he never
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028401_0075_0FD8F3E3C3590E40"/>
would himſelf return) to order his Eſquire to haſten to him immediately with his horſes. He deemed it unneceſſary to make any excuſe to the Baron for his abrupt departure, ſince Lord Frederic, whoſe more immediate gueſt he had been, might well ſuppoſe that it was in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their conference in the Foreſt: and he left it to him to place it in what light he ſhould chuſe, to his Father. His purpoſe, however, was anticipated; for he was not yet out of ſight of the Caſtle of Hertzwald when Maurice met him. The Eſquire expreſſed great joy to review his maſter; and recounted to him, that on his not returning with Lord Frederic, he had been much troubled; and after waiting ſome time without being able to procure any intelligence of him, he had at laſt concluded he muſt be gone to viſit the Lady Conſtance, whom he well knew his impatience to review; and that he had therefore taken that road in queſt of him. Sir Albert commended his diligence, and imparted to him the happy reſult of the conference he had with her, and her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to fly with him that night from her
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028401_0076_0FD8F3E4D257E088"/>
Father's Caſtle: he added, that it was his intention to carry her to Vienna; and, as ſoon as the rites of the Church ſhould have rendered her indiſſolubly his, to demand the protection of the Emperor, whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer marks of favour left him no doubt of obtaining it, againſt any exertions which might be made by the Baron of Dornheim to force her from him; and he flattered himſelf that the interceſſion of ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a mediator might diſpoſe her Father to an earlier reconciliation than could otherwiſe be reaſonably expected.</p>
            <p>While he was ſpeaking he heard the trampling of horſes; and he retired behind ſome trees to avoid them. It was the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and his troop, returning to the Caſtle of Dornheim.—Sir Albert felt a degree of ſatisfaction, that he had quitted that of Hertzwald without having had time to ſee the Lady Conſtance. After they had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he walked on with Maurice; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of him for his horſes, the Eſquire replied, that he had left them at the Caſtle of Dornheim, not knowing his intention to return thither no more. Sir Albert or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to go immediately and bring
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028401_0077_0FD8F3E67637A768"/>
them to him at the peaſant's cottage; whither he haſtened himſelf, imagining that, ſince the Baron was already departed, Elinor would ſpeedily viſit him with the key which was to admit him into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Hertzwald.</p>
            <p>His generous temper never open to miſtruſt, induced him to place a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the intereſt ſhe had expreſſed in her miſtreſs's concerns. The aſſertion of Lord Frederic, that one of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Lady Conſtance was in his pay, had not, in thoſe moments of joy, recurred to his memory; nor, though it had, would Sir Albert ever have ſuſpected that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to be Elinor. Yet Elinor had for ſome time been won by the gifts of Lord Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric, to convey to him private intelligence of every confidence her miſtreſs repoſed in her. She had hitherto flattered him with the perſuaſion, that the Lady Conſtance ſlighted his Father on account of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhe felt for himſelf; and it was with a view of leading her to an avowal of this that ſhe had begun the conference, which contrary to her hopes, had drawn from her the confeſſion of her love for Sir Albert.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028401_0078_0FD8F3E81DD6A048"/>
Diſappointed by this, and ſtill more by his ſudden appearance, Elinor had only liſtened to the diſcourſe which enſued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, with a view of betraying their mutual intereſts to Lord Frederic; and, having formed a ſcheme which ſhe was perſuaded would be very acceptable to him, ſhe poſſeſſed herſelf of the key, and ſet out, not for the Cottage where Sir Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert awaited her, but for the Caſtle of Dornheim. She was cloſely veiled, left any of the domeſtics of the Baron ſhould know that ſhe belonged to the Lady Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and, as it had been her cuſtom in former viſits ſhe had made there, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for one whom ſhe knew to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly attached to Lord Frederic, by whom ſhe was immediately and privately conducted to his chamber.</p>
            <p>On his return from following Sir Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, he had found that his Father was gone to the Caſtle of Hertzwald, whither himſelf had received no invitation; and he had paſſed the day alone, freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging the wild diſtraction of his mind, and forming new ſchemes of violence.— At the entrance of Elinor, his counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028401_0079_0FD8F3EC770CE928"/>
was brightened by a gleam of hope; and he eagerly aſked her what news ſhe brought him?</p>
            <p>"Such, my Lord," returned ſhe,
<q>as I truſt when you ſhall have heard it all, you will deem deſerving of ſome thanks: but the firſt circumſtance I muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to you, will be little welcome—you have a rival, hitherto unthought of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Who?—what rival?" exclaimed he.</p>
            <p>"Let me firſt, my Lord," ſaid the damſel,
<q>requeſt you to tell me whence you obtained the caſque you wore when laſt you viſited our Caſtle?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I had it from a Knight in the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſervice,</q>
replied Lord Frederic:
<q>he lent it to me once, when I was ſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden expedition: I liked it—was lighter than my own;—and I gave him another in exchange for it.—But what of that caſque?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Was that Knight named Albert, my Lord?</q>
demanded Elinor.</p>
            <p>"He was," returned Lord Frederic.</p>
            <p>"Then know in him," ſaid ſhe,
<q>the favoured lover of the Lady Conſtance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:028401_0080_0FD8F3F246810618"/>Lord Frederic ſtarted from his ſeat in fury; he recollected the manner in which his conference with Sir Albert had termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the morning, and he wondered he had not before diſcovered what he was now ſo incenſed to learn. His rage vented itſelf in many horrid imprecations; and ſcarcely could Elinor reſtrain him from going inſtantly in queſt of the rival, on whom he thirſted to avenge himſelf.</p>
            <p>"Were you more calm, my Lord," ſaid ſhe,
<q>I could direct you to a ſurer vengeance than, your ſword could give you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"What vengeance", cried Lord Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric:
<q>tell me of vengeance, and I will liſten to thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"This night," returned Elinor,
<q>Sir Albert is to ſteal away the Lady Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. I know not whether ſhe would have conſented to this meaſure, had not I perſuaded her: but I overcame her ſcruples; and I have promiſed to admit him into the garden, where ſhe is to meet him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:028401_0081_0FD8F3F638118400"/>"Thou, Elinor!" exclaimed Lord Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric:
<q>is this the friendſhip thou didſt promiſe me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I ſhall leave that to your own deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, my Lord,</q>
replied ſhe.
<q>Here is the key of the garden-gate; and here is a white plume, which if you place in the front of your caſque, Conſtance will ſly to you as to Sir Albert, and you may bear her whither you will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"My excellent Elinor?" cried he:
<q>in this device I recognize thy genius. This will indeed avenge me on them both!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Nor is this all, my Lord," reſumed the damſel—
<q>When once before, unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of this pre-occupation of her heart, I would have counſelled you to propoſe to the Lady Conſtance a flight with you, to avoid the marriage to which I knew ſhe was averſe, you objected the detriment which might ariſe to your own fortunes, from an action which would ſo greatly irritate your Father.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"I care not for that now," exclaimed the impetuous youth:
<q>I would ſacrifice my fortunes, nay my life, rather than miſs this glorious opportunity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:028401_0082_0FD8F3F9CBAD6CF8"/>
               <q>But you need endanger neither, my Lord,</q>
returned the damſel—
<q>I have offered to attend the Lady Conſtance in her flight; let me therefore return the following morning to the Caſtle, and I will throw the imputation on Sir Albert, with ſuch circumſtances as ſhall not only prevent any ſuſpicion from faſtening on you, but ſhall determine both her Father and your own to wreak on him the rage which the wrong they will ſuppoſe him to have done them will inſpire. I am going to him now, to inform him, as from his miſtreſs, that ſhe will fly with him to-morrow night, inſtead of this: to-morrow, therefore, he will volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily throw himſelf into their hands; and judge my Lord, whether the Baron of Dornheim, believing him the rival who has robbed him of his bride, will prove a reluctant executioner of the ſevereſt vengeance your fury could dictate to your wiſhes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>However ſatisfactory Elinor had ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the plot ſhe had thus treacherouſly laid, would prove to Lord Frederic, his tranſports ſtill exceeded her expectations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:028401_0083_0FD8F3FB44E4E630"/>He promiſed her the moſt boundleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and as an earneſt of them, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with a rich jewel he wore on his finger. She received it with much ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and gave him ſuch further direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as ſhe judged neceſſary, with regard to the conduct he muſt obſerve, the more effectually to deceive the Lady Conſtance. She then quitted him, and haſtened to the Cottage, where Sir Albert had long waited in anxious expectation of her. When he ſaw her approach, he went haſtily out to meet her, and demanded whether ſhe had brought him the promiſed key?</p>
            <p>"Alas! no, Sir!" returned ſhe, with a well-diſſembled concern—
<q>the Lady Conſtance has ſent me the reluctant bearer of a meſſage, which, I fear will greatly diſappoint you: it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for her this night to leave the Caſtle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Impoſſible!" exclaimed Sir Albert:
<q>O Elinor! what cruel tidings doſt thou bring me! Will Conſtance violate her promiſe?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Not willingly, valiant Sir!" replied the damſel;
<q>nor indeed are you to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028401_0084_0FD8F401196AA338"/>
this any other than a ſhort delay of a meaſure in which her happineſs is, if poſſible, more concerned than your own. To-morrow night you may aſſure yourſelf ſhe will be yours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"But why not to-night?" cried he.</p>
            <p>"Sir," anſwered Elinor,
<q>when, after the Baron's departure, I went in queſt of the key, I found that it had been remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its cuſtomary place, and the Lady Conſtance ſoon learned, with great diſquietude, that her Father was gone from home on ſome ſudden buſineſs, and that, uncertain at what hour he might return, he had taken with him the key of the garden, meaning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit himſelf that way, without oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his family to watch for him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"But if he has taken the key," cried Sir Albert impatiently, <q>why cannot I ſcale the wall?</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Alas! Sir," replied ſhe,
<q>and do you not then conſider the danger of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning at the moment to ſurprize you? ſhould he meet you in your flight with the Lady Conſtance, what but eternal ruin to your hopes could be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028401_0085_0FD8F402CB262FE0"/>
He would certainly attempt to force her from you; and, ſhould you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her, think what would be her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ſhould her Father fall by your hand! Her mind is ſo deeply impreſſed with the idea, that I am confident, no arguments you could urge, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her this night to venture:—but to-morrow no ſuch dangers will threaten you; and to-morrow you may depend on her flying with you, to eſcape the tyranny of thoſe who would force her to eſpouſe the man whom ſhe deteſts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir Albert was by no means diſpoſed to content himſelf with this delay of his hopes, but Elinor ſaid ſo much, and with ſuch an appearance of a ſincere attachment to his intereſts, that he was at laſt obliged to ſubmit, and to conſent to wait till the following night. The damſel promiſed to re-viſit him in the morning, to bring him word whether he might ſafely attempt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other conference with the Lady Conſtance during the courſe of the day, and likewiſe to arrange with him finally the mode of her eſcape. She then quitted him, and went back to the Caſtle of Hertzwald;
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028401_0086_0FD8F40787F22A18"/>
when to her miſtreſs, who had longed for her return, ſhe accounted for the length of her abſence, by feigning that Sir Albert had detained her with innumerable queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſpecting all that had befallen the object of his love during their tedious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. The deceived Conſtance was pleaſed at every inſtance of the tender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt he took in her concerns: yet, during the abſence of Elinor, her reſolution had begun to waver, and her apprehenſions of the guilt ſhe ſhould contract, by a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age contrary to the will of her Father, had almoſt determined her to ſtay, and ſuffer him to ſacrifice her happineſs for ever. But the crafty diſcourſes of the damſel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived ſo ſtrongly in her breaſt her horror for the Baron, and her love for the valiant Albert, that ſhe was confirmed in her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intentions; and with a kind of dread leſt further reflection ſhould finally oblige her to renounce them, ſhe awaited the hour appointed for her flight.</p>
            <p>She retired earlier than uſual to her chamber; for her conſciouſneſs of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſobedience overwhelmed her in the preſence of her Father, with all the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028401_0087_0FD8F408C5AE2D88"/>
confuſion of guilt; and, unaccuſtomed to diſſemble, ſhe fancied that her every look betrayed the hidden purpoſe of her heart. Had he converſed with her with kindneſs, ſhe would have found it impoſſible to command her feelings; but, with more than uſual harſhneſs, he reproved her for the averſion ſhe expreſſed towards him, whom it was his pleaſure ſhe ſhould eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe, and exaggerated the paſſion with which her charms had inſpired the Baron, in ſuch terms as tended only to heighten the diſguſt with which ſhe thought of him. She heard in ſilence; for ſhe dared not truſt herſelf to anſwer: but, when ſhe left the room, the idea ſtruck upon her mind, that ſhe quitted it, not for a night, but perhaps for ever; and ſhe burſt into tears. In her own chamber ſhe wept for ſome time without reſtraint; while Elinor was buſied in preparing ſuch things as it was expedient ſhe ſhould be provided with on her journey.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the family retired to reſt, and the hour approached, at which Sir Albert was to arrive. The heart of Conſtance palpitated with expectation,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028401_0088_0FD8F40E224C74E0"/>
and her tears ceaſed to flow. Nor had ſhe expected long, before ſhe deſcried a figure in the garden; his arms, as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, glittered to the moon-beam; and he was ſoon ſo near, that ſhe diſtinguiſhed the white feather in his caſque. He came under her window; and Elinor, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive leſt her miſtreſs ſhould obſerve that his voice was not that of Sir Albert haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſired him in a whiſper, not to ſpeak, leſt he ſhould be heard by any one who might yet be ſtirring in the Caſtle. He comprehended her meaning, and made her a ſign of obedience. For Conſtance, it had been unneceſſary to enjoin her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;—for the firſt time in her life, ſhe was about to commit an action, of which ſhe doubted the propriety; and on that action the whole of her future fate was to depend:—her emotion was ſo ſtrong, that it hardly left her the power of ſpeech; and ſhe would even yet have receded from her purpoſe, and remained at the Caſtle, but Elinor reproached her irreſolution, and repreſented to her, that if ſhe neglected the preſent moment, eſcape at any future one would be impoſſible. She had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028401_0089_0FD8F40FCE1DB178"/>
provided a ladder of ropes, and the trembling Conſtance deſcended from the window.</p>
            <p>Ere ſhe reached the ground, her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported lover caught her to his breaſt; ſhe was offended at a boldneſs ſo new to her, and diſengaged herſelf from his arms, in a manner ſufficiently expreſſive of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Apprehenſive of too ſoon alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, he reſtrained his paſſion, and with a reſpectful air, led her towards the gate of the garden, where a confidential ſervant was waiting with two fleet horſes. He vaulted on one, taking before him in his arms his lovely and unſuſpecting prize: his ſervant, in the ſame manner, took charge of Elinor: and applying ſpurs to their horſes, they ſat out with the utmoſt ſpeed.</p>
            <p>Meantime, the real Sir Albert, little imagining for what purpoſe his name and creſt had been aſſumed, had ſat for ſome time, after the damſel had left him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging his diſappointment at the meſſage ſhe had treacherouſly brought him. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice was not yet returned with the horſes: Sir Albert wiſhed for his arrival, that he

might have with him one to whom he could ſpeak freely on the ſubject which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied him; and at laſt, impatiently riſing, he walked forth into the Foreſt, where for a while he ſtrolled, diſquieting himſelf with inventing new obſtacles which might ariſe to prevent the accompliſhment of his hopes on the morrow. The night was now ſet in, and its ſhades ſeemed to offer ſome relief to the trouble of Sir Albert; for they revived in his memory the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections which had agitated his mind, when, at a ſimilar hour, he had traverſed that part of the Foreſt the preceding night; and when he recollected how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable he ſhould then have thought the certainty which he now poſſeſſed, of the love of Conſtance, he was aſhamed of having ſo far ſuffered the delay of the promiſe, which ſhe ſtill meant to fulfil, to prey upon his peace: he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diveſt himſelf of every deſponding fear, and earneſtly recommended the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his affections to the protection of every Saint and Holy Angel.</p>
            <p>He then recollected, that, by wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſo late an hour, he was detaining
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028401_0091_0FD8F41586963FB0"/>
from reſt the peaſant to whoſe courteſy he was indebted for a lodging; but he had attended ſo little to his way, that he was at a loſs to determine which path would lead him back to his cortage. He was ſtill heſitating, when he deſcried at ſome diſtance, a light, glimmering through the trees. He haſtened towards it; but ſoon perceived that it was brighter than could proceed from a candle in a peaſant's win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Still he advanced:—it ſeemed to recede before him. Surprized and ſtruck with ſome emotion of dread, he ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it; when ſuddenly it ſunk into the earth, and Sir Albert perceived that he was at the mouth of the <hi>Cavern of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His dream, the ſtrange accounts he had received at the Caſtle of Dornheim, and the determination he had formed to explore the myſteries of that diſmal place, of which the various events of the day had ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the remembrance, now ruſhed at once upon his mind; the diſappointment which had prevented his quitting the Foreſt that night, now appeared to him the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that deſtiny which had reſerved him for the diſcovery of ſome dire ſecret;
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028401_0092_0FD8F418DE6B23D0"/>
and he reſolved immediately to attempt the adventure, to which the inward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his ſoul ſo ſtrongly impelled him.</p>
            <p>The night was not duſk; but, in that ſpot, the thick ſhadow of the trees diffuſed a gloom through which objects were ſcarce diſcernable; yet a few gleams of light were reflected by a narrow but rapid ſtream, which having its ſource in the innermoſt part of the Cavern, forced its paſſage through the rocks, a little below the only entrance it preſented to human feet. That entrance, for many years untrod, was half overgrown by briars, amid which ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the birds of night. Sir Albert at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſeparate the branches; but the want of a light embarraſſed him; and, but a few paces beyond the, mouth of the Cavern, the darkneſs was total. He judged it neceſſary to return to the peaſant's cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to procure a torch: as he now knew in what part of the Foreſt he was, he found the way thither without difficulty.</p>
            <p>At the door he was met by Maurice, who was arrived then with his horſes, and who had wondered at his abſence, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was already the hour at which
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028401_0093_0FD8F41A0B96ACC0"/>
he had appointed to repair to the Caſtle of Hertzwald. Sir Albert acquainted him with the alteration that had taken place in his ſchemes, and with his intention to enter immediately the <hi>Cavern of Death.</hi> Maurice heard him with viſible conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would have remonſtrated; but Sir Albert interrupted him—</p>
            <p>"Be ſatisfied," ſaid he,
<q>that I require not thee to follow me. Wert thou leſs ſuperſtitiouſly fearful, thy company on ſuch an adventure, would to myſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the ſenſation of awe with which my mind is even painfully impreſſed; but coward as thou art, thou couldſt afford me no aſſiſtance. Remain here with my horſes, and await my return.— If no evil befall me, thou ſhalt ſee me ere the morning dawn.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He then went into the cottage, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a torch. When the peaſant heard the purpoſe for which he required it, he expreſſed the ſame horror which was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the countenances of all in whoſe preſence the <hi>Cavern of Death</hi> was named.</p>
            <p>"Alas! valiant Sir!" cried he,
<q>what deſperate project have you formed? No
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028401_0094_0FD8F41F47A43128"/>
human being has ever entered it, and returned to the regions of the living.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir Albert continued unſhaken in his reſolution.—The peaſant reluctantly gave him a torch, and he returned alone to the mouth of the Cavern.</p>
            <p>Though his ſoul was fortified with a courage which roſe ſuperior to every dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet his imagination was affected by the various terrific circumſtances which attended the adventure he had undertaken; and if his ear caught the light flutter of the leaves, or if the ſhadow of a branch, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the wind, waved acroſs his path, he ſtarted, and for an inſtant fancied it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural.</p>
            <p>When he reached the Cavern, he again attempted to diſentangle the briars which obſtructed his entrance: but finding it difficult, he drew his ſword, and with that ſoon opened himſelf a paſſage. The birds, which had long been accuſtomed to rooſt undiſturbed among their branches, now rouſed, flew out in ſuch numbers, that Sir Albert found it neceſſary to retire a few ſteps, left, as they all made towards the light, the motion of their wings ſhould
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028401_0095_0FD8F422EA1FEB98"/>
extinguiſh his torch. When they were diſperſed, he again advanced; and finding the paſſage now clear, he commended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the protection of his Tutelary Saint, and entered the Cavern. For a few paces he proceeded with his ſword ſtill drawn; but his path ſoon became ſo difficult, by reaſon of the large fragments of the broken rocks over which he was obliged to climb, that he found it neceſſary to ſheath it, that he might be at liberty to aſſiſt himſelf with his hand; and indeed of no encounter with ſuch enemies as it might avail againſt, had he, in that place, any apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>As he advanced, the horrors of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern ſeemed to deepen. The chill damp air froze the current of his blood: the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was only broken, at diſtant intervals, by droppings from the roof, encruſted with half congealed vapours. At every ſtep he trod more lightly; and if ſometimes his foot ſlid upon a ſmooth and ſlippery ſtone, his heart, at the ſound beat with a quicker motion. By degrees, he approached the bed of the ſubterraneous ſtream which he had obſerved iſſuing near the mouth of the Cavern; and the death-like ſtillneſs of the
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028401_0096_0FD8F425468DB818"/>
place was interrupted by the noiſe of its current, firſt, murmuring at a diſtance, then, as his path wound nearer to it, roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with impetuous fury over the rough rocks which obſtructed its courſe.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert now found himſelf obliged to ſtoop, for the roof was too low to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to walk upright. He advanced, and it became ſtill lower; but, after he had proceeded a few ſteps on his hands and knees, it ſuddenly widened, and he found himſelf in a ſpacious and lofty part of the Cavern; though neither of its extent nor height could he form any accurate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for its bounds were loſt in impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable darkneſs. In that thick and obſcure air, his torch caſt no light but on the hand which bore it. Only when he climbed the ſteep banks which overhung the ſtream, the white foam of its waters enabled him to trace its courſe, where it fell from a high rock in a broken cataract.</p>
            <p>The deafning noiſe of the torrent filled the ſoul of Sir Albert with an unknown horror: he deſcended precipitately from the bank, and retreated to a rock, which ſeemed on one ſide the boundary of the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028401_0097_0FD8F429537B0F80"/>
Cavern; againſt which he leaned, while his imagination, unrelieved by any viſible object, and wholly occupied in the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of his dream, was left at liberty to repreſent him, now, the hideous phantom hovering in the duſky air, and now, the fleſhleſs warrior, ſhunning his embrace, and waving high the fatal ſword.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert did not long give way to theſe viſionary fears, but ſtrove by reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to recal the firmneſs, which, at no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of real danger, ever had forſaken him. He was aſhamed of his weakneſs; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting that no circumſtance which could authoriſe it had as yet occurred, he withdrew his arm from the rock, and would have proceeded to explore farther when he felt himſelf ſuddenly drawn back; —his heart gave a fearful beat; he turned his head with perturbation, but ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing near him; he looked eagerly on all ſides, and at laſt, concluding his own ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had deceived him, he would again have advanced from that ſpot, when again he felt himſelf drawn back; and inſtantly a Form, to which even his fancy could aſſign no certain ſhape, flitted by him
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028401_0098_0FD8F42A8F78C508"/>
through a chaſm in the rock, which the darkneſs had before prevented his obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but which, when he approached it, opened to his view a long narrow paſſage, leading downwards with a ſteep deſcent, at the further extremity of which he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried a ſmall red flame; it reſembled the dog-ſtar, when he ſets bloodily in a miſty horizon.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert now ſummoned all his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and deſcended the path.—Hitherto, the ground on which he had trodden had been hard and rocky; but now, at every ſtep his feet ſunk into a looſe dry ſand. Guided by the flame, which grew larger and brighter as he advanced, he ſoon reached a ſmall and nearly circular vault, entirely illuminated by its radiance; and beyond this no further path appeared.</p>
            <p>In this ſpot, thus ſupernaturally pointed out to him, Sir Albert was perſuaded he was to meet the concluſion of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He croſſed himſelf, and implored the protection of the holy Angels; then, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes on the flame, which hung in the air conſiderably above his head, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that it darted downwards, in a ſpiral ray, on a ſpot where the ſand roſe
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028401_0099_0FD8F44E89D019A8"/>
in a little hillock: and he heard around him a faint ſound, like the fluttering of diſtant pinions. He regarded the hillock, and obſerved ſomewhat glittering beneath the ſurface: he ſtooped, and removing a little of the ſand, diſcovered the blade of a ſword; but what were his emotions, when he perceived that the hilt was graſped by the dry cold hand of a ſkeleton!</p>
            <p>The words of the phantom who had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited him in his ſleep, were inſtantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his remembrance: and he dropped keeling on the earth.</p>
            <p>"Yes, injured Spirit?" exclaimed he;
<q>thou whom I know not by what name to addreſs, but who haſt queſtionleſs led me hither, and art now inviſibly preſent to my invocation! I receive thy gift! and I ſwear to allow myſelf no reſt, till the vengeance ſhall be completed, in which, though by what myſterious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion as yet I comprehend not, thou haſt taught me to believe my own deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny involved!</q>
            </p>
            <p>As he uttered theſe words, with an awe which half checked his voice, he extended his hand to take the ſword; and inſtantly
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028401_0100_0FD8F42C75B98658"/>
at his touch, the bony fingers which held it, uncloſed themſelves, and left it in his graſp. At the ſame moment the flame, with a vivid flaſh, diſappeared; and a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den whirlwind ariſing extinguiſhed the torch, and involved Sir Albert in an eddy of the ſand.</p>
            <p>His ſoul, already worked up to the higheſt pitch of horror, now fainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him; and he ſunk on the ground, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as lifeleſs as the ghaſtly form which lay beſide him. He continued for ſome time devoid of all ſenſation; and, when his recollection returned to him, as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed his eyes in total darkneſs, he felt that his hand was laid on that of the ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.—He drew it back with haſty ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.—He again made an effort to recover his fortitude; and, riſing, he liſtened to the ruſhing of the torrent, and hoped, by following that ſound, to find the paſſage between the rocks by which he had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that receſs. But ſuddenly it was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered viſible to him by a light which ſtreamed through it from the outer part of the Cavern. He approached, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral lights moving in different direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028401_0101_0FD8F430057942A8"/>
acroſs the further entrance; and he imagined he heard the ſteps of feet, and the claſh of arms; when, in an inſtant, a cry of horror, uttered by many united voices, aſſailed his ear; and amid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>articulate ſhrieks of ſome, he could diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that others, exclaimed,
<q>blood! a cataract of blood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Cavern now ſhook from its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and the voices were at once loſt in a craſh, which ſeemed as if the whole frame of Nature were violently rent aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The ſound was reverberated from the hollow ſides of the Cavern in repeated echos, which by degrees died away, and again no noiſe was heard, beſide the ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the torrent.</p>
            <p>The lights had diſappeared, yet ſtill a faint glimmering remained, which enabled Sir Albert to diſcern the paſſage. Still graſping the fatal ſword, he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcended his former path, and, on iſſuing out into the open part of the Cavern, he perceived that the glimmering he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved was that of a torch, which lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extinguiſhed on the ground. Rejoiced to recover a light, he took it up, and ſoon
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028401_0102_0FD8F432CB1BDF40"/>
diſcovered that the violent noiſe he had heard, had been occaſioned by the fall of a huge fragment of the rock, under which, on a further examination, he perceived the mangled bodies of two men, whom its enormous weight had cruſhed.—Struck with new horror, he was regarding theſe wretched victims, when he heard behind him a deep and agonizing groan.—He ſtarted!—and after ſome interval, it was repeated.—He turned, and looking round, he at laſt deſcried an armed figure, lying proſtrate on the earth.—As he approached him, this unknown perſon groaned again.</p>
            <p>"Who art thou?" cried Sir Albert, bending over to regard him;
<q>and what purpoſe led thee hither?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtranger, at the ſound of a human voice, half raiſed his head, and diſcovered to Sir Albert the features of the Baron of Dornheim?—Aſtoniſhed, and ſcarcely cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting his eyes, he ſtood for a moment ſilent; while the Baron, on beholding, him, ſhrunk aghaſt! and again turning his face to the earth, lifted up his arm, as if to ſhroud himſelf from the view of ſome terrific object.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="unknown:028401_0103_0FD8F4350BA7FE58"/>
               <q>Whither wouldſt thou drag me, avenging Spirit?</q>
exclaimed he, with a faint and trembling voice.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert, accoſting him by his name, demanded to whom he addreſſed himſelf, and what had thus ſtrangely agitated him; but to all his queſtions he returned ſuch diſordered anſwers, as induced the Knight to believe that diſtraction had ſeized him. At laſt the Baron, with a ſudden ſtart, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain raiſed his head, and leaning on his arm, regarded Sir Albert with a fixed horror.</p>
            <p>"Why do you thus wildly gaze one me?" cried the Knight; "do you not know me?"</p>
            <p>"Know thee!" exclaimed the Baron;
<q>Ah! too well I know thee!—And that ſword? The moment threatened by the Phantom is arrived, and already is my family extinguiſhed on the earth!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"My Lord!" ſaid Sir Albert,
<q>theſe words bear no common meaning; and circumſtanced as I am, they concern me too nearly to ſuffer me to forbear inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on an explanation of them.—Riſe! and prepare immediately to anſwer the demand which the events of this night ſufficiently authorize me to make.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="unknown:028401_0104_0FD8F43BCAD8A450"/>The Baron roſe, as if awed by ſome power he durſt not diſobey; but preſently ſtarting with new affright—
<q>Yon ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſion!</q>
exclaimed he;
<q>that crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon torrent!—Save me—hide me from the view!</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Theſe are the terrors of guilt my Lord!" cried Sir Albert;
<q>and vainly would you ſtrive to eſcape the viſions created by your own accuſing conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Vainly indeed!" replied the Baron—
<q>yet, if thou wouldſt hear the dire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure I muſt make to thee, in pity lead me from this ſcene of horror!— here I cannot!—it is impoſſible?—they haunt me—the Daemons of Vengeance haunt me, and the unappeaſed Spirit of the Dead hovers around me, and urges them to ſeize their prey!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir Albert ſaw, that in effect his mind was too much diſordered to permit him to make any connected narration in that drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, which impreſſed with diſmay the heart even of the innocent; and he led the way towards the mouth of the Cavern while the Baron followed him with unſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſteps.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:028401_0105_0FD8F43BCD0FDB58"/>They were in the narroweſt part of their paſſage, when the light of Sir Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's torch was reflected by the gleam of armour; he looked, and beheld a man half hid in a cavity of the rock. On finding himſelf diſcovered, the ſtranger came forth trembling, and falling on his knees, petitioned for his life. The Knight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded wherefore he had ſought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal himſelf? He acknowledged that he was one of the vaſſals of the Baron of Dornheim, by whom he had been brought into the Cavern to aſſaſſinate Sir Albert.</p>
            <p>"Is this true, my Lord?" ſaid the Knight, looking ſternly around.</p>
            <p>"It is moſt true," replied the Baron—
<q>ſuch was indeed my purpoſe; but the Agents of an Inviſible World have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, and I have vainly ſtriven to reſiſt the decrees of fate</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir Albert ordered the man to riſe and follow them; and ſoon emerging from the Cavern, though night ſtill reigned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found amid the Foreſt, her ſhadows, to the eyes of thoſe who had ſo long been buried in that region of ſubterranean dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appeared almoſt the refulgence of day.</p>

               <pb n="107" facs="unknown:028401_0106_0FD8F43D9E1DE278"/>At the earneſt entreaty of the Baron, Sir Albert advanced ſome paces, till they had reached a ſpot, out of hearing of the ſound of the murmuring current: there pauſing—"and now, my Lord!" ſaid he,
<q>I will proceed no further, till you ſhall have fully explained to me, as I know you are well able to do, the myſteries which the receſſes of yon Cave enfold. Why are you thus aghaſt when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this Sword? And who was the murdered Warrior in whoſe fleſhleſs hand I have found it?</q>

            <p>"That murdered Warrior," replied the Baron, "was thy Father!</p>

            <p>"And in me," continued the Baron, "thou vieweſt his murderer!"</p>
            <p>Sir Albert's hair ſtood erect with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and his eyes ſparkled with unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fury.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Suſpend thy vengeance till thou haſt heard me further,</q>

<q>I feel that the hour of retribution is arrived, and a power more than mortal compels me to unfold the tale I tremble to pronounce.</q>

               <q>Rodolph, Baron of Dornheim, was thy Father. He was my Brother—my elder Brother; and from the Holy Land was he returning, to claim the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which, at the death of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon parent, devolved of right to him, when I, covetous to poſſeſs it, met him in this Foreſt, with a band of ruffians devoted to my intereſt. He was alone; but, with his native valour, and with that Sword, which had often drank deeply of the blood of Infidels, he long defended himſelf againſt his aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins. At laſt, overpowered by numbers, he fell; and, in the convulſions of death, he ſo ſtrongly graſped the hilt, that one of my men, unable to force it from him, was about to ſtrike off the hand which held it, when I forbade him. To none of the brave Knights who had warred in Paleſtine was the Sword of Rodolph unknown; and, ſhould it be found in my poſſeſſion, or in that of any of my people, a diſcovery that he had periſhed by our hands might have enſued:—I therefore commanded them to forego the rich ſpoil, and to

conceal it, with the body, in the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt receſſes of yon gloomy Cavern. A report of his death upon the journey was then circulated; and no ſuſpicion of my concern in it ariſing in the minds of any, I ſucceeded to the vacant Barony, of which I have ever ſince, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the world, been the undiſturbed poſſeſſor. But the world has not known the ſecrets of my own guilty heart. Often, at the ſtill and ſolemn hour of midnight has the Spirit of my mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Brother viſited me; ſometimes in ſilence pointing to his wounds, and waving his bloody Sword, ſometimes threatening me with vengeance, in a voice, of which, even in the hours of apparent feſtivity, the ſound has ever continued in my ears.—Of five former Sons whom I have loſt, the untimely deaths were announced to me by this Phantom; but the great and final ſtroke which was to complete the meaſure of my puniſhment, and for ever cut off my family from the earth, he taught me to expect at the moment in which his Sword ſhould paſs into the poſſeſſion of

his own rightful heir.—With what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror I have awaited that moment, thoſe only can know, who, like me, have known the guilt of blood:—from a faint hope to avade the menace, I have made repeated efforts to regain the Sword; but the fear leſt I ſhould expoſe my crime to detection, forbade me to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy for that purpoſe any but thoſe who had been my former accomplices; they ſeverally attempted it; but their courage proved unequal to encounter the horrors of the Cavern. Meanwhile, I had recourſe to every means, to diſcover who was that heir to whom the ſword was deſtined, I could obtain no further information, than that Rodolph, ere he went to the Holy Land, had eſpouſed a Lady at <hi>Prague,</hi> under a feigned name, leſt my Father, who had deſtined him for another al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, ſhould be made acquainted with the marriage; but what afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of that Lady, or whether ſhe had borne him another Son, I could never learn, but continued in a ſtate of the moſt painful uncertainty till yeſternight, when, on your firſt entrance, I for a

moment fancied you the viſionary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my nightly terrors:—Your name was repeated by my Son, and I ſtrove to ſuppreſs my ſtrong emotions; but ſtill your reſemblance to the noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph had filled my mind with dire forebodings, and your ring too certainly confirmed them, for well did I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it in the poſſeſſion of my Brother. This morning, your own narration ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to me every circumſtance which could yet give riſe to any doubts. From that moment, your death was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and already had I concerted the plan of your aſſaſſination, when with diſmay I learned that you were gone to explore the receſſes of the <hi>Cavern of Death.</hi> The moment which was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to you the Sword of your Father, ſeemed now at hand:—by one deſperate effort could I only hope to avert the fate impending o'er my houſe;—and to that effort ſome ſupernatural impulſe ſeemed to urge me on, and to overpower the dread, with which even the diſtant view of a place which I fancied conſcious of my crime, had hitherto inſpired me.—
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028401_0111_0FD8F42C0579C778"/>
I armed as many of my vaſſals as I durſt confide in, and at their head I entered the Cavern, hoping to find you, bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in its labyrinths, ere you ſhould have ſeized the Sword on which my deſtiny depended. Animated by this idea, neither I, nor two of my accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices in the murder of your Father, the only two who ſtill ſurvived, ſeemed to remember our former guilty dread, till we reached the ſpacious vault in which you found me. There the awful ruſh of the torrent ſtruck upon our ſouls, and in a moment revived our terrors. we aſcended its bank—we beheld the foaming cataract—to our eyes it ſeemed a cataract of blood!—thoſe of my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants whoſe conſciences accuſed them of no former crimes, uttered a cry of diſmay at the dire prodigy, and fled; but we, whoſe hand had been crimſoned with the blood of Rodolph, ſtood, rivetted by horror to the ſpot— but we ſtood not long, before the fall of the impending rock overwhelmed my two companions, of whom one was Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, your Eſquire, but my ancient vaſſal.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:028401_0112_0FD8F45371F7A428"/>"Maurice!" exclaimed Sir Albert; was "he diſloyal?"</p>
            <p>
               <q>From the moment when I acquainted him with your birth,</q>
returned the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
<q>his fears concurred with his former attachment to me, and with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I offered, to induce him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray to me your every deſign. It was from him I learned your purpoſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Cavern.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baron was proceeding, when the trampling of horſes interrupted him:—he pauſed; and Sir Albert, looking round, deſcried a troop of men, who guided by the light he bore, were haſtening towards him. On their nearer approach, it was diſcernible that four among them, who were on foot, bore a corpſe, on a bier made of interwoven boughs. The Baron's mind miſgave him; he eagerly queſtioned them, and, while they heſitated to anſwer, he forced a paſſage through them, and ruſhed to meet the corpſe; he recognized the pale and blood-ſtained features of his Son.</p>
            <p>The bearers ſat down their load.—The Baron uttered not a word, but threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the bier, and in convulſive ſobs,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028401_0113_0FD8F456071D3678"/>
gave vent to the paſſions which agonized his ſoul.—Sir Albert drew near, and with ſtrong emotions beheld the face of Lord Frederic.—The Baron ſuddenly turned, and before he was aware of his purpoſe, ſnatched from his hand the Sword of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph, and plunging it in his own breaſt, ſunk expiring on the body of his Son.— The horſemen alighted, and crowded round him; but ſuccour was too late;— pointing to Sir Albert, in a faultering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent he bade them regard in him their rightful Lord; and then, drawing forth the weapon from the wound, his life iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, in a ſtream of blood.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert, falling on his knees, awfully adored the ſevere juſtice of the Almighty Avenger of the crime of mortals.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who ſurrounded the bier, all vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of the Barony of Dornheim, were ſtruck with conſternation at this fatal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe, and eagerly enquired of each other the meaning of their late maſter's dying words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir Albert, in ſuccinct terms, and without expatiating on the guilt of him who lay lifeleſs before them, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with the diſcoveries which that
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028401_0114_0FD8F45A6F3115D0"/>
night had brought forth; a narration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by him who had been found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in the Cavern, and who had been preſent at the Baron's confeſſion; and all moſt readily acknowledged the Son of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph as their Lord, and entreated him to ſuffer them immediately to conduct him to the Caſtle. He complied with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and proceeded thither with them; whilſt thoſe who had before borne the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Lord Frederic, now bore that of his Father with it on the ſame bier.</p>
            <p>On their way, Sir Albert demanded the particulars of the death of the former.— They confeſſed, that the Baron had ſent them with orders to lye in wait for Sir Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert himſelf; but that the ſimilarity of the arms and veſtments of Lord Frederic had deceived them, and aſſaulting him, they had not diſcovered their miſtake till he had fallen beneath their ſwords.</p>
            <p>When they reached the Caſtle, where the chief officers and moſt of the domeſtics were in waiting to re-admit their Lord, the tidings they brought of his death at firſt diffuſed a general diſmay; but Sir Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert convened the vaſſals in the great hall,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028401_0115_0FD8F45CC8AA0868"/>
and in a modeſt, but forcible addreſs, ſtated to them his claim to the ſucceſſion, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſuch proofs as left them no room to queſtion his right to the domains of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. Many of the older men who were preſent, remembered Lord Rodolph, and loved his memory; and they, with accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of joy, retraced his features in thoſe of his Son; and, as the character of the late Baron had not been ſuch as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the affections of any of his people, there were none who did not receive their new Lord with demonſtrations of unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gladneſs.</p>
            <p>Sir Albert now wiſhed to be alone, that he might reflect at leiſure on the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary events of the night, and compoſe the agitation of ſpirits into which ſo many unexpected diſcoveries had thrown him. But, as he was proceeding along a paſſage, in his way to a private apartment, the Seneſchal followed him, and demanded what he would have done with regard to two Ladies who had been brought that night to the Caſtle, by the order of the late Baron. Sir Albert, demanded who they were: the Seneſchal unlocked the
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028401_0116_0FD8F4616FA87850"/>
door of an apartment on one ſide of the paſſage, and Sir Albert beheld the Lady Conſtance! Surprized and delighted, he flew towards her; but her aſtoniſhment and joy ſeemed even to exceed his own.</p>
            <p>"By what miracle art thou preſerved?" cried ſhe:
<q>What Guardian Power has delivered thee from the foes by whom, when they tore me from thee, I left thee encircled?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Her words ſeemed at firſt myſterious to Sir Albert; but Elinor, finding it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to avoid the diſcovery of her treaſon, threw herſelf at their feet, and voluntarily confeſſed it; and then it appeared, that after the Lady Conſtance, deceived by her arts, had betrayed herſelf into the power of Lord Frederic, ſhe was ſtill uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of her miſtake, when they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by the troop which the Baron, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the ſimilar treachery of Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of her intended flight with Sir Albert, had ſent out to intercept them: that Lord Frederic had been obliged to ſet her down in order to defend himſelf; and that two of the troop, in compliance with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they had received, had immediately
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028401_0117_0FD8F464448034D8"/>
ſeized herſelf and Elinor, and had borne them to the Caſtle, which they had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about an hour before; during which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval ſhe had abandoned herſelf to the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt grief, and had inceſſantly wept the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable death of the imaginary Sir Albert.</p>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances afforded the pious Knight new cauſe to admire the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence, which had thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the meditated crimes of the victims of its juſtice the means of bringing down its judgments on their heads; and he could not but feel ſome ſatisfaction, that his enemies had thus been the inſtruments of their own deſtruction; ſince he was now ſpared the taſk of avenging his murdered Father on one ſo nearly allied to him as the Baron, and of diſputing his claim to the ſucceſſion, with one with whom he had lived on ſuch habits of intimacy as with Lord Frederic, till the impious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal he had made him in the Foreſt had diſcovered to him the blackneſs of his ſoul. The Lady Conſtance heard with tranſport, of the change which that night had effected in the fortunes of her Lover.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="unknown:028401_0118_0FD8F468DBDC4F18"/>The morning now began to dawn; and Sir Albert immediately diſpatched a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to her Father, to inform him of the death of the late Baron, and his own ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, in right of his Father, Lord Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph—to acquaint him that his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was at the Caſtle; and to invite him thither, to learn ſuch further particulars as it was expedient he ſhould know.</p>
            <p>The invitation was immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with; nor was Sir Albert deceived in his hope, that he who had been about, from motives of intereſt, to ſacrifice his only child to a man ſo unworthy to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs her, would, with equal readineſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to beſtow her on himſelf, who now enjoyed the power and dignities of his late rival. His propoſals were received with manifeſt joy; and, till the marriage could be celebrated with proper magnificence, the Lady Conſtance returned with her Father to the Caſtle of Hertzwald, where during that interval, Sir Albert, now uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally acknowledged Baron of Dorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim, daily viſited her.</p>
            <p>He cauſed the bodies of the late uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and his Son to be privately interred:
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028401_0119_0FD8F46BC67B83F0"/>
but the remains of his unhappy father, himſelf, at the head of a large body of his vaſſals, re-entered the <hi>Cavern of Death</hi> to bring forth; and mourning his untimely fate with the deepeſt expreſſions of filial ſorrow, he cauſed them to be depoſited, with the moſt ſolemn rites of the Church, and every funeral honour, in the Chapel of the Caſtle: erecting over them a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent tomb, above which was ſuſpended the fatal Sword.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, he eſpouſed the Lady Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and in the hand of her who had been the object of his earlieſt affections, he received the completion of that felicity to which his virtues entitled him.</p>
