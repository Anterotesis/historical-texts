            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE favourable reception given to the firſt attempt at ſomething like a REGISTER for the Year 1800, has induced the Editor to lay before the Public a volume more enlarged, and rather more methodical in its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement—but he does not expect that to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſatisfaction to others, when he himſelf is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of its defects. Amongſt many inconveniences with which he has had to contend, was much ill health, both in his own perſon, and in thoſe of his workmen—This, with his diſtance from any ready help, and the difficulty he found in obtaining the neceſſary intelligence, have prevented its appearance in the month of January, as he wiſhed and expected.</p>
            <p>But as every misfortune is ſaid to bring along with it ſome alleviating circumſtances, the book, in fact, has gained by the accidental delay. The Editor has had an opportunity of inſerting ſeveral important articles relative to the late Election of a Preſident, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would have been defered till next volume—indeed he could not with any propriety paſs over a tranſaction which ſo highly intereſted the feelings of the new, and attracted the ſerious attention of the old world—

                  <l>"When the ſword hung ſuſpended by a hair."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If ſmall matters may be compared to great, in order to ſhew our Readers the nature of the work, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Annual Regiſter for the year 1799 was not publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in September laſt—As a Record of <hi>what is paſt,</hi> it is not neceſſary it ſhould appear exactly on the firſt day of the new year like an Almanack—And it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be imagined, that it takes ſome time and trouble to arrange and prepare materials even for ſo ſmall a work as the preſent.</p>
            <p>In the arrangement of the materials which compoſe this little volume, it was the Editor's object to combine hiſtorical inſtruction, with a collection of the local events and occurrences of the year. His hiſtorical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:035113_0004_1000BE1F6C630980"/>
are taken from the beſt authorities, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted with a view, that the people of this country might thereby form a judgement of the nature of the corrupt-and-tottering Governments of Europe, and learn from them, to appreciate the advantages which they enjoy; and taking example from the awful ſcenes now acting in that part of the world, to cheriſh and ſupport a form of Government founded on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of juſtice and natural right.</p>
            <p>On a review of the materials which he had collected, he perceived that he had as many as would make a very thick Octavo volume, all of them, in his opinion, worthy of preſervation, either for uſe or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—His chief labour, therefore, has been, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a great many of theſe articles, and ſo to contract and compreſs others, as to bring them into ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs as he thought would fit the ſize of his book, and enable him to ſell it at a moderate price.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to ſee, that the Editor had in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a publication ſimilar to the Engliſh Annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, in which ſhould be recorded the principal Acts of both the General and State Governments, the Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Accounts, &amp;c.—to inſert every article tending to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Agriculture, Commerce, and Manufactures, all uſeful inventions and, diſcoveries, the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occurrences of the year, &amp;c. theſe to be enlivened with choice Poetry, remarks on new Publications, and hiſtorical extracts and details.</p>
            <p>Such a work, if executed with calmneſs and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, it is evident, would be both a uſeful and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining publication—Several Gentlemen, who are of this opinion, and who wiſh ſuch a ſcheme carried into execution, have ſuggeſted to the Editor, either to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a large volume annually, or a ſmaller one half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yearly—Either way, for ſuch a work, there would be an abundance of materials, in an age when every week, almoſt every day, produces ſomething new and wonderful.</p>
            <p>Whether this idea will be carried into execution, will depend on certain concurring circumſtances, and upon the reception which the preſent volume ſhall receive. Late as it is in its appearance, and imperfect as it may

ſeem to thoſe who are accuſtomed to conſult that juſtly admired work publiſhed in London,<note n="*" place="bottom">Altho' the Annual Regiſter, by the reſtrictions laid upon the Preſs in England, has lately been obliged to omit, or very ſlightly notice, certain political ſubjects and events, and altho' it contains many articles that are unintereſting to an American reader, yet, the importance of its hiſtorical chapters, and the number of curious and literary articles which it annually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to view, renders it a work highly uſeful in a Gentleman's library.</note> the Editor hopes that the unavoidable cauſes of its delay will plead his excuſe; and that the local uſefulneſs of the articles which it contains, will recommend it to the notice of a diſcerning public.</p>
            <p>In the following pages, two leading principles are meant to be openly and decidedly inculcated—namely, the importance of a religious and moral conduct; and, the ſuperior excellence of a Republican form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>The Editor thinks it right at once to diſplay his colours, and avowedly to declare his ſentiments—in order, that thoſe who expect to find other principles in this book, by reading theſe few lines, may ſave both their time and their money.</p>
            <p>In what is now called "the Age of Reaſon," a <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Morum</hi> is but an unthankful office. The man who only talks of Religion, ſubjects himſelf to the charge of hypocriſy; and if he attempts to inculcate it, he is accuſed of preſumption—On this ſubject, therefore, the Editor will be very conciſe—In a few words, he would humbly plead the cauſe of that belief in, and reliance on, the goodneſs and providence of an all-ſeeing, all-directing Deity, which gives dignity to the individual, and ſafety to the community;<note n="†" place="bottom">The following anecdote is related of Dr. Franklin, whoſe buſt, long ago, ſhould have filled one of the vacant niches in the Capitol at Richmond:—A young man, one of the <hi>new</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, after pouring out a number of flippant remarks deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of all religion, turned to the Dr. with a look of ſelf-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and aſk'd his opinion?—<hi>It is beſt to believe,</hi> ſaid the Philoſopher—The opinion of this truly great man, after the experience of 80 years, ſhould outweigh the haſty, ill-judg'd aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions of a million of pretenders to philoſophy.</note> which is a balm of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the poor, and is a check and controul on the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:035113_0006_1000BE21D9D25A00"/>
rich—If the word of one who has ſeen and felt much of the world could obtain any credit, he would aſſure his readers, that the man, the family, the community, or the nation, who obſerves a religious and moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, will, eventually, be found not only the moſt happy, but alſo the moſt proſperous.</p>
            <p>But he does not plead for <hi>political</hi> Religion—<hi>that</hi> kind of religion which has exalted Kings, and Popes, and Cardinals, and Dignitaries to high places, to riot on the hard earnings of a deluded people, and which, more than all the writings of Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſts and Infidels, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and almoſt annihilated, <hi>true</hi> religion—<hi>that</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which the Kings and Deſpots of Europe, at the expence of ſo much blood and treaſure, are ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſupport—<hi>that</hi> religion, called the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, which the Engliſh, in the war of 1756, ſpent ſo many millions to protect—nor <hi>that</hi> religion, the Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, which the ſame nation, in the war of 1793, has expended ſo many more millions to reſtore!<note n="*" place="bottom">"Neither Proteſtant nor Papiſt!—Of what religion are you then?"—Look, my friend, into the 5th and 6th chapters of Mathew, and behold the ſimple, unadulterated tenets of the <hi>true</hi> Religion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In this country, and in theſe teeming times, it is impoſſible for any Writer, or Editor, to avoid Politics,—Indeed, that man muſt have a cold heart, or an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty head, who can look on unmoved by what is now paſſing in the world. Every man has his bias; and every man who beholds the wonderful changes tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place in opinions, in ſyſtems, and in empires, muſt be affected. Whether the Editor has ſubjected <hi>his</hi> bias to the dictates of candour and impartiality, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſt, to the rules of decency and good manners, the Public—the diſpaſſionate Public—will pronounce.<note n="†" place="bottom">With every good American, it muſt be cauſe of vexation, to obſerve the unbounded abuſe and illiberality which daily pour from many of the preſſes on both ſides of the queſtion—One would think, that Peter Porcupine had ſpread his poiſonous mantle over the whole continent, and infected the general maſs!—ſuch extravagant licentiouſneſs, if it does not tend finally to annihilate the Liberty of the Preſs, as it has done in Europe, muſt at leaſt greatly imbitter its ſweets.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Religion and Politics are the two great engines by which mankind have been agitated, and deceived, and
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:035113_0007_1000BE2365F4C818"/>
enſlaved, from the earlieſt times.—It is not ſurpriſing, that a diverſity of opinion ſhould ariſe on metaphyſical ſubjects—The being and attributes of the Deity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination or free will, philoſophical neceſſity or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man volition, the beginning of eternity, &amp;c. cannot be brought to mathematical demonſtration by all the ſkill of human learning—But, one ſhould think, that the ſcience of Government, after the experience of five or ſix thouſand years, could not be ſo very abſtruſe and myſterious a ſubject—nor would it, but for the folly and knavery of men. To a plain, unprejudiced, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophiſticated underſtanding, can there be a doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one man ſhould rule a million by his mere will and pleaſure, or, that the million ſhould govern themſelves upon the principles of equity and juſtice?—There would not, but for ignorance on one ſide, and cunning on the other.<note n="*" place="bottom">What a degrading picture does the hiſtory of the world preſent to our aſtoniſhed view—a very ſmall proportion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who were knaves, deceiving and domineering over all the reſt, who were fools!—The <hi>new</hi> Philoſophers ſay they will mend this matter—Yes, that they will—when Godwin eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhes the <hi>perfectability of human nature!</hi>
               </note> In a word, whether a Kingly or a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican form of Government is the moſt eligible, the moſt rational, and the moſt conducive to the happineſs of the people?</p>
            <p>If the queſtion was to come fairly before the bar of Reaſon, it would not admit of a moment's heſitation—but, unfortunately, pride, ambition, ancient partialities and modern antipathies, and <hi>Emolument,</hi> often more powerful than all thoſe together, come in "to puzzle the will, and perplex the underſtanding."—When one man gets a million a year for being a King, another ten thouſand a year for being a Biſhop, and others thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands a year for being a Lord of the Bed-chamber, a Groom of the Stole, a Maſter of the Hounds, a Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Scullery, &amp;c. &amp;c.<note n="†" place="bottom">Whoever looks at the <hi>Engliſh Red-Book,</hi> if he can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the gravity of his muſcles, will not be ſurprized that there are ſo many ſtrenuous advocates for Monarchy with all its trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings—indeed, without its trappings, there would be very little contention about it.</note> no wonder ſo many men are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But all cannot be of one opinion; diverſity is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature. It is to be acknowledged, that there are good men who adopt the monarchical ſyſtem mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon principle; and ſuch men are entitled to our reſpect, however they may differ from us in ſentiment—But the greateſt misfortune to the cauſe of Liberty is, that many men, particularly thoſe of property, take refuge under the wings of Kingly power, diſguſted with the tumults and diſorders of Democracy. This is a rock which the Americans, in the navigating of their political bark, would do well to avoid—it is the more dangerous, becauſe it is a popular one. <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> or the Will of the People, is unqueſtionably the firſt principle and ground-work of the American Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; but, as ſoon as the people have fulfilled their grand, ineſtimable privilege of chuſing their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, then it becomes <hi>Republicaniſm,</hi> or a ſyſtem marked and bounded by certain known and definite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations. The Democracy here deprecated, conſiſts in a confuſion of ſyſtem, of ill-timed interferences of one body with another, and of violent and unneceſſary exertions of the people, &amp;c.—It is <hi>this</hi> Democracy, that is kindled and enflamed by cunning and ambitious men, who firſt raiſe themſelves on the ſhoulders of the mob, and then trample on their rights, under the pretext of reſtoring order and good government—It is <hi>this</hi> Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, that, ſooner than any other, will become a prime engine in the hands of <hi>foreign</hi> emiſſaries, firſt to divide the people, and then reduce them to <hi>foreign</hi> obedience.</p>
            <p>One would think that the geographical ſituation of the American States would keep them clear of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and all-devouring vortex, European politics, and that an ocean 3000 miles broad, would protect them from inſult and danger.

            <head>AN EXPLANATORY AND APOLOGETICAL PREFACE TO THE ALMANACK.</head>
            <p>PRINTERS and PRINCES have long been in the habit of ſpeaking and writing in the imperative ſtyle plural, as, WE <hi>do this,</hi> WE <hi>order that,</hi> and ſo forth. If any of our Federal read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be offended at the <hi>Printer</hi> preceding the <hi>Prince,</hi> let them recollect, that this is, <hi>as yet,</hi> a Republican country, and that both of them are often, very often, miſchievous characters. It is true, they don't much like fighting in their own proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but often, too often, they are the cauſe of much blood being ſhed by others.</p>
            <p>Be it known then to all the good people of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that the Printer hereof will deſcend from his impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive chair, and, for a little while, condeſcend to talk like a common Citizen, in the firſt perſon ſingular.</p>
            <p>When URBAN'S Almanack made its firſt appearance, it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally attracted the attention of all the Critics in <hi>that</hi> line of literature, and two grand faults were found with it; namely, that it had too much religion, and too little weather.—To do the Sovereign People<note n="*" place="bottom">"Sovereign People"—I believe this very emphatical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion was firſt made uſe of by that ſuperior genius Mirabeau, at the beginning of the French Revolution—Edmund Burke, when he ſaw things thro' another medium, and got a penſion of 3 or 4000l. a year, called the people "the ſwiniſh multitude"—and Fenno, the compeer and ſucceſſor of Porcupine, whilſt he was Printer to the Senate, and publiſhed his libels within a few doors of their chamber, had the boldneſs to liken the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Government and the different States, to "a ſow with her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>reed, the 39 Articles, &amp;c. at one gulp, or woe be to both his temporal and ſpiritual concerns.<note n="*" place="bottom">Take a peep into the Engliſh ſtatute book (it only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about 100 folio volumes) and ſee how the rod of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Power is held over the People in that country, and yet it is perfect freedom when compared with the Popiſh countries—It would appear, that the old nations had too much religion, and that ſome of the new ones have too little.—Is there no medium?</note>
            </p>
            <p>To remedy the firſt complaint, there was no great difficulty—with one daſh of my pen, I ſwept the whole pack of Saints, Martyrs, and Virgins out of the Calendar!—"Ladies and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſaid I to them very civilly—putting the Virgins fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt) you ſee there is no buſineſs for you here; here there are neither images, nor ſhrines, nor cathedrals, nor votaries—Heaven knows it was not worth your whiles to leave your ſnug births at home, to croſs the Atlantic ocean for all the profit, or honour either, you have got in this country.—God help you, poor emigrants, I don't know where you can now ſojourn, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be among the Chickiſaws and Catabaws, who live, or rather wander, ſome hundreds of miles beyond the Ohio.—Now, as I gave you a decent welcome to my table—and would have kept you there, if my maſters had been ſo pleaſed—the only requeſt I have to make of you is, that you will be ſo kind as take this vile Ague and Fever along with you, and drop it in one of the lakes on to'ther ſide of the mountains—If you do, I ſhall pray for you, and to you, all the days of my life."—</p>
            <p>On the ſubject of Religion, I have only to add, that I have retained a few of the capital Saints, juſt to ſhew that there were ſuch a people once upon a time, and to put <hi>ſome</hi> folks in mind when they may expect a merry day—By the bye, I never could learn the reaſon, why theſe holy men are placed, as one may ſay, at the very head of our drinking parties.—It is ſaid, indeed (but I don't pretend to vouch for the truth of the report, as it has too much the appearance of <hi>ſcandal</hi>) that both <hi>St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> and <hi>St. Patrick</hi> were fond of a little whiſkey in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and Mr. Gibbon has given us to underſtand, that <hi>St. George</hi> was not ſo holy a man as John Bull imagined him to be.—Be this as it may, I can't conceive how the two <hi>Johns,</hi> who were ſaid to have been remarkably ſober Saints, happened to be of the Fraternity.—The only way I can account for ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a connection is, that with all their outward ſanctity, like ſome of our modern Parſons—in the old country—they liked, "under the roſe", good eating and drinking as well as their neighbours.</p>
            <p>To remove the ſecond complaint, I ſoon found a much more ſerious undertaking—it was the more difficult, becauſe unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:035113_0013_1000BE2E978F7A98"/>
It never entered into my head, that "the moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened nation in the world" would have aſk'd ME to foretell all the guſts and ſtorms of the enſuing year!—I could not help thinking the requeſt, or rather command, a little unreaſonable—but there is no accounting for the whims of your very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible people; and ſo, right or wrong, I muſt obey; I muſt be a Conjuror, nolens volens, as the ſaying is.—Well, what was to be done?—Iſaac briggs, a plain honeſt Quaker, declared he never made a guſt or a ſtorm in all his life; and the other Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazers ſaid, that as I was no cuſtomer of theirs, they would have nothing to do with it—I ran from one end of the town to the other, in a hot day, popping my head into every open door, and begging of every one I ſaw, to foretell me next year's weather—Nobody knew any thing of the matter—Even the Mayor, who, by virtue of his office, is by much the wiſeſt man in the community, could tell nothing about it—In ſhort, I was completely pos'd—as the man in the play ſays, "I faith it was a puzzler."</p>
            <p>In this dilemma, I luckily caſt my thoughts on the capital, the city on the hill—Surely, ſaid I, ſtriking the palm of my right hand on my forehead, if there are any weather-wiſe men in the nation, there they muſt be, and thither wilt I go—No ſooner ſaid than done—I ſtuff'd myſelf into the ſtage-waggon for Richmond, and, in little more than 48 hours, was furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with "as pretty an aſſortment of weather," as any Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack-maker in the 16 United States of America, with the weſtern Territory into the bargain—Not ſatisfied with this expedition, I ſent off a ſpecial meſſenger (as I could not go myſelf) to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh, the capital city of North Carolina, and got from thence another parcel; by which means I have become poſſeſſed of a "well aſſorted ſtock" both from the North and from the South.—And having now got into the right track, next year, I am determined, for the ſatisfaction of my cuſtomers, to have wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Eaſt and from the weſt, and every point of the compaſs.—</p>
            <p>It is not very decent for a man to blow his own trumpet—yet, methinks, I do deſerve well of the Country.</p>
            <p>Now, other Printers would have done all this in ſilence, ſlily pretending it be their own cleverneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">A Printer in a neighbouring town has very induſtriouſly borrowed almoſt the whole of our this year's Calendar, without ſaving, by your leave ISAAC BRIGGS, or with your permiſſion Miſter URBAN; even <hi>Neighbour Spriggans</hi> is thruſt in to fill up a barren title-page!—There is ſomething in an old book about modeſty, decency, &amp;c.</note>—whereas I freely own my obligations to other heads—I let every man have his due—I would "give the Devil his due"—Beſides, it anſwers two good purpoſes—In the firſt place, it ſhews the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>But, notwithſtanding the putting out of the Saints, and the putting in of the weather, I am not vain enough to ſuppoſe, particularly in theſe combuſtuous times, that all the world will be pleaſed with my work—A French writer has ſomewhere ſaid,

                  <l>Qui pretend contenter tout le monde eſt ſon pere.</l>
               </q>
Which, in plain Engliſh, is as much as to ſay, "he's a great fool who thinks he can pleaſe every body"—And a celebrated Poet, who well knew the imperfections of human nature, has ſaid,

               <p>It was by ſuch means that he acquired 120 milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of crowns (15 millions ſterling) all caſked up in barrels, hoop'd with iron, end depoſited in double vaulted cellars.</p>
               <p>This Monarch uſed to walk from his palace cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an old blue coat, with large copper buttons half way down his thighs, and when he bought a new one, which was but ſeldom, theſe buttons were made to ſerve again. It was in this dreſs, with a large ruſty hat and patch'd boots, and armed with a huge cane, that his Majeſty ſallied forth every day to review his regiment of giants. Theſe giants were his greateſt delight, and for whom he went to the heavieſt expence. The men who ſtood in the front rank were none of them leſs than 7 feet high, and he ſent to purchaſe them from every part of Europe. They were after wards made Heiduques by the new King to attend the Queen's coach. As they walked on each ſide of an old ill ſhapen coach, in order to keep it from falling, theſe Heiduques could ſhake hands with each other over the roof.</p>

After his Majeſty had been graciouſly pleaſed to review his giants, he uſed to walk thro' the town, when every body fled from before him.

               <p>In ſhort, Turkey is a Republic when compared to the deſpotiſm exerciſed by Frederick William of Pruſſia!</p>
               <p>We may eaſily imagine, what would be the wrath of a Vandal like this, to find he had a ſon endowed with wit, ſenſe, and good breeding; who was eager in the acquiſition of knowledge, who made verſes, and afterwards ſet them to muſic. If his Majeſty caught his ſon with a book in his hand, he rudely took it from him, and threw it into the fire; or playing on the flute, he broke it into pieces; and he often treated the Prince as he did the unfortunate women and preachers when he caught them near to his parade.</p>
               <p>The Prince, at length weary of the attentions of ſo <hi>kind</hi> a father, determined to elope, without well knowing whether to fly, to France or to England—His father's economy deprived him of the power of travelling even in the ſtile of an Engliſh tradeſman, and he was obliged to borrow a ſmall ſum of money.—Two young gentlemen, both very amiable, were to accompany him. One named Kat, the only ſon of a brave Officer; the other Keit, who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the daughter of the Baroneſs Kniphauſen, who had to pay 30,000 livres for making a child without his Majeſty's permiſſion, as before mentioned.

               <p>At firſt, the King believed that the Princeſs Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helmina, his daughter, was concerned in the plot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The Queen Mother, who happened to be preſent at this kingly exploit, with great difficulty ſaved her daughter, by catching hold of her petticoats at the moment ſhe was going out of the window. The Princeſs received a violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion on her breaſt, the mark of which remained with her during life, and which ſhe did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Prince had a ſort of miſtreſs, the daughter of a ſchool-maſter. This girl played tolerably well on the harpſichord, and the Prince accompanied her with his flute; he thought he he was in love, but he was miſtaken—However, the King extended his Royal authority over this miſguided girl, by cauſing her to be paraded by the public hangman, and afterwards whip'd in the Prince's preſence!—His Majeſty then ſent his ſon to the citadel of Cuſtrin, ſituated in the midſt of an unwholeſome marſh; here he was cloſely confined for ſix months, in a ſort of dungeon; at the end of which time, his Royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was graciouſly pleaſed to allow him a ſoldier as an attendant.</p>
               <p>This ſoldier, who was young, handſome, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the flute, had more ways than one of arouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prince—So many fine qualities made his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and I ſince knew him, at once Valet de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre and Prime Miniſter, with all the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

doubt he was going to be made a head ſhorter—the Officer, ſtill in tears, ordered the grenadiers to take the Prince to the widow, and hold his head out of it by force, that he might behold the execution of his friend Kat upon a ſcaffold built for the purpoſe.—The tender-hearted Monarch ſtood preſent at this exhibition, as he had been at the poor girl's whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping bout!</p>
               <p>Keit, the other confidant, had fled into Holland, whether the King diſpatched his military meſſengers to ſeize him. Luckily he eſcaped by a minute, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for Portugal, and there remained till the death of the moſt tender-hearted Frederick William, King of Pruſſia.</p>
               <p>But it was not his Majeſty's intention to have ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped here; it was his deſign to have beheaded the Prince alſo. He conſidered, that he had three other ſons, not one of whom wrote verſes, or played on the flute, and that they were ſufficient to maintain the grandeur of the Pruſſian throne.

               <p>After 18 months cloſe impriſonment, the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Emperor, and the tears of the Queen, obtained the Prince his liberty.—As the King did not ſuffer him to have any connection with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of government (the affairs of which only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in reviewing troops, and oppreſſing the people for money) the Prince employed his time in writing to men of letters in France—He flattered me as ſomething divine, and I him as a perfect Solomon!—Epithets coſt us nothing—I took the liberty to ſend him a beautiful ink-ſtand, and he had the goodneſs to ſend me a few gew-gaws in amber—but they came from a Prince, and all France envied my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune!—Certainly, if I had been inclined<note n="*" place="bottom">Voltaire did indulge perſonal hopes, and ſacrificed his ſame to his vanity, by ſtrutting about in the Court of Potſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam with a gold key dangling at his button-hole!—Even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the groſs treatment which he received from the King's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

his wiſh to ſee me at Bruſſels—Apartments were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him in Chateau de Meuſe, where I went to wait upon his Majeſty. One ſoldier was the only guard I found—the Miniſter of State, Rambonet, was walking in the court-yard, blowing his fingers; he had on a dirty ſhirt with long dirty ruffles, an old hat all in holes, and an old judge's wig, one wing of which hung into his pocket, whilſt the other ſcarcely touched his ſhoulder.</p>
               <p>I was conducted into his Majeſty's apartment, in which I ſaw nothing but four bare walls. By the light of a bougie, I perceived a ſmall truckle-bed, in a ſort of cloſet, upon which lay a little thin man wrapped in a morning gown of blue cloth—It was his Pruſſian Majeſty, who lay ſhaking with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I made my bow, and began my acquaintance by feeling his pulſe as if I had been his firſt phyſician.—The ague left him, he aroſe, dreſſed himſelf, and ſat down to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with Algarotti, Maupertius, the Ambaſſador, and myſelf, where, at ſupper, we treated moſt profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the immortality of the ſoul, of natural liberty, and the Androgynes of Plato.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we were thus philoſophizing upon liberty, the Miniſter Rambonet, mounted upon a poſt-horſe, in his judge's wig, was riding all night towards Liege, at the gates of which, next day, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, with ſound of trumpet, the name of the King his maſter, whilſt 2000 ſoldiers laid the city under contribution!—The pretext for this fine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit was, certain rights which his Majeſty pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have over a part of the ſuburbs. The drawing up of the manifeſto was committed to me, which I performed as well as the nature of the caſe would let me—not ſuſpecting that a King, with whom I had the honour of ſupping, who called me his dear friend, and who talked ſo beautifully of natural juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and the immortality of the ſoul, could poſſibly be in the wrong. The affair was ſoon brought to a concluſion; the innocent people of Liege were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay a million of livres in hard caſh, which more

than defrayed his Majeſty's expences cauſed by his journey to ſee Straſburgh, &amp;c</p>
               <p>I ſoon felt an attachment for him, as he had wit and an agreeable manner, and, moreover, he was a King, which is a ſeduction ſeldom vanquiſhed by human weakneſs. Generally, authors flatter Kings; but, in this inſtance, I was praiſed by a King from the crown of my head to the ſole of my foot.</p>
               <p>Some time before the death of his father, the Prince had written againſt the deteſtable principles of Machiavel—but this was before he became a King, and whilſt his father gave him no great reaſon to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire deſpotic power. This manuſcript he had ſent to me at Bruſſels, to have it corrected and printed. With all my admiration for my kingly friend, I could not help feeling ſome remorſe at being concerned in printing this Anti-machiavelian book, at the very moment the Royal author, who had a hundred mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in his cellars, was robbing the poor inhabitants of Liege of a million of livres!</p>
               <p>I began to perceive, that my kingly friend would not ſtop here. His father had left him 70,000 well-diſciplined troops; he was buſily augmenting them, and appeared to have a vaſt inclination to give them employment the very firſt opportunity.</p>
               <p>In the month of October 1740, the Emperor Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les VI. died of an indigeſtion cauſed by eating cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignons, which brought on an apoplexy—and this plate of champignons occaſioned the death of many thouſands of brave men, and changed the order of things in Europe. It was ſoon very evident, that the King of Pruſſia was not ſo great an enemy to Machiaveliſm as the Prince Royal!</p>
               <p>He had already aſſembled his troops, yet none of his Miniſters or Generals knew his deſigns. I had ſome reaſon to ſuppoſe, that he meant to quarrel with France; as, three months before, he had ſent to me a political diſſertation, written in his manner, wherein he conſidered France as the natural enemy of Germany—But it was conſtitutional in Frederick to do the very reverſe of what he ſaid or wrote.</p>

He departed, on the 15th of December, for the conqueſt of Sileſia, at the head of 50,000 well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined combatants. As the Queen of Bohemia was illy prepared to repel him, he ſoon effected his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He wrote a hiſtory of that conqueſt, which he ſhewed to me—Here follows one of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, which I carefully tranſcribed, as a thing worthy of recording:—</p>
               <p>"Ambition, intereſt, and a deſire to make the world ſpeak of me, determined me to go to war!—Add to theſe conſiderations, I had a fine army and a full treaſury; theſe, with the vivacity of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, urged me to make war on Maria Thereſa, the Queen of Bohemia and Hungary!"</p>
               <p>It is much to be regretted, that I prevailed upon him to omit theſe paſſages, when I afterwards cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his works. A confeſſion ſo uncommon ſhould have paſſed to poſterity, in order to ſhew upon what principles Kings make war, and ſhed the blood of their deluded ſubjects.</p>
               <p>I now returned to Cirey, and afterwards paſſed the winter in Paris, where I had a multitude of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for, having written the Hiſtory of Charles XII. preſented ſeveral ſucceſsful pieces to the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and compoſed an epic poem, I had, of courſe, all thoſe who write either in bad verſe or proſe as my enemies—and, as I wrote likewiſe on philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic ſubjects, of neceſſity, according to ancient cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, I was treated as an Athieſt by all Church bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots and devotees.</p>
               <p>I was the firſt who dared to develope to the people of France, in an intelligible ſtyle, the diſcoveries of the great Newton. I was likewiſe an admirer of Locke; I conſidered him as the only reaſonable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſician. I praiſed that moderation ſo new, ſo prudent, where he ſays, we have not ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to determine, by the light of reaſon, that God could not grant the gifts of thought and ſenſation to a being which we call material.—The poor creatures who were the moſt forward and the hotteſt in this diſpute, knew very little of either matter or ſpirit.</p>

The fact is, that none of us know what or how we are, except that we are convinced we have life, motion, and thought, but without the leaſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of how we came by them. The very elements of matter are as much hidden from us as the reſt—We are blind creatures, groping in the dark—and Locke was right when he aſſerted, that it was not for us to determine what the Almighty could or could not do.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the literary grubs of Paris were making war upon me, the King of France began to make war upon the Queen of Hungary upon principles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually iniquitous as thoſe of the King of Pruſſia.—After having ſolemnly guaranteed and ſworn to the Pragmatic Sanction, and the ſucceſſion of Maria Thereſa to the inheritance of her father, and after having received Lorraine as the purchaſe of theſe promiſes, it does not appear to be conſiſtent with the rights of nations, or the ideas of common juſtice, to break ſuch ſacred engagements.</p>

It not only developes much of the ſecret hiſtory of that extraordinary woman, in her private life and amours, but alſo diſcovers a great deal of the political manoeuvres both of the Ruſſian and other European Courts.—The importance of this publication may be judged of, by the uncommon demand for it in every country in Europe, and the extreme ſolicitude which the Emperor Paul ſhews to have it ſuppreſſed wherever his power, or influence, or authority, can reach. Beſides the general hiſtory of the times, which were ſufficiently eventful and intereſting, the book contains many curious anecdotes, not only of the Empreſs herſelf, but of many public characters which the ignorant and uniformed world were wont to reverence or eſteem—It exhibits, in bold and legible characters, the deep deſigns of Courts, and the treacherous venality of Courtiers—from a view of which, every honeſt American will be thankful to Providence for placing his country at ſo great a diſtance from that buſy, perturbed ſcene, where a combination of Kings, and Politicians, and Generals, by their intrigues and their ambition, are daily miſleading and oppreſſing mankind.—In ſhort, after a careful peruſal of theſe entertaining and inſtructive volumes, we are at a loſs which moſt to abhor the artful and cruel means by which Catherine aſcended and then kept poſſeſſion of the Imperial throne, or to wonder at the ſurpriſing addreſs with which ſhe ruled her vaſt Empire, whilſt ſhe guided, or agitated, or convulſed, the politics of almoſt all Europe.</p>

THE book opens with a ſuccinct account of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences in the Court of Peterſburgh previous to the Revolution of 1762, when the unfortunate Peter III. (huſband of Catherine II.) was dethroned and put to death—As this part of the hiſtory is too lengthy for our preſent purpoſe, we ſelect for the attention of our Readers, the melancholy ſtory of the Princeſs Tarrakanoff, daughter of the Empreſs Elizabeth, who became a victim, by the baſeſt means, to the jealous and unrelenting policy of Catherine—Let it be remembered, that the treacherous agent in this inſiduous buſineſs, Alexius Orloff, was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal murderer of the Emperor Peter—But we muſt firſt give ſome account of the Empreſs Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth—</p>

               <p>To Anne, in 1740, ſucceeded her nephew Ivan the Third, yet in his cradle, and who, by a conſpiracy headed by a German ſurgeon named Leſtock, was dethroned, 13 months afterwards, in order to raiſe Elizabeth to the throne.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth, it is ſaid, had a reſemblance to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the handſome Catherine. But, if ſhe equalled her in thoſe advantages which render the ſociety of women ſo agreeable, ſhe ſurpaſſed her in the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate love of vicious pleaſure. Inſtead of having the art of commanding, like her mother, Elizabeth ſubmitted herſelf to the guidance of others; and this weakneſs was the primary cauſe of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of Peter III.</p>
               <p>That ſhe might maintain her independence, Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth refuſed to take a huſband, with whom ſhe muſt have ſhared the empire; but ſhe did not the more

abſtain from voluptuous gratifications; and as, with her other infirmities, ſhe had that of being a bigot, the Field Marſhal Razumouſky, her Grand Veneur, had the art to perſuade her to give him her hand in a private manner. The two Counts Tarrakanoff and their ſiſter, were the fruit of this clandeſtine union. Elizabeth, however, did not content herſelf with one lover; ſhe had frequent changes; but Razumouſky permitted none to approach her, except ſuch as he thought to have too little underſtanding, or ambition, to attempt a competition with him.</p>
               <p>To her violent propenſity to voluptuouſneſs, Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abeth added firſt the love of good eating, and then the pleaſures of wine. Banquets, feaſts, balls, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querades, and the moſt frivolous amuſements, were preferred to buſineſs—By degrees, ſhe proceeded from moderate enjoyments to the extravagance of ſenſuality; and her taſte for devotion augmented her voluptuouſneſs, and added to the abſurdity of her character. She continued whole hours on her knees before the picture of her favourite Saint<note n="*" place="bottom">The Ruſſians are of what is called the Greek Church and differ in certain particulars from the Church of Rome—for inſtance, they will not worſhip any <hi>graven</hi> image, but they kneel before and pray to <hi>painted</hi> ones!—This is only one of the many groſs abſurdities which mankind have fallen into and practiſed theſe 15 or 1600 years. Whenever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the original purity of the Goſpel, their errors became innumerable, and the Prieſthood artfully encouraged them.—The Romiſh ſuperſtitions are nearly come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion—thoſe of the Greek Church are ſtill in full operation; the Sun of Knowledge has not yet beamed upon the frozen regions of Ruſſia.</note>, to which ſhe ſpoke, and which ſhe even conſulted—She paſſed alternately from acts of bigotry to the intemperance of juſt, and from ſcenes of extreme laſciviouſneſs to the quieting opiates of prayer—To deſcribe her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bluſhing exceſſes, would ſtain the page of Hiſtory, and ſhock the ear of Modeſty.</p>
               <p>Such was the woman deſtined to rule a mighty Empire, and who had it in her power, at any time, to inflame all Europe, and ſacrifice the lives of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of men!</p>

At the commencement of her reign, ſhe made a vow, never to puniſh a malefactor with death; the Judges, therefore, who could not decapitate cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, deprived them of life by the barbarous pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of the knout; and never were more tongues cut out, or miſerable wretches ſent to Siberia, than under the <hi>clement</hi> reign of the Empreſs Elizabeth!—In dungeons not far from her own palace, were lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing in miſery, a dethroned Emperor, ſeveral Princes and Dukes, beſides many Courtiers, States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Generals, Officers, and even women!</p>

It has already been mentioned, that the Empreſs Elizabeth had three children by her clandeſtine mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Grand Veneur, Alexey Gregorievitch Razumoffſky. The youngeſt of theſe children was a girl, brought up under the name of Princeſs Tarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kanoff.

He thought that it would not be in vain if he oppoſed to the Sovereign, whoſe armies were ſpreading deſolation over his unhappy country, a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val whoſe mother's name ſhould render dear to the Ruſſians. Perhaps his ambition might ſuggeſt to him yet more lofty hopes—Perhaps he might flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf with being one day enabled to mount the throne on which he intended to place the young Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rakanoff. However this be, he gained over the perſons to whom the education of this Princeſs was committed, carried her off, and conveyed her to Rome.</p>
               <p>Catherine, having intelligence of this tranſaction, took immediate ſteps to fruſtrate the deſigns of Prince Radzivil. Taking advantage of the circumſtance of his being the chief of the confederacy of the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, ſhe cauſed all his eſtates to be ſeized, and reduced him to the neceſſity of living on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the diamonds and other valuable effects he had carried with him to Italy. Theſe ſupplies were ſoon exhauſted. Radzivil ſet out in order to pick up what intelligence he could concerning affairs in Poland, leaving the young Tarrakanoff at Rome,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035113_0031_1000BE551C2BF5B8"/>
under the care of a ſingle Gouvernante, and in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances extremely confined. Scarcely had he reached his own country, when an offer was made to reſtore him his poſſeſſions, on condition that he would take his young ward to Ruſſia. He refuſed to ſubmit to ſo diſgraceful a propoſal; but he had the weakneſs to promiſe that he would give himſelf no farther concern about the daughter of Elizabeth.—This was the price of his pardon!</p>
               <p>Alexey Orloff, charged with the execution of the will of the Empreſs, ſiezed the firſt moment on his arrival at Leghorn, of laying a ſnare for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Tarrakanoff. One of thoſe intriguers who are ſo common in Italy, repaired immediately to Rome; and, after having diſcovered the lodgings of the young Ruſſian, he introduced himſelf to her in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary dreſs, and under the name of an officer. He told her that he had been brought thither by the ſole deſire of paying homage to a Princeſs whoſe fate and fortunes were highly intereſting to all her country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. He <hi>ſeemed</hi> very much affected at the ſtate of deſtitution in which he found her; he offered her ſome aſſiſtance, which neceſſity forced her to accept; and the traitor appeared to this unfortunate lady, as well as to the woman that waited on her, in the light of a ſaviour, whom Heaven had ſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When this treacherous emiſſary thought he had ſufficiently gained their confidence, he declared that he was commiſſioned by Count Alexius Orloff to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the daughter of Elizabeth the throne that had been filled by her mother. He ſaid, that the Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were diſcontented with Catherine; that Orloff eſpecially could never forgive her for her ingratitude and her tyranny; and that, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

her the treachery of him that made them. But her inexperience and her candour permitted her not to ſuſpect any guilt. Beſides, the language of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſary of Alexius Orloff ſeemed analogous with the notions ſhe had imbibed from Prince Radzivil. She imagined herſelf deſtined to the throne; and all the airy dreams that any way related to that opinion could not but encourage the deceit. She according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave herſelf up to theſe flattering hopes, and with a grateful heart, concurred in the deſigns of her treacherous adviſer, who "flatter'd but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy."</p>
               <p>Some time after Alexius Orloff came to Rome. His emiſſary had already announced him.—He was received as a benefactor.—However, ſome perſons to whom the Princeſs and her gouvernante commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the good fortune that was promiſed them, adviſed them to be on their guard againſt the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of a man whoſe character for wickedneſs had been long eſtabliſhed, and who doubtleſs had too much reaſon to remain faithful to the Empreſs to think of conſpiring againſt her. Far from profiting by this good council, the Princeſs was ſo imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frank as to ſpeak of it to Alexius Orloff, who with great eaſe delivered his juſtification, and thenceforth threw a deeper ſhade of diſſimulation and addreſs into his ſpeeches and behaviour. Not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with fanning the ambition of the young Ruſſian, he put on the ſemblance of a paſſion for her, and ſucceeded ſo far as to inſpire her with a true one. So ſoon as he was aſſured of it, he conjured her to enter into a union with him by the moſt ſacred ties. She unhappily conſented; and it was even with joy that the poor unfortunate Lady promiſed to ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize a marriage which muſt conſummate her ruin. She thought that the title of ſpouſe of Count Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius Orloff would ſhelter her invincibly from thoſe treacheries which ſhe was taught to apprehend. She entertained not the leaſt ſuſpicion that a man could make religion and the moſt ſacred titles ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the deſtruction of an innocent victim. But,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035113_0033_1000BE5A83417348"/>
alas! was any religion, was any title ſacred to the barbarian into whoſe ſnares ſhe had fallen?—He who could ſtrangle the unfortunate Peter III. could he dread to diſhonour the daughter of Elizabeth?</p>
               <p>Feigning a deſire that the marriage ceremony ſhould be performed according to the ritual of the Greek Church, he ſuborned ſubaltern villains to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe themſelves as prieſts and lawyers. Thus profanation was combined with impoſture againſt the innocent and unprotected Tarrakanoff!</p>
               <p>When Alexius Orloff was become the huſband, or rather the raviſher of this unhappy Princeſs, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to her, that their ſtay at Rome expoſed her to too cloſe obſervation, and that it would be adviſeable for her to go to ſome other city of Italy, to wait for the breaking out of the conſpiracy that was to call her to the throne. Believing this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to be dictated by love and prudence, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that ſhe would follow him wherever he choſe to conduct her. He brought her immediately to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, where he had previouſly hired a magnificent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. There he continued to treat her with marks of tenderneſs and reſpect; but he permitted none to come near her, except perſons who were entirely at his devotion; and when ſhe went to the play or to the public promenade, he accompanied her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways himſelf.</p>
               <p>The diviſion of the Ruſſian ſquadron under the command of Admiral Greig, had juſt entered the port of Leghorn. On relating this news to the Princeſs, Orloff told her, that his preſence was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary at Leghorn for the purpoſe of giving ſome orders, and offered to take her with him. To this ſhe readily conſented, as ſhe had heard much talk of the beauty of the port of Leghorn and the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Ruſſian ſhips.—Imprudent Lady! the nearer ſhe approached the cataſtrophe of the plot, the more ſhe truſted to the tenderneſs and the ſincer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of her faithleſs betrayer!</p>
               <p>She departed from Piſa with her cuſtomay attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. On arriving at Leghorn, ſhe landed at the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035113_0034_1000BE5CB875C028"/>
houſe of the Engliſh Conſul, who had prepared for her a ſuitable apartment, and who received her with marks of the profoundeſt reſpect. Several la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were early in making their viſits, and ſedulouſly attended her on all occaſions. She ſaw herſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſurrounded by a numerous court, eager to be beforehand with all her deſires, and ſeeming to make it their only ſtudy inceſſantly to procure her ſome new entertainment. Whenever ſhe went out, the people ran in her way. At the theatre all eyes were directed to her box. All circumſtances conſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lull her into a fatal ſecurity. All tended to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the idea of any danger at hand.</p>
               <p>It is doubtleſs impoſſible to believe that an Engliſh Conſul<note n="*" place="bottom">The Engliſh Editor, anxious, no doubt, for the honour of his country, denies that the Engliſh Conſul had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this infamous tranſaction—we hope and believe that he had not—but we know, that Admiral Greig was a Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that he had many Engliſh and Scotch Officers on board of his fleet.</note>, an Engliſh Admiral, and ladies of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or acquaintance, could be ſo baſe, ſo inhuman, as to draw into the ſnare, by deceitful reſpect and careſſes, a victim, whoſe youth, whoſe beauty, whoſe innocence, was capable of affecting the moſt inſenſible heart.

               <p>The young Tarrakanoff was ſo far from ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her dangerous ſituation, that, after having paſſed ſeveral days in a round of amuſements and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation, ſhe aſked of herſelf to be ſhewn the Ruſſian fleet.—The idea was applauded.—The neceſſary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were immediately given; and the next day, on riſing from table, every thing was ready at the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſide for receiving the Princeſs. On her coming down, ſhe was handed into a boat with magnificent awnings. The Conſul, and ſeveral ladies, ſeated themſelves with her—A ſecond boat conveyed Vice-Admiral Greig and Count Alexius Orloff; and a third, filled with Ruſſian and Engliſh officers, cloſed

the proceſſion. The boats put off from ſhore in ſight of an immenſe multitude of people, and were received by the fleet with a band of muſic, ſalutes of artillery and repeated huzzas!—As the Princeſs came alongſide the ſhip of which ſhe was to go on board, a ſplendid chair was let down from the yard, in which being ſeated, ſhe was hoiſted upon deck; and it was obſerved to her, that theſe were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar honours paid to her rank.</p>

               <p>The poſt of <hi>Favourite</hi> being peculiar to Ruſſia, it will naturally be expected that it ſhould here be treated of ſomewhat more at large.—Ever ſince the year 1730, this Empire has been governed by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the reign of Peter III. having been too ſhort to form any ſtriking exception, or for giving the Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans a notion of any other government. It is a trite remark, that when Kings reign Women rule, and when Women reign Men govern; but there ſeems nothing more in this pretended axiom than an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis conſecrated by cuſtom, and repeated from one to the other, like many more, without reflection or foundation. Henry IV. Guſtavus III. Catherine II. are invincible proofs that both men and women are capable of grand undertakings, without the aid of the other ſex, not to mention more examples in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the fact. For a ſeries of ſeventy years the Monarchs of Ruſſia have always had Favourites offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially: it is no wonder then that the cuſtom, thus ſanctioned for ſo long a period, and ſcrupulouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by four Empreſſes, ſhould be almoſt deemed a fundamental law of the Empire, and an appendage to imperial grandeur!—As the reign of Catharine was of a longer duration than any of the Empreſſes her predeceſſors, it is highly natural that the number of her Favourites ſhould be more conſiderable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:035113_0037_1000BE6389714068"/>
It is neceſſary then to ſhew what were the duties and diſtinctions of the <hi>Favourites</hi> of Catherine.—When her Majeſty had fixed her choice on a new Favourite, ſhe created him her General Aid-de-camp, in order that he might accompany her every where without attracting reproach or inviting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Thenceforward the Favourite occupied in the palace an apartment beneath that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, to which it communicated by a private ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe. The firſt day of his inſtallment he received a preſent of 100,000 rubles, and every month he found 12,000 on his dreſſing-table. The Marſhal of the Court was commiſſioned to provide him a table of 24 covers, and to defray all the expences of his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. The Favourite attended the Empreſs on all parties of amuſement, at the opera, at balls, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menades, excurſions of pleaſure, and the like, and was not allowed to leave the palace without expreſs permiſſion. He was given to underſtand, that it would not be taken well if he converſed familiarly with other women; and if he went to dine with any of his friends, the miſtreſs of the houſe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abſent!</p>
               <p>Whenever the Empreſs caſt her eyes on one of her ſubjects, in the deſign of raiſing him to the poſt of Favourite, ſhe cauſed him to be invited to dinner by ſome lady in her confidence, on whom ſhe dropped in as if by chance—There ſhe would enter into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the new comer, with a view to diſcover whether or not he was worthy of the honour ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to vouchſafe him.

He was many years a Member of Parliament, latterly he aſcended to the Peerage, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the firſt wits of the age, was diſencumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of either wife or children, and was poſſeſſed of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent fortune—in ſhort, he had every opportunity that a man could have, to improve his mind and increaſe his knowledge.

Stock.—He bequeathed 10,000l. to the Ducheſs of Glouceſter, 5000l. to Lady Waldegrave, 5000l. to each of the Miſs Berrys, and 500l. to each of his nephews.—When he was above 70 years of age, he offer'd to marry either of the Miſs Berrys, but, ſtrange to tell, both of them had the courage to refuſe a Lord and 95,000l. yet he generouſly remembered them in his will.—To Mrs. Damer (celebrated for her uncommon taſte as a ſtatuary) he left 2000l. and the beautiful ſeat of Strawberry Hill, ſituated on the bank of the Thames, near to London.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Walpole had retired from Parliament, he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated himſelf entirely to the fine arts and literary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits. He publiſhed a Catalogue of Royal and Noble Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, which diſplays much induſtry and judicious criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. His hiſtoric doubts reſpecting the life and true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Richard III. are replete with great ingenuity and ſound argument. The only dramatic work he ever produced was, The Myſterious Mother, a tragedy, printed at his own preſs (for he was both a Poet and a Printer, kindred Arts) at Strawberry Hill; the ſtory is worthy of peruſal in the cloſet, but too horrid, perhaps too indelicate, for public repreſentation.

He was uncommonly agreeable in his manners, ſhone greatly in company, and was thought to poſſeſs a greater ſtock of literary and political anecdotes, than any gentleman in England; indeed it may be ſaid, that, with his genius, no man had ever better opportunities of acquiring knowledge, having it in his power, for 60 years, to aſſociate with every man in Great Britain and France, from the Prince to the loweſt grade in ſociety.</p>
               <p>MR. Walpole's works are handſomely printed in 5 volumes 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mr. W. aware of this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, "that his books are only calculated for the idle and the curious"—but the curious reader will find many articles worthy of his attention, as Mr. W. had a very general connection with both the faſhionable and political world, and an intimate knowledge of all the leading men, and women too, of the times in which he lived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walpole was a ſtaunch Whig, and, in ſome inſtances, borders even on Republicaniſm. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineates characters with much wit and ridicule, and withdraws the veil which had hidden ſeveral <hi>great</hi>

               <p>George I. while Electoral Prince, had married his couſin the Princeſs Dorothea, only child of the Duke of Zell; a match of convenience to reuntie the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the family. Though ſhe was very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, the Prince, was extremely amorous, and had ſeveral <hi>Miſtreſſes;</hi> which provocation, and his abſence in the army of the Confederates, probably diſpoſed the Princeſs to indulge ſome degree of coquetry. At that moment arrived at Hanover the famous and beautiful Count Koniſmark<note n="†" place="bottom">Brother of the beautiful Counteſs Koniſmark, <hi>mistress</hi> of Auguſtus II of Poland.—The Count had the honour of being wounded at a bull feaſt in Spain, where he behaved wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The old Elector flamed at the inſolence of ſo ſtigmatized a pretender, and ordered him to quit his dominions the next day. The Princeſs, ſurrounded by women cloſely connected with her huſband, and conſequently enemies of the lady they injured, was perſuaded by them to ſuffer the Count to kiſs her hand before his abrupt departure; and he was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035113_0041_1000BE6B58267AD8"/>
introduced by them into her bed-chamber the next morning before ſhe roſe. From that moment he diſappeared; nor was it known what became of him, till on the death of George I. on his ſon the new King's firſt journey to Hanover, ſome alterations in the palace being ordered by him, the body of Koniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark was diſcovered under the floor of the electoral Princeſs's dreſſing room, the Count having probably been ſtrangled there the inſtant he left her, and his body ſecreted.—The diſappearance of the Count made his murder ſuſpected, and various reports of the diſcovery of his body have of late years been ſpread, but not with the authentic circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Of the circumſtances that enſued on Koniſmark's diſappearance I am ignorant; nor am I acquainted with the laws of Germany relative to divorce or ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aration: nor do I know or ſuppoſe that Deſpotiſm and Pride allow the law to inſiſt on much formality when a Sovereign has reaſon or a mind to get rid of his wife. Perhaps too much difficulty of untying the Gordian knot of Matrimony thrown in the way of an abſolute Prince would be no kindneſs to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but might prompt him to uſe a ſharper wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, like that butchering huſband our Henry VIII. Sovereigns, who narrow or let out the law of God according to their prejudices and paſſions, mould their own laws no doubt to the ſtandard of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. Genealogic purity of blood is the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant folly of Germany: and the code of Malta ſeems to have more force in the empire than the ten Commandments. Thence was introduced that moſt abſurd evaſion of the indiſſolubility of marriage, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſals with the <hi>left hand;</hi> as if the Almighty had reſtrained his ordinance to one half of a man's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and allowed a greater latitude to his left ſide than to his right, or pronounced the former more ignoble than the latter!—The conſciences both of princely and noble perſons in Germany are quieted, if the more plebeian ſide is married to one who would degrade the more illuſtrious moiety—but, as if the laws of Matrimony had no reference to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035113_0042_1000BE6D404949B8"/>
to be thence propagated, the children of a <hi>left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed</hi> alliance are not entitled to inherit.—Shock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſequence of a ſenſeleſs equivocation, that only ſatisfies Pride, not Juſtice; and calculated for an acquital at the Herald's Office, not at the laſt Tribunal.</p>
               <p>The Ducheſs of Kendal, of whom I have ſaid ſo much, was when Mademoiſelle Schulemberg, maid of honour to the Electreſs Sophia, mother of King George I. and deſtined by King William and the act of ſettlement to ſucceed Queen Anne. George fell in love with Mademoiſelle Schulemberg, though by no means an inviting object—ſo little, that one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening when ſhe was in waiting behind the Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs's chair at a ball, the Princeſs Sophia, who had made herſelf miſtreſs of the language of her future ſubjects, ſaid in Engliſh to Mrs. Howard (afterwards Counteſs of Suffolk), then at her court, "Look at that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and think of her being my ſon's paſſion!"</p>
               <p>The Ducheſs, under whatever denomination, had attained and preſerved to the laſt her aſcendant over the King: but notwithſtanding that influence he was not more conſtant to her than he had been to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed wife: for another acknowledged miſtreſs, whom he alſo brought over, was Madame Kilman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſegge, Counteſs of Platen, who was created Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of Darlington, and by whom he was indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly father of Charlotte married to Lord Viſcount Howe, and mother of the preſent Earl. Lady Howe was never publicly acknowledged as the King's daughter; but Princeſs Amelia treated her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mrs. Howe, upon that foot; and one evening, when I was preſent, gave her a ring with a ſmall portrait of George I. with a crown of diamonds.</p>
               <p>Lady Darlington, whom I ſaw at my mother's in my infancy, and whom I remember being terrified at her enormous figure, was as corpulent and ample, as the Ducheſs was long and emaciated.

diſtinguiſhed from the lower part of her body, and no part reſtrained by ſtays—no wonder that a child dreaded ſuch an Ogreſs, and that the mob of London were highly diverted at the importation of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common a Seraglio!—They were food for all the venom of the Jacobites; and indeed nothing could be groſſer than the ribaldry that was vomited out in lampoons, libels, and every channel of abuſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sovereign and the new Court, and chanted even in their hearing about the public ſtreets.<note n="*" place="bottom">The following Anecdote is related of George I.—When his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It was not till the laſt year or two of his reign that their foreign Sovereign paid the nation the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of taking openly an <hi>Engliſh</hi> miſtreſs. That perſonage was Anne Brett, eldeſt daughter by her ſecond huſband of the repudiated wife of the Earl of Macelesfield, the unnatural mother of Savage the poet.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. Johnſon's Life of Savage, ſaid to be the moſt finiſhed piece of Biography in the Engliſh language.</note> Miſs Brett was very handſome, but dark e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough by her eyes, complexion, and hair, for a Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh beauty. Abiſhag was lodged in the palace under the eyes of Bathſheba, who ſeemed to maintain her power, as other favourite ſultanas have done, by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering partners in the Sovereign's affections.

George I. when his ſon the Prince of Wales and the Princeſs

had quitted St James's on their quarrel with him, had kept back their three eldeſt daughters who lived with him to his death, even after there had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly been a reconciliation between the King and Prince. Miſs Brett, when the King ſet out, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a door to be broken out of her apartment into the royal garden. Anne, the eldeſt of the Princeſſes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the freedom, and not chooſing ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in her walks, ordered the door to be walled up again—Miſs Brett as imperiouſly reverſed that command. The King died ſuddenly, and the empire of the new miſtreſs and her promiſed coronet vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <p>Miſs Henrietta Hobart was daughter of Sir Henry and ſiſter of Sir John Hobart, ſince created Earl of Bucking hamſhire. She was married to Mr. Howard, afterwards Earl of Suffolk. Mr. Howard was not opulent, the King was amorous in the German man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the lady was inconſtant, or ambitious. The intrigue would not have attracted much public no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but for the indiſcretion of the huſband, who, far from ceding his wife quietly to the Royal couch, when heated with wine, went one night into the quadrangle of St. James's, and vociferouſly deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her to be reſtored to him before the ſoldiers, &amp;c. Being thruſt out, he ſent a letter to her by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, who gave the letter to the Queen, who had the malicious pleaſure of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to her.—During the ſummer, a negociation was commenced with the obſtreperous huſband, who ſold his own honour and his wife's chaſtity for a penſion of 1200l. a year!</p>
               <p>After the death of the Queen, Lady Yarmouth came over, who was the King's miſtreſs at Hanover. She was created a Counteſs, and had much weight with him.—The King's laſt years paſſed as regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a clock.

A Clergyman at Oxford, who was remarkably abſent and nervous, going to read prayers at St. Mary's, heard a ſhow-man in the ſame ſtreet, who had an exhibition of wild beaſts, often repeat, "Walk in and ſee the ſhow; all alive, all alive, ho!"—The ſounds ſtruck the abſent man, and ran in his had ſo much, that when he began to read the Service, and came to the words "doeth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive," he cried out with a louder voice, "he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive; "all alive, all alive, ho!"—to the aſtoniſhment of the congregation.</p>
               <p>ANECDOTE.—Sampſon Gideon, a Jew, having accumulated a great fortune in England, had a mind to make his ſon a Chriſtian, and conform to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed religion of the country. Accordingly, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Epiſcopal baptiſm, and was put under the care of a clerical tutor, in order to learn the formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries of that branch of the Chriſtian faith. After ſome time, Sampſon had a curioſity to know what progreſs his ſon had made in the new religion; and having heard the Tutor examine him in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, he thought he would proceed in the ſame manner—"Who made you?" ſaid the old Jew to the young Chriſtian? "God," anſwered the boy—"Who redeemed you?"—"Jeſus Chriſt"—Here, unluckily, old Sampſon forgot the next queſtion, and ſtood fooliſhly twirling his fingers, ſtriving to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect himſelf; at length, determined to ſay ſomething or other like the third queſtion, "And who gave you that hat?"—"The Holy Ghoſt," anſwered the youth!</p>

               <head>MODERN ROME, Immediately previous to the French Revolution.</head>
               <p>ON coming out of the Pantheon, I went to the Caiptol.—This is the place which gave law to the univerſe; where Jupiter had his temple, and Rome her ſenate; from whence the Roman eagles were continually flying to every quarter of the globe, and from every quarter of the globe continually wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their way back with victories; and from whence a ſingle word from the mouth of Scipio, of Pompey, or of Ceſar, quickly reached the moſt diſtant nations, menacing their liberty, or dooming their Kings to death!—Alas, where is now all its greatneſs?—Its Senate, its Citizens, its Liberty?—Rome retains on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her name; ſhe is now only known by her ruins; by the puſillanimous ſuperſtition of her Nobles, and by the bigotted ignorance of her degraded inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants!</p>
               <p>At Rome there is now only three claſſes; the Pope, the Clergy, and the People.</p>
               <p>The number of inhabitants is eſtimated at 170,000—Fully 10,000 of theſe are beggars; menial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are more numerous; and the Clergy may be reckoned a ſixth part of the whole.</p>
               <p>Such is the ſtate of profeſſed celibacy, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of five women are reckoned to one man.—This will enable us to form an idea of the <hi>libertiniſm</hi> of popiſh Rome—The beſt education a girl here can get, is to get none—The multitude have ſome wit, a great deal of imagination, and no reaſon!</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſtical State, without troops, without money, ſurrounded by States caſting a longing eye on its poſſeſſions, ſhould ſeem an eaſy prey to the firſt ambitious invader.—Obſerve, that the jealouſy of theſe States with holds them from the attack; the political intereſt of the Catholic Princes watches o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Deſpotiſm upon which every other depends, that Kingly maxim, more powerful than armies, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <hi>That all authority is derived from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:035113_0050_1000BE7D762B08F0"/>
It is inconteſtible, that it is the crown of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch that ſupports the tiara of the Pontiff—To ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them, would be to deſtroy both.</p>
               <p>The temporal authority of the Pope will, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, never be loſt, till no religion ſhall exiſt, but one free from ſuperſtition.<note n="*" place="bottom">In this point the writer was miſtaken—We have ſeen the French Republic overturn the power of the Pope, and cut the Gordian Knot. It is true, the combined Kings, both Catholic and Proteſtant, have reſtored the puppet; but the veil is withdrawn, the myſtery is diſcloſed; and the Pope's political exiſtence hangs, at preſent, on the point of Buonaparte's ſword.</note>
               </p>
               <p>What a duration does this promiſe?—For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Reaſon or Philoſphy ever to purge the Catholic religion of all ſuperſtition.<note n="†" place="bottom">This ſentiment is the more remarkable, as it comes from a Frenchman, who, very probably, was bred a Roman Catholic.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The natural weakneſs of the human mind, the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the lower claſſes, the power of habit, and the intereſt of various paſſions, prevent the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion from attaining a ſtate of perfect purity; from elevating itſelf to Heaven, from whence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and from returning to thoſe ſimple and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime ideas, to which vulgar minds can never riſe.<note n="‡" place="bottom">We hope the American people will diſprove this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and ſhew the world, that Liberty and a rational ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of Religion can exiſt together, without the aid of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition or a Kingly Hierarchy.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is eaſy to explain the tranquility which reigns at Rome.—Tho' the Pope is in poſſeſſion of abſolute power, he is not much in the way of abuſing it—he is not born a Prince—the crown is to him the gift of Fortune—and he is an old man before he gets it.</p>
               <p>The deſpotiſm of the Popes, therefore, conſiſts more in not exerting their power, than in abuſing it.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the people, an infinity of moral cauſes bends their obedience, like their faith, under the Pontifical yoke. They have an abſolute maſter, but they have only one, and they believe his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is derived from God!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:035113_0051_1000BE7F657E4440"/>
If the people of Rome live in peace, tho' neither kept in order by a good police, nor reſtrained by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular juſtice, it is becauſe the abſence of the cauſes of diſorder there ſupplies the place of the uſual means of preſerving order.—Robberies and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakings are rare, but aſſaſſinations are frequent—Theſe, however, occaſion neither diſturbance or horror; the inhabitants of Rome coolly ſee them committed, and relate them with indifference; the murderer is not looked upon either as dangerous or infamous; "No doubt (ſay they) he has had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation!"</p>
               <p>Thus, the dagger is the duel of the populace—and thus, revenge conſtitutes the police of Rome!</p>
               <p>In ſhort, in Rome, there is neither military ſpirit, nor municipal juſtice—Beſides, there are near ſeven hundred <hi>Places of Refuge</hi> in Rome, and every houſe on which a Cardinal has placed his arms, is a place of refuge for creditors!—Some Cardinals make a gainful traffic of their aſylums!</p>
               <p>Mendicity, that degeneration of poverty, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious ſtate of which in other countries is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſource of robberies, has not that inconvenience at Rome; here it is a certain profeſſion. A man, a woman, or a child, has only to hang out a few rags, or expoſe a ſore, and they procure victuals. The pity of the Romans never reaſons—and what does a mendicant want?—Degraded by miſery, or diſeaſe, or idleneſs, animal life is enough for him; give him ſomething to eat, and he is as happy—as his dog!</p>
               <p>There are more beggars at Rome than any other City. They ſwarm on all ſides; and the pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages add to their number. Every place is open to them; they are permitted to ſeek every where for charity. Delicacy ſuffers and murmurs at this; but Humanity bids us to conſider that they are men.</p>
               <p>At Rome, therefore, miſery, indolence, ambition, or the deſire of women, do not excite to robbery—I ſay, the deſire of the ſex; for the climate and the manners of the country, furniſh women even to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety—Private debauchery is ſo great, that public debauchery is not perceived!</p>
               <p>

In the hiſtory of civilized nations, the Chapter of Women is divided into three ſections; Beauty, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and Dreſs. The Roman women, like the Italian women in general, are ſtill in a ſtate of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in an art ſo extenſive and important as that of Dreſs; in the art of adapting ornament to dreſs, and both to the ſhape, features, complexion, age, and the different hours of the morning or evening; in the art of ſoftening by gradations, of adjuſting by ſhades, of availing themſelves of contraſts—in ſhort, in that art, ſo coſtly and ſcientific, of completely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipping a woman for vanity, coquetry, or faſhion.</p>
               <p>Shall I tell it?—Will it be believed!—All the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Rome wear WIGS!—It is a ſacrifice made to indolence by their coquetry. Accuſtomed to lye down every day, after dinner, till ſix in the evening, to place a ſecond night in the middle of the day, they have found it too troubleſome to build up the edifice of a head-dreſs twice in the ſame day, and therefore indolently reſign their locks to the ſciſſors.</p>
               <p>The Roman ladies are in the habit of putting on white paint when in full dreſs. The Italian lady wiſhes to be a lilly; the French lady, a roſe What, has not beneficent Nature made them women?—Why will they thus disfigure themſelves?—They muſt have gauzes, feathers, flowers, and artificial heads; has not Nature given them beautiful hair?—Rouge; has ſhe not adorned them with the bluſh of modeſty?—White; altho' ſhe has given them the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate complexion?</p>
               <p>It is a fact, that the ſuperfluity of exiſtence, if I may uſe the expreſſion, never fails to produce that uneaſy ſenſation, which the French call <hi>ennui,</hi> and the Engliſh, listliſsneſs, ſometimes, <hi>nothing to doiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>—But this ſuperfluity of time, after the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their moſt preſſing appetites, the modern Romans expend in ſleep, in love, in frivolities, or in religious proceſſions.</p>
               <p>From dinner they paſs to ſleep, which laſts till ſix in the evening; they then do nothing, or in trifles which amount to nothing. Night arrives; all buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035113_0053_1000BE840CA66F10"/>
is ſuſpended, and all the ſhops are ſhut up; men and women, boys and girls, every body takes flight till three or four in the morning. They haſten to the public walks, to the Corfo, to coteries, and to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns—In ſhort, every night is a public feſtival, at which love, or rather luſt preſides. The ſenſes ſpeak to the ſenſes, and they ſoon make themſelves underſtood.—Intrigues are ſo numerous in Rome, that nothing can be called an intrigue—In modern Rome, the morally beautiful is abſolutely loſt and unknown.</p>
               <p>The modern Romans have a wonderful facility of changing faces; they are perpetually maſked.—In their dealings with each other, they never give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to countenances, to language, or even profeſſions—they believe only in the event!</p>
               <p>Throughout all the intercourſe of the great with the great, and of the great with the little, in Rome, there reigns a certain eaſe, politeneſs, and univerſal flattery. This proceeds from the opportunities For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune here enjoys of exerciſing all her caprices, and this, generally, in ſecret and in ſilence, by means of valets, monks, ſecretaries, and intriguing women.—Nobody, therefore, is acquainted with whom he has to do,—To-morrow, perhaps, that Prieſt may be a Pope, that Monk may be a Cardinal, or that valet a man in power.—In this ſtate of doubt, every body is civil to every body; and, in this ſtate of uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, every body laviſhes good wiſhes, ſmiles, and ſqueezes of the hand!</p>
               <p>Would you wiſh to know the behaviour of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal when he viſits another Cardinal, eſpecially when the latter is in place?—On entering the firſt anti-chamber, where the ſervants are, his Eminence makes a profound bow; in the ſecond, where ſit the valets de chambre, he ſmiles; in the third, where the Cardinal's <hi>gentlemen</hi> ſtay, he takes them by the hand; in the fourth, where he finds the introductor, he again bows, and ſmiles, and takes him by the hand, and even chats with him; at length, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at the great man's chamber. In appearance,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035113_0054_1000BE8716A11740"/>
you ſee two friends cordially embracing each other—no ſuch thing; they are two rivals, ready to cut each other's throat!</p>
               <p>Life, here, knows only child-hood and age—The other ſeaſons are wanting—Yet the people here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſatisfied. Their hunger is not violent; one daily repaſt ſatisfies them. Their thirſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes little wine, but great quantities of ice and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. And us for clothing, the climate reduces this to a mere covering; every body not naked, is cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—The wants of the ſexes find aliment in <hi>Ciciſbeiſm,</hi> the manners of the country, and in religion!</p>
               <p>The Romiſh religion, by its abſolutions, throws a convenient veil over the paſt, and, by its promiſes, gives a favourable colouring to the future. The common people are thoſe who fear the leaſt, and hope the moſt. They poſſeſs a moſt commodious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Let them be preſent at their religions cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that is to ſay, their ſacred theatrical exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, to make certain ſigns, and pronounce cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bain words, and they are ſure of Heaven!</p>
               <p>Religious ceremonies are very frequent in Rome; indeed they are neceſſary to amuſe, and to deceive, this worthleſs people; but I thought them uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting, without dignity or propriety—The proceſſion of the <hi>Fete Dieu</hi> owes its ſplendor to the preſence of the Pope.</p>
               <p>All the Monks, all the Prieſts, all the Prelates, all the Cardinals, &amp;c. are now in St. Peter's, and the proceſſion is arranging—Whilſt this is ordering, I walk in the church, and am hurried about by the crowd—What noiſe, what confuſion! occaſioned by the floods of people perpetually pouring in, and the floods ruſhing out!—By devotees, who, preſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the feet of St. Peter, are contending for the happineſs of kiſſing them; by perſons of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, every ſex and age, kneeling before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſionals filled with crafty Monks, and receiving ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution diſpenſed at the end of a long ſwitch, which the Monks ſhake over their heads; by young men and girls, wandering from tomb to tomb, wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035113_0055_1000BE88F43DEE90"/>
with each other, and talking of love!—Here I ſee Engliſhmen gravely taking the dimenſions of the pillars; Frenchmen, ſkipping about and jeſting; Germans, aſtoniſhed to perceive on the gates of the fineſt church in the world, the moſt laſcivious pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures!—On the other ſide, I obſerve a row of Abbes bending their bodies to the earth, and flattering the Cardinals, who, as they paſs, aſſume great ſtateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and a number of mendicants, who, to impoſe on pity, or fatigue delicacy, ſhock every eye with ſores and nudities!</p>
               <p>At length, the order of march is given—Behold a numerous train of dirty penitents, who file off, and make room for a multitude of dirty monks, dirty curates, and a thouſand dirty wretches, clad in dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſurplices, bearing each of them a flambeau, and exciting, every where as they paſs, by their gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſque appearance, an univerſal laugh. Now come the Prelates, the Cardinals, and the Pope himſelf!—His military attendants receive him, and the holy Sacrament that is waiting for him. The union of the two powers takes place, to the ſound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; the Pope and the Sovereign are intermingled, and the Crown and the Tiara united on the ſame head!—The Pontiff King then mounts on a throne, and ſeats himſelf with the Hoſt before him, yet it is ſo managed, that he appears as if on his knees, whilſt a dozen robuſt men bear him along. It is in this manner that the chief of the Chriſtian Biſhops ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances among the people, holding the Sacrament in his hands, and his eyes lifted towards Heaven, whilſt a general murmur runs thro' the crowd, whiſpering <hi>How handſome the Pope is!</hi>—The proceſſion returns to the Church; a thouſand torches are ranged along the whole extent of the immenſe building, and round the High Altar. The Pope deſcends from his mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throne, croſſes the church, mounts the ſteps of the altar, and, depoſiting the Hoſt, falls upon his knees—riſes up again—gives his benediction—and the buſineſs is concluded.</p>

               <p>But it is not very aſtoniſhing that St Peter's ſhould become ſo prodigious an edifice. It was projected by the vanity of Julius II. who deſired that his tomb ſhould be a temple.

The unfortunate Wickliſt had attempted a reformation of religion long before (about the year 1350), but he appeared too ſoon; he had not the noble Art of Printing to aſſiſt his endeavours, by opening the minds of the people; and ſo he and his followers fell beneath the power of the Roman Poniffs.—Here again we ſee the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>success</hi>—Wickliff is ſtigmatiſed as a Heretic; Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is celebrated as a Reformer!—Waſhington is a Hero; O'Connor is a Rebel!</note> who was ambitious of forming one perfect work from the maſterly productions of all the Fine Arts.

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035113_0060_1000BE95069A1040"/>
He took upon him the name of Pius VII. and when the French were, in their turn, in the abſence of Bunoparte in Egypt, obliged to relinquiſh their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in Italy, the new Pope took poſſeſſion of the Pontifical chair, when one of his firſt acts was, to reſtore the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> that powerful but moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable inſtrument of ſlavery and deſpotiſm!—From which act we cannot be at a loſs to gueſs the views and intentions of the combined Monarchs, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſentiment of the Writer from whom we have made our extracts: "That it is the crown of the Monarch which ſupports the tiara of the Pontiff, and that both conſpire to keep the people in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection."</p>
               <p>On this occaſion, it cannot be improper to relate the following Anecdote of the amiable Ganganelli, Clement XIV. commonly called the Proteſtant Pope.</p>
               <p>An Engliſh gentleman, on his travels, taking leave of Voltaire, ſaid to him in a jocular manner, that as he was going to Rome, he wiſhed to know if he had any commands to the Pope?—"Preſent my humble reſpects to the Holy Father (anſwered the Philoſopher) and tell him, I would be much obliged to him, if he would ſend me the eyes and ears of the Inquiſitor General." The Engliſhman, on his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at Rome, being preſented to the Pope, was ſo charmed with his affability and condeſcenſion, that he thought he might, without offence, venture to execute the Philoſopher's commiſſion—"When you return to Ferney (ſaid the good old man) make my compliments to M.

                     <p>It is generally believed, that this good man died by poiſon: his liberal and truly chriſtian mind gave offence to the more rigid members of the Conclave, as well as to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Catholic Princes; ſuch liberality did not ſuit either the temporal or the ſpiritual views of the Parties.

               <head>MODERN PARIS, In the ſixth Year of the Revolution.</head>
               <p>IF the morning, in Paris, is devoted to buſineſs, the evening at leaſt belongs to Pleaſure. Over thoſe hours ſhe holds an undivided empire, but is worſhipped at innumerable altars, and hailed by ever var<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ying rituals.</p>
               <p>During the laſt winter the amuſements of 24 the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres, which were opened every night, were every night ſucceeded by public and private balls, in ſuch numbers, that there were no leſs than 2000 ball rooms inſcribed on the regiſters of the Police, which keeps its wakeful vigils over every ſort of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in all their gradations, from the bright blaze of waxen tapers which diſplays the charms of nymphs dreſſed <hi>a la Sauvage,</hi> or <hi>a la Grec,</hi> who grace the ſplendid ball de Richlieu; to the oily lamp which lights up the ſeventh ſtory, or the vaulted cellar, where the blind fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ler's animating ſcrape calls the Sovereign people to the cotillion of wooden ſhoes.</p>
               <p>Theſe 2000 ball rooms of the capital afford ample proof that no revolution has taken place in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the French, and that they are ſtill a dancing nation. They have indeed of late fully demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the world that they are capable of greater things; and that when the energies of their ſouls are called forth, they can follow Buonaparte acroſs the bridge of Lodi; but when their minds return to its natural poſition, every barrack has a room appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riated for dancing, and the Heroes of Arcole, as well as the <hi>Muſcadins</hi> of Paris,
<q>
                     <l>All knit hands, and beat the ground</l>

               </p>
               <p>The fetes of the Court, it is aſſerted by the few perſons remaining in France, by whom they were frequented, were but tawdry ſplendour compared with the claſſical elegance which prevails at the fetes of our republican Contractors. As a ſpecimen of theſe private balls, I ſhall trace a ſhort ſketch of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035113_0062_1000BE99E2853050"/>
a dance lately given by one of the furniſhers of ſtores for fleets and armies, in his ſpacious Hotel, where all the furniture, in compliance with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent faſhion at Paris, is antique; where all that is not Greek is Roman; where ſtately ſilken beds, maſſy ſophas, worked tapeſtry, and gilt ornaments, are thrown aſide as rude gothic magnificence, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very couch reſembles that of Pericles, every chair thoſe of Cicero; where every wall is finiſhed in ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſque, like the baths of Titus, and every table, upheld by Caſtors and Polluxes, is covered with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian buſts and Etruſcan vaſes; where that modern piece of furniture a clock is concealed beneath the claſſic bar of Phoebus, and the dancing hours; and every chimney-iron is ſupported by a Sphinx, or a Griffin.</p>
               <p>The dreſs of his female viſitors was in perfect harmony with the furniture of his hotel; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Pariſian ladies are not ſuſpected of any obſtinate attachment to Grecian modes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are moſt rigid partizans of Grecian modes of dreſs, adorned like the cotemporaries of Aſpaſia—the looſe light drapery, the naked arm, the bare boſom, the ſandaled feet, the circling zone, the golden chains, the twiſling treſſes, all diſplay the moſt inflexible conformity to the laws of republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can coſtume. The moſt faſhionable hair-dreſſer of Paris, in order to accommodate himſelf to the claſſical taſte of his fair cuſtomers, is provided with a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of antique buſts as models; and when he waits on a lady, enquires if ſhe chuſes to be dreſt that day <hi>a la Cleopatre, la Dianne,</hi> or <hi>la Pſyche?</hi>—Sometimes the changeful nymph is a veſtal, ſometimes a Venus; but the laſt rage has been the <hi>Niobe;</hi> of late fat and lean, gay and grave, old and young, have been all <hi>a la Niobe;</hi> and the many-curled periwig, thrown aſide by the faſhionable claſs, now decorates the heads of petty ſhopkeepers.</p>
               <p>The fair Grecians being determined not to injure the contour of fine forms by ſuperfluous incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, no faſhionable lady at Paris wears any pockets,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035113_0063_1000BE9BC1F04AC8"/>
and the inconvenience of being without is obviated by ſticking her fan in her belt, ſliding in a flat purſe of Morocco leather, only large enough to contain a few louis, at the ſide of her neck, and giving her ſnuff-box and her pocket-handkerchief to the care of the gentleman who attends her, and to whom ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies for them whenever ſhe has occaſion.</p>
               <p>For a ſhort time during the winter, in defiance of froſt and ſnow, the coſtume of a few reigning belles was not <hi>a la grec,</hi> but <hi>a la ſauvage.</hi> To be dreſſed <hi>a la ſauvage,</hi> was to have all that part of the frame which was not left uncovered clad in a light drapery of fleſh colour. The boddice under which no lin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n was worn (ſhifts being an article of dreſs long ſince rejected at Paris, both by the Greeks and the Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) the boddice was made of knitted ſilk, clinging exactly to the ſhape, which is perfectly diſplayed; the petticoat was on one ſide twiſted up by a light feſtoon; and the feet, which were either bare or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a ſilk ſtocking of fleſh colour, ſo woven as to draw upon the toes like a glove upon the fingers, were decorated with diamonds. Theſe gentle ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, however, found themſelves ſo rudely treated whenever they appeared by the ſovereign multitude, that at length the faſhions of Otaheite were thrown aſide, and Greece remains the ſtanding order of the day.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Contractor, and his ball—Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeveral hours had paſt in dancing cotillions, which the young women of Paris perform with a degree of perfection—a light nymphiſh grace unſeen elſewhere—and after the walſe, which is now never forgotten at a Paris ball, had proved that the ſteady heads of Niobes were not to be made giddy, the company were led to a ſupper furniſhed with Eaſtern magnificence, and decorated with attic taſte. After ſupper the folding doors of the ſaloon were thrown open to a garden of conſiderable extent, beautifully illuminated with coloured lamps, and its trees bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with laviſh cluſters of fruits of every ſeaſon, and every climate, formed of ice, while fountains pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth ſtreams of orgeat, lemonade, and liqueurs!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:035113_0064_1000AC825B457DB8"/>
But while theſe imitators of Greece and Rome are revelling in Aſiatic luxury, you hear them lamenting moſt pathetically the ſubverſion of the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gime; that Regime, which would at leaſt have had thus much of juſtice, that it would have retained theſe perſonages in the anti-chambers of the ſaloons they now occupy; to which anti-chambers they would with a counter-revolution moſt probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. One is obliged to offer up an invocation to Patience, when condemned to liſten to their decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations againſt that new order of things to which ſolely they owe their elevation.</p>
               <p>There is indeed one claſs of perſons, before whoſe complaints of the Revolution, however bitter, the mind humbles itſelf in ſympathetic ſorrow. The poor Noble, while he ſips his Spartan black-broth, which he is forced to procure by parting, in ſad gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, with all the relicks of his former ſplendour, with watches, rings, furniture and clothes; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if he complains, is to be pitied, and if he forbears complaint, it is to be revered! But alas, there is ſo much of tragical detail in the pages of the Great Book, a thing which has long ſince been called a great evil, that we muſt give it at leaſt a whole chapter to itſelf.</p>
               <p>At preſent I ſhall only obſerve, that the reign of Terror has acted upon this country like ſome mighty peſtilence, which not only ſweeps away devoted mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in its fury, but leaves an obnoxious taint upon every object where it has paſſed. The reign of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror has given a fatal wound to the energies of public ſpirit; ordinary minds have miſtaken the execrable abuſes of Liberty for an effect of the generous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple itſelf the victims of revolutionary government have lifted up their complaining voice; all emotions of ſympathy, and all the feelings of indignation have been called forth; and the partizans of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Regime have left no art unpractiſed, no ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion untried, to take advantage of theſe diſpoſitions in favour of their own ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:035113_0065_1000BE9E220486D0"/>
Thoſe who have been too rapidly enriched by the Revolution, have endeavoured to hide the obſcurity of their origin, by mimicking the tones of thoſe who have titles and honours to regret, till Ariſtocracy has deſcended ſo low, that it will ſoon perhaps be exploded, like any other faſhion, when taken up by the vulgar. Theſe very ladies, who have taught their new-made Liege Lords to ape their counter-revolutionary follies, will at length be aſhamed of their Ariſtocracy, when they find how ſucceſsfully they are rivalled in thoſe ſentiments by their mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liners and mantua-makers. A writer of a late poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical pamphlet has given an admirable reaſon why our Pariſian belles will ſoon lay aſide the tone of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal lamentations for the overthrow of deſpotiſm. "Seven years," ſays he, "have already elapſed ſince the epocha of the Revolution: ſeven years is a period of ſome length in the hiſtory of a youthful beauty, and a lady will not regret the Monarchy under the penalty of paſſing for old." I believe every perſon who has ſtudied the female heart, will agree with this writer, that the Republic has a tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable chance upon this principle of obtaining ere long many fair proſelytes.</p>
               <p>Public balls, as well as concerts, were held laſt winter at the <hi>Theatre Francais,</hi> which, after having been long ſhut up, was repaired, embelliſhed, and baptized by the Greek name of the <hi>Odeon;</hi> and that no jealouſy might exiſt between the balls and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certs, on account of this claſſical nomenclature, the balls immediately received the appellation of <hi>Thiaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the moſt ſingular ſpecies of amuſement which the laſt winter produced, were ſubſcription-balls, entitled as <hi>des bals a la Victime.</hi> Such, and ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was the rage for pleaſure, that a certain number of its votaries who during the tyranny of Robeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre, had loſt their neareſt relations on the ſcaffold, inſtituted, not days of ſuch ſolemn, ſad commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as is dear to the ſuperſtition of tenderneſs, when, in melancholy proceſſion, clad in ſable, and
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035113_0066_1000BEA0E3071A20"/>
wreathed in cypreſs, they might have knelt, a mourning multitude, around the ſpot where the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated bodies of their murdered parents had been thrown by the executioner; and bathed the ſod with thoſe bitter tears which filial affection, or organized love, ſhed over the broken ties of nature, or of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—no!—the commemorative rites which theſe mourners offered to the manes of their maſſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, were feſtive balls! To theſe ſtrange, unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed orgies, no one could be admitted who had not loſt a father, a mother, a huſband, a wife, a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or a ſiſter, on the guillotine; but any perſon with a certificate of their execution in his pocket book, not only obtained admiſſion, but might dance as long, and as heart could wiſh. Had Holbein been preſent at ſuch a ſpectacle, no doubt he would have enriched his death-dance with new images, and led forward each gay nymph by an attendant headleſs ſpectre. The indignant cry of public opinion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was at length heard above the muſic of the walſe and the cotillion; and the <hi>bal a la victime</hi> exiſts no longer to bear its powerful teſtimony to a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, not merely of manners, but of the heart.</p>
               <p>If in the winter, conformibly to our Grecian ideas at Paris, concert rooms became <hi>Odeons,</hi> and the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obes and the Titus's danced in a <hi>thiaſe,</hi> ſummer can boaſt of more than equal honours; ſince then we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tread but once the attic ground, and never ſuffer ourſelves to be pleaſed but when pleaſure preſents herſelf with a claſſical appellation. Witneſs ye gardens of Tivoli, ye bowers of Idalia, ye winding walks of Elyſium, ye grotos of Venus, ye vales of Tempe, ye groves of Theſſaly! witneſs with what fond alacrity the lovers of antiquity fly in multitudes to your enchanting receſſes, where the arching trees are hung with innumerable lamps of varying co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, where the ear is exhilerated with the ſounds of muſic, and the eye is cheated with the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the dance; and where every evening the hour of ten ſerves as a general ſignal, at which the whole city of Paris ſeems one vaſt theatre for the

diſplay of fireworks. A ſtranger who ſhould enter this city at night by the bridge of Neuilly, might ſuppoſe he had reached this ſcene of great events at ſome important epocha, which had occaſioned a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral rejoicing. On his right he would diſcern the lights of <hi>Bagatelle,</hi> beaming through the <hi>Bois de Boulogne,</hi> and would paſs cloſe to the brilliant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Idalia; on his left he would be dazzled by the illumination of the Elyſium; while, as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, he would diſcern, above every quarter of the town, the tall ſky rockets darting their vivid flaſh, and would hear, in all directions, the light exploſions of enchanted palaces, with bright arcades and fairy columns:
<q>
                     <l>The crackling flames appear on high,</l>
                     <l>And driving ſparkles dance along the ſky.</l>

               <head>MODERN LONDON, At the Cloſe of the 18th Century.</head>
               <p>LONDON, the metropolis of Great Britain, one of the largeſt and moſt opulent cities in the world, is mentioned by Tacitus as a place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable note in the time of Nero. London is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 8 miles long on the banks of the Thames, above 3 miles wide, and 24 miles in circumference, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 8000 ſtreets, lanes, and alleys, and 65 ſquares in which are above 162,000 houſes, beſides ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and public buildings; the inhabitants are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned 1,250,000, being fully 400,000 more than what are eſtimated in the city of Paris. Taking a compaſs of ten miles round St. Paul's church, which would include nearly 100 towns and villages, the number of inhabitants would then be 1,500,000, a fourth part of the whole of the people in the United States eſtimated at their greateſt number, and more than all the inhabitants of Virginia, both black and white!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:035113_0070_1000AC8597C92838"/>
London, with all its opulence, is not remarkable for its elegance. The ſtreets are crooked, narrow, and irregular; nor are its public buildings appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately magnificent. St. Paul's Church is the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable modern fabric; indeed it is a noble pile, and only inferior to St. Peter's in Rome. It is 2292 feet in circumference, and 365 feet in height (ſee Note p. 44)—As a Gothic building, Weſtminſter Abbey is a grand ſpecimen of that kind of architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it was founded by the Eaſt Saxons in the year 610; it is 365 feet in length, and 195 broad. It contains a greater number and variety of monuments than any church in the world; and Henry the VIII's Chapel has been called one of the Wonders of the World. The bridges over the Thames are a great ornament to London. The moſt ancient is London bridge, finiſhed about the year 1200; it has 19 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and is 950 feet long. Weſtminſter bridge is one of the fineſt in the world; it was built by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle, a native of Switzerland, and was finiſhed in the year 1750; it has 15 arches, and is 1225 long. Blackfriar's bridge, built by Mylne, a Scotchman, was completed in the year 1768; it is 995 feet long, and conſiſts of 9 elliptical arches, the centre one 100 feet wide, and all of them wider than the famous Rialto at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>But as we have not room to particulariſe all the public buildings, we muſt mention in the groſs.—London contains 240 churches and chapels of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Religion; 207 Meeting-houſes for Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of different denominations; 45 Chapels for Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; and 6 Synagogues for Jews. It has 4050 ſeminaries of Education, 170 Alms-houſes, and 750 Inſtitutions for charitable uſes, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The broad ſtream of the river Thames flowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween London and Southwark, continually agitated by a briſk current, or a rapid tide, brings conſtant ſupplies of freſh and wholeſome air into this vaſt city, which is remarkably healthy, conſidering its ſize. The cleanlineſs of London is greatly aided by its ſituation on the Thames; and the New River fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035113_0071_1000BEA81957EE28"/>
contributes to the abundance of that very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary element. The ſituation alſo is fortunate with regard to navigation; had it been placed lower on the Thames, it would have been annoyed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome marſhes, and more liable to the attacks of foreign enemies; had it been higher, it would not have been acceſſible to veſſels of burthen. It now poſſeſſes every advantage that can be derived from a ſea-port, without its dangers; and, at the ſame time, by means of its noble river, enjoys an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive communication with the internal parts of the country. London, therefore, unites in itſelf all the benefits ariſing from navigation and commerce, with thoſe of a metropolis at which all the public buſineſs of a great commercial nation is tranſacted. In the port of London alone, 13,500 veſſels, and 50,000 waggons (including their repeated voyages and jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) annually bring and carry away property to the amount of 120 millions!—Add to this ſum, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, proviſions, bank-notes, caſh, jewels, &amp;c. depoſited, and in conſtant circulation within the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, in the courſe of the year, the whole may fairly be eſtimated at 170 millions ſterling!<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>This ſum will aſtoniſh the Reader at firſt view; but when the vaſt extent of the trade and commerce of London is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and that in the exports and imports of the Capital alone, there is an annual movement of about 70 millions of property laden and unladen in the river Thames, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the great quantity of ſtationary or fixed property, all which cannot amount to leſs than 100 millions—it will ceaſe to be a matter of ſurprize, that under a defective ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of Police, the depredations are eſtimated ſo high.</p>
               <p>

In contemplating this ſhocking catalogue of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man depravity, which, however, does not include every deſcription of fraud or diſhoneſty practiſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mind ſhall imbibe unfavourable impreſſions, it may be neceſſary to remind the reader, that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der juſtly to appreciate the moral turpitude which attaches to ſuch a corrupt community, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects deluded and miſled by the numerous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which aſſail them in a rich and luxuriant city, it muſt be meaſured by a ſcale proportioned to the unparalleled extent and opulence of the metropolis.—London is not only the grand magazine of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh empire, but alſo the general receptacle for the idle and the depraved of almoſt every country in the world—where, temptations for criminal pleaſures, gambling, fraud, and depredations, almoſt exceed imagination—beſides, being the ſeat of Government, and the centre of faſhion, amuſements, diſſipation, folly and extravagance, it is a great manufacturing town, and the firſt commercial city in the univerſe.</p>
               <p>Under theſe circumſtances, whilſt immorality, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, and crimes are known to advance in proportion to riches, it is much to be lamented, that in the rapid increaſe of the latter, ſufficient attention has not been beſtowed to remedy the defects, by a better ſyſtem of police, and a more effective code of laws.</p>

               <head>HUME'S HISTORY. For the VIRGINIAN REPOSITORY.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE Editor of the Collection, entitled WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTONIANA, has taken upon him to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Hume's Hiſtory of England for "the purity of its ſtyle." I know it is a common opinion, that Mr. Hume is a very elegant hiſtorian; a powerful ſet of men, who find it their intereſt to ſupport a conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church and State, have ſaid ſo—but a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opinion is not always a juſt one; the voice of the People is not always the voice of God, in liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary diſquiſitions; and, in the preſent caſe, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think, that the public has been led to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what will not bear the teſt of a critical exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation—I am one of thoſe who think, that the ſtyle of Hume's Hiſtory does not deſerve ſuch high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations as it has received; on the contrary, it appears to me to be often clumſy, frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct, and never elevated beyond mediocrity.</p>
               <p>As the ſubject is worthy of conſideration, I am in hopes you will give the following obſervations a place in your Repoſitory.—I freely confeſs, however, that they are not altogether original; but they will not, I preſume, be conſidered the leſs curious and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, becauſe they happen to accord with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an able Critic in London. And I think it
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035113_0077_1000BEB4AD9D0468"/>
a duty. I owe to my fellow citizens of the United States, not only to guard them againſt Toryiſm and Infidelity,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mr. Hume's firſt eſſay as a Hiſtorian was two volumes in defence of the Houſe of Stewart. Theſe met with ſo favourable a reception from a numerous Party, that he leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened his book into a Hiſtory of England, including the affairs of Scotland. From whence it will be ſeen, that Mr. Hume's outſet was a profeſſed defence of Tory principles, and how unfit he is to be conſidered as an impartial hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal guide with reſpect to political doctrines—indeed he is the favourite Author of all the advocates for Monarchy, and is conſidered by them as a ſtandard authority.</p>
                     <p>Goldſmith was alſo on the Tory ſide, and yet his Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is become a School-book!</p>
                  </note> but alſo from being led believe, that there are purity and elegance of ſtyle where they are not.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Hume's character of Queen Elizabeth has been particularly admired, I ſhall ſelect that portion of his Hiſtory, and try it by the touchſtone of gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical correctneſs and claſſical purity.</p>
               <p>"There are few perſonages in Hiſtory, who have been more <hi>expoſed</hi> to the calumny of enemies, and the adulation of friends, than Queen Elizabeth; and yet there ſcarcely is any whoſe reputation has been more certainly determined by the unanimous conſent of poſterity."—</p>
               <p>Now, the writer did not mean what is here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. Elizabeth's character is no more <hi>expoſed</hi> to calumny and adulation, than the character of any other perſonage, becauſe Calumny and Adulation make no rational diſtinctions. Her character may, indeed, have <hi>incurred</hi> more calumny and adulation, or have been the <hi>object</hi> of them, than that of moſt other people; and this is what the Writer would have expreſſed, had he known how to write Engliſh.</p>
               <p>"The unuſual length of her <hi>adminiſtration,</hi> and the ſtrong <hi>features</hi> of her character, were able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all difficulties; and obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her admirers ſomewhat of their panegyrics, have, at laſt, in ſpite of political factions, and, what is more, of religious

animoſities, produced a uniform judgement with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to her conduct."—</p>
               <p>No judge of the Engliſh language will venture to ſay, that there is either purity or elegance in this paſſage. A correct writer would have put <hi>reign</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>adminiſtration.</hi> The fancy too of a <hi>feature</hi> as able to overcome a prejudice, will have but few ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers amongſt readers of taſte and diſcernment.—Inſtead of <hi>a</hi> uniform, it ſhould be written <hi>an</hi> uniform judgement, &amp;c. And how inſipid is the concluſion?—"a uniform judgement with regard to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct!"—The pooreſt ſcribbler for a News-paper could not have clothed his ſentiment in more beggarly language.</p>
               <p>"Her vigour, her <hi>conſtancy,</hi> her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, addreſs, are allowed to merit the higheſt praiſes, and appear not to have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by any perſon that ever filled a throne."—</p>
               <p>Where is the elegance of this paſſage?—Beſides, <hi>conſtancy,</hi> in its general ſenſe, is well repreſented by the <hi>conſtantia</hi> of the Romans, but Engliſh readers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the word to love or friendſhip. <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> or <hi>firmneſs,</hi> or ſome equivalent expreſſion, would much better have repreſented the writer's intention in this place. And the laſt clauſe of the paſſage is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly cold and undignified.</p>
               <p>"A conduct leſs rigorous, leſs imperious, more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, more indulgent to her people, <hi>would have been</hi> requiſite to form a perfect character."—</p>
               <p>How, <hi>would have been?</hi>—It ſhould be "<hi>is</hi> requiſite" in addition to her excellencies.</p>
               <p>"By the force of her mind, ſhe controlled all her more active and ſtronger <hi>qualities,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">According to the idea of ſome Writers, the word <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> does not properly apply to Vice, but only to Virtue.—Thus we ſay, the quality of <hi>courage,</hi> of <hi>temperance,</hi> or of <hi>chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;</hi> but we cannot, according to this opinion, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, ſay the quality of <hi>cowardice,</hi> of <hi>drunkenness,</hi> or of <hi>las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiousness</hi>—Theſe, ſay they, are <hi>propensities,</hi> not <hi>qualities</hi>—A queſtion for the Critics.</note> and prevented them from running into exceſs."—</p>

This paſſage is a flat contradiction to the former. If ſhe were free from <hi>exceſs</hi> in her ſtronger qualities, why ſhould we wiſh her to have been <hi>leſs</hi> imperious, or <hi>leſs</hi> rigorous than ſhe was?—The Writer appears to be actuated by a ſtrong deſire to exhibit a ſtriking antitheſis, without poſſeſſing a clearneſs of conception or a dexterity of language, ſufficient for his purpoſe. It is this ſuperficial glitter that impoſes upon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent or unſkilful reader, but will not impoſe upon the calm and judicious Critic.—The whole of this ſentence is inſipid, and does not ſhew a ſingle ſtroke of a maſter artiſt.</p>
               <p>"Her heroiſm was exempt from temerity, her frugality from avarice, her friendſhip from partiality, her active temper from turbulence and a vain ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."—</p>
               <p>The wording of this paſſage may be well enough put together, but the poſitions are very diſputable, and will be acceded to by very few who have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and impartially ſtudied this Queen's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>"She guarded not herſelf with equal care, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſucceſs, from leſſer infirmities; the rivalſhip of beauty, the deſire of admiration, and the ſallies of anger."<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>"Rivalſhip of Beauty"—Queen Elizabeth had no beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to boaſt of; on the contrary, by the beſt accounts we have of her perſon, ſhe was a very ordinary, forbidding figure, but poſſeſſed of ſtrong paſſions, and immoderately fond of admiration; even the groſſeſt flattery was acceptable to her.—Hence aroſe her implacable hatred to Queen Mary, who was the moſt beautiful woman of the age.—Her long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated murder of the unfortunate Mary, under the moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery of legal forms, ſtands upon authentic records, as the moſt atrocious and treacherous act that has been perpetrated in any country.—Taking in all the circumſtances, it is one of the moſt affecting ſtories related in Hiſtory.—[For the beſt accounts of Mary's life and misfortunes, conſult Robertſon on one ſide, and Stewart on the other.]</p>
                     <p>From the aſſumed <hi>chastity</hi> of Elizabeth—ſhe was called the <hi>Virgin Queen</hi>—aroſe the name of this State, <hi>Virginia.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the preſent generation of <hi>Virginians</hi> will applaud the fitneſs of this appellation—certainly they will wonder at the curious, and oft-times ridiculous circumſtances, which give riſe to the moſt important affairs of the world.</p>
                  </note>—</p>
               <p>"The deſire of admiration" wants vigour, and the "ſallies of anger" make a moſt unmuſical concluſion. A well-tun'd ear will perceive the ſuperiority of a different arrangement; "the ſallies of anger, and the jealouſies of love."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:035113_0080_1000ACC947A35668"/>
"Few Sovereigns of England <hi>ſucceeded</hi> to the throne in more difficult circumſtances; and none ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the government with ſuch uniform ſucceſs <hi>and felicity.</hi>"—</p>
               <p>The ſpecific term <hi>ſucceeded</hi> has no propriety in this place; he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>aſcended the throne.</hi> And what a tame redundancy in the two laſt words of the ſentence—they ſhould be expunged.</p>
               <p>"Tho' her enemies were the moſt powerful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Europe, the moſt active, the moſt enterpriſing, <hi>the leaſt ſcrupulous,</hi> ſhe was able, by her vigour, to make deep impreſſions on their ſtates; her own greatneſs, meanwhile, remained <hi>untouched</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impaired.</hi>"—</p>
               <p>"The leaſt ſcrupulous"—in what?—Some addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſſary to a clear perception of the Writer's meaning; and we may readily conclude, that what has been <hi>untouched</hi> is <hi>unimpaired.</hi> The whole para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph wants conſecution, coheſion, and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>"The ſame of this Princeſs, tho' it has ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the prejudices both of Faction and Bigotry, yet lies ſtill expoſed to <hi>another prejudice,</hi> which is more durable, becauſe <hi>more natural;</hi> and which, according to the different views in which we ſurvey her, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable either of exalting beyond meaſure, or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the luſtre of her character."—</p>
               <p>As nothing was ſaid above of any thing but reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious factions, the words "both of Faction and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry" are inaccurate and indiſtinct. The character of the paſſage, inſtead of the diſparaging term <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prejudice,</hi> evidently required a word of middle
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035113_0081_1000ACCACD00B088"/>
power, as it is made ſuſceptible of two oppoſite ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. <hi>More natural</hi> is fooliſh; no compariſon is neceſſary, and none, in reality, was intended.—Whether "to ſurvey according to a view" be either Engliſh or ſenſe, I much queſtion; and, "to exalt a luſtre," will command no admiration from readers of taſte; beſides, regularity demands this collocation: "either of exalting, or diminiſhing, beyond meaſure, the luſtre—". <hi>Meaſure,</hi> too, as applied to <hi>luſtre!</hi>—It is like a <hi>peck of moonſhine!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"The true method of eſtimating her merit, is to lay aſide all theſe <hi>conſiderations,</hi> and <hi>conſider</hi> her mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a rational being, placed in authority, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the government of mankind,"—</p>

There is no inſtance on record, I think, of ſo great a reputation that reſts on ſo flimſy a foundation. If any of his admirers, after ſeeing what Hume <hi>is,</hi> ſhould be inclined to view what he <hi>is not,</hi> let them turn to Johnſon's preface to his edition of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear, and their conviction will be complete.

               <head>MEMOIRS of the Author of "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman." By W M. GODWIN.</head>
               <p>VULGAR tears fall and evaporate without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any trace behind them: but the tears of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is often chryſtialiſed by the power of genius, and converted into a permanent literary brilliant. Mr. Godwin, whoſe abilities are indiſputable, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours thus to dignify and render illuſtrious his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for the loſs of his wife; we therefore regret the neceſſity of obſerving that not only the general reader, but the moſt judicious and reflecting part of mankind, will arraign the prudence and the utility of theſe memoirs, though he himſelf commences them with this ſentence of high expectation:—'there are not many individuals with whoſe charcter the <hi>public welfare</hi> and <hi>improvement</hi> are more ultimately connected, than the author of "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman."</p>
               <p>After an exordium ſo ſplendid, we could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find ſuch a narrative;—a narrative which we muſt indeed read with pity and concern, but which we ſhould have adviſed the author to bury in oblivion. Bluſhes would ſuffuſe the checks of moſt huſbands if they were <hi>forced</hi> to relate thoſe anecdotes of their wives which Mr. Godwin voluntarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims to the world. The extreme exentricity of Mr. G.'s ſentiments will account for this conduct. Virtue and Vice are weighed by him in a balance of his own. He neither looks to marriage with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, nor to ſuicide with horror. He relates with complacency of Mary Wollſtonecaft, afterwards his wife, that ſhe cultivated a <hi>platonic</hi> affection for Mr. Fuſeli the painter:—that ſhe cohabited with Mr. Imaly as his wife, took his name and had a child by him, without being married; and that ſhe even li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Mr. G. himſelf, and was pregnant by him; and that it was only her pregnancy which induced them to think of marriage; fearing that, otherwiſe ſhe might be excluded from ſociety. He gravely records, alſo, (what was mentioned at the time in
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035113_0083_1000ADF1FB96C6A8"/>
the Newſpapers, and was conſidered by ſome perſons as calumny,) her attempt to drown herſelf in the Thames, in conſequence of the ill-treatment which ſhe experienced from Mr. Imlay.</p>
               <p>How the public welfare and improvement are connected with or can be advanced by the ſtudied and uniform eulogium of ſuch conduct will not be eaſily perceived; nor will any reader of diſcernment who appreciates the merits of this unfortunate fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, even on the evidence of her own huſband, be able to ſay with him that 'there are no circumſtances in her life that, in the judgment of honour and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, could brand her with diſgrace!'—Peace to her manes! She was the child of Genius, but ſhe was alſo the child of Error!</p>
               <p>Moſt of the incidents which compoſed her ſhort life are neither very ſingular nor very ſtriking. Where ſhe was born her huſband does not know. She commenced the career of fame, like Milton, Sir Richard Blackmore, Dr. Johnſon, and others, by keeping a ſchool;—ſhe then became a writer for a bookſeller, and an occaſional critic. She attracted notice by entering the liſts againſt Mr. Burke, and particularly by her "Vindication of the Rights of Woman;" by the publication of which, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of her biographer, 'ſhe will perhaps be found to have performed more ſubſtantial ſervice for the cauſe of her ſex, than all the other writers, male or female, that ever felt themſelves animated in the behalf of oppreſſed and injured beauty.' Though this muſt be deemed exaggerated praiſe, it may be forgiven from a huſband, who, no doubt, moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely mourns her loſs; and our other female au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors muſt not take it amiſs that he ſhould wiſh to have it believed, that 'no female writer ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo great a degree of celebrity throughout Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.'</p>

very prepoſſeſſing impreſſions. At laſt, however, a ſtrong and mutual affection took place, and ripened into love.</p>
               <p>'There was (Mr. G. ſays) no period of throes and reſolute explanation attendant on the tale. It was friendſhip melting into love. Previouſly to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>To this account of the ſincerity and ardour of their mutual paſſion, it is conciſely added, '<hi>We did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,'</hi>—and then follows this poor, turgid at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at a juſtification:—</p>
               <p>'It is difficult to recommend any thing to indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate adoption, contrary to the eſtabliſhed rules and prejudices of mankind; but certainly nothing can be ſo ridiculous upon the face of it, or ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>general march of ſentiment,</hi> as to require the overflowing of the ſoul to wait upon a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that which, whereever delicacy and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation exiſt, is of all things moſt ſacredly private, to blow a trumpet before it, and to record the moment when it has arrived at its climax.'</p>
               <p>Apprehending that this very refined and ſentimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal logic would not be ſufficient to convince the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic of the propriety of their conduct in this reſpect, Mr. G. adds—'There were other reaſons why we did not immediately marry—Mary felt an entire conviction of the propriety of her conduct.'—We queſtion this. Her experience, with Mr. Imlay, of the miſerable conſequences to which a woman expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes herſelf by an unmarried connection, <hi>muſt</hi> have taught her the <hi>imprudence</hi> at leaſt of diſregarding the law of ſociety reſpecting marriage. No evil may reſult from recording the Vow of Love; but many evils <hi>muſt</hi> reſult from a neglect, or a contempt of the Law of Marriage. It is one of the moſt important inſtitutions of civil ſociety.</p>
               <p>On this ſubject, Mr. Godwin rather gives his own opinions than thoſe of his wife; or, he exhibits her's with the colouring of his theoretical ſyſtem thrown

over them,—But let us liſten to his account of her religion?—</p>
               <p>'Her religion was little allied to any ſyſtem of forms; it was founded rather in <hi>taſte,</hi> than in the niceties of polemical diſcuſſion. Her mind conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally attached itſelf to the <hi>ſublime</hi> and the <hi>amiable.</hi> She found an inexpreſſible delight in the beauties of Nature, and in <hi>the ſplendid reveries of the imagination!</hi>—When ſhe walked amidſt the wonders of Nature, ſhe was accuſtomed to converſe with God. To her mind, He was pictured as not leſs amiable, kind and generous, than great, wiſe, and exalted. In fact, ſhe had received few leſſons of religion in her youth, and her religion was almoſt entirely of her own cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.<note n="*" place="bottom">Here we perceive the ſource of all Miſs Wolſtancroft's misfortunes, "the want of an early religions education."—She entered into the world without a ſyſtem of either morals or religion, ſhe fell a victim to a "<hi>glowing imagination,</hi>" and became an object of ſhame, and reproach, and miſery!—Such are the effects of a <hi>glowing imagination,</hi> particularly in a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, without the reſtraining helps of Morals and Religion.—We underſtand by her life, which has been lately publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that her father was of an unſettled diſpoſition, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moving from place to place, until at laſt he waſted all his property, and died in poverty.</note> She could not recollect the time when ſhe had believed the doctrine of future puniſhments.—The tenets of her ſyſtem were the growth of her own moral taſte, and her religion was a gratification not a terror to her. She ſometimes liſtened to the ſermons of Dr. Price, but more frequently attended public worſhip according to the forms of the Church of England. Latterly her attendance on Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice became leſs conſtant, and at length was wholly diſcontinued.—I believe (continues Mr. G.) that no perſon of <hi>a well furniſhed mind,</hi> that has ſhaken off the implicit ſubjection of youth, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The matrimonial happineſs of Mr. and Mrs. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win was but of ſhort contiuance. Their marriage was declared in April 1797, and ſhe died the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember following, in child-bed, aged 38.</p>

                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:035113_0086_1000BEBC2B6F3788"/>
In the poſthumous works of Mrs. Godwin, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſeries of letters to Mr. I. who lived with her at Paris for a ſhort time in <hi>matrimonial intimacy,</hi> but without the forms of marriage; he forſook her when ſhe was pregnant, a prey to deſpair, and took up with another woman.—Almoſt any other huſband than Mr. Godwin would have ſuppreſſed theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; yet he not only publiſhes them, but introduce them with a preface, in which he declares them to 'contain the fineſt examples of the language of <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent</hi> and <hi>paſſion</hi> ever preſented to the world!'—We think ſuch language little ſhort of inſanity; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when it appears, that her <hi>ſentiments</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guided by <hi>prudence,</hi> ſhe was left to ſhame, miſery and deſpair!</p>
               <p>The following extract from one of her letters to her unfaithful lover, will give our readers an idea of her <hi>glowing imagination:</hi>—</p>
               <p>"I obey an emotion of the heart, which made me think of wiſhing thee, my love, a good night, before I go to reſt, with more tenderneſs than I can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, when writing a haſty line under Colonel—'s eye. You can ſcarcely imagine with what pleaſure I anticipate the day, when we are to begin <hi>to live together;</hi> and you will ſmile to hear how many plans of employment I have in my head, now that I am confident my heart has found peace in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom—[<hi>deluded, miſtaken woman!</hi>]—Cheriſh me with that <hi>dignified tenderneſs,</hi> which I have only found in you; and your own dear girl will try to keep under a <hi>quickneſs of feeling,</hi> that has ſometimes given you pain!—Yes, I will be good, that I may deſerve to be happy; and, whilſt you love me, I cannot again fall into the miſerable ſtate which rendered life a burthen almoſt too heavy to be borne.</p>
               <p>"But, good night—God bleſs you!—Sterne ſays, that is equal to a kiſs; yet I would rather give you the kiſs into the bargain!</p>
               <p>"<hi>P. S,</hi> I will be at the Barrier a little after ten o'clock to-morrow"—</p>

                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:035113_0087_1000AC9D544E1308"/>
The conſequence of this barrier aſſignation was a child. It was called the <hi>Barrier Girl,</hi> from a belief that ſhe owed her exiſtence to this <hi>willing</hi> interview on the Lady's ſide—The man who could reſiſt ſuch an invitation, muſt be more than a Joſeph!</p>
               <p>Altho' Miſs W. went, of her own accord, without form or ſolicitation, on this occaſion, to make a child, yet ſhe frequently lamented the evils to which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ſubjected her ſex in the article of children; a ſubject which ſhe never could diſcuſs with patience, it being an evil to which man was not ſubjected.</p>
               <p>"What ſignifies (cried ſhe) all the freedom of our ſouls, all the exaltation of our intellects, if we are to be confined for months to carry a burthen which we have no means to lay down; and when the little wretch appears to the world, what a dreadful idea!—With intellects that ſoar beyond the firmament, are we to be confined to ſwaddle and dandle an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal that has no ideas, and would at every moment deſtroy itſelf, if we did not preſerve it?—O horrid! that Nature did not provide ſome middle, ſome ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, lumpiſh being, to rear and take care of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man progeny—Why not make man an oviparous ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal?—Then we might have hatched the eggs in ſtoves, as they do chickens in Egypt!"</p>
               <p>Is this a woman to be held up as a pattern for the ſex?—Are her writings fit to be put into the hands of our wives and daughters?—We may pity her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, but we muſt blame her conduct, and deteſt her ſentiments.</p>
               <p>If Mr. I. was ſoon cloyed with the exceſſive fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this <hi>willing dame,</hi> it muſt be confeſſed, that Godwin and her were "congenial ſouls," both of them diſregarding the ceremonies of the Law, and the reſpect of the Community.

—But, let him ſpeak for himſelf, and let every good citizen think of the conſequences:—</p>

               <p>Again—"The inſtitution of marriage is <hi>a ſyſtem of fraud!</hi>—It is true, marriage is law, but it is <hi>the worſt of all laws!</hi>—Whatever our underſtandings may tell us of the perſon from whoſe connection we ſhould derive the greateſt improvement, of the worth of one woman, and the demerits of another, we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to conſider what is law, and not what is juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.

Moreau, in imitation of Xenophon, acquired more glory by retreat, than others have achieved by victory; and Buonaparte, by uniting the warrior and the ſtatesman in his own perſon, has conſummated the glory of his adopted country.</p>
               <p>This extraordinary man, BUONAPARTE, was born in the town of Ajaccio, in Corſica, in 1767, is the ſon of Char. Buonaparte and Laetitia Raniolmi. His father, who was alſo a native Ajaccio, was bred to the law, at Rome, and took part with the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Paoli, in the memorable ſtruggle made by a handful of brave iſlanders, againſt the tyrannical ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Louis XV, and the Machiavelian ſchemes of his miniſter, Choiſeul.</p>
               <p>I am aſſured, by a near relation of the family, that he not only laid aſide the gown upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but actually carried a muſket as a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel.</p>
               <p>On the conqueſt of the iſland, he wiſhed to retire, with the gallant chieftain who had ſo nobly ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled for its independence; but he was prevented by his uncle, a Canon, who exerciſed a parental au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over him.</p>
               <p>In 1773, a deputation from the three eſtates was ſent to wait on the king of France; and, on this occaſion, Charles Buonaparte was ſelected to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Nobles. He was ſoon after promoted to the office of Procurotore Reale of Ajaccio, where his

anceſtors, ſuppoſed to have been originally from Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany, had been ſettled nearly two hundred years.</p>
               <p>The family of the elder Buonaparte was numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for he had ſeven children: four ſons, and three daughters. It was his good fortune, however, to be cheriſhed by the French; and both he and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily lived in the greateſt intimacy with M. de Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeuf, the Governor, who received a revenue of 60,000 livres a year, on condition of doing nothing! An Intendant was paid nearly as much, and a ſwarm of hungry leeches, engendered in the corruption of the court of Verſailles, at one and the ſame time ſucked the blood of the Corficans, and drained the treaſure of the mother country; in ſhort, like the conqueſts of more recent times, the ſubjugation of that iſland ſeems to have been achieved for no other purpoſe, than to gratify avarice, and ſatiate rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p>On the death of his friend, Charles Buonaparte, M. de Marhoeuf continued to patronize his family, and placed his ſecond ſon, Napoleone, the ſubject of theſe memoirs, at the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The advantage reſulting from this ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which has produced more great men than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Europe, were not loſt in young Buonaparte; he there applied himſelf with equal aſſiduity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to mathematics, and ſtudied the art of war as a regular ſcience. Born in the midſt of a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican ſtruggle, in his native land, it was his good fortune to burſt into manhood, at the moment when the country of his choice ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There was alſo ſomething in his manners and habits that announced him equal to the ſituation for which he ſeems to have been deſtined; inſtead of imitating the frivolity of the age, his mind was continually occupied by uſeful ſtudies; and from the Lives of Plutarch, a volume of which he always carried in his pocket, he learned, at an early age, to copy the manners, and emulate the actions, of antiquity.</p>

With this diſpoſition, it is but little wonder that he ſhould have dedicated his life to the profeſſion of arms. We accordingly find him, while yet a boy, preſenting himſelf as a candidate for a commiſſion in the artillery; and his ſucceſs equalled the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his friends, for he was the 12th on the liſt, out of the 36, who proved victorious in the conteſt. In conſequence of this event, he became a lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in the French army, and ſerved as ſuch during two or three years, in the regiment of <hi>La Fe e.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the ſecond expedition fitted out againſt Sardin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia, he embarked with his countrymen, and landed in the little iſland of Maddalena, which he took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of, for the French Republic; but finding the troops that had been got together for this expedition neither poſſeſſed organization, nor diſcipline, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the port of Ajaccio, whence he had ſet out.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, a ſcheme was forming for the annexation of Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Buonaparte had a difficult part to act upon this occaſion; he was perſonally attached to Paſquale Paoli; he reſented the treatment he experienced du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reign of the <hi>Terroriſts,</hi> and had actually drawn up, with his own hand, the remonſtrance tranſmitted by the Municipality of Ajaccio againſt the decree declaring the General an enemy to the Commonwealth. Indeed, he was ſuppoſed to be ſo intimately connected with him, that a warrant was actually iſſued by Lacombe de St. Michel, and the two other commiſſioners of the Convention, to arreſt young Buonaparte!—Notwithſtanding this, he was determined to remain faithful to his engagements, and learning that the Engliſh fleet, in the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean, had failed for the purpoſe of ſeizing his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive iſland, he embarked, along with his family, for the continent, and ſettled within eighteen leagues of Toulon.</p>

That town, the ſecond ſea-port in France, was at this moment in the poſſeſſion of the Engliſh, having been juſt ſeized upon by Admiral Lord Hood, who had ſubſtituted the Britiſh croſs in the place of the three-coloured flag. The military talents of the young Corſican were well known to Salicetti, who introduced him to Barras, to whom he afforded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable proof of the ſincerity of his profeſſions, at a period when ſuſpicion was juſtified by the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and frequent defections. He was accordingly advanced from the rank of Chief de Brigade, to that of General of Artillery, and directed, under General Dugommier, the attacks of the various re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts that ſurrounded and ſtrengthened this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant port, in which Collot de Herbois ſoon after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, "that he had found the galley-ſlaves alone, faithful to the Republic!"—It is almoſt needleſs to add, that the energy of the French troops, added to the ſcientific arrangements of the engineer, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the zeal and the reſiſtance of the motely garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and reſtored the key of the Mediterranean to France.</p>
               <p>The conqueſt of Toulon contributed not a little to raiſe the credit of Buonaparte; and it proved equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantageous to his friend Barras. That deputy had been alſo bred a military man, and was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his colleagues on all great energies. One of theſe ſoon occurred; this was the commotion among the ſections of Paris, known by the name of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Vendemaire.</hi> On this occaſion, he took care to be ſurrounded by able men, among them was General Buonaparte, whom he had inveſted with the command of the artillery, at the ſiege of Toulon. It was to another Corſican, however, that he confined the ſuperintendance of the army; this was Gentili who had juſt acquired a great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by his gallant defence of Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Auſtrian power in Italy, and added greatly to the reputation of the French arms. On this occaſion, a battalion of grenadiers bore down all before them, and reached the bridge of Lodi, ſhouting, "Long live the Republic!" but the dreadful fire kept up by the enemy having ſtopt their progreſs, Generals Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier, Maſſena, Cervoni, &amp;c. ruſhed forward; even their preſence would have proved ineffectual, had it not been for intrepidity of Buonaparte, who ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtandard from the hand of a ſubaltern, like Caeſar, on a ſimilar occaſion, placed himſelf in front, and antimating his ſoldiers by his actions and geſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations (for his voice was drowned in the noiſe of the cannon and muſketry) victory once more arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged herſelf under the Gallic banners.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this ſignal defeat, or rather ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of victories, Beaulieu was obliged to yield the palm to a younger rival, for he felt himſelf reduced to the neceſſity of retreating among the mountains of Tyrol, on which the French took poſſeſſion of the greater part of Lombardy, and acquired aſtoniſhing reſources, and immenſe magazines.</p>
               <p>After croſſing the Mincio, in the face of the Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians, the republican army entered Verona, which ſo lately had afforded an aſylum to one of the <hi>titular</hi> kings of France, and ſiezed on Pavia. Here a new and a more dreadful enemy attempted to ſtop the progreſs of the conquerers. It was Superſtition, clothed in cowls and ſurplices, brandiſhing a poniard in one hand, and a crucifix in the other; but the ſpeedy puniſhment of the prieſts and other adherents put an end to the inſurrection, and thus ſaved Buon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aparte and his army from a more eminent danger than they had as yet experienced, and from which no French army that has hitherto croſſed the Alps, has been exempt.</p>
               <p>At length, Mantua, alone, remained in poſſeſſion of the Auſtrians, and this alſo was ſoon inveſted by the victors, who, at the ſame time, made inroads into Tyrol, and, by the battle of Reveredo, and the poſſeſſion of Trent, became maſters of the paſſes that led to Vienna.</p>

                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:035113_0097_1000BECC898CC360"/>
In the mean time, the gallant Wurmſer determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhut himſelf up, with the remainder of his diſpirited troops, in Mantua; and the Auſtrians made one more grand effort, by means of General Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinzy, to reſcue his beſieged army, and regain their ancient preponderance in Italy. But the battle of Arcola completely diſappointed their expectations, and the capture of Mantua at one and the ſame time concluded the campaign and their humiliation.</p>
               <p>In the winter of 1796, General Buonaparte was united to Madame Beauharnois, a beautiful French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who had experienced a variety of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions during the time of Robeſpierre. Her former huſband had attained the rank of General in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Republic, and had always conducted himſelf as a friend of liberty. On that memorable day, when Louis XVI, and his family, repaired to Paris, M. de Beauharnois fat as preſident of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Aſſembly, exhibited great dignity of demeanor; notwithſtanding this, he fell a victim to the Terro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts, who, joining the narrow ideas of ſectariſts to the ferocious character peculiar to themſelves, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted all whoſe opinions were not exactly conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their own ſtandard.

               <p>The campaign of 1797 opened under the moſt auſpicious circumſtances for France, as well as Spain, who was now in alliance with her; Sardinia acted a ſubordinate part under her control; Tuſcany obeyed her requiſitions; Naples had concluded a ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arate peace, and Rome was at her mercy. In this ſituation, the eyes of the Court of Vienna, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of all Europe, were turned to the Archduke Charles, who was ſaid to inherit the military talents of the Houſe of Lorraine.

                     </gap>o,</hi> that unmans the ſex in order to deceive the ear, that cuts off population to gratify the momentary longings of a debauched appetite?</p>
               <p>It has been aſſerted by a reſpectable Traveller, that the deſcendants of a nation (the Greeks) which once enriched the world with the Arts and Sciences, and afforded the nobleſt monuments of human virtue and of human ſkill, notwithſtanding the cruel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading yoke of the Muſſelmans, ſhall call to mind the greatneſs of their anceſtors. We are aſſured, that they frequently boaſt that they are ſprung from thoſe Greeks who are no leſs memorable in arts than arms, and that they not only recapitulate the fears of their progenitors, but actually point out the ſcenes of their glory.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding very unfavourable appearances, this is alſo the caſe with ſome of the modern Romans. Among them, too, it muſt be remembered, firſt aroſe the independent little Republics of Europe; and the ſeeds of early liberty have not been entirely choked by the triple ſervitude of civil, religious, and foreign
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035113_0100_1000BED419EE9C60"/>
domination. And the foundations of a new Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic have lately been laid in a claſſic ſoil, and the names of Buonaparte, Maſſena, Cervoni, &amp;c. may ſerve to remind them, in ſome degree, of the Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſes, the Catos, and the Scipios of antiquity.</p>
               <p>General Maſſena is now about 40 years of age.—He was born in Nice, at a period when it appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Houſe of Savoy into whoſe ſervice he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered early in life. The reproach is not peculiar to the Court of Turin, that, without courtly protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, merit makes but flow progreſs. How many Officers of talents have we beheld in obſcurity, whilſt the ſon of a King, or the baſtard ſon of a Lord, has been lifted to high command and rich emoluments?—It was well obſerved by an Engliſh ſubaltern, that, "in order to attain a rapid promotion in the Engliſh army, he would rather be backed by a <hi>rotten borough</hi> than poſſeſs the talents of a Turenne!"</p>
               <p>Maſſena became an Enſign in the Sardinian army, and an Enſign he might have remained to this day, had he continued in that ſervice. But another deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny awaited him; he threw up his commiſſion, and entering into a French legion, his talents ſoon began to be diſtinguiſhed.—It was at the capture of Soſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pello that he firſt developed his military talents, and it was entirely owing to him, that Saorgio, in the campaign of 1794, yielded to the French arms. For this important ſervice he was made a General of Diviſion.</p>
               <p>When Buonaparte was appointed Commander in Chief in Italy, the local knowledge, the intrepidity, and military experience of Maſſena, pointed him out as an Officer every way capable of adding ſucceſs to his plans. Accordingly, we find him, in the ſpring of 1796, acting a brilliant part under the command of that wonderful General, at the battles of Monte Lezina and Monte Not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the war recommenced at the infraction of the treaty of Campo Formio by the Emperor, Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na was again called to the field; but, in the abſence of Baonaparte to command, and of Carnet to direct, the French armies, diſorganized and undiſciplined, were no longer ſucceſsful, and they loſt Italy as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly as they had gained it. But when Baonaparte returned from Egypt, and when Carnet again direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great and complicated machine of war, ſo powerful were their genius and their influence, that the republican arms again appeared in triumph!—Maſſena was the firſt and only General that gave a blow to the warlike <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, Mr. Jefferſon commenced a ſtudent at law under the guidance of Mr. Wythe, he venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge and Chancellor of Virginia.</p>
               <p>In 1766, Mr. Jefferſon came to the bar of the Supreme Court, and continued to practice with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and reputation until the commencement of the Revolution in 1774, and the conſequent concluſion of the Courts of Juſtice. During the period of his practice, his induſtrious mind ſound time to digeſt a volume of Reports of adjudged Caſes in the Supreme Courts of Virginia—a book that is admitted now to be a good authority, as it is an honourable evidence of his early labours and uſeful talents.</p>
               <p>In the year 1774, when all America was rouſed into action by the unconſtitutional claims of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Government, Mr. Jefferſon ſtepped forward a bold and able champion of his country's rights, and publiſhed his much admired pamphlet, entitled, "A ſummary View of the Rights of Britiſh America, addreſſed to the King," which brought againſt the writer threats of proſecution by Lord Dunmore, then Governor of Virginia—threats which produced no other effect on the independent mind of Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than publicly to avow himſelf the author, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to meet every conſequence.</p>
               <p>About this time, Mr. Jefferſon married the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Mr. Wayles, an eminent lawyer, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed much domeſtic felicity in the ſociety of one of the moſt amiable of women, till the year 1780, when by her death he became the mourner of her virtues,

and the guardian of two daughters and only ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iſſue, to whoſe education and ſettlement in life, he has ever ſince faithfully devoted himſelf, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining a widower.</p>
               <p>In the year 1775, Mr. J. was elected a member of the Virginian Convention; and, on the 4th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt in the ſame year, one of the members to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſtate (then colony) of Virginia.</p>
               <p>In the memorable year 1776, the natal year of American freedom and independence, Mr. Jefferſon was one of a Committee of Five, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Tho. Jefferſon, John Adams, Benj. Franklin, Roger Sherman, and R. Livingſton, appointed by Congreſs to draft the Declaration of Independence; and it was from the able pen and enlightened mind of Mr. Jefferſon, firſt named of the Committee, that ever-memorable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument proceeded, which was reported by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and unanimouſly adopted by Congreſs.</p>
               <p>In the ſame year, the ardent mind of Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, eagerly purſuing the glorious principles of the Revolution, and foreſeeing that ſo long as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Britiſh ſyſtems exiſted, we were inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent in name, but not in fact, produced for the adoption of the Legiſlature, the following Acts, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

               <p n="1">1. An Act to eſtabliſh religious Freedom.</p>

               <p n="4">4. An Act to eſtabliſh public Schools.</p>
               <p>The influence of theſe Acts upon the relative prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they embrace, will be ſeen and felt by all thoſe who prize Civil Liberty as a primary bleſſing—whilſt ſyſtems of univerſal toleration in matters of religion; for an equal diſtribution of property, and a ſubverſion of the unjuſt, ariſtocratical principle of of entail and primogeniture right; for ameliorating the ſanguinary code of criminal law; and for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the pooreſt of citizens the benefits of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation; muſt be viewed as the emanations of a great and good mind, zealouſly endeavouring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineſs of his fellow men.</p>

Equally evincive of a watchful regard for the rights of his countrymen, was his ſuggeſtion for the formation and adoption of the Conſtitution of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, in the ſame year, and for prefixing thereto "A Bill of Rights, declaratory of the natural and unalienable Rights of Man"—which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done.</p>
               <p>In the year 1778, Mr. Jefferſon being then a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Virginia Legiſlature, preſented to that body "An Act to prevent the importation of Slaves" which was enacted into a law, and was ſhortly after followed by another humane Act "to authorize Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umiſſions," being the commencement of a ſyſtem of gradual emancipation, alſo propoſed by him.</p>
               <p>In the year 1779, at the age of 36, Mr. Jefferſon was choſen Governor of Virginia, and continued in that office until June 1781, during which the State ſuffered by three invaſions, and was alſo brought into a critical condition reſpecting its boundary lines with Pennſylvania and North Carolina. His conduct in that ſtation, amidſt the jarring conflicts and trying difficulties of both foreign invaſion and domeſtic feuds, was ſuch, as ſecured to him, ſix months after he left the office, and upon the fulleſt enquiry, the unanimous thanks of the Legiſlature, then conſiſting of 180 members, for "his attentive adminiſtration of the powers of the Executive while in office."</p>
               <p>During the year 1781, amidſt the cares of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſcenes of private affliction, Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon prepared his celebrated work, which he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly ſtyled Notes on Virginia,<note n="*" place="bottom">Abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t the year 1797 or 8, when the political fervor of the country had been trepanned into a wrong bias by the arts of a certain Faction, and WAR was loudly recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by high authority, a rude and wanton attack was made upon Mr. Jefferſon, in Porcupine's <hi>British</hi> Gazette, by a Mr. Martin of Maryland, alledging that the celebrated ſtory of Logan was a fabrication calculated to injure the reputation of Capt. Creſſop, &amp;c.—r. Jefferſon, in an Appendix to his Notes, calmly inveſtigates all the circumſtances, and authenticates the fact. The calumny now recoils on the heads of theſe perſons who raſhly undertook the dirty work of a miſchievous Faction, in order to blacken the fair fame of Mr. Jefferſon.—See his Appendix.</note> In this work, ſo

juſtly admired for its philoſophical reſearch, ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous theory, and able diſquiſition, the author, in a ſuperior ſtrain of eloquence, boldly attacks and fully refutes the fallacious theories of Buffon and Raynal, which tended to diſparage both the man and the beaſt of America, and reduce them to an inferior ſcale with thoſe of Europe; and vindicating the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſtribution of Nature's bleſſings to this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent both in the animal and vegetable creation.</p>
               <p>In the year 1783, Mr. Jefferſon was again appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſeat in Congreſs from his native ſtate, and the the following year, on the 7th of May was nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that hon. body Miniſter Plenipotentiary of the United States to the Court of France, as the ſucceſſor of our illuſtrious Franklin, whither he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked early in the ſame year, and remained abſent from the United Sates, in the execution of the duties of that important truſt, until the month of October, 1789, when he returned home by permiſſion of the then Preſident, Waſhington, who, upon being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to the chief magiſtracy of the Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, immediately deſtined Mr. Jefferſon the next moſt honourable and confidential ſtation in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive government, near his own perſon.</p>
               <p>During his miſſion to France, Mr. Jefferſon, with that peculiar addreſs, intelligence and attention to promote the eſſential intereſts of the United States, which directs all his actions, obtained from the French King, an arrette, highly beneficial to the American commerce, for the free admiſſion, exempt from the cuſtomary foreign duties, of oil, fiſh and whalebone, the product of the American fiſheries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain ports, and for the ſale of American built ſhips in all the ports of France—benefits, which our Eaſtern brethren continued to reap the peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of, until the commencement of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary convulſions which have, unhappily, too long agitated that country.</p>

                  <pb n="92" facs="unknown:035113_0106_1000BEDFEC330488"/>
About the ſame period Mr. Jefferſon, in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with our immortal Franklin, negotiated with a Miniſter from the court of Pruſſia, then at Hague, that celebrated treaty known by the name of "The Pruſſian Treaty," in which an aſtoniſhed world has, for the firſt time, ſeen a public avowal and poſitive proviſion by treaty, between two ſovereign and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent nations, for the eſtabliſhment of thoſe two great and glorious principles, promotive of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal peace, and happineſs, to wit, 1ſt. "That free ſhips make free goods;" and, 2d. "That pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateering in the time of war be aboliſhed;" prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which it were to be wiſhed could be rendered univerſal and eternal. Mr. Adams now Preſident of the United States, was one of the commiſſion to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate this treaty, and on its completion, it was ſent over to London, where Mr. Adams then reſided as miniſter of the United States, for his ſignature. It is greatly to be regretted that Mr. Adams could not be content to retain to himſelf a ſhare of the glory which reflects on the authors of this celebrated treaty. But, unhappily for our country, ſince he became Preſident of the United States we have ſeen him nominate his ſon John Quincy Adams, as miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the court of Pruſſia, for the expreſs purpoſe, as declared, of renewing the treaty with that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which having been limited to continue in force for ten years only, had expired. Accordingly ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treaty has been made by his ſon with Pruſſia, which has been approved by a majority of the Senate and ratified by the Preſident, but which, inſtead of renewing and continuing the old treaty, is in itſelf a new one, expreſsly abandoning and renouncing the two ineſtimable principles, 1ſt. "That free ſhips make free goods," and 2d. "That privateering in time of war be aboliſhed;" principles which, it appears, from the correſpondence accompanying the negotiation, laid before the Senate of the United States by the Preſident, the wife and enlightened miniſters of the Pruſſian Monarch were brought, with great difficulty and reluctance, to abandon, on
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035113_0107_1000BEE202AEE3C0"/>
the earneſt ſolicitation and reiterated demand of the American negotiator, under the ſuggeſtion that the maritime powers, particularly Great Britain, would never ſanction or permit them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Of the allegations contained in the above paragraph, we do not ſpeak with abſolute preciſion—As in the colliſion of party views, and in the confuſion of ſelfiſh repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is difficult to diſcover the truth (and which, in ſpite of the greateſt political ſagacity, often depends on contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent circumſtances) it becomes us to be diffident.—The new Treaty, which contains 37 Articles, and is to continue another ten years, has lately been publiſhed, and is open to the impartial inveſtigation of the public.—If the King of Pruſſia obtains poſſeſſion of that great commercial city, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, the Treaty will be of more conſequence to America, than either Mr. Adams or his opponents at firſt imagined.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1789, Mr. Jefferſon being returned to the United States, and appointed by Preſident Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, Secretary to the department of State, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately entered on the arduous duties of that important ſtation, having previouſly ſtipulated with the Preſident, that, on conſideration of the many years abſence from his family and eſtate, he might be permitted at the expiration of the conſtitutional term for which the Preſident was elected, to retire from the public ſervice.</p>
               <p>The firſt reſult of the labours of Mr. Jefferſon in the department of ſtate, were exhibited to Congreſs in the following reports,—to wit,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A report on the fiſheries of the United States.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A report on coins, weights and meaſures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A report on the waſte and unappropriated land of the United States.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A report on privileges and reſtrictions on the commerce of the United States in foreign countries.</p>
               <p>Each of theſe reports diſplayed the uſual accuracy, information, and intelligence of the writer.</p>
               <p>But it was reſerved for a more critical and delicate period in the affairs of the United States, that the pre-eminent talents of the American Secretary ſhould become moſt conſpicuous, and intereſtingly uſeful to his country. The non-execution of the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035113_0108_1000BEE443F2CDA0"/>
treaty of peace with the United States, on the part of Great-Britain, her detention of our Weſtern poſts, and the attendant ſpoliations on our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, both by Great-Britain and France, then at war with each other, added to the <hi>intrigues</hi> of the Miniſter of the latter, Genet, all conduced to a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation difficult and perplexing. Beſides which, Spain continued to withhold from us the free navigation of the Miſſiſſippi, ſo eſſential to all Weſtern America. In this ſtate of things, the juſt confidence, which the diſcriminating mind of Waſhington, had repoſed in Mr. Jefferſon, was amply repaid, by the prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, zeal and ability, with which the American Secretary, contributed, by his labours, to relieve the executive from embarraſſment. Through a ſervice of maſterly and unequalled diplomatique correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which he maintained, at the ſame time, with the reſpective miniſters of Great-Britain and France, namely Hammond and Genet, he traverſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butted their reſpective cauſes of charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt the United States, and having fully proved the various aggreſſions and infractions of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the part of their reſpective governments, pointed to the means of preſerving the honour and maintaining the rights of his own country, whilſt, alike ſuperior to the intrigues of Great Britain or of France, he fully manifeſted that he held no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar attachment to any foreign nation, but was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared, with the deciſion, firmneſs and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of a true American, to oppoſe and reſiſt the aggreſſions of all. The recal of Genet; and appointment of his ſucceſſor, with the ſubſequent proceedings between the United States and France, the appointment of Mr. Jay, his treaty with Great Britain, and the recal of Mr. Hummond, the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. Liſton, and the ſubſequent proceeding with Great Britain, are all well known.</p>
               <p>In reſpect to Spain, the labours of Mr. Jefferſon were more immediately effective and complete. Having poſſeſſed the Commiſſioners of the United States then at Madrid, negotiatng a treaty with the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035113_0109_1000ACB08DDF3560"/>
Court of Spain, with the moſt ample and pointed inſtructions, and alſo of the form and proviſions of a treaty, predicated on the baſis of the free naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miſſiſſippi, it remained only for Mr. Thomas Pinckney, then Miniſter of the United States at London, under ſpecial inſtruction from the Preſident, and appointed Envoy for that purpoſe, to repair to Madrid, and ſeizing the favourable moment for effecting it, to accompliſh this deſirable work. This was accordingly done, with equal promptneſs and deciſion on his part, and jointly to that, and the labours of the American Secretary in the Cabinet, are the United States indebted for the moſt liberal, honourable, and beneficial treaty, they have ever yet entered into with a foreign nation.</p>
               <p>About this time, having, at the preſſing entreaty of the then Preſident, Waſhington, remained one year longer at the head of the department of ſtate, than he had before ſtipulated to do, he reſigned his office, and retired with the warmeſt thanks and regret of the Preſident, Waſhington, to his eſtate at Monticello, in Albemarle county, Virginia, where he continued for upwards of two years uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to enjoy the ſweets of domeſtic eaſe, and a reſpite from the fatigues of public life, following with avidity his favourite purſuits of philoſophical reſearch and agricultural improvement, until the voice of his Country again ſummoned him to the more active ſcenes of public duty, and placed him in nomination for the preſidential chair, as the ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of Waſhington. The iſſue of that election is well known, and but for a falſe return in one ſtate, and the ſuppreſſion of a return in another, Mr Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon would have been declared Preſident; as the returns however ſtood before Congreſs, it appears that he had 68 votes, and Mr. Adams 71, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the latter was declared Preſident, and the former Vice Preſident of the United States.</p>
               <p>The tongue of Party malice, which is never at reſt, and gives to every ſubject a malignant hue, perceiving Mr. Jefferſon's riſing popularity, in order
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035113_0110_1000BEE68E250090"/>
to prejudice the public mind, and to diſappoint his future election, brought forward a charge, that he was indebted to the Britiſh, and took meaſures to diſappoint his creditors. This charge has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed in a manner highly honourable to Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's character, by certain gentlemen in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, who took particular pains to inveſtigate the ſubject. Immediately after Mr. Jefferſon's arrival in Virginia, in the fall of 1789, he procured a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Agent and the gentlemen intereſted, and an amicable ſettlement was made in writing on the principles of his letter.<note n="*" place="bottom">Referring to a letter from Mr. Jefferſon, dated the 5th of January 1787, wherein he made amicable propoſals of ſettling and paying the demands againſt him, and which were accepted.—We are ſorry we have not room for this letter, as it does much honour to his feelings and principles, beſides ſhewing the diſtreſſed ſtate of the country during the revolutionary war.</note> Mr. Jefferſon AGAIN<note n="†" place="bottom">

                     </gap>eaning, that he had before paid the amount of the debt into the treaſury of Virginia, agreeably to the then law of that State, which firſt payment proved an entire loſs to Mr. Jefferſon!</note> ſold property to the amount of the debt, and, in the courſe of the firſt and ſecond years, delivered over the obligations received for it to the Agent, who took on himſelf the collection of the money—ſo that it is now ſeven or eight years ſince he paid the debt.</p>
               <p>But there was another claim made by the Agent of the houſe of Farrel and Jones againſt the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Mr. Wayles, and another for a cargo of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 4000l value, to be ſold on commiſſion, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the conſignees. Mr. Wayles aſſiſted in the ſale, but died ſoon after, when the whole collection ſurvived to the other conſignee, who received it, waſted it, and died a bankrupt. The Agent thought he would try the chance of recovering the money from the executors of Mr. Wayles, altho' he knew they had not received it; on the trial, 11 of the jury determined againſt the liability of the executors, but the 12th diſſenting, the caſe was laid over to the next Federal Court, when a ſecond jury unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035113_0111_1000BEE9389970E0"/>
concurred with the eleven of the firſt, and gave a verdict for the executors, agreeably to the opinions of Judge Iredell who preſided at one hearing, and of Judge Patterſon who preſided at the other.</p>
               <p>Perhaps there is no man in America better calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to fill the chair of ſtate than Mr. Jefferſon.—Few men who have travelled at all, have travelled with more advantage, and had a greater capacity of receiving improvement from this mode of it, than him. The genius of each nation, its particular cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and manners, and the great relative intereſts which regulated the policy of Courts, were ſubjects with which he was acquainted; and eminently fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, to fill a department, the peculiar organ of their communications. Controverſy, which ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently betrays the fallibility of the underſtanding, becauſe it begets intemperance, never makes him a victim to the deſigns of his opponent. He liſtens to his argument with ſcrupulous attention; draws new ſources of information from conflicting princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and, if he is animated at all, it is with the diſcovery of a new truth. There are, perhaps, few men better calculated always to triumph, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to leave upon the other's mind, at leaſt, the moſt favourable impreſſions, if not the moſt deciſive conviction. This is not difficult to account for, when applied to Mr. Jefferſon; becauſe few men, like him, deſerves the application. He never hazards an opinion without the authority of experience, and the conviction of reaſon. Travel and obſervation have matured the one, and extenſive application and reflection, have invigorated the other. His princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, therefore, convey the ſtrongeſt impreſſions, which he inforces by logical deduction and mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical preciſion, drawing from an expanded intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that ſeparates, with infinite facility, the purity of Truth from the groſſer materials of Error.</p>
               <p>Diſdaining the character of the Courtier, where puſillanimity and flattery are the ſteps by which the obſequious ariſe to diſtinction, Mr. Jefferſon has fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the higheſt offices of government, by his own
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035113_0112_1000BEEB872F7658"/>
intrinſic merit. The ſimplicity of his manners, and the reſervedneſs of his temper, are the characteriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics of a vigorous mind, which graſps at higher ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects than the mere arts of pleaſing. Yet there is no man in private life, more amiable, none more dignified, and none whoſe manners, poſſeſs, in a higher degree, the incomparable felicity of inſpiring the combined emotions of attachment and reſpect. He has contemplated men and things in the different lights in which they are, and in which they ſhould be. His reflections on this ſubject, are the ſources of his humanity and forbearance; qualifications which travel, buſineſs, and books, have matured into practice, and given to his mind a degree of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical tranquility—But let not this placidity of temper, be miſtaken for coldneſs of apprehenſion. He poſſeſſes an underſtanding, capable of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with intrepidity, when great objects demand its energy. The American Declaration of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, his negotiations in ſeveral of the moſt ſubtle cabinets of Europe, and his communications with the <hi>intriguing</hi> Miniſters of France and England, while Secretary of Sate, will remain the durable memorials of a great mind, at once capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining the various qualifications of energy, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and deliberate coolneſs.</p>
               <p>It has been ſneeringly ſaid, "O, Mr. Jefferſon is a Philoſopher,"—meaning, that from the habits of his life, he is unfit to be the Chief Magiſtrate of an active, mixed, extended community.—If Mr. J. had all his days been ſecluded in a cloſet or a cloyſter, the inſinuation might not be improper—We have ſhewn the contrary; that, to the attainments of a Scholar, and the accompliſhments of a Gentleman, he adds the neceſſary qualifications of a Stateſman, "one well acquainted with the world and its ways"—But we do not believe that Mr. J. himſelf ever ſaid he was a Philoſopher; he knows too well the vaſt dignity of the character; he is too modeſt and too ſenſible a man, to take upon himſelf a title which requires a rare aſſemblage of all the exalted qualities
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035113_0113_1000ACB8F609CD20"/>
of the human mind, united to all the poſſible attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of human learning.—We believe Mr. J. is not of the NEW Philoſophy, the jargon of the day, that vague, undefined jumble of words, which pulls down every ſyſtem, whether moral or religions, and ſets up nothing in their place, leaving the poor wanderer in a wilderneſs, and depriving ſociety itſelf of a guide!—Nor of that old, cold-blooded, machiavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Philoſophy, which, under the ſemblance of "political ſyſtem," connects immorality, fraud, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and tyranny, ſacrificing, on the altar of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, the liberty of nations, and the felicity of millions!<note n="*" place="bottom">Amongſt many others, Louis XIV. of France, and Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick of Pruſſia, are notable inſtances of this ſort of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy; perhaps the late Catherine of Ruſſia excelled both theſe kingly gentlemen.—It is almoſt needleſs to remark, that the French revolution has begotten a hoſt of <hi>political</hi> phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers on both ſides of the queſtion—Robeſpierre ſet out on the NEW ſcheme, and a bloody uſe he made of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, however, he meanly ſkulked from one ſcheme to the other, and both of them failed him.—Amongſt many others, poor Miſs Wolſtoncraft fell a victim to the deluding ideas of the <hi>new</hi> Philoſophy.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Our readers know the iſſue of the late election; that a decided majority of the people of America has given their voice for Mr. Jefferſon to be Preſident of the Federal Government of the 16 States.—At the moment that this ſheet is going to preſs, the people of America are waiting in anxious, awful ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, to ſee whether the preſent Congreſs will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incide with or oppoſe their choice.</p>

[At the requeſt of a Correſpondent, we inſert the following extract from Mr. Jefferſon's "Notes on Virginia." It is that part of them which has been the ſubject of ſo much cavil and criticiſm; which has given ſo much offence to <hi>tender</hi> conſciences, and which has been ſo greedily ſnatched at by the diſciples of the <hi>new</hi> Philoſophy—We therefore deem it a neceſſary accompanyment to an account of that Gentleman's life and character.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we believe that many of the remarks made upon this portion of Mr. Jefferſon's Notes have come from pious and well-meaning men, we muſt at the ſame time obſerve, that the groſſeſt and moſt illiberal ſtrictures have been made by others from <hi>political</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> motives, as was fully evidenced pending the late election.—It is thus that true Religion is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured; the ſpiritual affairs of the other world are dragged into the temporary concerns of this—it is thus that Religion is thrown out as a tub to the whale, in order to deceive and miſlead the unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multitude!</p>
               <p>To that part of the extract which appears moſt objectionable, our Correſpondent has ſubjoined a note of obſervation, which we inſert verbatim.]</p>

                  <p>In anſwer to the queſtion, What religion is in the ſtate of Virginia?—Mr. Jefferſon proceeds thus:</p>
                  <p>"The preſent ſtate of our laws on the ſubject of Religion is this. The Convention of May 1776, in their Declaration of Rights, declared it to be a truth, and a natural right, <hi>that the exerciſe of Religion ſhould be free;</hi> but when they proceeded to form on that declaration the ordinance of government, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of taking up every principle declared in the Bill of Rights, and guarding it by legiſlative ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they paſſed over that which aſſerted our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rights, leaving them as they found them. The ſame Convention, however, when they met as a member of the general aſſembly in October 1776, repealed all Acts of Parliment which had rendered criminal
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035113_0115_1000BEEFB408A208"/>
the maintaining any opinions in matters of religion, the forbearing to repair to church, and the exerciſing any mode of worſhip; and ſuſpended the laws giving ſalaries to the Clergy, which ſuſpenſion was made perpetual in October 1779. Statutory oppreſſions in religion being thus wiped away, we remain at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent under thoſe only impoſed by the common law, or by our own Acts of Aſſembly. At the common law, <hi>Hereſy</hi> was a capital offence, puniſhable by burning. Its definition was left to the eccleſiaſtical judges, before whom the conviction was, till the ſtatute of the 1 Eliz. c. 1. circumſcribed it, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, "That nothing ſhould be deemed <hi>Hereſy,</hi> but what had been ſo determined by authority of the Canonical Scriptures, or by one of the four firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, or by ſome other Council having for the grounds of their declaration the expreſs and plain words of the Scriptures." Hereſy, thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed, being an offence at the common law, our act of aſſembly of 1777, c. 17, gives cognizance of it to the General Court, by declaring, that the juriſdiction of that Court, ſhall be general in all matters at the common law. The execution is by the writ <hi>De Hoeretico comburendo.</hi> By our own act of Aſſembly of 1705, c. 30, if a perſon brought up in the Chriſtian religion denies the being of a God, or the Trinity, or aſſerts there are more Gods than one, or denies the Chriſtian religion to be true, or the Scriptures to be of divine authority, he is puniſhable on the firſt offence by incapacity to hold any office or employment eccleſiaſtical, civil, or military; on the ſecond by diſability to ſue, to take any gift or legacy, to be guardian, executor, or adminiſtrator, and by three years impriſonment, without bail. A father's right to the cuſtody of his own children being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in law on his right of guardianſhip, this being taken away, they may of courſe be ſevered from him, and put, by the authority of a court, into more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox hands.</p>
                  <p>"This is a ſummary view of that Religious Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, under which a people have been willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

who have laviſhed their lives and fortunes for the eſtabliſhment of their civil freedom. The error ſeems not ſufficiently eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are ſubject to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have authority over ſuch natural rights only as we have ſubmitted to them. The rights of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we never ſubmitted, we could not ſubmit. We are anſwerable for them to our God. The legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate powers of Government extend to ſuch acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbour to ſay, there are twenty Gods, or no God;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>It ſometimes happens, that even the beſt Writers, in their endeavours to eſtabliſh a fact, or illuſtrate a principle, urge too much, and overſhoot their mark.—With great def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence to the highly reſpectable Author of the Notes on Virginia, I think the above paſſage a proof of the remark—nay more, it appears to me a very objectionable one; and I do not wonder at its giving offence to pious minds, and of being made the ground-work of much cenſure and miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.—After the knowledge he now has of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, does Mr. Jefferſon really think, that the man who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in no God, is as good, or as uſeful a member of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, as he who believes in one, or three, or twenty Gods?—Mr J. is too dignified a character to make a needleſs play upon words, of "picking pockets, or of breaking legs—but it may eaſily be imagined, and experience confirms the fact, that the man who diſbelieves all Leity, and who has diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf of all moral and religious obligations, would not only pick pocket<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I could ſay much more on this ſubject, Mr. Editor, if you would give me room—but the poſition is ſo very plain and demonſtrative, that it requires no ingenuity to ſupport it—I therefore conclude with only remarking, that in a book which is ſo ably and laudably calculated to vindicate and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the noble principles of Civil and Religious Liberty, I am ſorry to ſee ſuch a paſſage; and I cannot help thinking, that the cool judgement and mature experience of the writer muſt now make him wiſh, that it never had appeared among his Notes.</p>

It may fix him obſtinately in his errors, but will not cure them. Reaſon and free enquiry are the only effectual agents againſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Give a looſe to them, they will ſupport the true religion, by bringing every falſe one to their tribunal, to the teſt of their inveſtigation. They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, Chriſtianity could never have been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Had not free enquiry been indulged, at the aera of the Reformation, the corruptions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity could not have been purged away. If it be reſtrained now, the preſent corruptions will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and new ones encouraged. Was the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to preſcribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in ſuch keeping as our ſouls are now. Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as an article of medicine, and the potatoe as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of food. Government is juſt as infallible too when it fixes ſyſtems in phyſics. Galileo was ſent to the Inquiſition for affirming that the earth was a ſphere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This error however at length prevailed, the earth became a globe, and Deſcartes declared it was whirled round on its axis by a vortex. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which he lived was wiſe enough to ſee that this was no queſtion of civil juriſdiction, or we ſhould all have been involved by authority in vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In fact, the vortices have been exploded, and the Newtonian principle of gravitation is now more firmly eſtabliſhed, on the baſis of Reaſon, than it would be were the government to ſtep in, and to make it an article of neceſſary faith.

                  <head>COPY of a LETTER from Mr. JEFFERSON to a Gentleman in Berkley County, dated Monticello, 4th Sept. 1800.</head>
                  <p>"SIR,—Your favour of Auguſt 26th, has been duly received, and is entitled to my thankfulneſs for the perſonal conſiderations you are pleaſed to expreſs in it. How far the meaſure propoſed might have the expected effect, you can beſt judge; however, in the great exerciſe of right in which the Citizens of America are about to act, I have on mature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſeen, that it is my duty to be paſſive. The intereſts which they have at ſlake are entitled to their whole attention, unbiaſſed by perſonal eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem or local conſiderations; and I am far from the preſumption of conſidering myſelf equal to the awful duties of the firſt magiſtracy of this country. That there ſhould be differences of opinion among our fellow-citizens, is to be expected always. Men who think freely, and have the right of expreſſing their thoughts, will differ, It is true that theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences have of late been artificially increaſed; but they are now again ſubſiding to their natural level, and all will ſoon come right if no acts of violence intervene. The great queſtion which divides our citizens is, whether it is ſafeſt that a preponderance of power ſhould be lodged with the monarchical, or the republican branch of our Government?—Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary panics may produce advocates for the former opinion, even in this country; but the opinion will be as ſhort-lived as the panic with the great maſs of our fellow-citizens. There is one circumſtance which will always bring them to rights: a prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of the executive over the legiſlative branch cannot be maintained but by immenſe patronage, by multiplying offices, making them very lucrative, by armies, navies, &amp;c. which may enliſt on the ſide of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035113_0119_1000BEF906F80308"/>
the patron all thoſe whom he can intereſt, and all their families and connexions; but theſe expences muſt be paid by the labouring citizen; <hi>he</hi> cannot long continue, therefore, the advocate of opinions, which, to ſay only the leaſt of them, doom the labouring Citizen to toil and ſweat for uſeleſs pageants.</p>
                  <p>"I ſhould be unfaithful to my own feelings were I not to lay, that it has been the greateſt of all human conſolations to me, to be conſidered by the republican portion of my fellow-citizens as the ſafe depoſitary of their rights. The firſt wiſh of my heart is, to ſee them ſo guarded as to be ſafe in any hands, and not to depend on the perſonal diſpoſition of the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitary: and I hope this to be practicable as long as the people retain the ſpirit of freedom. When that is loſt, all experience has ſhewn, that no forms can keep them free againſt their own will. But that corrupt ſtate of mind muſt be very diſtant in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where, for ages to come, unoccupied ſoil will ſtill offer itſelf to thoſe who wiſh to reap for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what themſelves have ſown.</p>

               <head>Mr. BURR.</head>
               <p>AARON BURR was born at Fairfield; he was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated at Princeton College, New Jerſey, of which ſeminary his father was Preſident. In the year 1775, when he was at the age of 25, he was made Aid de Camp to General Putnam, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf in ſo eminent a manner as an able Officer, that he was ſelected by General Waſhington to be Lieu. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Col. of one of the 12 additional Regiments. Through the whole of the war, he was diſtinguiſhed by the ſame ardent devotion to the principles of Liberty, the ſame courage and judgement, which mark his character at this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="unknown:035113_0120_1000BEFB95F24940"/>
At the reſtoration of peace, having exhauſted an ample patrimony in the ſervice of his Country, Mr. Burr found himſelf compelled to the profeſſion of the Law as the means of ſubſiſtence. Here, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the competition of Mr. Hamilton and other gentlemen of great talents in New York, he ſoon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an high reputation; and the rapid fortune he acquired from an extenſive practice, declared the favourable opinion of his fellow citizens. Poſſeſſed once more of an independent fortune, he forſook the troubleſome occupation of an Advocate, for one more ſuited to his inclination, and better adapted to the diſplay of his talents. He entered the Legiſlature of New York, then became a Senator of the U. States, and in both places he was equally reſpectable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways patriotic.</p>
               <p>Endowed with a mind firm, liberal, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, America can claim but few citizens as fit as Mr. Burr to be placed as a ſecond in the government of the country. With an energy and deciſion of character peculiar to himſelf, while other men are debating, he reſolves; while they think, he acts.—His manners are amiable, his reputation unblemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He has overthrown the dangerous influence of <hi>Foreigners</hi> in the ſtate of New York; and, in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his highly reſpectable compeer Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is hoped, that they will baniſh it from the national councils altogether, leaving America to be governed by its own Citizens.—In ſhort, Mr. Burr is an uniform, conſiſtent, tried Republican.</p>
               <p>We conclude this ſhort account of Mr. Burr, with giving a place to the following extract of a letter written by him to a Member of Congreſs, when he learned that it was probable the votes would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual for Mr. Jefferſon and himſelf, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Congreſs in particular, and America in general, that he diſclaimed all idea of conteſting the poſt of honour with that Gentleman.—The letter reflects much credit on Mr. Burr, and muſt raiſe him ſtill higher in the eſtimation of his fellow citizens.</p>

            <p>The political ſtorm, which lately raged with ſo much violence, has at length happily ſubſided.—The two Parties have tried their ſtrength, and ſucceſs has crowned the efforts of the Republicans in the election of THOMAS JEFFERSON.</p>
            <p>To Republicans it muſt be a cauſe of ſincere feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, that their Country has ſurmounted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other agitation than that of public ſentiment, the choice of their Firſt Magiſtrate—The example is auſpicious to the deſtinies of the world—Whilſt other nations, the victims of Monarchical power, or Ariſtocratical ambition, on ſimilar occaſions, appeal to the ſword, America preſents the auguſt ſpectacle of a great people reſorting only to argument, and to republican principles.</p>
            <p>On ſuch a reſult as this, every friend to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, every true American, will reflect with high ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction—Beholding in the ſyſtem of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, founded on the right of general ſuffrage, the ſource and ſtrength of his political freedom, he will rejoice to behold the confirmations of experience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting new ſtability to the republican ſtructure.—And while he mourns over the tottering ruins of European ſyſtems and ſtates, and over the miſeries of the nations of the old world, he will, with proud

philanthrophy, preſent his own ſyſtem to them as a cure for all their evils.</p>
            <p>On this great occaſion, it is the duty of every friend to republican Liberty, to ſupport the cauſe with gentleneſs and equanimity—Having the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral welfare at heart, and ſuperior to the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſonal motives, whilſt his joy is animated, let it be rational and unalloyed with party reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—Let him hold out the hand of friendſhip to his neighbour, of whatever opinion or country, and ſay, <q>I reſpect virtue and talent wherever they are found; come, let us live in fellowſhip; let every man ſtrive to deſerve well of the Country, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remembering the important maxim, <hi>United we ſtand, divided we fall.</hi>—</q>

               <p>PARIS, Oct. 2, 1800. Yeſterday a treaty of Amity and Commerce between the French Republic and the United States of America, was ſigned by the three French Miniſters on one ſide, and by three American Commiſſioners on the other—reſtoring, we hope, a ſyſtem of Concord between the two countries, which, as Republics, ought never to be at variance.</p>
               <p>Oct. 6.—Citizen Joſeph Buonaparte, Preſident of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Miniſters Plenipotentiary charged to negociate with the Miniſters Plenipotentiary of the Un. States of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, gave a moſt ſplendid entertainment to theſe Miniſters, on the 3d inſt. at Morfontaine, to celebrate the return of an amicable underſtanding between the two Republics. There were preſent the three Conſuls, all the Miniſters and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Corps Diplomatique, the Counſellors of State. &amp;c. and ſeveral gentlemen friends to America, among whom we obſerved General La Fayette.</p>
               <p>At 6 o'clock, the Miniſter for foreign affairs delivered to the Firſt Conſul, a copy of the Convention, which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by a diſcharge of cannon. The dinner conſiſted of 180 covers, ſerved on three tables in three halls communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with each other. The firſt was the <hi>Hall of Union;</hi> the ſecond and third bore the names of <hi>Franklin</hi> and <hi>Washington,</hi> and were ornamented with the buſts of theſe illuſtrious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. The firſt hall, however, was the moſt brilliantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated, preſenting emblamatic devices of all the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable events of the American Revolution.</p>
               <p>After dinner, ſeveral toaſts were drank. The Firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul gave, "To the manes of the French and Americans who died in battle for the independence of the new world."</p>
               <p>The Conſul Cambaceres gave, "To the ſucceſſor of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington."</p>
               <p>The Conſul Lebrun gave, "To the union of America with the Powers of the North, to enforce reſpect to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Seas."</p>
               <p>After dinner were fire-works emblematic of the occaſion, which were ſucceeded by a concert, and that was followed by a ſpectacle, which cloſed the buſineſs of the night.</p>
               <p>On the 12th, about mid-day, the American Miniſters took leave of the Chief Conſul, to whom they were preſented by the Miniſter of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Elſworth, in the name of his colleagues ſaid, "that he hoped the Convention would prove the baſis of a laſting friendſhip between France and America;" and Mr. Murray added, "that the American Miniſters would neglect nothing to promote this deſirable
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035113_0124_1000BF00B7717F28"/>
object." The Chief Conſul anſwered, "that the differences between the two nations being adjuſted, there ſhould no longer remain any trace of them; that the liberal principles, with regard to navigation, conſidered in the Convention, ought to be the baſis of a growing intimacy; and that, in the preſent circumſtances, it was more than ever the intereſt of the two nations cloſely to adhere to them."</p>
               <p>The Miniſter of war to the Maritime Prefects.</p>
               <p>"I make haſte to inform you, Citizens, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Amity and Commerce between the French and American Republics, has juſt been ſigned by the Miniſters Plenipotentiary of France and the American Commiſſioners.—I pray you to communicate this news immediately to the military Officers of the Adminiſtration, as well as to the Commerce of your City.</p>

And this paſſport will be ſufficient without any other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ordinance to the contrary notwithſtanding; which paſſport ſhall not be deemed requiſite to have been renewed or recalled, whatever number of voyages the ſaid ſhip may have made, unleſs ſhe ſhall have returned home within the ſpace of a year. Proof with reſpect to the cargo ſhall be certificates, containing the ſeveral particulars of the cargo, the place whence the ſhip ſailed and whither ſhe is bound, ſo that the forbidden and contraband goods may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the certificates; which certificates ſhall have been made out by the officers of the place whence the ſhip ſet ſail, in the accuſtomed form of the country. And if ſuch paſſport or certificates, or both, ſhall have been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by accident, or taken away by force, their deficiency may be ſupplied by ſuch other proofs of ownerſhip, as are admiſſible by the general uſage of nations. Proof with reſpect to other than merchant ſhips, ſhall be the commiſſion they bear.</p>
               <p>This article ſhall take effect from the date of the ſignature of the preſent Convention. And if, from the date of the ſaid ſignature, any property ſhall be condemned contrary to the intent of the ſaid Convention, before the knowledge of this ſtipulation ſhall be obtained, the property ſo condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall without delay be reſtored or paid for.</p>
               <p>V. The debts contracted by one of the two nations with individuals of the other, or by the individuals of one with the individuals of the other, ſhall be paid, or the payment may be proſecuted in the ſame manner as if there had been no miſunderſtanding between the two States. But this clauſe ſhall not extend to indemnities claimed on account of captures or confiſcations.</p>
               <p>VI. Commerce between the parties ſhall be free. The veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the two nations and their privateers, as well as their prizes, ſhall be treated in the reſpective ports as thoſe of the nation the moſt favoured; and, in general, the two parties ſhall enjoy in the ports of each other, in regard to commerce and navigation, the privileges of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured nation.</p>
               <p>VII. The citizens and inhabitants of the United States ſhall be at liberty to diſpoſe, by teſtament, donation or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, of their goods, movable and immovable, holden in the territory of the French Republic in Europe, and the citizens of the French Republic ſhall have the ſame liberty with regard to goods, moveable and immovable, holden in the territory of the United States, in favour of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as they ſhall think proper. The citizens and inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of either of the two countries, who ſhall be heirs of goods, moveable or immovable, in the other, ſhall be able to ſucceed <hi>ab intesttao,</hi> without being obliged to obtain letters of

naturalization, and without having the effect of this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion conteſted or impeded, under any pretext whatever; and the ſaid heirs, whether ſuch by particular title, or <hi>ab intestato,</hi> ſhall be exempt from every duty whatever in both countries. It is agreed that this article ſhall in no manner derogate from the laws which either ſtate may now have in force, or may hereafter enact, to prevent emigration; and alſo that in caſe of the laws of either of the two ſtates ſhould reſtrain ſtrangers from the exerciſe of the rights of property with reſpect to real eſtate, ſuch real eſtate may be ſold, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſed of, to citizens or inhabitants of the country where it may be, and the other nation ſhall be at liberty to enact ſimilar laws.</p>
               <p>VIII. To favour commerce on both ſides, it is agreed, that, in caſe a war ſhould break out between the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which God forbid, the term of ſix months after the declaration of war ſhall be allowed to the merchants and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther citizens and inhabitants, reſpectively, on one ſide and the other, during which time they ſhall be at liberty to withdraw themſelves with their effects and moveables, which they ſhall be at liberty to carry, ſend away or ſell, as they pleaſe, without the leaſt obſtruction; nor ſhall their effects, much leſs their perſons, be ſeized during ſuch term of ſix months, on the contrary paſſports which ſhall be valid for a time neceſſary for their return, ſhall be given to them for their veſſels, and the effects which they ſhall be willing to ſend away, or carry with them; and ſuch paſſports ſhall be a ſafe conduct againſt all inſults and prizes which privateers may attempt againſt their perſons and effects. And if any thing be taken from them, or any injury done to them or their effects, by one of the parties, their citizens or inhabitants, within the term above preſcribed, full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhall be made to them on that account.</p>
               <p>IX. Neither the debts due from individuals of the one nation to individuals of the other, nor ſhares. nor monies, which they may have in public funds, or in the public or private banks, ſhall ever, in any event of war, or of nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al difference, be ſequeſtered or confiſcated.</p>
               <p>X. It ſhall be free for the two contracting parties to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point commercial agents for the protection of trade, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in France and the United States. Either party may except ſuch place as may be thought proper, from the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of theſe agents. Before any agent ſhall exerciſe his function, he ſhall be accepted in the uſual forms by the party to whom he is ſent; and when he ſhall have been accepted and furniſhed with his exequatur, he ſhall enjoy the rights and prerogatives of the ſimilar agents of the moſt favoured nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:035113_0128_1000BF06EB375EA8"/>
XI. The citizens of the French Republic ſhall pay in the ports, havens, roads, countries, iſlands, cities and towns of the United States, no other, or greater duties or impoſts, of what nature ſoever they may be, or by what name ſoever called than thoſe which the nations moſt favoued are, or ſhall be obliged to pay; and they ſhall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities and exemptions in trade, navigation and commerce, whether, in paſſing from one port in the ſaid ſtates to another, or in going to and from the ſame from and to any part of the world, which the ſaid nations do or ſhall enjoy. And the citizens of the United States ſhall reciprocally enjoy in the territory of French Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public in Europe, the ſame privileges and immunities, as well for their property and perſons, as for what concerns trade, navigation and commerce.</p>
               <p>XII. It ſhall be lawful for the citizens of either country to ſail with their ſhips and merchandize (contraband goods always excepted) from any port whatever to any port of the enemy of the other, and to ſail and trade with their ſhips and merchandize, with perfect ſecurity and liberty, from the countries and ports, and places of thoſe who are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of both, or of either party, without any oppoſition or diſturbance whatſoever, and to paſs not only directly from the places and ports of the enemy aforementioned, to neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral ports and places, but alſo from one place belonging to an enemy, whether they be under the juriſdiction of the ſame power, or under ſeveral; unleſs ſuch ports or places ſhall be actually blockaded, beſieged, or inveſted.</p>
               <p>And whereas it frequently happens, that veſſels ſail for a port or place bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nging to an enemy, without knowing that the ſame is either beſieged, blockaded, or inveſted, it is agreed that every veſſel, ſo circumſtanced, may be turned away from ſuch port or place, but ſhall not be detained, nor any part of her cargo, if not contraband, be confiſcated, unleſs, after notice of ſuch blockade or inveſtment, ſhe ſhall again attempt to enter: but ſhe ſhall be permitted to go to any other port or place ſhe ſhall think proper. Nor ſhall any veſſel of either, that may have entered into ſuch port or place before the ſame was actually beſieged, blockaded, or inveſted by the other, be reſtrained from quitting ſuch place with her cargo, nor if found therein after the reduction and ſurrender of ſuch place, ſhall ſuch veſſel or her cargo be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to confiſcation, but they ſhall be reſtored to the owners thereof.</p>
               <p>XIII. In order to regulate what ſhall be deemed contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of war, there ſhall be compriſed under that denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gunpowder, ſaltpetre, petards; match, ball, bombs, grenades, carcaſſes, pikes, ſwords, belts, piſtols, holtſters, cavalry ſaddles and furniture, cannon, mortars, their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035113_0129_1000ACCCCC51EA58"/>
and beds, and generally all kinds of arms, ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of war, and inſtruments ſit for the uſe of troops; all the above articles, whenever they are deſtined to the port of an enemy, are hereby declared to be contraband, and juſt objects of confiſcation; but the veſſels in which they are laden, and the reſidue of the cargo ſhall be conſidered free, and not in any manner infected by the prohibited goods, whether belonging to the ſame, or a different owner.</p>
               <p>XIV. It is hereby ſtipulated, that free ſhips ſhall give a freedom to goods, and that every thing ſhall be deemed to be free and exempt, which ſhall be found on board the ſhips belonging to the citizens of either of the contracting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, although the whole lading, or any part thereof, ſhould appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods being always excepted. It is alſo agreed, in like manner, that the ſame liberty be extended to perſons who are on board a free ſhip, with this effect, that although they be enemies to either party, they are not to be taken out of that free ſhip, unleſs they are ſoldiers and in actual ſervice of the enemy.</p>
               <p>XV. On the contrary, it is agreed, that whatever ſhall be found to be laden by the citizens of either party on any ſhip belonging to the enemies of the other, or their citizens, ſhall be confiſcated without diſtinction of goods, contraband or not contraband, in the ſame manner as if it belonged to the enemy, except ſuch goods and merchandize as were put on board ſuch ſhip before the declaration of war, or even after ſuch declaration, if ſo be it were done without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch declaration; ſo that the goods of the citizens of either party whether they be of the nature of ſuch as are prohibited, or otherwiſe, as is aforeſaid, were put on board any ſhip belonging to an enemy before the war, or after the declaration without delay to the proprietors demanding the ſame, but ſo as that if the ſaid merchandizes be contraband, it ſhall not be any ways lawful to carry them afterwards to any ports belonging to the enemy.</p>
               <p>The two contracting parties agree, that the term of two months being paſſed after the declaration of war, their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective citizens, from whatever part of the world they come, ſhall not plead the ignorance mentioned in this article.</p>
               <p>XVI. The merchant ſhips belonging to the citizens of either of the contracting parties, which ſhall be bound to a port of the enemy of one of the parties, and concerning whoſe voyage, and the articles of their cargo, there ſhall be juſt grounds of ſuſpicion, ſhall be obliged to exhibit, as well upon the high ſeas as in the ports or roads, not only their paſſports, but likewiſe their certificates, ſhewing that their goods are not of the quality of thoſe which are ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be contrband in the thirteenth article of the preſent Convention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:035113_0130_1000ACFCF58A0248"/>
XVII. And that captures on light ſuſpicions may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided aud injuries thence ariſing prevented, it is agreed that when one party ſhall be engaged in war, and the other, party be neuter, the ſhips of the neutral party ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with paſſports ſimilar to that deſcribed in the fourth Article, that it may appear thereby that the ſhips really belong to the citizens of the neutral party; they ſhall be valid for any number of voyages, but ſhall be renewed every year, that is, if the ſhip happens to return home in the ſpace of a year. If the ſhips are laden, they ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided not only with the paſſports above mentioned, but alſo with certificates ſimilar to thoſe deſcribed in the ſame article, ſo that it may be known whether they carry any contraband goods. No other paper ſhall be required, any uſage or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the contrary notwithſtanding. And if it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the ſaid certificates that there are contraband goods on board, the ſhips ſhall be permitted to proceed on their voyage. If it ſhall appear from the certificates, that there are contraband goods on board any ſuch ſhip, and the commander of the ſame ſhall offer to deliver them up, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſhall be accepted, and the ſhip ſhall be at liberty to purſue its voyage, unleſs the quantity of the contraband goods be greater than can conveniently be received on board the ſhip of war or privateer, in which caſe the ſhip may be carried into port for the delivery of the ſame.</p>
               <p>If any ſhip ſhall not be furniſhed with ſuch paſſport or certificates as above required for the ſame, ſuch caſe may be examined by a proper judge or tribunal, and if it ſhall appear from other documents or proofs, admiſſible by the uſage of nations, that the ſhip belongs to the citizens of the neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral party, it ſhall not be confiſcated, but ſhall be releaſed with her cargo (contraband goods excepted) and be permitted to proceed on her voyage.</p>
               <p>If the maſter of a ſhip, named in the paſſport, ſhould happen to die or be removed by any other cauſe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put in his place, the ſhip and cargo ſhall nevertheleſs be equally ſecure, and the paſſport remain in full force.</p>
               <p>XVIII. If the ſhips of the citizens of either of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall be met with, either failing along the coaſts, or on the high ſeas, by any ſhip of war or privateer of the other; for the avoiding of any diſorder, the ſaid ſhips of war or privateers ſhall remain out of cannon ſhot, and may ſend their boats on board the ſhip which they ſhall ſo meet with, and may enter her to the number of two or three men only, to whom the maſter or commander of ſuch ſhip ſhall exhibit his paſſport concerning the property of the ſhip, made out according to the form preſcribed in the fourth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. And it is expreſsly agreed that the neutral party ſhall in no caſe be required to go on board the examining
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035113_0131_1000ACD3E5039218"/>
veſſel for the purpoſe of exhibiting his papers, or for any other examination whatever.</p>
               <p>XIX. It is expreſsly agreed by the two contracting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the ſtipulations above mentioned, relative to the conduct to be obſerved on the ſea by the cruiſers of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligerent party towards the ſhips of the neutral party, ſhall be applied only to ſhips ſailing without convoy, and when the ſaid ſhips ſhall be convoyed, it being the intention of the parties to obſerve all the regard due to the protection of the flag diſplayed by public ſhips, it ſhall not be lawful to viſit them, but the verbal declaration of the commander of the convoy, that the ſhips he convoys belong to the nation whoſe flag he carries, and that they have no contraband goods on board, ſhall be conſidered by the reſpective cruiſers as fully ſufficient: the two parties reciprocally engaging not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit under the protection of their convoys, ſhips which ſhall carry contraband goods deſtined to an enemy.</p>
               <p>XX. In all caſes where veſſels ſhall be captured or detained under pretence of carrying to the enemy contraband goods, the captor ſhall give a receipt for ſuch of the papers of the veſſel as he ſhall retain, which receipt ſhall be annexed to a deſcriptive liſt of the ſaid papers: and it ſhall be unlawful to break up or open the hatches, cheſts, trunks, caſks, bales, or veſſels found on board, or remove the ſmalleſt part of the goods, unleſs the lading be brought on ſhore in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the competent officers, and an inventory made by them of the ſaid goods. Nor ſhall it be lawful to ſell, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change or alienate the ſame in any manner, unleſs there have been lawful proceſs, and the competent judge or judges ſhall have pronounced againſt ſuch goods ſentence of confiſcation, ſaving always the ſhip and the other goods which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
               <p>XXI. And that proper care may be taken of the veſſel and cargo, and embezzlement prevented, it is agreed, that it ſhall not be lawful to remove the maſter, commander or ſupercargo of any captured ſhip from on board thereof, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther during the time the ſhip may be at ſea after her capture, or pending the proceedings againſt her, or her cargo, or any thing relative thereto. And in all caſes where a veſſel of the citizens of either party ſhall be captured, or ſeized, and held for adjudication, her officers, paſſengers and crew ſhall be hoſpitably treated. They ſhall not be impriſoned or depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of any part of their wearing apparel, nor of the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and uſe of their money, not exceeding for the captain, ſupercargo and mate five hundred dollars each, and for the ſailors and paſſengers, one hundred dollars each.</p>
               <p>XXII. It is further agreed, that in all caſes, the eſtabliſhed courts for prize cauſes, in the country to which the prizes may be conducted, ſhall alone take cognizance of them.
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:035113_0132_1000AD2847D11D28"/>
And whenever ſuch tribunal of either of the parties ſhall pronounce judgement againſt any veſſel or goods, or property claimed by the citizens of the other party, the ſentence or decree ſhall mention the reaſons or motives on which the ſame ſhall have been founded, and an authenticated copy of the ſentence or decree, and of all the proceedings in the caſe, ſhall, if demanded, be delivered to the commander or agent of the ſaid veſſel, without any delay, he paying the legal fees for the ſame.</p>
               <p>XXIII. And that more abundant care may be taken for the ſecurity of the reſpective citizens of the contracting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to prevent their ſuffering injuries by the men of war or privateers of either party, all commanders of ſhips of war and privateers, and all others the ſaid citizens, ſhall forbear doing any damage to thoſe of the other party, or committing any outrage againſt them, and if they act to the contrary they ſhall be puniſhed, and ſhall alſo be bound in perſons and eſtates to make ſatisfaction and reparation for all damages and the intereſt thereof, of whatever nature the ſaid damages may be.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe all commanders of privateers before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their commiſſions, ſhall hereafter be obliged to give, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a competent judge, ſufficient ſecurity by at leaſt two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible ſureties, who have no intereſt in the ſaid privateer, each of whom, together with the ſaid commander, ſhall be jointly and ſeverally bound in the ſum of 7000 dollars, or 36,820 francs, or if ſuch ſhips be provided with above 150 ſeamen or ſoldiers, in the ſum of 14000 dollars, or 73,640 f. to ſatisfy all damages and injuries which the ſaid privateer, or her officers or men, or any of them may do or commit during their cruiſe, contrary to the tenor of this Convention or to the laws and inſtructions for regulating their conduct; and further, that in all caſes of aggreſſions, the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſhall be revoked and annulled.</p>
               <p>XXIV. When the ſhips of war of the two contracting parties, or thoſe belonging to their citizens which are arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in war, ſhall be admitted to enter with their prizes the ports of either of the two parties, the ſaid public or private ſhips, as well as their prizes, ſhall not be obliged to pay any duty either to the officers of the place, the judges, or any others; nor ſhall ſuch prizes, when they come to and enter the ports of either party, be arreſted or ſeized, nor ſhall the officers of the place make examination concerning the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſuch prizes, but they may hoiſt ſail at any time, and depart and carry their prizes to the places expreſſed in their commiſſions, which the commanders of ſuch ſhips of war ſhall be obliged to ſhew. It is always underſtood, that the ſtipulations of this Article ſhall not extend beyond the privileges of the moſt favoured nation.</p>

                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:035113_0133_1000ADA1EAF23B70"/>
XXV. It ſhall not be lawful for any foreign privateers who have commiſſions from any Prince or State in enmity with either nation, to fit their ſhips in the ports of either nation, to ſell their prizes, or in any manner to exchange them; neither ſhall they be allowed to purchaſe proviſions, except ſuch as ſhall be neceſſary for their going to the next port of that Prince or State from which they have received their commiſſions.</p>
               <p>XXVI. It is further agreed, that both the ſaid contracting parties ſhall not only refuſe to receive any pirates into any of their ports, havens, or towns, or permit any of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to receive, protect, harbour, conceal, or aſſiſt them in any manner, but will bring to condign puniſhment all ſuch inhabitants as ſhall be guilty of ſuch offences.</p>
               <p>And all their ſhips, with the goods or merchandizes taken by them and brought into the port of either of the ſaid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhall be ſeized as far as they can be diſcovered, and ſhall be reſtored to the owners, or their factors or agents duly authorized by them (proper evidence being firſt given before competent judges for proving the property), even in caſe ſuch effects ſhould have paſſed into other hands by ſale, if it be proved that the buyers knew, or had good reaſon to believe, or ſuſpect, that they had been piratically taken.</p>
               <p>XXVII. Neither party will intermeddle in the fiſheries of the other on its coaſts, nor diſturb the other in the exerciſe of the rights which it now holds, or may acquire, on the coaſt of Newfoundland, in the Gulph of St. Lawrence, or elſewhere on the American coaſt northward of the United States. But the whale and ſeal fiſheries ſhall be free to both in every quarter of the world.</p>
               <p>This Convention ſhall be ratified on both ſides in due form, and the Ratifications exchanged in the ſpace of ſix months, or ſooner, if poſſible.</p>
               <p>In faith whereof, the reſpective Plenipotentiaries have ſigned the above Articles both in the French and Engliſh languages, and they have thereto affixed their ſeals; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring nevertheleſs that the ſigning in the two languages ſhall not be brought into precedent, nor in any way operate to the prejudice of either party.</p>
               <p>Done at Paris the 8th day of Vendemaire of the 9th year of the French Republic—the 13th day of Sept. 1800.</p>

            <p>THE cloſe of the 18th Century will be a remarkable, and, we hope, an auſpicious period in the hiſtory of the New World—In the month of November 1800, the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the People of the United States commenced their deliberations for the public good in the CITY OF WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, deſtined to be the Capital of the confederated Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics of America.—It has been ſaid, that the founding of this City was a ſymptom of vanity in the illuſtrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage whoſe name it bears—May it be aſked, is there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther envy nor peeviſhneſs in the remark?—We are inclined to aſcribe its riſe to a laudable motive; it was the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a great and comprehenſive mind, looking forward to the proſperity and happineſs of future generations; an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable wiſh to perpetuate his name to poſterity by a uſeful, a durable, and a noble monument, a great and flouriſhing City.—The man who is the means of raiſing but one blade of graſs, is ſaid to be praiſe-worthy—the building of but one houſe adds to the comfort of the community—how much more praiſe-worthy is that man, who is the founder of a City intended to be the elegant depoſitary of the Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the emporium of a Free People, and the capital of a great Republic?—Other great men, as they have been erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly called, have rendered their names famous by the deſtruction of Cities, and by the miſery of Nations—Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's fame reſts on other principles; in having fought for the liberties of his countrymen; in aſſiſting to frame for them a free Conſtitution; and in deviſing means for their future happineſs and proſperity.</p>
            <p>Let us conſult both ancient and modern hiſtory—The city of Alexandria long ſtood a monument of propitiation for the deſtructive wars and mad ambition of Alexander—The new city of Peterſburgh makes us forget, and almoſt forgive, the coarſe manners and cruel deeds of the firſt Peter—What a ſuperior character is OUR Waſhington to theſe men?—The even tenor of his conduct ſubjects <hi>his</hi> fame to no ſuch unpleaſant drawbacks—Shall we then attempt to weigh all the circumſtances of his life in the nice ſcales of ſcrupuloſity, or with a microſcopic eye ſearch for blemiſhes, and peeviſhly magnify defects from which no human being is exempted?—Is Republicaniſm of that harſh, ungracious, uncharitable temper, as ſlightly to paſs over the beauties, and dwell with malicious pleaſure on the imperfections of the picture?—Forbid it Generoſity, forbid it Gratitude, forbid it Patriotiſm!</p>
            <p>May the <hi>City of Washington,</hi> therefore, fulfill the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its illuſtrious founder—May it be the ſeat of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, learning, and ſcience; the fountain of good laws; and the rallying point of all the republican virtues.</p>

            <p>The Legiſlature of the United States of America meet this day. As they are the grand depoſitory of national confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to whom are entruſted powers, on the correct exerciſe of which the public felicity greatly depends, it is natural that a general ſolicitude ſhould accompany their delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Poſſeſſing the power of preſerving peace or declaring war, of increaſing or diminiſhing taxes, the welfare of the community, on points of the deepeſt and moſt extenſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, cannot fail to be as much promoted by an enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it would be injured by a contracted policy.</p>
            <p>There is one circumſtance which leads us to hope, that Congreſs commences its proceedings in the new Capital at an auſpicious period.—The unfortunate differences which have too long ſubſiſted between the French and American Republics, are, we truſt, nearly terminated; and that the two countries, fitted by their forms of government, to be on amicable terms, will henceforth be on terms of concord and harmony.—With reſpect to the nature of the Treaty, no one will imagine, that the American Envoys, either from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality or prejudice, will have conferred any advantages on France, nor dictated by a ſcrupulous adherence to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of a juſt reciprocity. The ſentiments they are known to poſſeſs, and their high reſpectability and integrity, are ſufficient pledges of their upright conduct.</p>
            <p>The preſervation of peace is ſo plainly and unequivocally the policy of Republics, and ſo peculiarly the policy of <hi>this</hi> Country, that every true friend to its proſperity will rejoice in an honourable termination of diſputes, that hazarded its tranquility at home, and diſturbed its relations abroad.</p>
            <p>The American people are not averſe to war, becauſe they fear to try their ſtrength with any foe that menaces their rights—but they deprecate war as one of the greateſt curſes inflicted upon mankind. Knowing that it renders nations depraved, and governments deſpotic, they view it as the inſtrument of Tyranny and Oppreſſion—as ſuch, they do well to be jealous of their Rulers, and by an unſleeping vigilance, to reſtrain that ſpirit of encroachment and domination which Ambition is perpetually prompting—Nothing can be in is clearly expreſſed by the late elections, from one end of the Union to the other, than the marked hoſtility of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mind to war with any nation, unleſs forced upon the country by dire neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Among the immediate benefits which may be expected to flow from the altered ſtate of our affairs, is a repeal of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain laws, whoſe only apology was looked for in "the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like attitude of the country."—And may we not entertain a ſincere wiſh for the revocation of the Alien Law, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence has, in all probability, with-held from our country
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:035113_0136_1000BF0C4FA83978"/>
many wealthy merchants, ingenious mechanics, and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous farmers,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The Alien Law, and the general complexion of the then American Government, did diſcourage ſeveral uſeful and opulent men from coming to this country.—As a proof of a hoſtile diſpoſition to emigrants, the following circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is related.—A Gentleman whoſe moral conduct would ſtand the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny, whoſe diſpoſition is temperate and religious, but whoſe principles were republican, obtained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the government of Ireland to bring himſelf and his property (about 30,000l.) to the United States; to his great ſurpriſe, obſtacles were thrown in his way by the American Miniſter in London; at length, after a tedious and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proceſs, he was permitted to come, but he was rudely given to underſtand, "that he muſt behave himſelf!"—as if the principles for which he was baniſhed from his native country were adverſe to thoſe of the people of theſe States—Was it natural to ſuppoſe, that a man of ſtrict integrity and conſiderable property, who had ſuffered every thing but death for ſupporting republicaniſm in Ireland, would come to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the republican Government of America?—Or, are we to believe, that the American Rulers were cajoled into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to abet the ſelfiſh views of England to the manifeſt prejudice of their own country?</p>
                  <p>Where was the conſiſtency, where was the good policy of this act!—If the poor, afflicted people of Ireland, after ages of oppreſſion and contumely, were provoked to reſiſtance, what a damnable deed did Meſſrs. Waſhington, Adams, and Co. commit in their rebellion!</p>
                  <p>It is proper, however, to obſerve, that the above circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance took place during the deluſion of 98 or 99, when <hi>Peter Porcupine</hi> was conſidered as the Saviour of America!—Mr. A. was then deep in the trammels of the New York fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—We are inclined to believe, that he now entertains a very different opinion of the <hi>political manoeuvres</hi> of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable period in the hiſtory of the United States.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P. S</hi> The unfortunate Gentlemen now languiſhing in a Scottiſh priſon had alſo obtained permiſſion to come to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica—Whatever may be the real fact, the pretext was, "that the American Government would not receive them."—Upon this ground, whether true or falſe, the Iriſh Rulers broke their compact—If it had been adhered to, theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men could have brought property with them to the amount of more than 100,000l.—The particulars of this tranſaction, with ſeveral others concerning that ill-ſated country, Ireland, we are obliged to omit; perhaps they may come before us in a ſucceeding volume—From an able writer, they would make a moſt intereſting and inſtructive hiſtory.</p>
               </note> while it has proved no reſtraint upon idle and diſorderly characters.</p>

Taxes, under moſt governments, are a neceſſary evil; but, in a Republic, where the Rulers are wiſe and honeſt, they ceaſe to be a grievance. Impoſed on principles of juſtice and equality, and devoted only to objects of national im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, they are not thought oppreſſive, and ſeldom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the objects of popular diſcontent. And to the honour of the American people, the juſt wants of their government have always been ſupplied with readineſs and liberality.</p>
            <p>It ſhould, however, ever be impreſſed upon the minds of the Repreſentatives of the People, that the public impoſitions ſhould never riſe above the real wants of the government—For the ſame ſpirit that gives with cheerfulneſs whatever is needed for national purpoſes, will reſiſt every impoſition that is unjuſt and unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>The preſent criſis of human affairs is deeply awful and momentous. The European world preſents the almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>form ſpectacle, of governments oppreſſing their ſubjects, or of ſubjects riſing in arms againſt their governments—War, deſtructive War, rages with all its calamities—Human life, for the protection of which governments were inſtituted, is there ſacrificed to lawleſs ambition, to the rod of power, or to the ſword of the conqueror!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What an awful, what an instructive lesson is here for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican people and governments!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Riſing into national importance on the principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm, our Governors need only to be guided by thoſe principles, to be beloved by their country, and applauded by the world. Purſuing the plain path of juſtice with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to foreign nations, and diffuſing among their Citizens the bleſſings of equal rights and impartial laws, the ſpirit of candour, of harmony, and conciliation will be diffuſed, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to heal the cancarous wounds made by party violence, perſonal animoſity, and political diſcord.</p>

               <head>The Committee of Ways and Means, who were inſtructed to enquire into the expedincy of repealing the "Act to provide for the Valuation of Lands and dwelling Houſes, and the Enumeration of Slaves within the United States,"</head>
               <p>Report, That the valuation of lands and dwelling houſes has not yet been completed in all the States; and to repeal the law before that object is accompliſhed, would, in its effect, defeat the direct tax in thoſe States where the valuation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains incompleat.</p>
               <p>That one great object contemplated at the time of paſſing the law, and which it is preſumed ſtill exiſts, was to organize a ſyſtem for laying direct taxes, to which the legiſlature might reſort if the exigencies of government ſhould require more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue than could conveniently be drawn from indirect taxes; and to relinquiſh this object, after the expence of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it has been incurred, might be a proof of inſtability, but not of wiſdom.</p>
               <p>That the expence of procuring the diſtribution and transfer of real eſtates to be recorded in the ſurveyor's office, incurred by individuals, is, in the opinion of the Committee, an object of little importance when oppoſed to the advantages ariſing from a public record of titles, and the more important advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which the government will derive from the ſyſtem, if any event ſhould render a direct tax neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Although it is to be hoped that no further direct taxes will become neceſſary, yet, as it is impoſſible to pronounce, with
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035113_0139_1000BF10F3C203E8"/>
certainty, that this will not be the caſe, the Committee believe that it is highly expedient to purſue a ſyſtem, which, in caſes of emergency, may be uſed to draw into the Treaſury, with certainty and expedition, any reaſonable ſums which the public neceſſities may require</p>
               <p>The Committee are therefore of opinion, that it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to repeal the act providing for the valuation of lands and dwelling houſes, and the enumeration of ſlaves within the United States.</p>

               <p>A mode of electing the Preſident and Vice-Preſident of the United States, which might at once combine the expreſſion of the public ſentiments of the people of the reſpective ſtates, with a due appointment of the electors for that important purpoſe, is a diſcovery greatly to be deſired; that ſuch mode may be found, under the preſent proviſions of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States, and will be diſcovered by the good ſenſe of the American people, when aided by further experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is confidently hoped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Under ſuch circumſtances, to adopt excluſively the mode propoſed by the firſt reſolution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to your committee, might not only preclude the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of further experience and the adoption of a more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible made, but might tend to perpetuate, as well as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more frequent the occurrence of thoſe exceptionable incidents which have been before ſuggeſted, and for which it is difficult, if not impracticable, to find adequate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient means of prevention or remedy.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations induce your Committee to prefer the exiſting proviſions of the Constitution of the United States, to the change propoſed by the firſt of the reſolution, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them.</p>
               <p>In relation to the ſecond Reſolution referred to your Committee, they report that the objects directly contemplated therein, are already within the limits of the legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the government of the United States. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a conſtitutional proviſion for the exerciſe of legiſlative authority, to which recurrence may be had at all times, and under which ſuch modifications may be introduced, from time to time, as the public good and convenience may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in the ordinary forms of legiſlation, into a ſpecific conſtitutional preſcription, ſeems to be both ſuperfluous and inconvenient.</p>
               <p>The adoption of the plan propoſed in the ſecond Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would alſo, in the opinion of your committee, indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to withdraw from the government of the United States, its exiſting controul over the appointment of one of its moſt eſſential branches, and to veſt that authority exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively in the ſtate Governments. Such arrangement might
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035113_0141_1000BF139B0530C8"/>
produce conſequences not contemplated, and too unpleaſant to be anticipated. Your Committee therefore conceive it to be inexpedient to adopt the propoſed change on this ſubject, and ſubmit the following reſolutions to the conſideration of the Houſe</p>

                  </gap> it important to add, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary expence which has ariſen within a few years, has ſwallowed up large ſums of the public wealth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the application of thoſe monies which might otherwiſe have gone to the extinguishment of the public debt, to objects connected with the honour, and, in ſome caſes, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate exiſtence of the Government</p>
               <p>"In this claſs of expence will be included a large ſum oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the Indian war—one million two hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand dollars, expended in quelling two inſurrections in the ſtate of Pennſylvania—more than one million and an half expended in our tranſactions with Algiers and the other Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterranean powers, together with a much larger expence occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the unprovoked aggreſſions of France upon this country. Had it been poſſible, ſteadily to have applied thoſe various ſums to the purchaſe of debt, it is eaſily to conceive how rapidly the ſame might have been extinguished—The committee have likewiſe, noticed the large ſums which have been neceſſarily expended in the erection of lighthouſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing

                  </gap>ſe objects, it is well known, ariſes to a very large amount, and the property thus acquired by the government, and which is now on hand, cannot be eſtimated, on the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate calculations, at a ſum leſs than four millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. The value of this property might be conſidered as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing another item in the credit of the general account of debt, but the Committee have not thought it neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it, and have noticed it particularly at this time, for the purpoſe of exhibiting a more general view of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expence incurred by the government, and for the purpoſe preſenting all that information, in relation to the debt, which will enable the Houſe accurately to appreciate the great and increaſing reſources of the country; and on this point the committee cannot forbear to remark, that the progreſs of the government, in its financial operations, muſt afford the moſt flattering preſages of its future ſucceſs, if the ſame ſyſtem is purſued which has hitherto proved ſo ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>"It cannot certainly be unworthy of remark that ten years have not at this time elapſed ſince the government fairly commenced its operations; that during that period it has been neceſſary to liquidate, to fund and to provide for a large capital of floating debt which has grown out of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Confederation; that during the ſame ſhort period the government has been compelled to contend with one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive war on the frontier, with two inſurrections in the centre of our country, and with depredation and hoſtility from the nations of Europe; that theſe embarraſſments have nevertheleſs been faced by the government; moſt of the difficulties have been ſurmounted; the debt has been liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated and diminiſhed, and the nation has ſtill continued to increaſe in wealth and population beyond all former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and although the conteſt in which we are now engaged, may, for a ſhort period, retard the further extinguiſhment of debt, or perhaps produce a ſmall addition to that which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready exiſts, yet it cannot be doubted, that whilſt we retain order at home, no exterior circumſtances can exhauſt or greatly diminiſh the increaſing reſources of the nation."</p>
               <p>We have thus impartially ſtated, as far as our limits will allow, the different ſums at the different periods, as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Committee. It is probable ſome of our read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may be puzzled between the <hi>nominal</hi> and <hi>true</hi> amounts; indeed the Report ſays, that "there was a difference of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Committee,"* therefore the debt is ſtated both ways—"When Doctors differ, who ſhall decide?"</p>

On this important ſubject, let us hear what Mr. Gallatin ſays—His abilities in Financial matters few men will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to diſpute—If he has intentionally miſrepreſented the ſubject in the face of the world, he muſt be both a bold and a bad man.—Thoſe who wiſh to come at the truth, would do well to take Mr. G's pamphlet in one hand, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee's Report in the other, and judge for themſelves.</p>
               <p>"The Secretary of the Treaſury (ſays Mr. G.) in a letter to the Committee of Ways and Means, dated Jan. 1800, gave it as his opinion, "that the principal of the public debt had <hi>increased,</hi> ſince the eſtablishment of the preſent Government, in the ſum of 1,516,338 dollars." A Committee of the Houſe of Repreſentatives,<note n="*" place="bottom">Meſſrs. Griſwold, Waln, Sewal, S. Smith, Sheaff, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas, and Gallatin, were the Committee, and the latter gentleman is accuſed of "unbluſhing miſrepreſentation in his pamphlet"—Certainly his being on the Committee gave him an opportunity of being intimately acquainted with all the items—If he has miſrepreſented the public accounts, he deſerves public execration.</note> appointed in March, to examine the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the United States, reported, on the 8th of May, a number of ſtatements, and, as the reſult drawn from them, that the Public Debt; inſtead of having increaſed, as ſtated by the Secretary, had, on the 1ſt of Jan. 1800, <hi>diminished</hi> by a ſum of 1,092,841 dollars, if contraſted with the debt of Jan. 1790, and 3,972,878 dollars if compared with the debt of 1791.—The Report was printed by order of the Houſe, but never acted upon, nor any occaſion offered to inveſtigate its principles.</p>
               <p>"The different reſults exhibited by the Secretary in Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and by the Committee in May, ſhew that the ſubject may be conſidered in different ways, embracing not only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, but queſtions of opinion. Whether the view taken by the Committee is correct or not, is to be decided by reaſoning; and their Report, not being confined, as ſeems to have been intended by the Houſe, to <hi>matters of fact,</hi> muſt be conſidered only as the <hi>opinion</hi> of a few individuals.—It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, in this Eſſay, to examine ſome of the facts contained in the Treaſury ſtatements, to diſcuſs the grounds of the <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the Committee, and to add ſome obſervations on the financial operations of the government of the United States."—(Mr. G. then proceeds to examine the facts in a variety of calculations, which are too lengthy for our book, but which we recommend to the ſerious peruſal of thoſe who are deſirous of being acquainted with the financial affairs of the United States—We therefore ſelect from a variety of tables what we think are his concluſive ſtatements.)</p>
               <p>"From thoſe conſiderations it appears, that the Public Debt may, according to the two different views of which the ſubject is ſuſceptible, be correctly ſtated as follows:

Waſhington, and that the Bill was rejected by the Senate—This ſeſſion, the ſcheme was renewed upon a much more expenſive plan, which, as might be expected, occaſioned much debate and difference of opinion—Some of the members were for no other memorial of the departed General's virtues, than what could be fix'd in the <hi>hearts</hi> of his fellow citizens<note n="*" place="bottom">It was a good idea, ſuggeſted by one of the members in this debate, that a conciſe hiſtory of the Revolution, and the life of Gen. Waſhington, ſhould be made ſchool-books—Among the firſt rudiments of learning taught the young ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſhould be a knowledge of his own country.</note>—others were for ſuch a monument of him as was voted by the old Congreſs—others again, and theſe the majority, 44 to 40, gave their voice for a <hi>Mausoleum,</hi> on a grand and extenſive ſcale—On this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, we think it neceſſary to inſert the following</p>

                     <p>OBSERVING the Reſolutions paſſed by the United States of America, for removing the body of GEORGE WASHINGTON from the family vault to the city bearing his name, and their intention to raiſe an appropriate monument to his memory in that city, I thought the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with the plan for a monument from me as an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can and one not altogether obſcure in the elegant ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, might be acceptable to thoſe in that country, who are deſirous of paying the laſt tribute to his memory, by a monumental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, placed in the Federal City.</p>
                     <p>The raiſing of monuments to departed virtue, has ever been an object of the firſt attention in all civilized countries, and no people ever had ſo proud an inſtance in doing this as the Americans, by raiſing one to true virtue and real worth, as that which preſents itſelf to them in the character of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Waſhington, and that the placing of ſuch records in public ſituations has ever been conſidered true policy, by all wiſe governments, for which the highways, ſquares and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes for ſuch records have been preferred, we have the higheſt authority from the Egyptians, Grecians, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.—That the raiſing of a monument to the memory of General Waſhington, I believe, is the wiſh of all the civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed world. I do therefore recommend, that the moſt durable form for ſuch a monument be adopted, which is, that of the Triangle or Pyramid, and that its ſituation be the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the Federal City; its height one hundred and fifty feet, and its baſis the ſame. The place or ſquare, where it is erected, to be planted with trees to give inviting ſhade, and to be opened to the public: this will afford the parent or tutor an opportunity to inculcate the virtues of that great man, in the juvenile mind of the riſing offspring. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the pyramid has a conic cavity to ſave the expence in building, and at the ſame time gives as much ſtrength as though ſolid; within that is built a rotundo, lighted from the top, in which is placed the pedeſtrian ſtatue of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in bronze, to be in height not leſs than ſeven feet, and round the rotundo eight baſſo-relievos in the ſame metal, four containing military, and four civil ſubjects. In place of the frize and dado round the rotundo, a grove to be cut, to a conſiderable depth, and in the ſame manner round the eight baſſo-relievos. This will give a monumental ſimplicity, which belongs to its character, and the whole of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the natural colour of the ſtone with which it is built; one of the four entrances into the rotundo to be cloſed,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:035113_0159_1000ACF8E506FD18"/>
for the place where the remains of that great man ſhould be depoſited in a ſtone coffin, which ſhould be elevated, and under it a proper inſcription. The three entrances which lead into the rotundo, to have iron gates, to be opened on fixed days, for ſeeing the ſepulchre. Such a monument would be an appropriate one to the exalted character of George Washington, and worthy the United States of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica to raiſe to his memory. It ſhould ſtand pre-eminent in magnitude, as the character it records ſtood pre-eminent in virtue, as well as to give a taſte to any monuments that may in future be erected—it will both adorn the City, and inſpire the people with virtue from generation to generation, for thouſands of years.</p>
                     <p>The better to elucidate the conſtruction of ſuch a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſend you the plan, ſection, and elevation; they are goemetrical, and laid down to a ſcale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The eſtimate of ſuch a monument in erecting, the workmen in America will be able to aſcertain, as the whole is to be of ſtone. The works of art, ſuch as the ſtatue and baſſo-relievos, their expence will be aſcertained in Europe, agreeable to ſimilar works.</p>

               <p>At the opening of the Aſſembly, the Governor ſent a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (along with other communications) dated 1ſt Dec. 1800, of which the following is the ſubſtance:—His Excllency notices the ſtate of the Penitentiary Houſe, which he thinks ought to be ſtrengthened and ſurrounded with an external wall, &amp;c.—Mentions the Marine Hoſpital at Norfolk, to be ceded to the United States on certain conditions; alſo, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tract of land called Goſport, "as ſoon as he ſhould be ſatisfied the United States were willing to pay the amount, at which the ſaid tract ſhould be valued by agents appointed by each party."—He takes notice of the contagious diſeaſe which lately afflicted Norfolk and Baltimore, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he took to enforce quarantine, &amp;c.—He recites the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:035113_0167_1000BF4268BE0208"/>
taken in regard to the Act for appointing Electors to chuſe a Preſident and Vice-Preſident of the United States, and "the chearfulneſs with which ſaid Law was received and executed by the patriotic Citizens of this State."—The paragraphs concerning the Alien and Sedition Laws, and that touching the conduct of a certain Magiſtrate in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, we ſhall inſert verbatim, for the information of our Readers:—</p>
               <p>"As ſoon as the requiſite number of copies of the Report of the Select Committee of the laſt ſeſſion on the Anſwers of ſeveral of the ſtates to the Reſolutions of the General Aſſembly, which paſſed at the preceding Seſſion, relative to the Alien and Sedition Laws of the United States, and the Inſtructions to the Senators of this State in the Congreſs of the United States were printed, the Executive haſtened to diſtribute them among the ſeveral Counties of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in compliance with the Reſolution of the 20th of January laſt. It is believed, that no public documents illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trative of public tranſactions, however intereſting, were ever more generally read or thoroughly approved, than theſe were; nor can it be doubted that the light which they communicated on the very important ſubject to which they referred, tended to increaſe in a high degree, the confidence of the good people of this Commonwealth, in the wiſdom and rectitude of the policy which governed the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. In connection with that ſubject it is proper to add, that ſince your laſt Seſſion, the Sedition Law, one of the Acts complained of, has been carried into effect in this Commonwealth, by the deciſion of a Federal Court.—I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice this event, not with a view of cenſuring, or even criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing it. The tranſaction has gone to the world, and the impartial, will judge of it, as it deſerves. I notice it for the purpoſe of remarking, that the deciſion was executed with the ſame order and tranquil ſubmiſſion on the part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as could have been ſhewn by them on a ſimilar occaſion to any the moſt neceſſary, conſtitutional, and popular Acts of the Government. The conſtitutional authorities and the good people of this Commonwealth, are attached to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and cheriſh it with their fondeſt wiſhes. The coloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of their anceſtors in this Weſtern world, was gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the ſame country, at the ſame time, and produced by the ſame cauſe; they alike groaned under an oppreſſion which repreſſed their growth and checked their proſperity:—they fought and bled in the ſame battles, in defence of the ſame rights, and have ſince experienced, with unexampled harmony and unanimity, a variety of new and intereſting occurrences which admoniſh them, they ſtill are and ought to remain forever united. The General Aſſembly, and the good people of this Commonwealth, have acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:035113_0168_1000BF44C935A2B0"/>
to their own conſciences, and to their brethren in America, in ſupport of a cauſe, which they deemed a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional one, by the ſtand they made, and the ſentiments they expreſſed of thoſe acts of the General Government; but they have looked for a change in that reſpect, to a change in the public opinion which ought to be free, not to meaſures of violence, diſcord and diſunion, which they abhor."—</p>
               <p>"Some time in April laſt I was adviſed by a reſpectable citizen in Norfolk, that a Magiſtrate of that Borough had received from the Captain of the Conſtellation, a frigate of the United States, a perſon ſaid to be one of the mutineers on board his Britannic Majeſty's ſhip the Hermione; that he committed the ſaid perſon to jail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with an order to the jailor to ſurrender him to the Britiſh Conſul, on his application; that he was ſurrendered accordingly to the ſaid conſul, who ſent him to a Britiſh Iſland where he was executed. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſo extraordinary as that alledged, could not otherwiſe than excite the aſtoniſhment of the Executive. Every man within the jurisdiction of the ſtate, is under certain excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, amenable to its laws and entitled to its protection. If he commits an offence againſt the ſovereignty, or other rights of the United States; he is amenable to their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and laws for the infraction. But the act which was denounced did not appear to proceed from, or to be ſanction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the authority of that government. To deſignate a man within the juriſdiction of a ſtate, as one not entitled to its protection, or that of the United States, to diveſt him of ſuch protection, and ſurrender him to a foreign power, to be ſent abroad, tried, condemned, and executed, by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a foreign tribunal, are important acts of ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which the character and agency of the chief public functionaries ſhould be ſeen and for which they are highly reſponſible. But nothing of the kind appeared in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance. No reſpectful, though ſtrict analyſis, by the competent authority, of the reſpective claims to juriſdiction, between the ſtate and the United States, with reſpect to the fugitive, who ſought an aſylum here; no circumſpect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of treaties between the United States and a foreign power, which ought to precede an act derogating in ſome reſpects from the national ſovereignty, were heard of. The magiſtrate who acted was not even an officer of the federal government, but of this ſtate, in which light, he was in a peculiar degree reſponſable to its authority. The act was ſtated to be ſummary and peremptory, and ſtrictly that of the magiſtrate himſelf. As however this communication compromitted the character of a conſul of a foreign power, and an officer of the United States, as well as that of a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of this Commonwealth, the Executive was careful to obſerve in the part it took, the utmoſt deference to the rights
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:035113_0169_1000BF474E410C40"/>
of thoſe who were to be affected by it. The information was given in writing by a reſpectable citizen, but yet that did not ſeem to be an evidence ſufficiently formal and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic, to juſtify a prompt proceeding under it. It was deemed more conſiſtent with the principles of juſtice, and becoming the character of a free State, to cauſe the verity of theſe charges to be aſcertained by affidavit, with due notice to the parties before any ſtep was taken. And as the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General was neceſſarily engaged in public buſineſs in one of the ſuperior courts at the time, that truſt was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to George Hay, a citizen of merit and talents, by whom it was executed, with that degree of judgement and propriety its delicacy and importance required. I am ſorry to add that the reſult of the enquiry did not diminiſh the preſumption that the charges alledged were true. It was deemed of ſufficient force to impoſe on the Executive an obligation, to refer the ſubject to the Attorney General, with a requeſt that he would take ſuch meaſures in reference to the tranſaction as in his judgement might be ſuitable. I ſubmit a copy of all the papers neceſſary to give a full view of this intereſting occurrence to the General Aſſembly; with whoſe wiſdom it will remain to determine, whether any further proviſion ought to be made by law for ſimilar offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in future."</p>

                     <head>Copy of Mr. LEE'S Letter, referred to in Governor Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe's Addreſs to the Legiſlature:</head>
                     <p>SIR,—Without apology for my not being perſonally known to you, I take the liberty of addreſſing to you as chief magiſtrate of the Commonwealth of Virginia, on a ſubject in my judgement highly intereſting to the liberty and happineſs of my fellow-citizens.</p>
                     <p>Some time in the ſpring of laſt year, Captain Truxton, of the Conſtellation frigate, ſent to Doctor J. K. Read, one of the aldermen of the borough of Norfolk, a man who HE ſaid had acknowledged himſelf one of the mutineers on board the Hermione frigate; the man was committed to jail, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the order of the Britiſh conſul, by him taken out, ſent to Jamaica, and there executed. This information is from Dr. Read himſelf, in the preſence of Seth Foſter, J. Niviſon, Otway Byrd, Dr. Barraud, the Britiſh Conſul and ſeveral others; for on being aſked by capt. Traxton on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt, what had become of the man he had ſent as one of the mutineers on board of the Hermione frigate, he replied that he had delivered him to the Britiſh conſul. Mr Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who was preſent, obſerved, HE had ſent him to Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, where he was hanged. Although this confeſſion was made in the preſence of ſtaunch federaliſts and men of order, yet the principle was alarming, and of courſe made ſome
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035113_0170_1000BF4937470BF8"/>
noiſe. As ſoon as I heard of it I applied to the jailor. The reſult of my enquiry is, that there was ſuch a perſon commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Doctor Read, ſubject to the order of the Britiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul; that he was taken out of jail, and put on board of a Britiſh veſſel—but what his fate was, he knows not.—The mittimus he ſays is either loſt or miſlaid. The jailor alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that previous to this another man was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Doctor Read for the ſame offence, but that he died in jail before there was an opportunity to ſend him away; a copy of this mittimus I herewith ſend you.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall forbear to remark on the dreadful conſequences that may ariſe from a conduct of this ſort, and ſhall only obſerve, that if men cloathed with authority can be made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of oppreſſion to gratify the views of a Britiſh Conſul, we may bid adieu to the liberty and happineſs of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and every thing dear and valuable to us in it. From con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in my mind, that doctor Read's conduct has been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, I have thought it incumbent on me to give you this information.

                     <p>THE ſubjoined letter was written by me to Governor Monroe, and went to the hope, that his Excellency, ſenſible of the injury he muſt have done me, in his letter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication to the legiſlature, would have thought it right, to requeſt a ſuſpenſion of the public opinion, until the event of that proſecution which he has ordered againſt me, and which is <hi>depending</hi> and <hi>undetermined,</hi> ſhould be known. But, his Excellency has neither deigned to notice my letter, or to take any meaſures for ſoftening the ſeverity of his denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.</p>
                     <p>Is it not novelty in the <hi>new</hi> philoſophy?

Is it not new, that the unguarded openneſs of private converſation, in domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic circles (like the domiciliary viſits of Robeſpierre) ſhall be betrayed, and tortured into matter of information and impeachment? and that from ſuch evidence, and the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical opinion of an Attorney General founded thereon, a Chief Magiſtrate, ſhall think himſelf authoriſed to <hi>prejudge</hi> a caſe—denounce an individual, and conſign him to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and execution of his fellow citizens—untried, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard?</p>
                     <p>Conſcious that I have never have been governed by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper motives, in any act of my official duty. I feel little apprehenſion for the conſequences of this proſecution—the

errors of judment may be imputed to me (for 'tis the portion of human nature to err,) but the <hi>honours</hi> which ſurrounded his Excellency, with a much better ſalary ſuperadded, would be conſiderations inſufficient to induce me to commit an act, which the dictates of my own heart did not fully juſtify.</p>
                     <p>For theſe, and many other reaſons, I think it neceſſary, through the medium of your paper, to requeſt a ſuſpenſion of the public opinion, until the event of the proſecution now depending, ſhall be known.</p>
                     <p>As to the illiberal, unjuſtifiable, unexampled and violent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which has been uſed by many members of Aſſembly, both within and without the houſe, proceeding from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which were made by the communications, I ſhall forbear to make any other remark, than to leave the perſons who are implicated, to the unavoidable accuſations of their own conſciences, or to be more and more expoſed by their own obſtinate ſtupidity.</p>

                     <p>SIR,—I ſhall be pardoned for aſſerting an inherent right of complaining when an injury is done me, however eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſtation of him, by whom ſuch injury is meditated.</p>
                     <p>I complain, Sir, of an unjuſtifiable and wanton exerciſe of your powers, as Chief Magiſtrate of this Commonwealth, in the expoſition of documents, taken <hi>exparte,</hi> and which you knew were not teſtimony, even in that Court, from whoſe archives you have taken them, and in which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, by your order inſtituted againſt me, is depending and undetermined, to the Legiſlature of Virginia, in your letter of communication to that honorable body. I ſay <hi>unjustifiable,</hi> becauſe, I am at this moment a ſubject of legal proſecution before another tribunal, and the law which made you a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, forbade your <hi>prejudging</hi> a cauſe, or fixing a guilt of offence, on a man thus circumſtanced, ere that guilt had been proved by a legal and impartial trial!</p>
                     <p>The procedure complained of, was wanton, becauſe, as no legiſlative interference could poſſibly affect me, for a ſuppoſed offence heretofore committed, and as you have honoured me with executive, I can by no means become the object of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative attention; therefore, no valuable purpoſe, could reſult, from conſigning me, to the execration and reſentment of my fellow-citizens at large, by a communication thus highly ſanctioned, unleſs indeed, it was calculated to poiſon and influence the public mind, to the dereliction of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, which ſhould be the firſt feature in the event of every legal proceſs.</p>
                     <p>I forbear entering fully into this novel and extraordinary precedure, left under the preſſure of the injury you have done me, I ſhould be tempted to loſe ſight of that reſpect, which I

have ever conſidered as due to the conſtituted authorities of my country. I ſhall only take occaſion further to aſk your Excellency, if in the event of this cauſe (doubtful, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>respectability</hi> of your <hi>Citizen</hi> informer, or the talents of your <hi>missionary</hi>) a verdict ſhould be given in my favour, what method will you adopt to eradicate the poiſon, you have ſo ſucceſsfully inſtilled into the minds of my fellow citizens, to reſtore me to their confidence and eſteem?</p>

               <p>In the Houſe of Delegates, Jan. 14, Mr. Edm. Harriſon reported from the committee appointed to inveſtigate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port upon the conduct of John Hamilton, the conſul reſident at Norfolk, in the tranſaction alluded to in the Governor's communication relative to the alledged delivery of Hugh Jones, by John K. Read, and at the requeſt of the ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, that the committee had, according to order, had the ſaid ſubject under their conſideration, and are of opinion, that John Hamilton, as conſul, was not authoriſed under the laws of the United States, or any exiſting treaties, between his Britannic Majeſty and the United States to demand the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of any perſon whatſoever, as he is repreſented to have done.</p>
               <p>They are alſo of opinion, that the delivery of the ſaid Hugh Jones, if made as repreſented, was done without any authority under the exiſting laws of this ſtate or of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, and that ſuch delivery if ſo unlawfully made, does in no degree extenuate or diminiſh the offence of the ſaid John Hamilton.</p>
               <p>And Whereas it is provided by the Conſtitution of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, that the judicial power of the United States ſhall extend to all caſes affecting Ambaſſadors, or other public Miniſters or Conſuls.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, That the Governor be requeſted to tranſmit to the Preſident of the United States, a copy of the beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned communication, together with the documents accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the ſame, with a requeſt that he will cauſe the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be enquired into by the competent authority; and that ſuch redreſs may be given, as the laws of nations and the United States will warrant.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, That proviſion ought to be made by law, for puniſhing any like offences that may happen in future.</p>
               <p>Then the firſt Reſolution being twice read, was on the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being put thereupon, agreed to by houſe.</p>

               <p>The following Bill was preſented in the Houſe of Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of this ſtate, by Mr. Munford, and read the firſt time; and the farther conſideration thereof was poſtponed till the 23d of April next.</p>
               <p>As the inconveniences attending the preſent ſyſtem of Courts of Chancery, from the delays attending the mode of proceeding and the vaſt accumulation of buſineſs, have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned much complaint, ſeveral plans have been propoſed as remedies for the evil. A bill which was warmly advocated by many members, to change the ſyſtem of the High Court of Chancery, by dividing the State into 5 diſtricts, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went a long and elaborate diſcuſſion at this ſeſſion. That bill was printed at the public expence, and is now ſubmitted to the conſideration of the people.</p>
               <p>Actuated by a conviction that the beſt mode of obtaining the object deſired, is to enable the Courts of common law to give relief in all caſes, to which their powers can be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, others were of opinion that the following bill ought to be preferred.—It is therefore here inſerted, that the people may give it due examination, and may, if they think proper, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their opinion on the ſubject, by inſtructions to their Repreſentatives, or petitions to the next General Aſſembly.</p>

               <p>WHEREAS the delays incident to the preſent ſyſtem of the High Court of Chancery, and other Courts of ſimilar juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction are ſo great as often to amount to a denial of juſtice, which delays ariſe from the number of caſes in which the Courts of Common Law are at preſent unable to give relief; for remedy thereof, be it enacted by the General Aſſembly, that the defendant in any action in a Court of Common Law, may plead in his defence all ſuch matters of the things as may be juſt and equitable; the plaintiff when required by the defendant, ſhall reply on oath, and no demurrer to any plea ſhall be ſuſtained, unleſs ſuch plea be had, not only in law, but in equity.</p>

2. Whenever any legal or equitable cauſe of defence ſhall ariſe, or come to the knowledge of the defendant after the trial or judgement, on affidavit thereof by the defendant, the Court may on motion award a new trial, or permit a new plea or pleas to be filed, and farther proceedings to be had in the cauſe according to the juſtice and right of the caſe: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that unneceſſary delay ſhall not have been practiſed by the defendant after the ground of the ſaid application ſhall have ariſen or come to his knowledge.</p>

               <p>By the late Cenſus of the State of Pennſylvania we learn, that the city of Philadelphia has decreaſed about 500 <hi>Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables</hi> ſince the year 1793. Total <hi>Taxables</hi> in the whole ſtate 111,612, being an increaſe in 7 years of 20,462.—New Counties erected in that time 14.</p>
               <p>M. Achard, the Pruſſian chemiſt, has at length brought his diſcoveries, in the article of ſugar from vegetables, to ſuch perfection, that he is enabled to vend it at ſix ſous per lb.</p>
               <p>The largeſt Ox ever ſeen in America was raiſed in Morris county, New Jerſey, and was lately exhibited as a ſhow in Philadelphia. It meaſured 17 feet 3 inches from the noſe to the tail, excluſive of the bruſh; 6 feet 3 inches high, and the girth 9 feet 4 inches. It weighed 2996 lbs. being larger than the famous Blackwell Ox, at Dartmouth, the largeſt Ox ever ſeen in England.</p>

"Thus we ſee (ſays the Duke) that a barrel of flour, whoſe medium value in 1791 was 5 dollars 55 cents—in 1792, 5 drs. 3 cts.—in 1793, 5 drs. 15 cts.—in 1794, 5 drs. 56 cts. roſe, in 1795, to 9 drs. 35 cts.—and that Indian Corn, an article but of ſecondary demand, was at 37 cents the buſhel in 1791, at 54 in 1792, at 61 in 1793, at 51 in 1794, and at 66 in 1795.</p>
                  <p>"The exportations from Norfolk amounted, in the year 1791, to 1,028,789 dollars—in 1792, to 1,147,414—in 1793, to 1,045,525—in 1794, to 1,687,194—in 1795, to 1,934,827—and already to 1,088,105 dollars for the firſt quarter of 1796—When we conſider the increaſe of the exports for ſome years back, we muſt recollect that the difference is much more conſiderable in the value than in the quantity. The neceſſities of Europe have more than doubled the price; and altho' it be certainly a fact that the clearing of new grounds augments the quantity of produce, that augmentation bears no proporation to the difference of value preſented by the tables for three years back ſent in from the different Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes."</p>

               <div type="description_of_city">
                  <p>The Duke, after giving a curious account of his unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant voyage from Charleſtown in a ſmall, encumber'd veſſel, proceeds to deſcribe Norfolk, &amp;c.—</p>
                  <p>"Norfolk is built on Elizabeth-River, at nine miles from the ſpot where it diſcharges its waters into the bay. In the intervening ſpace there are few houſes, and thoſe few almoſt all preſent a wretched appearance. An almoſt uninterrupted ſucceſſion of pines are the only object which meets the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers eye. Craney Iſland lies nearly in the middle of the river at a ſhort diſtance above its mouth. Two points of land, which approach within a quarter of a mile of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in front of Norfolk, are ſtrengthened with forts which are capable of ſucceſsfully defending the entrance. That on the Norfolk ſide is in better condition than the other, which, however, might be ſpeedily repaired, at no great expence.</p>
                  <p>"Portſmouth, a ſmall aſſemblage of houſes on the oppoſite ſide of the river, did not ſhare in the conflagration of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk. From its ſituation it ſeemed entitled to expect all the commerce of Elizabeth-River: at its quays the greateſt depth of water is found: at the higheſt tides, it is there 12 feet deep, whereas it is only 6 at Norfolk; the pump-water at the former place is not brackiſh, as at the latter; the ſoil on which the town is built is more dry, and the air more ſalubrious. But, at the concluſion of the peace, the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants incenſed againſt the Engliſh, refuſed to admit any merchant of that nation, or any new-comer whoſe political principles were liable to ſuſpicion. To this rancorous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was attributed a political motive of a leſs generous kind—an apprehenſion on the part of the American mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:035113_0197_1000BF79620A10C8"/>
who had remained at Portſmouth, left the new traders who came to ſettle among them, ſhould, by the advantage of bringing in greater capitals than they themſelves poſſeſſed, be enabled to outdo them in the line of commerce.</p>
                  <p>"However this may be, the conſequences has been, that the inhabitants have removed to the oppoſite ſide; that Norfolk has been rebuilt, and that its trade is twenty times more conſiderable than that of Portſmouth; nay, the few merchants who ſtill reſide in the latter town, purchaſe at Norfolk almoſt all the articles that conſtitute their cargoes, and ſome of them even have their compting-houſes there.</p>
                  <p>"At the cloſe of the year 1783, there were not 12 houſes rebuilt in Norfolk; at preſent (1796) there are between 7 and 800. It is one of the uglieſt, moſt irregular, and moſt filthy towns that can any where be found. The houſes are low and unſightly, almoſt all conſtructed of wood, and erected without any attention to regularity; not 20 of them are built with brick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. The ſtreets are unpaved; the town is ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſwamps; the haſtineſs and ſtench which prevail are exceſſive, and add to the natural inſalubrity of the ſituation, and of the climate, which is extremely hot.</p>
                  <p>"From theſe concurrent ſources of unhealthineſs, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, that diſeaſes are habitual at Norfolk in ſummer and autumn, and that malignant epidemics are frequent. Laſt year the Yellow Fever is ſaid to have carried off 500 perſons from a population of 4000; 300 died at the time the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper prevailed, the others fell victims to its conſequences.—The inhabitants of Norfolk, even thoſe among them who are the moſt opulent, fancy that the uſe of wine and ſtrong liquors furniſhes them with a preſervative againſt the inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrity of the climate, and they make a liberal uſe of the remedy.—Previous to the war, Norfolk is ſaid to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained 8000 inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>"Norfolk carries on a conſiderable trade with Europe, the Antilles, and the northern States. Her exports are flour, wheat, Indian corn, timber of every kind, particularly planks, ſtaves, and ſhingles, ſalt meat and fiſh, iron, lead, flax-ſeed, tobacco, tar, turpentine, and hemp. All theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are the produce of Virginia, or of North Carolina, which latter State, having no ſea-ports, or none that are good, makes her exportations chiefly thro' thoſe of Virginia.</p>
                  <p>"Norfolk is the only port for the ſouthern part of this extenſive State; for, as no veſſels above 120 tons can go up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſent down in lighters to Norfolk, from whence it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Thus, this port almoſt ſingly carries on all the commerce of that part of Virginia which lies ſouth of the Rappahannock, and of North Carolina far beyond the Roanoke.</p>
                  <p>"Ten years ago, Norfolk could not reckon ten large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of her own; whereas at preſent ſhe poſſeſſes fifty of that deſcription, excluſive of fifty others of ſmaller ſize employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Weſt India trade. Under the name Norfolk, are to be underſtood Norfolk and Portſmouth, as they conſtitute but one port of entry, and are both ſubject to the ſame Cuſtom-houſe.—The preſent tonnage of Norfolk is 15,567 tons, excluſive of the veſſels employed in the coaſting trade.</p>
                  <p>"The exportation of Tobacco from Norfolk has, by the diminution of the culture of that article in Virginia, been reduced above one third within the laſt five years. In 1793, it amounted to 15,000 hhds.—in 1794, to 11,054—and, in 1795, to 9,968 hhds. I have not been able to procure an accurate ſtatement of the quantities in 1791 and 92."—</p>

We then adviſed and do again adviſe, that the ſide paths be completed, both for the convenience of ſocial intercourſe and the benefit of trade; and let there be, on both ſides of the ſtreet, a row of Poplars, not only to cover houſes not very handſome, but for the ſake of ſhade and of health, as the trees would act as powerful conductors to carry off diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vapours and impure air: The inhabitants would do well to attend to this circumſtance, of having more trees about their dwellings.—An Act of Aſſembly was obtained to bring water into the ſtreets and houſes, that moſt neceſſary of all elements, particularly in a warm climate, and in a wooden town; but no ſteps have yet been taken to carry this ſalutary law into effect.</p>

               <p>It is ſaid, we do not know upon what grounds, that the owners of property in and about Peterſburg, by a churliſh, impolitic diſpoſition, are very far from being encouragers of improvement—We can ſcarcely believe this report—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the with of ſeeing a reſpectable and flouriſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity riſing around them, the idea of being conſidered the promoters of public proſperity and happineſs, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme pleaſure of being eſteemed and beloved by all their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens—they muſt know, that every improvement made by others, augments the value of <hi>their</hi> property, and that they themſelves, ultimately, will be the greateſt gainers.</p>
               <p>There is one other obſervation which we think it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to make—Altho' the inhabitants of Peterſburg are made up from various nations, Americans, Engliſh, Scotch, Iriſh, French, &amp;c. and entertain very different opinions, yet there is leſs political aſperity diſplayed among them, than perhaps in any town on the continent; "peace and good neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood" ſeems to be their favourite maxim. Without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſearch for the cauſes of this pleaſing effect, we, at once, aſcribe it to the good ſenſe of this people.—Long may this amiable ſuavity continue to be the diſtinguiſhing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of the town of Peterſburg—God knows we have enough of the real troubles of life, without creating artificial ones—let us not embitter the bleſſings we enjoy, by unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary diſcuſſions, nor diſturb the public harmony with fooliſh quarrels about "the colour of beards, or the length of noſes."</p>

               <p>On the 12th of January laſt, about 8 in the morning, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons in Southern Pruſſia ſaw three Suns appear on a ſudden. They roſe majeſtically from the horizon. At ſeven o'clock the ſky was clear and ſerene; a few minutes after it was covered with clouds; and at half paſt eight, there were ſeen in the Eaſt three columns of fire, the middle one of which roſe to the height of 45 degrees. The two others, formed by the other two ſuns, were only a third as big as the middle one; they ſeemed to burn like a blazing fire, and as they roſe produced a very majeſtic and awful effect.</p>

                              <p>NEW YORK, April 17, 1800. On Saturday evening, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 10 and 12, a ſevere ſtorm of rain was experienced in this city, accompanied with very vivid flaſhes of lightening and ſome thunder. The wind was ſoutherly, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere was remarked to be very thick and ſultry, yielding a ſulphurous ſmell. Yeſterday morning, after the ſtorm had abated, an impalpable powder was perceived in the ſtreets, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in thoſe parts where the water had ſubſided, and in the rain-water caſks, reſembling brimſtone. Some ingenious gentlemen have made a collection of this ſubſtance, for the purpoſe of experiment; by one of thoſe gentlemen we are aſſured, that he melted a ſmall quantity of it, and found it anſwer the purpoſes of common brimſtone in the making of matches. This circumſtances is, perhaps, unprecedented; and we mention it with a hope, that wherever it may have occurred, it will attract the notice of philoſophy, as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in every reſpect deſerving a minute inveſtigation.</p>

               <p>A gentleman from Italy, who lately travelled through the United States, gives the following account of this Tree:—</p>
               <p n="1">1. It moderates the heat of the ſummer ſun in meadows, and protects and encreaſes the quantity of hay and paſture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The body of the tree, when full grown, after its bark is taken off and it is thoroughly dried, makes good rails.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its branches, when cut down and dried, afford excellent fire-wood, particularly for cooking in ſummer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The leaves and ſmall twigs of the tree, when plucked or out in the fall of the year, and dried, make a wholeſome fodder for cattle and ſheep during the winter.</p>

               <head>FRENCH TREATY.</head>
               <p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.—Yeſterday the Senate proceeded to conſider the form of ratification of the Treaty reported by a ſelect Committee, which was ſubſtantially that the Treaty be ratified with the exception of the 2nd, and 3rd Articles, and with the addition of two new Articles, one declaring that the Treaty ſhould not be conſtrued in any of its propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to affect any pre-exiſting treaties formed with other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the other limiting its duration to eight years.</p>
               <p>A diviſion of the diſtinct queſtions contained in the form of ratification was called for, when the following queſtions were taken:—</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Shall the 2nd article of the treaty be excepted?—Two thirds of the members not concurring, the queſtion was loſt, and of conſequence the 2d article was not excepted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Shall the 3d article of the treaty be excepted?—Two thirds of the members not concurring the queſtion was loſt, and of conſequence the 3d article was not excepted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Shall the article declaring that this Treaty ſhall not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any pre-exiſting Treaties be agreed to?—Two thirds of the members not concurring, the queſtion was loſt, and of conſequence the new article was not agreed to.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Shall the article, limiting the Treaty to eight years be agreed to?—This queſtion was agreed to by nearly an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vote.</p>
               <p>The firſt three members of the form of Ratification being virtually diſagreed to, the Ratification remained uncondition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, except as to the limitation of the Treaty to eight years.</p>
               <p>On agreeing to this form of ratification there were 16 Yeas, 14 Nays.—The ratification was therefore loſt, there not being two thirds of the members in favour of it.</p>
               <p>The Yeas and Nays were as follow:—</p>

               <p>Feb. 3—This day was brought on in the Senate the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration</hi> of the treaty with the French Republic. The form of Ratification propoſed an <hi>exception</hi> of the 2d article, and a clauſe of limitation in point of time, to eight years' and in this ſhape it was aſſented to, 22 for it, 10 againſt it'—(See p.

               <p>On Tueſday, Feb. 10, Mr. S.

After which, Mr. Bayard made the following motion, and ordered to lie on the table:—</p>
               <p>Reſolved, That a Committee be appointed to prepare and bring in a bill <hi>to amend the Common Law,</hi> ſo as to define and limit the puniſhment upon proſecutions for libels, and to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a defendant, upon ſuch proſecution, to give the truth of the matter charged as a libel, in evidence, in his defence.</p>
               <p>Thus, a Law has at length been got rid of, which never ought to have been enacted, if, as its advocates alledge, the Common Law was fully competent to the evil complained of.—As to Mr. Bayard's explanation, it has the appearance of fairneſs, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to enable the Defendant to plead the truth of the alledged libel.—Mr. Cooper ſays, he was <hi>not</hi> permitted to prove the truth of <hi>his</hi> aſſertions, as Judge Chaſe would not allow him to ſummon, Mr Adams as a witneſs.</p>

               <p>This day at 11 o'clock, the Houſe of Repreſentatives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the Senate chamber, where the votes for Preſident and Vice-Preſident were counted, when it appeared, that <hi>Thomas Jefferson</hi> and <hi>Aaron Burr</hi> had an equal number of votes—(See page 108.)—The Houſe then returned to its own chamber, and, with cloſed doors, proceeded to ballot.</p>
               <p>Upon the ballots being counted, they ſtood thus:—

               <p>There being no election, the Houſe immediately proceeded to a ſecond ballot, when the reſult was the ſame—and thus they continued balloting till Thurſday morning at 9 o'clock; after the 27th ballots, the exhauſted members agreed to poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone buſineſs till 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>At 12, the 28th ballot was taken, and the reſult was the ſame—After which, all further balloting was ſuſpended till next day, Friday.</p>
               <p>At 12 o'clock on Friday, the 29th ballot, and at 1, the 30th ballot were taken, and the reſult the ſame. It was then determined to adjourn till next day.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, at 12 o'clock, the Houſe went into the 31ſt ballot, and the reſult, was the ſame.</p>
               <p>After the 32d ballot, Mr. Dickſon of North Carolina de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that it was high time to put an end to the conteſt, and that henceforth he ſhould vote for Mr. Jefferſon.</p>
               <p>At 2 o'clock, the 33d ballot was taken, and the reſult the ſame—It was then reſolved, to poſtpone further balloting till Tueſday.</p>

This day, Tueſday the 18th, at 1 o'clock, after an awful ſuſpenſe which had excited the fears of all America, and the malicious hopes of her enemies, <hi>Republicanism</hi> was triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant—on the 36th ballot, it appeared, that Mr. Jefferſon had 10 States for him, 4 for Mr. Burr, and two were <hi>blank.</hi>

               <p>Before we conclude this ſubject, we juſt remark, that, on this occaſion, the Federal party loſt a noble opportunity of ſhewing their magnanimity, by unanimouſly voting, after the firſt or ſecond ballot, for Mr. Jefferſon—Inſtead of which, they pertinaciouſly withſtood the wiſh of the majority, and peeviſhly continued to vote for a man they diſliked, and whom, they well knew, was only ſecond in the public choice—It had been well for their character, if they had copied from the laudable example of Mr. Jay of New York, who ſubmitted at once to the general will, proving himſelf to be a good Citizen, a Republican in the true ſenſe of the word.—(See his very ſenſible anſwer to the addreſs of the Federal party in New York.)</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, however blameable the ill-timed obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the Federaliſts <hi>in</hi> Congreſs have been in the opinion of many people, it is right to ſay, that the moſt reſpectable of that party <hi>out</hi> of Congreſs decidedly diſapproved of their conduct, and quietly acceded to the general will.</p>

Guided by the wiſdom and patriotiſm of thoſe to whom it belongs to expreſs the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative will of the nation, I will give to that will a faithful execution. I pray you to convey to the honourable body from which you are deputed the homage of my humble ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgements, and the ſentiments of zeal and fidelity, by which I ſhall endeavor to merit theſe proofs of confidence from the nation and its repreſentatives.</p>

               <p>He then recommends the building a number of 74 gun men of war, and the erection of dock-yards at the following places, <abbr>viz.</abbr> at Portſmouth, New Hampſhire, Boſton, Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, Waſhington, and Norfolk—"and meaſures have been taken to procure ground at New York for capacious dock-yards, &amp;c. contracts have been made for cannon, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"When the United States (ſays Mr. Stoddart) ſhall own a number of 74 gun ſhips, and a ſufficient number of ſtrong frigates, and that it is known they have the means of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, with facility, their naval force, it is hoped we may then avoid thoſe wars in which we have no intereſt, and not ſuffer ourſelves to be plundered or inſulted.
