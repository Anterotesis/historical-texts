            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Reasons offered to the Council by his Excellency the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, against passing the Bill raising 2593 l. 6 s. 8 d.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> THe Bill does not answer the end, there is no Provision made for the Expence of Officers that must be imployed to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>C</hi>ollonies, in raising of the Men, nor for the incidental Charge of marching and transporting the Men to the Fronteers, if they can be raised, (which is yet a doubt) And allowing the Money to be all solvent, and paid at the time appointed (which can never be expected) it cannot answer the Sum of three Pounds a Man, Levy Money, which must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly paid them in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If these Men cannot be levyed upon this Encouragement, there is no Provision made for the security of the Province. Money without hands gives no Defence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though you may allow me to be judge of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Necessity,</hi> the Representatives plainly show they are not of this Opinion, by refusing to allow such a Proviso to be put in the Bill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By this Bill the <hi>P</hi>ower of Detachments seems to be cut off for a twelve Month, the words [<hi>Inevitable Necessity</hi>] will need an Explanation,
<pb facs="unknown:000757_0009_0FAA47B8ECC72A50"/>
which the Assembly (as they have done in another case) will always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be <hi>j</hi>udges of, by which means the People will be blown up to a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>WE are humbly of Opinion with your Excellency, That this <hi>B</hi>ill does not fully nor perfectly answer the end, but we do humbly offer, That after many Debates and Conferences with the Committees of the said Assembly upon these Heads, We do not find any other better ways or means can be at present obtained. And that although there is by the said Act no provision made for incidental Charges, that must certainly accrue in the imploying O<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

            <p>To the <hi>Second,</hi> We are humbly of Opinion, That though in express words, in case the way of raising Men by this <hi>B</hi>ill, without Detachment, fail, there is no other certain way proposed, yet we are humbly of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That if after all means used for levying these Men without Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they cannot be got, it must then be understood, there will then be an Inevitable Necessity for detaching Men out of this Province, and that your Excellency will be pleased to send for the whole House, and so explain that Clause to them.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Third,</hi> We do humbly offer our Opinion to your Excellency, That by this Act, your Excellency's Power of Detaching is not out off, but restrained, as in the fore-going Article is explained, and such an Explanation must prevent all Mis-interpretations on that Head.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Speaker, and you Gentlemen Representatives,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis is the chief Bill upon which our Safety hinges, its for Money to levy Men to recruit his Majesties Companies, for the strengthening of the Fronteers: I have some Exceptions to the wording of it, and the Substance: I was against the passing of it, and gave my Reasons to the Council: It does not seem to answer the end. The Gentlemen of the Council have given me their Opinions under their Hands for passing of it. I have resigned my Reason to theirs, and therefore pass it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I am as tender of the Peoples Ease as any of you, and have earnestly both studied that and their safety. Yet if Men cannot be found for the encouragement you enable me to give, notwithstanding the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and pains I shall take to procure them, and the Fronteers become weak and exposed, I shall think the necessity of Detachments <hi>Inevitable,</hi> being resolved not to lose one foot of this <hi>P</hi>rovince while I have Hands to defend it. When the Disease is desperate, the Cure must be so, and as this is the sharpest Remedy, it shall be the last I shall use, and obvious to all good Men the necessity is inevitable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is a Bill for payment of Debts, contracted long before my arrival: It is commendable in you to keep up the Credit of the Government. I have been as good a Husband of the King's Revenue as ever I was of my own private Fortune. I understand not an Account, I left that part to the Gentlemen of the Council, who are of the greatest Interest amongst you, whom I believe to be honest Men, and to have dealt fairly in the matter of the Publick Accounts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is a Bill to cut off a Deed of Trust, with Uses, for payment of Debts, it is private. I suppose most of your Affairs will call you home I think fit to adjourn you to the 29th of <hi>September</hi> next, and desire Mr, Speaker to adjourn the House accordingly.</p>
