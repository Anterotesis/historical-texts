            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>CHRIST JESUS in the 18th Verſe acquaints the Diſciples with His own Authority: <hi>All Power is given unto Me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> And then He Exerciſes His Authority in Commiſſionating them. And firſt, He tells them to whom they ſhall go. <hi>viz. To all Nations,</hi> as they had Opportunity. They were forbiden formerly to go to the Gentiles. Mat. 10.5. <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any City of the Samaritans enter ye not;</hi> but now He takes off that prohibition, tho' they were firſt
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001999_0003_0FBA56D1F90C6690"/>to offer the Goſpel to the Jews. <hi>Paul &amp; Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> told the Jews, <hi>That it was neceſſary that the Goſpel ſhould firſt be ſpoken to them,</hi> Act. 13.46. Secondly, Here be the ſeveral Offices which they are to Attend. (1) They were to make Diſciples. We render it, Teach the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Diſciple all Nations.</hi> They were to bring them to the acknowledgment of Chriſt &amp; the Profeſſion of the Goſpel. (2) They were to Baptize them in the Name of the Father and of the Son &amp; of the Holy Ghoſt. This is a Seal of the Covenant that ſucceeds in the room of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, Repreſenting our being waſned from our Sins in the blood of Chriſt: This muſt be applied to all Diſciples Adult and Infants. (3) They muſt teach them all rules of Obedience. This comprehends the whole Law of God both Moral &amp; Inſtituted, what ever was their duty to practice, that was the duty of the Diſciples to Preach. This work that He ſets them about was attended with much difficulty, conſidering the corruption of Nature, and the prejudices that both <hi>Jews &amp; Gentiles</hi> were under; therefore He incourages them that He will be with them. He would have them take ſpecial notice of it, <hi>Lo, I am with you.</hi> Mind here, 1ſt. What He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that is, His Preſence. He was about to remove to Heaven, but he tells them, He will
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001999_0004_0FBA56D7099961D8"/>be with them; though He was abſent as to His Humane Nature, yet He would be with them, by His Spirit and His Power. 2ly. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom the promiſe is made, and they are immediately the Eleven Apoſtles: But He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends their Succeſſors alſo. They could live but a little while; But He promiſes His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to the end of the World.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <q>
                  <hi>CHRIST JESUS will be preſent with the Miniſters of the Goſpel to the End of the World.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>CHRIST was eminently with the Apoſtles, ſo that in a ſhort time, they ſet up Churches in many parts of the World, and laid a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, both among civil and barbarous Nations; and tho' Miniſters in theſe days muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch extraordinary gifts, or ſuch wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſucceſs as they had; yet they have the word of Chriſt for it, that He will be with them. They may conclude that Satan will be buſy to oppoſe them: But this is their incouragement that Chriſt will be preſent with them. The work of the Miniſtry is difficult work. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things,</hi> 2 Cor.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001999_0005_0FBA56D81AE9C158"/>2.16. But yet there is no reaſon that they ſhould faint under their burden, for Chriſt ſaith He will be with them. The Miniſters of the Goſpel are Chriſts Miniſters, and their Service is Service for Chriſt, therefore it is no wonder that He will be preſent with them. When God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Children of Iſrael, He tells them that <hi>He will be with him,</hi> Exod. 3.12. So when Chriſt ſends his Miniſters, He tells them that He will be with them; and it is a great Comfort to the People, that Chriſt will be with their Miniſters: and this is not the Privilege of One Generation, or a few Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but of all Generations to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>Here it may be inquired, [1.] <hi>How do Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters need the Preſence of Chriſt?</hi> [2] <hi>How will Chriſt be preſent with them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Queſt. <hi>How do Miniſters need the Preſence of Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>To furniſh them with Gifts for their Work.</hi> There was need of extraordinary Gifts in the beginning of the Goſpel, for the removal of Prejudices: both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> by reaſon of their Education were under Prejudices, and there was need of Miraculous Gifts to prepare them to conſider impartially the Doctrine
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001999_0006_0FBA56D98DE51930"/>taught by the Apoſtles. And Miniſters now need Chriſts preſence to furniſh them with Gifts: there is need of a great deal of Wiſdom <hi>to find out acceptable words</hi> Eccl. 12.10. <hi>The Preacher ſought to find acceptable words.</hi> They need a great deal of Knowledge to accompliſh them for their work: The Miniſter needs great Knowledge in the Scripture to inable him to anſwer all Caſes of Conſcience that may be put to him; to help Perſons that are in the dark to judge aright of their Condition, to inable them to ſee their Sincerity or their Hypocriſy; they need a great deal of Light from Chriſt, that they may underſtand the Truth in things that are controverted, and lead the People in the right way: there be abundance of Miſtakes among Men in Matters of Religion, ſome of them very dangerous, all of ill conſequence; and Miniſters need Light from God, that they may not be blind guides: they need Divine Teaching, that they may be able <hi>to convince</hi> Men that do oppoſe the Truth; and to eſtabliſh them that do receive it He muſt be able to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince gainſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.9. There is a great deal of darkneſs among Men about Matters of Faith, about Moral Rules, and about Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and Miniſters need to be taught of God that they may teach People the good and the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001999_0007_0FBA56DB218807B8"/>right way. It is not enough for a Miniſter to be able to make ſome Edifying Diſcourſes; he ſhould be able to ſet thoſe points that are more intricate in a true light, and to ſpeak accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to all thoſe Caſes that the Souls of Men need help in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To ſtrengthen them againſt Temptation.</hi> The Calling of a Miniſter lays him open to great Temptation, eſpecially thro' a Spirit of Fear to neglect his duty; ſometimes he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Preach ſuch Truths as will be offenſive to ſome, and ſtir up their diſpleaſure and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; ſometimes to give ſuch Reproofs as will be taken very hardly by ſome Men, they will ſtomach it that they are reflected upon; ſometimes he is under a neceſſity to deal with ſome Men, that don't know how to bear it. And there is danger of being out-bid with a Spirit of Fear; ſome are his Friends and he is loth to offend them, he has a dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome, and it is dangerous croſſing them: in ſuch caſes he needs a great deal of help from Chriſt to ſtrengthen his Love and his Faith, that he may be bold to do his duty. When <hi>Jonah</hi> was ſent to cry againſt <hi>Nineveh</hi> becauſe of their wickedneſs, his fear maſtered him, ſo that he fled to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> Jon. 1.2, 3. He was terrifyed to think what uſage he ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001999_0008_0FBA56DD72FF38B8"/>meet with all, and to avoid the anger of Men expoſed himſelf to the anger of God. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs may expoſe them to great Sorrows, the fear of which ſometimes makes to be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>Paul</hi> begs prayers on that account Eph. 6.19, 20. <hi>And for me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the Myſtery of the Goſpel, for which I am an Ambaſſador in bonds, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I may ſpeak boldly, as I ought to ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To protect their Perſons.</hi> In times of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution Miniſters are more expoſed than other Men; they are looked on as the head of their Party, and the principal ſpight is againſt them. <hi>Jezabel</hi> cut off the Prophets of the Lord ſo the Papiſts have a particular Malice againſt them: and about Fifty Years ſince, Two Thouſand Miniſters were ſilenced in <hi>England,</hi> in one day, and many of them expoſed to great ſtraits: and at other times, they are expoſed to many wrongs and injuries, and need help from God for their deliverance. <hi>Paul</hi> was delivered through the Preſence of God. 2 Tim. 4 17. <hi>The Lord ſtood with me, and ſtrengthned me, and I was deliverea out of the Mouth of the Lion.</hi> Chriſt promiſed <hi>Paul</hi> to deliver him, Acts 26.17. <hi>Delivering thee from the People and from the Gentiles to whom I ſend thee</hi> And ſo He did many times. If God had not delivered him, he had not continued in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001999_0009_0FBA56E2CA34E270"/>his work as he did, but would have fallen a Sacrifice to the rage of his Enemies many Years before he did. Acts 26.22. <hi>Having obtained help of God I continue unto this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>To Succeed their Labours.</hi> They need to be proſpered in their labours, that there may be a Reformation wrought in the Land; that thoſe corrupt Practices which bring down the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God may be put away: And in order to this, they need the help of God. It is God's work to prepare Men to Reform. 2 Chron 29.36. <hi>And Hezekiah rejoyced &amp; all the People, that God had prepared the People, for the thing was done ſuddenly.</hi> There is need of Divine help that the labours of Miniſters may be proſperous for the Comforting of Diſconſolate Saints: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are like <hi>Rachel, Refuſing to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</hi> There is need of the Preſence of Chriſt with Miniſters for the Awakning of Sinners and bringing them to Chriſt. Miniſters will Preach to no purpoſe if God do not ſend His Spirit. Miniſters can't open blind Eyes, nor raiſe dead Men to Life. Job. 16.7, 8. <hi>If I depart I will ſend the Comforter unto you, and when he is come, be will reprove the world of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment.</hi> It is God that adds Efficacy to the Ordinances. 2 Cor. 10.4. <hi>The weapons of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> are mighty through God to the pulling
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001999_0010_0FBA56E6EFE4C5D0"/>down of strong holds.</hi> It is God that caſts out Devils. It is Chriſts work to build up His Church. It is a Divine work to make the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the word ſtick in the Hearts of Men. Miniſters may waſte their Spirits, tire their Brains, and weary their Bodies to no purpoſe, if God don't add the operation of His Spirit. If God do not give His Bleſſing to their labours, they may take up that complaint, Iſa. 49.4. <hi>I have laboured in vain, and ſpent my ſtrength for naught and in vain.</hi> Men can remain ſottiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing under the beſt means. <hi>It is God that takes away the heart of ſtone and gives an heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 11.19. Miniſters may take pains and write their Sermons, but it is God only <hi>that writes the Law in the hearts of men.</hi> Jer. 31.33. It is <hi>His Voice that raiſeth dead ſouls,</hi> Joh. 5.25. The Word of God is the Sword of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>How will Chriſt be preſent with them?</hi> How doth He ingage His Preſence? How far may we depend on thoſe words of Chriſt, without ſtraining them? If we conſider the Qualities of many Miniſters, we cannot conceive any eminent Preſence of Chriſt with them; many of the Prieſts of Old were very bad. Jer. 2.8. <hi>The Prieſts ſaid not, Where is the Lord, and they that handle the Law know me not:
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001999_0011_0FBA56E7CA898A50"/>and the Paſtors have tranſgreſſed againſt me.</hi> So the <hi>Scribes &amp; Phariſees</hi> were very corrupt. Mat. 23.3. <hi>Do not after their works, for they ſay and do nor.</hi> And ſo it is at this day in many Countries, eſpecially with ſome Miniſters of the Goſpel; their Practices are ſuch as make many to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the Law.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>CHRIST will be ſo preſent with the Goſpel-Miniſtry, that His viſible Kingdom ſhall be upheld.</hi> If ſome of them be notoriouſly defective of their duty; yet by thoſe that are in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, His work ſhall be carryed on, and His Kingdom ſhall be preſerved throughout all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. The Goſpel ſhall be Preached and there ſhall be thoſe that ſhall make a Profeſſion of the Truth. The Kingdom of Chriſt is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a more fiouriſhing condition, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it withers: but it ſhall never be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of theſe Kings, ſhall the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom, that ſhall never be deſtroyed. Mar. 16.18. <hi>Upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> God has made a donation of an Eternal Kingdom to Chriſt. Pſal. 72.17. <hi>His Name ſhall endure for ever, it ſhall continue as long as the Sun.</hi> How many ſecure, carnal and corrupt men are in the Miniſtry, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute very little to the upholding of His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001999_0012_0FBA56E951629B78"/>yet there ſhall be ſuch a Preſence of Chriſt with ſome that are in the Miniſtry, that neither Perſecutuion nor Hereſy ſhall prevail to root out the Kingdom of Chriſt. God will ſo far proſper the labours of the Miniſtry, that the Church ſhall be Immortal: There ſhall be a Succeſſion of thoſe that ſhall make a Profeſſion of the Goſpel: There ſhall always be Witneſſes for Chriſt, tho' for a long while they Prophecy in Sackcloth. Chriſt ſhall divide the ſpoil with the Mighty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>CHRIST will be ſo preſent with them, that all the Elect ſhall be brought in.</hi> There be a Number whoſe Names are written in the Lambs book of Life: there be a Number that God hath given to Chriſt, and God will bleſs the labours of Miniſters unto their Converſion, &amp; their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in Holineſs. Some Preach Chriſt out of love, and ſome for carnal ends. So it was of Old. Phil. 1 15. <hi>Some indeed Preach Chriſt even of envy and ſtrife, and ſome of good will</hi> But Chriſt doth ſo far bleſs the Preaching and Writing of the Miniſtry, that all the Elect ſhall be brought in. In ſome Ages many are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and in all Ages ſuch as do belong unto the Election of Grace Joh 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall come unto me.</hi> Rom. 11.7. <hi>The Election hath obtained.</hi> Rom. 8.30. <hi>Whom
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001999_0013_0FBA56EB4B61F890"/>he did Predeſlinate, them he alſo Called, and whom be Called, them be alſo Juſtifyed.</hi> Whether the Means be greater or leſs, there ſhall be ſuch a Preſence of Chriſt with them, that all whom God has choſen ſhall be Converted. If any of them live under corrupt and vicious Miniſters, yet they ſhall not miſcarry; the light that they enjoy ſhall prevail for their Converſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Pſal. 132.16. <hi>I will cloath her Prieſts with Salvation.</hi> Chriſt will not looſe any of thoſe that the Father hath given him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>CHRIST will be preſent with many of them and make them gracious.</hi> For the advantage of Religion God will prepare many Godly Men to Preach the Goſpel: The Piety of Miniſters is greatly for the promoting of Religion: Piety makes them more findious: Piety furniſhes them with ſuch Experience, as greatly helps them in their work: Piety makes them more faithful to the Souls of Men; and the ſenſe that People have of their Piety, cauſeth them to lay the more weight on their words, and cauſes the word to fall with more authority on them. God fits Men for the Miniſtry. So God fitted <hi>Paul:</hi> He had choſen him to Preach the Goſpel, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in a wonderful manner. Gal. 1.15, 16. <hi>It pleaſed God who ſeparated me from my Mothers Womb, and called me by his Grace, to reveal his Son
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001999_0014_0FBA56EC4ADCFD98"/>in me.</hi> God promiſed of old <hi>to raiſe up a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Priest,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.35. And ſometimes eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially there ſhall be a great Number of faithful Preachers. Jer. 3.15. <hi>I will give them Paſtors af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mine own heart, that ſhall feed them with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Underſtanding.</hi> Chriſt adviſeth us to Pray that it may be ſo. Mat. 9.38. <hi>Pray ye the Lord of the harveſt, that he would ſend forth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into his harveſt.</hi> And He doth at times eminently anſwer ſuch Prayers. So He did at the time of the caſting off of Popery, which that Scripture hath reference unto, Rev. 14.6. <hi>I ſaw another Angel flie in the midst of Heaven, having the Everlaſting Goſpel to preach to them that dwell on the Earth.</hi> God raiſed up <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> with many others, who did great Service to the Church of God. God Converts ſome Men and then makes them Miniſters. So he did <hi>Paul:</hi> He made him faithful, and ſo put him into the Miniſtry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. And He puts ſome Men into the Miniſtry and then Converts them. They are qualifyed with Gifts and Learning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and after they are entred into the work, God qualifies them with Grace. Acts 6.7. <hi>A great company of the Priests were obedient unto the Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>CRHIST will be graciouſly preſent with
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001999_0015_0FBA56EE01676000"/>them that are faithful.</hi> It is a great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Miniſter to be a faithful Man. Col. 1.7. <hi>Epaphras, is for you a faithful Miniſter of Christ.</hi> Such Men ſhall have the gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. He will own them in their work, tho' it may be in different degrees. God don't give the ſame light to one faithful Man that He doth to another. Some godly Men are left to great Miſtakes. Godlineſs is no ſecurity againſt leſſer Errors. Neither doth He give the like meaſure of protection to one as to another. He appears more eminently for the preſervation of one, and the vindication of one, than of another. He eminently vindicated <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a reward of his faithfulneſs. Numb. 12.7. <hi>My ſervant Moſes is not ſo, who is faithful in all my houſe.</hi> So He doth more eminently ſucceed the labours of one than of another. Some have more abundant ſucceſs, while ſome Men take abundance of pains, and there appears little profit: Others have great occaſion to rejoyce that they have not run in vain. <hi>Paul</hi> had great ſucceſs. Rom. 15.29. <hi>I am ſure, that when I come unto you, I ſhall come in the fulneſs of the bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>USE, I. <hi>This is ground of Encouragement to People, in Praying for the Preſence of God with their Miniſters.</hi> The Miniſter ſhould Pray for
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001999_0016_0FBA56F4037139C0"/>the People, and the People ſhould Pray for their Miniſters, for their own Miniſters, and for the Miniſters of the Land; yea, and for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Chriſtian World. <hi>Moſes</hi> Prays for the Miniſters. Deut. 33.8. <hi>And of Levi he ſaid, Let thy Thummim, and thy Urim be with the holy One,</hi> &amp;c. Verſe 11. <hi>Bleſs, Lord his ſubſtance, and accept the work of his hands. David</hi> did ſo, Pſal. 132.9. <hi>Let thy Priests be clothed with Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> There is ground of incouragement that Chriſt hath promiſed His Preſence with them. This Promiſe may make you bold and free in Praying for them: you may conclude that 'tis acceptable to God ſo to do. You may gather from this Promiſe that you are welcome to Pray for them, that it is a thing ſuitable to the Heart of God, and that there is great hopes that God will accept of ſuch Prayers. Indeed God don't oblige Himſelf as to the degree of this Mercy, but you have no reaſon to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, He allows you to put Him in mind of His Promiſe, and to beg of Him that He would remember His Word, and fulfill it graciouſly. You ſhould look on this Mercy as a Mercy that God delights to beſtow, and ſo come boldly to the Throne of Grace for it.</p>
               <p>There be three faults contrary to this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When People Pray for them for Forms ſake.</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:001999_0017_0FBA56F7F16B8510"/>Many People have got a cuſtom when they make their Prayers, to ſay ſomething in a curſory way for their Miniſters: but it is not upon their heart that God would be with them. We have many People that are violently carrying on worldly deſigns, that are panting after the duſt of the Earth, that make light of the Goſpel, and go one to his Farm and another to his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize: theſe Men are but formal in their Prayers for Spiritual Bleſſings; they ſpend it may be the greateſt part of their time in Prayer about Spiritual Bleſſings, but their hearts don't go with their words. So they Pray for their Miniſters, but it is only of courſe, becauſe it is their manner: their hearts are not much in it that the labours of their Miniſters be bleſſed, either to others or to themſelves; when the words are out of their Mouths they have done with it, they think no more on it; they don't look after their Prayers to ſee what anſwer God gives them; if they be not heard they don't trouble themſelves, their hearts are not on the proſperity of Religion; there is much of <hi>Gallio</hi>'s Spirit in them: <hi>They care not for thoſe matters,</hi> Acts 18. 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When People Pray under the prevailings of diſcouragement</hi> Some Perſons Pray that God would bleſs the Miniſters; Conſcience of duty
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001999_0018_0FBA56FB695AAF68"/>makes them do it, they can't ſatisfie their own hearts to neglect it: but they think it is not worth the while to inſift upon it, for there is very little hope of obtaining any great matter, for things are growing worſe and worſe in the Country; we grow more and more Proud and Worldly, and Intemperate, and there ſeems to be a blaſt upon Ordinances, and People hold faſt deceit, and refuſe to return to God. We ſeem to be like the People of <hi>Judah,</hi> to whom God ſent the Prophets, <hi>Riſing early and ſending them, but they would not hear;</hi> they conclude that the Country will degenerate more and more; they ſay Temptations increaſe and are greatly multiplyed; a ſpirit of rudeneſs and prophaneſs doth abound in the Land; and they are ready to ſay, God ſeems to have little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Prayers of this Nature; that God has forgotten us, <hi>and that our bones are dryed,</hi> as they ſay, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.11. Things look ſo dark that they are out of hope of obtaining any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they think the Country will grow a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Country; they grow out of heart, and don't ſeek earneſtly that it may be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When Men Pray preſumptuouſly for them.</hi> Some err on this hand, either from a miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Promiſes, as if God were ſo bound to bleſs the labours of His Miniſters, that He
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001999_0019_0FBA56FE57DCBBF0"/>had not left Himſelf at liberty, as certainly He ſometimes doth in Judgment, as Iſai. 6.9, 10. <hi>Go tell this People, Hear ye indeed but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, and ſeeing ye indeed but perceive not; make the heart of this People fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, and convert and be healed.</hi> Some preſume from ignorance of the ſtate of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: They think that moſt of the Profeſſors of the Country are godly Men; are not ſenſible that there are many fooliſh Virgins; many that have a Name that they live, and are dead; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have not the Wedding Garment, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle appearance paſſeth with them for holineſs; they are ſomewhat ſtartled to conſider, that there be ſo many Judgments in the Land; but it ſeems to them, that the Country is full of good People, and that there be a great number of Converted Men and Women in the Land; and ſo they preſume that Miniſters ſtill will have a great deal of Succeſs, and that Religion will flouriſh in the Land. Some preſume upon their Prayers, as if they did Merit to be heard; as if their earneſt Prayers muſt needs engage God, and it would not be fair for God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them; whereas if their Prayers be anſwered it is from free Grace.</p>
               <p>

USE, II. <hi>Faithful Miniſters ought to take Encouragement that they ſhall have Chriſts Preſence.</hi> Miniſters are in danger to be diſcouraged; their work is heavy, and attended with a great deal of difficulty, and their Spirits are ready to faint, ſometimes under a ſenſe of their own weakneſs, want of Underſtanding, and Grace for their work, ſometimes upon Experience of Unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfulneſs; they have taken a great deal of pains, and little comes on it; Sins that they reprove are not reformed; Sinners are not Converted; many remain ſenſeleſs, and hard-hearted, as if no Means had been uſed with them: but their hearts ſhould not ſink under their burden. 2 Cor. 4.1. <hi>Seeing we have this Miniſtry, as we have received Mercy we faint not.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus can aſſiſt them in their work, and furniſh them to do their work acceptably; and He can make their work proſperous; He can make their Miniſtry powerful, though Men be very blind, and dead, and have ſtrong inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to continue in a courſe of Sin. And Chriſt has pomiſed His Preſence. He doth not ſay that He will be as much with one as with another; or in what degree He will be preſent; but He promiſeth His Preſence, this ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:001999_0021_0FBA5707CA6043E8"/>
1. <hi>This ſhews that Chriſt is ſenſible that they need His Preſence.</hi> When Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will be with you,</hi> He ſpeaks it in pity and compaſſion. He takes notice that their work is hard, and they are like to meet with many difficulties. He is ſenſible that their work will be too hard for them, if He ſhould leave them alone. He has no Expectation that the work will proſper except He be preſent with them. He knows and takes notice of their inabilities; that let them ſtudy never ſo much, and be exceeding careful in their preparations, and earneſt and hearty in their delivery of their Sermons, let them uſe the moſt proper arguments, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them never ſo fully, and confirm what they ſay by clear teſtimony from the word of God, and purſue the deſign without wearineſs; yet they will not be able to Convince, or to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Men; they can neither reform the Place, nor prevail with Men to comply with the terms of the Goſpel, except He be preſent with them. He has no dependance upon their abilities, to make the Goſpel Efficacious. He is ſenſible it would be a fruitleſs thing to ſend them; He may as well ſend them to remove Mountains, as to perſwade them to fall in with the way of Salvation, Except He be with them. Chriſt is ſo well acquainted with the blindneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001999_0022_0FBA5708F3DCAC20"/>of Mens hearts, that it will ſignifie nothing to ſend them, unleſs He be with them; therefore He promiſes Divine help. Joh. 16.7, 8. <hi>The Comforter ſhall come and convince the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He would have them incourage themſelves in hope of His Preſence.</hi> The very deſign of theſe words is to Comfort &amp; Incourage their hearts. He ſpeaks theſe words to ſupport them, that they may go chearfully about their work. He would have them ſet this Promiſe againſt the difficulties of their work. He ſpeaks theſe words to anſwer their Temptations, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that might ariſe in their hearts. If He ſays, He will be with them, He will not call it Preſumption for them to hope for His Preſence, but He will be angry with them if they do not. Not to be incouraged is to neglect the proper uſe of theſe words: Theſe words, <hi>I will be with you,</hi> are a good foundation for them to Pray in Faith for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt is under bonds to grant His Preſence to the Ministry.</hi> This Promiſe is abſolute to the Miniſtry. I can't ſay that Chriſt is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely bound to make every Miniſter an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Converſion of Souls. A Miniſter may die quickly; or a Miniſter may prove a very corrupt man; or if God ſhould not make a Miniſter an inſtrument to Convert Souls, yet
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001999_0023_0FBA570AE76AD5E8"/>He may make him very Succeſsful as to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing and comforting of Saints; or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Place; or to clear up ſome Divine Truths that were not acknowledged. But this Promiſe, That Chriſt will be with the Miniſters, and make uſe of them for the Converſion of Souls, is abſolute to the Miniſtry; there is no condition expreſſed, neither is there any to be underſtood, for it is by the Service of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry that He intends to carry on His Work, &amp; build up His Church in all Generations. Eph. 4.11, 12. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.</hi> And He has Elect Ones to be brought in in all Ages: There ſhall be a Succeſſion of godly Ones to the End of the World. Pſal. 72.17. <hi>His Name ſhall indure for ever, it ſhall continue as long as the Sun, Men ſhall be bleſſed in him.</hi> The Succeſs of the Miniſtry is held forth in that Parable: Mat. 22.10. <hi>Thoſe Servants went out into the High ways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both good and bad, and the wedding was furniſhed with gueſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Add this likewiſe, <hi>That He hath made good this Word many times Eminently.</hi> The Apoſtles had great Succeſs in one Country and another.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001999_0024_0FBA570F8E2EB108"/>Acts 14.1. <hi>They ſo ſpake that a great Multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.</hi> Acts 19.20. It is ſaid, <hi>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</hi> This ſucceſs in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times is repreſented, Rev. 6.2. <hi>Behold a white horſe, and he that ſat on him had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</hi> There were many in thoſe days that ſuffered Martyrdom: Rev. 12.11. <hi>They loved not their lives unto the death.</hi> So in ſucceeding Ages when they broke off from Popery, many were Converted by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and Sealed the Truth with their blood. And in our days ſeveral Miniſters have had Eminent Succeſs, and God has given a great bleſſing to their labours: And many of them have given great Evidence of their real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion by their holy lives, and the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which they had in a dying day. Many Miniſters may ſay by Experience, as 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.</hi>
               </p>

USE, III. <hi>Ministers ſhould do what they can that they may have the Preſence of Chriſt with them.</hi> It is true, that Chriſt acts ſomewhat arbitrarily in this matter: yet there are rules to be attended that you may engage the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt with you; and it is well worth the while to take care in this matter. It is a great comfort &amp; incouragement to a Miniſter to ſee the Preſence of Chriſt with his labours. It is a ſmile upon him; though it be no certain ſign of Sincerity, yet therein God ſmiles on him: It is an honour to him. When God ſets his Seal to his Miniſtry, God owns him in his work. 1 Cor. 9.2. <hi>The Seal of my Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord.</hi> When God is preſent with his labours He makes him a bleſſing; which was part of the happineſs of <hi>Abraham:</hi> God tells him, <hi>I will bleſs thee and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing.</hi> Gen. 12.2. Dr <hi>Williams,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in his old Age expreſſed himſelf in this manner, <q>That he had born many honourable Offices, but if he did know that he had been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to Convert one Soul to God, it would be more comfort to him, than all the Offices that he had ſuſtained.</q> To be uſeleſs is a reproach, to be an inſtrument to do hurt is a curſe, but to be an inſtrument of good is a great
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001999_0026_0FBA571B59EB7B98"/>honour. Let Miniſters then be careful to get the Preſence of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Be of an unblameable Converſation.</hi> The holy carriages of Miniſters have a natural tendency to beget aregard in the hearts of hearers; holy carriages do command reſpect, and prepare Men to receive advice. They are more ready to believe Men of good than men of bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Holy carriages in Preachers take off prejudices from the Spirits of hearers: It ſeems to Men that ſuch Miniſters urge rules from Conſcience and Compaſſion. But an unholy Converſation diminiſhes Mens authority, their Words don't ſink into the hearts of their hearers, they don't look upon their advice as flowing from a gracious Spirit, but from ſome lower principles. But Men of a holy Converſation have a room in the hearts of others. Beſides, this is a way to engage the Preſence of Chriſt. Evil carriages are abominable to Chriſt, but holy carriages are acceptable to Chriſt. Men that walk holily put honour upon him; and <hi>He will honour them that honour him,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. When Men carry holily, God delights to ſucceed their labours. Mal. 2.6. <hi>He walked with me in Peace and Equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.</hi> But when Men carry corruptly, He many times caſts contempt on them, and their
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001999_0027_0FBA571C67099378"/>Miniſtry is not bleſſed. Mal. 2.8, 9. <hi>But ye are departed out of the way; ye have cauſed many to ſtumble at the Law; ye have corrupted the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Levi, faith the Lord of hoſts: Therefore have. I alſo made you contemptible and baſe before all the People; according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the Law.</hi> An unholy Converſation brings a blaſt upon their labours. The proſperity of Religion don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the labours of Men that do not honour it: their words will not prevail without their practice: they muſt Preach in their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Week days, as well as in the Pulpit on the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Inſiſt on thoſe things that Men ſtand in ſpecial need of.</hi> All Scripture is profitable, but the great deſign of the Scripture and the Miniſtry is to Convert Men to God. Acts 26.18. <hi>To open their blind eyes, to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Some Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſpeak a great deal to Saints to comfort and incourage them; and alas, there be but a few of them in many Congregations: The body of the People are in a periſhing condition; and there is ten times more need that Men be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened and terrifyed. Miniſters ſhould imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.11. <hi>Knowing the terror of the Lord, we perſwade men.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus was
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001999_0028_0FBA571DD8E89640"/>often putting Men in Mind of Hell and the day of Judgment, in the time of His Miniſtry. It is not a little hint now and then, that will make them work out their Salvation with fear and trembling. Many Men are in a faſt Sleep, and whiſpering will not awaken them; the threatnings of God had need ring in their Ears; they are ſo atheiſtical and devoted to the World, that it is well if Thunder &amp; Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning will ſcare them; they are ſo hardned, that talking moderately to them, as <hi>Eli</hi> did to his Sons, takes no more impreſſion on them, than on the Seats of the Meeting houſe. The rule is, Ezek. 6.11. <hi>Thus faith the Lord God, Smite with thy hand, and ſtamp with thy foot, and ſay, alas, for all the abominations of the houſe of Iſrael, for they ſhall fall by the Sword, and by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Preach in ſuch a Manner as is most proper to take with the Conſcience.</hi> Gods way is to bleſs ſuitable Means. He don't bleſs healing Plainſters to eat away proud fleſh; He don't bleſs Cordials to take away ſtubborn humours: If Miniſters deſign to Convert Men, they had need ſpeak peircing words. Eccl. 12 11. <hi>The words of the wiſe are as goads and as nails, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Moster of Aſſemblies.</hi> Some Miniſters affect Rhetorical ſtrains of Speech, as if they
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001999_0029_0FBA571F8E131E70"/>were making an Oration in the Schools; this may tickle the Fancies of Men, and ſcratch Itching Ears; but we have Mens Conſciences to deal with: Men need to be frighted and not to be pleaſed. 1 Cor. 2.4. <hi>My Speech and my Preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom; but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi> We are not ſent into the Pulpit to ſhew our Wit and Eloquence, but to ſet the Conſciences of Men on fire; not to nouriſh the vain humours of People, but to lance and wound the Conſciences of Men. <hi>The word is ſharper than a two-edged ſword, dividing Soul and Spirit, Joints &amp; Marrow, diſcovering the thoughts, and intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4.12. And we ſhould uſe it for that end: The Word is as an Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and we ſhould uſe it to break the Rocky hearts of Men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Be much in Prayer for the Preſence of Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt has made a Promiſe, but He expects that we ſhould ſue it out: As Ezek. 36.37. <hi>Yet will I be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi> We ſhould turn Promiſes into Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions; one end of Promiſes is to help us to Pray in Faith: And this is a way to engage Chriſt more eminently to fulfill the Promiſe. When we Pray for the Preſence of Chriſt, we acknowledge our own inſufficiency, and that we
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001999_0030_0FBA57241C50CB68"/>have need of the Preſence of Chriſt; that we can neither do our work, nor obtain Succeſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Him. When we Pray for His Preſence, we acknowledge that we are unworthy of it; that we cannot challenge it as due, but depend on His Grace, to make it good to us; that we muſt have it in a way of free gift. When we Pray for it, we acknowledge His ſufficiency to help us; that if we have His Preſence, that will be enough, that then we may go chearfully on in our work. When we Pray for it, we ſhew that we lay weight upon His Promiſe, and it is a ſign that if He doth grant His Preſence, we ſhall give Him the Glory, and aſcribe our Succeſs to Him. Therefore we had need be much in Prayer for this, That God's Urim and Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim may with us; this is our encouragement that He has ſaid, <hi>He will cloth his Priests with Salvation,</hi> Pſal. 132.16. And as in the Text, That <hi>He will be with His Miniſters to the End of the World.</hi>

            <head>An Examination of the Power of the FRATERNITY.</head>
            <byline>By the ſame Author.</byline>
            <p>THE miſtakes of one Generation many times become the calamity of ſucceeding Generations. The preſent Generation are not only unhappy by reaſon of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own Minds, but the errors of thoſe who have gone before them, have been a foundation of a great deal of Miſery. Poſterity is very prone to eſpouſe the principles of Anceſtors, and from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Veneration of them, to apprehend a ſacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their Opinions, and don't give themſelves the trouble to make an impartial Examination of them, as if it were a tranſgreſſion to call them into queſtion, and bordered upon Irreligion to be wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about them; and the carnal intereſts of many Perſons has no ſmall influence upon them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to engage violently in the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them.</p>
            <p>And if any particular Perſons have been led by God into the underſtanding of thoſe miſtakes, and have made their differing Sentiments Publick, it has proved an occaſion of much Sorrow; and many People have fallen into Parties, whereby a Spirit of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001999_0032_0FBA572C2227D1F8"/>Lore has been quenched, and great heats have riſen, from whence have proceeded, Cenſures and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and ſometimes Separation &amp; Perſecution. There have been two eminent inſtances of this in latter times. When the People of <hi>England</hi> caſt off the Doctriues of Popery, they retained many of the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as the <hi>Surplice, Croſ, in Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Kneeling at the Lords Supper,</hi> &amp;c. and this has been a wounding thing to their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Generations ſince have been greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed by their Contentions about thoſe things. Many Books have been written for and againſt the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; and ſometimes one party has got the upper hand, and have perſecuted the other with a great deal of harſhneſs and ſeverity, to the undoing of many Families: Sometimes the other party has prevailed, and knew not how to uſe their advantage with moderation, and there is no proſpect of the end of theſe troubles; the diſcords run ſometimes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſometimes lower, but nothing appears in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but that they may be perpetual.</p>
            <p>The other inſtance is in <hi>New-England;</hi> The firſt Planters drew up a Platform of Church Diſcipline, before they had much time to weigh thoſe things, and when they were under prejudices, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of their ſufferings in <hi>England;</hi> and ſome of their Poſterity are mightily devoted to it, as if the Platform were the Pattern in the Mount, and all deviations from it, are looked upon as a degree of Apoſtacy; others have taken the liberty to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, and can diſcover no foundation in the Word of God for many Poſitions therein: theſe differences do much interrupt our quiet and hinder
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001999_0033_0FBA572EC958E220"/>the flouriſhing of Religion. Some Perſons place a great part of their Religion in their being of this or that party; and others who have better Principles, ſpend more of their zeal in theſe Controverſies thau is meet, and thereby it comes to paſs that weightier matters are too much neglected. Mens Corruptions are drawn forth, offences are given, and ſome times offence is taken, to the great diſadvantage of the Intereſt of Religion. There is a neceſſity of the vindicating the Truth, yet we cannot do it without making ſome diſturbance</p>
            <p>In the Platform it is ſuffirmed, <hi>That the Brothren have power of judgment in matters of Cenſure, and power in admitting of Members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Principle is very Popular; it is taking with them to ſee themſelves advanced to a ſhare in the government: They have a greater fondneſs for power than ability to uſe it, and nothing but light as clear as the light of the Sun at Noon day, will prevail with ſome Men to part with one Inch of that power, which they are told, doth belong to them.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall endeavour to clear it up, <hi>That the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church is given unto the Elders, &amp; that the Fraternity have no power in binding &amp; looſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CHRIST JESUS is the abſolute head of the Church, and keeps that part of government en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in His own hands, to appoint Officers and Laws for His Church. The Civil Magiſtrate has power alſo in many Eccleſiaſtical caſes; he may appoint days of Faſting, as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> did, 2 Chren. 20.3. <hi>Jehoſhaphat feared &amp; ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord and proclaimed a Faſt throughout all Judah.</hi> And by the ſame reaſon they may appoint days of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001999_0034_0FBA57318E2598E8"/>they may call Eccleſiaſtical Councils, they may take care of the Maintenance of Miniſters, they may Suppreſs thoſe that give diſturbance to the Church.</p>
            <p>The Elders with the Church have power alſo occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally to appoint days of Faſting or Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p>The Brethren of the Church have power to chooſe their own Officers. It ſeems alſo to belong to the body of the People to appoint where their Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe ſhall be ſet. But Spiritual power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, by admitting of Members, Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Offenders, and taking off of Cenſures, doth belong entirely to the Elders.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Arg. Is from Mat. 16.19. <hi>I will give unto thee the Keys of the King done of Heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou ſhalt looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> And Joh. 20 23. Chriſt ſaith to the Apoſtles <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remit, they are remitted to them, and whoſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> Here you may conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is given: There be two expreſſions of this, The firſt is <hi>the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> This intends power over the Church. The Keys are the Enſign of Authority When <hi>Eliakim</hi> was made Steward of the Kings houſe, it is expreſſed in this manner: Iſai. 22 22. <hi>The Key of the houſe of David I will lay upon his ſhoulder, ſo he ſhall open and none ſhall ſhut, and he ſhall ſhut and none ſhall open.</hi> At this day, when a beſieged City doth render to the beſiegers, they deliver up the Keys as a ſign of their Subjection. The ſecond expreſſion is, <hi>That what he binds on earth is bound in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. This notes a power to inflict Church Cenſures, and alſo to deliver from them: for in <hi>John</hi> it is explained by <hi>permitting &amp; retaining ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001999_0035_0FBA573424CB7AB8"/>
2. The Subject that this power is given unto, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſtly to <hi>Peter</hi> and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, and ſo to their Succeſſors to the end of the World. As the Church is to continue, ſo the government of the Church muſt be continued. Goſpel Ordinances will continue in force to the end of the World; therefore the Goſpel Church is called, <hi>A Kingdom that cannot be moved,</hi> Heb. 12.28. The Key of Doctrine doth belong to the Miniſters, they are the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles to the end of the World: And the Key of Diſcipline belongs to the ſame Perſons that the Key of Doctrine doth belong to. Heb. 13.7. <hi>Remember them that have the rule over you, that have ſpoken to you the Word of God.</hi> The managing of the Keys is a work of Office, and therefore doth belong to thoſe that have Office power in the Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſhew how this Scripture has been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of Papal power; But mind you how it hath been darkned by a violent interpretation among out ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Keys were given to <hi>Peter</hi> partly as an Apoſtle, partly as a Miniſter, partly as a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. This interpretation has more of fancy than truth: If this interpretation were given by inſpired Men, it ought to be received, but there is not a tittle in the Text that looks that way.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt had ſaid, That He gave unto the Church the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Apoſtles, and Paſtors, and Believers, might have put in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pleas for their ſhares of Eccleſiaſtical power; but he doth not promiſe to give power to the <hi>Church,</hi> but to give power to <hi>Peter;</hi> and it would be very ſtrange if he ſhould give power to <hi>Peter</hi> to judge an
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001999_0036_0FBA573512F009A8"/>Offender as he was a Paſtor, and yet further power to him as a Believer to give his Suffrage in the ſame caſe among the Brethren.</p>
            <p>The plain meaning of the Place is this, That as a reward of his hearty confeſſion of Chriſt, Chriſt would beſtow on him the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven by making him an Officer in the Chriſtian Church. And its abſurd &amp; ridiculous to ask whether he is made an Officer as an Officer, or as a Believer. It is all one as if we ſhould ask whether the Staff be given to a Captain as a Captain, or as a common Souldier: or to ask whether the Office of a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be given to him as a Governour, or as a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The giving the Keys to <hi>Peter</hi> gives Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power to him; they are given unto him as one choſen to ſuch an Office.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Arg. Is taken from 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they who labour in the Word &amp; Doctrine.</hi> Heb. 13 17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſumbit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls as they that muſt give account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider 1. Who they are to whom this Honour &amp; Obedience muſt be yielded, that are ſtiled Rulers. And it is very evident that they are Elders, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally if not only Teaching Elders: In Heb. 17.13. They are ſaid to be thoſe <hi>that watch for their ſouls</hi> And v. 7. He ſpeaks of ſuch Rulers, <hi>as have ſpoken to them in the Name of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What their Duty is towards them; <hi>They are to they them,</hi> and to <hi>ſubmit to them.</hi> Whence we may obſerve two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Elders are the only Rulers in the Church;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001999_0037_0FBA573694D45238"/>Ruling in the Church is appropriated to them.</hi> They are not called the Principal Rulers, but <hi>the Rulers.</hi> None elſe has any authority to joyn in Ruling When they are ſaid to be the Rulers, it is excluſive of any other. They that are <hi>the Rulers</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from them that are <hi>Ruled</hi> If Elders are the Rulers, then it is an Intruſion for any other to intermeddle in Ruling. To Vote in matters of Rule is to Rule, therefore they that are not to Rule, are not to Vote. Elders being the only Rulers in the Church, they are to do every thing that is an act of Rule. It is an act of rule to call Offenders to an account, to Cenſure them and Pardon them; ſo to admit Members; therefore theſe Services are to be done by the Elders. For other Men to take upon them, to Vote in theſe caſes, is to uſurp an authority that don't belong to them. Many are willing that the Elders ſhould be Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to order Church Meetings, to order Speech and Silence, to put things to Vote; but Moderators are not Rulers. A Moderator in a Council, is not the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Council. A private Man may be a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator in a Church, that has no Elder, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene to do what is proper for them, yet he is no Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, he is no Church Officer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They muſt be Obeyed &amp; ſubmitted unto; the Church and every Member of it muſt be ſubject to their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But if the Brethren have power to Vote in acts of government, then they have a liberty to obey or diſobey; and particular perſons are only to obey the Elders in caſe there be a concurrence of the Brethren with them If the Elders muſt be obeyed they muſt not be controuled or over ruled by them. There be other titles given to the Elders importing the ſame.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001999_0038_0FBA5739710D24E8"/>They are called <hi>Paſtors</hi> or <hi>Shepherd;</hi> and ſo have a government over the Sheep: the Sheep are not ſit to govern themſelves. They are Overſeers or Biſhops <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. The care of the Church is committed unto them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Arg. <hi>The Miniſters of the Jewiſh Church were the ſole judges in Spiritual cauſes.</hi> Sometimes alſo they were made judges in Civil Cauſes, becauſe they were ſuitably qualified. 1 Chron. 26.29, 30. And <hi>of the Iz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harites, Chenaniah &amp; his Sons, were for the outward bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs over Iſrael, for officers &amp; judges. And of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bronites, Haſhabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a thouſand &amp; ſeven hundred, were officers among them of Iſrael on this ſide Jordan weſtward, in all buſineſs of the Lord, and in the ſervice of the king.</hi> So in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes. But the Miniſters and they alone were judges in ſpiritual cauſes. It is probable from ſome places of Scripture, that ſome Men of other Tribes were admitted to the Miniſtry in Iſrael. The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees were of any Tribe, and they were allowed to be Teachers. Mat. 23.2, 3. <hi>The Scribes &amp; Phariſees ſet in Moſes ſeat, all therefore that they bid you obſerve, that obſerve &amp; do.</hi> And it is probable that they were the Miniſters in ſome of the Synagogues, and did other acts of Office in admitting Proſelytes, and ſitting in judgment on offenders. Mat. 23.15. <hi>Wo to you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for you compaſs ſea &amp; land to make one Proſelyte.</hi> Acts 23.6. <hi>Paul perceived that one part of the council were Sadduces, and the other Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> Yet theſe two things are ſure.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the government of the Church of Iſrael was not a popular government.</hi> The common ſort of People had no judgment in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001999_0039_0FBA5751ED19AF50"/>either Moral or Ceremonial uncleanneſs. There is not one tittle in the word of God that Men were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemned or pardoned by the Vote of the People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Prieſts &amp; Levites were the judges in ſpiritual cauſes. 2 Chron. 19.8. <hi>He ſet of the Prieſts &amp; Levites, and of the chief of the Fathers in Iſrael, for the judgment of the Lord, &amp; for controverſies.</hi> And he tells them, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>That Amaziah the chief Priest was over them in all matters of the Lord, and Zebadiah the Ruler of the houſe of Iſrael in the Kings matters.</hi> And in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult caſes they were to carry their appeal to the place that God ſhould chuſe; if it were an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Caſe to the Prieſts, and if it were a Civil to the Judge, and there the thing was to be finally iſſued. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. from <hi>v.</hi> 7. to 12. And in the caſe of Leproſy, the Man was to be pronounced clean or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean by the Prieſt. Lev. 13.3 <hi>The Prieſt ſhall look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him &amp; pronounce him unclean.</hi> And v. 6. <hi>And the Prieſt ſhall pronounce him clean.</hi> So in the caſe of an unclean houſe, Lev. 14.48. <hi>Then the Prieſt ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the houſe clean, becauſe the plague is healed.</hi> So the Prieſt was to value the unclean beaſt that a Man would redeem. Lev. 27.11, 12. <hi>He ſhall preſent the beaſt before the Prieſt, and the Prieſt ſhall value it, whether it be good or bad, as thou valueſt it who art the Prieſt ſo ſhall it be.</hi> And if the judgment in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes did belong unto the Miniſters of the Jewiſh Church, there is the like reaſon that it ſhould belong unto the Miniſters of the Chriſtian Church Miniſters are now by their Function to perform all ſpiritual Offices in the Church. It was the Miniſters work of old to bleſs the People, ſo it is now; it was the Miniſters work of old to teach the People, ſo it is now; it was the Miniſters work then to put up Publick Prayers, ſo it
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001999_0040_0FBA57548EB5EA38"/>is now; it was the Miniſters work of old to judge in Spiritual cauſes, ſo it is now: Men yeild the caſe, only they ſay, <hi>That the Multitude have a Negative voice, and if they think meet may ſtop their proceedings.</hi> As if the People were to have more privilege &amp; power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, and the Miniſter have leſs. As if the Jewiſh People were not qualified to have an hand in the government, &amp; Chriſtian Miniſters were unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to govern without the Suffrage of the People. As if the Jewiſh Church were more unhappy than the Chriſtian in reſpect of the ignorance or unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the People, and the Chriſtian more unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in reſpect of the ignorance or unfaithfulneſs of their Miniſters.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Arg. <hi>The Community are not fit to judge &amp; rule in the Church.</hi> They muſt be Men of underſtanding that are to judge in Civil cauſes. Exod. 18.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt provide out of all the People able men.</hi> Deut. 1.13. <hi>Take you wiſe men &amp; underſtanding, and known among your Tribes, &amp; I will make them rulers over you.</hi> There is a great deal of intricacy many times in cauſes, &amp; many things are offered to blind the eyes: there may be fair pretences for foul actions. Sometimes it is difficult to find out matter of fact; ſometimes to find out mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of law. So that there is great need of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed for wiſdom to judge Iſrael, and Iſrael took notice <hi>that the wiſdom of God was in him to do judgment,</hi> 1 King. 3. <hi>ult.</hi> But the Community are not men of underſtanding. Wiſe Men are but here &amp; there to be found. Many of them have not had the advantage of Reading &amp; Study. Some of them are Men of very weak Abilities, ſome of them are raſh, ſome of them are Young, hardly Sixteen Years of Age, ſo me of them are Servants; a crafty man may lead a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001999_0041_0FBA57561BC3AE68"/>Score of them by the Noſe; they are uncapable to ſee into an abſtruſe thing. Let the government be put into their hands, &amp; things will be carryed head-long by a tumultuous cry. If the Multitude were to be judges in Civil cauſes, things would quickly be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up ſide down. We have many examples in the Scripture of the ungovernable Spirit of the Multitude. When Chriſt Jeſus ſtood before <hi>Pilate, they cryed out, Crucify him, crucify him.</hi> When <hi>Stephen</hi> pleaded his caſe, <hi>they lift up their voice &amp; ſtopped their ears, &amp; ran upon him with one accord.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> made his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <hi>they lift up their voice &amp; ſaid, Away with ſuch a fellow, it is not fit that he ſhould live.</hi> We have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that Chriſt would intruſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Church with Men ſo uncapable to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. We read <hi>of the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Arg. <hi>They that are impowred by Christ to judge who are diſciples, have power to judge in other cauſes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clefiaſtical; but Miniſters are to judge who are diſciples.</hi> Mat. 28.19. <hi>Go therefore &amp; teach all Nations baptizing them.</hi> The word rendred <hi>Teach,</hi> is, <hi>Diſciple them;</hi> and when that was done, then they were to Baptize them. They were not to ask the Church for liberty to Baptize them, and if the Church were unwilling, then to neglect it; but when they Diſcipled them, they were to Baptize them. If the command had been to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize thoſe that the Church Voted to be diſciples, they ought to have taken a Vote for it: but if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be to Baptize diſciples, they are made the judges who are diſciples. There is the like reaſon for other acts of Office: becauſe they are to give the Lords-Supper to qualifyed Perſons, therefore they are to judge who are qualifyed; and becauſe they are to cenſure impenitent Offenders, they are to judge who
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001999_0042_0FBA575865E687A8"/>are impenitent Offenders; and becauſe they are to forgive them that are Penitent, they are to judge who are Penitent <hi>Paul</hi> Baptized the Jailor &amp; his Family, &amp; <hi>Lydia</hi> without the conſent of any Church. <hi>Philip</hi> Baptized the Eunuch, and <hi>Peter</hi> Baptized <hi>Cornelius</hi> without the conſent of any Church. <hi>Paul</hi> Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated <hi>Hymeneus &amp; Alexander,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.20. but there is no intimation that he had the conſent of the Church. It may be pleaded, <hi>That Paul was an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, &amp; had extraordinary power.</hi> Yet it muſt be yielded that then the Brethren have power of Suffrage only in ſome caſes, &amp; that their conſent is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the validity of the act.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Arg. <hi>It was foretold in the Propheſies of the Old Teſtament, that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould be judges in Eccleſiaſtical Controverſies.</hi> Ezek. 44.24. <hi>In controverſy they ſhall ſtand in judgment, and they ſhall judge according to my judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſider,</hi> What time this has reference unto: And ſurely it don't reſpect the time immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Babiloniſh Captivity;</hi> for the Temple here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of is not <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Temple, for it was not built in that place where <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Temple was, neither was <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Temple built after the meaſures here ſpoken of, neither was the Land then divided accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the form here laid down, neither was there ſuch a Portion laid out for the Prince, neither were there ſuch Waters run out from the Sanctuary, either properly or figuratively, as is here expreſſed; but it doth reſpect the time of the Goſpel Church, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably more eſpecially the time after the deſtruction of Antichriſt. And the ſtate of it is ſet forth by phraſes borrowed from the worſhip that was in the Jewiſh Church.</p>

2. The Perſons ſpoken of: who are the Miniſters of the Goſpel Church. They are compared to the Sons of <hi>Zadock,</hi> for he ſpeaks of thoſe that have the charge of the Sanctuary, that are to teach the People, and to carry on the Publick Worſhip. And ſeveral Rules are given to them to obſerve, that were given of Old to the Levitical Prieſts; as being clothed with Linen Garments, not drinking Wine when they enter into the inner Court, or Marrying a Widow, not coming at any dead Perſon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Duty incumbant on them; <hi>in Controverſy they ſhall ſtand in judgment, and the ſhall judge it according to my judgments.</hi> This muſt be reſtrained to Spiritual or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Controverſies, ſuch as belonged unto the Prieſts of Old. In theſe Controverſies they were to be the judges; others had nothing to do to invade this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Others might not ſtand in judgment. It is uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a power that don't belong to them, to take upon them to judge in Controverſies. And theſe Miniſters muſt judge; whatever other buſineſs they have, they may not neglect this. God expects this Service from them, and they do not the work of their Office if they do omit this. The judging in theſe Controverſies is an act of Authority &amp; Office power, and none but thoſe that are Officers in the Church may take this work upon them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. OBj. Mat. 18.17. <hi>Tell it to the Church, and if he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to hear the Church, let him be to thee as an Heathen Man and a Publican.</hi> Therefore the Brethren have power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The meaning is, <hi>Tell it to the Eccleſiaſtical authority,</hi> in diſtinction from the Civil. <hi>Paul</hi> finds great fault with the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth</hi> for going to Law with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. 1 Cor. 6.6. <hi>Brother goeth to law with Brother.</hi> In caſe of Offences, Chriſt would not have them Proſecute their Brethren at the Law, or avenge themſelves privately; but ſeek to heal them. &amp; accordingly bring them to the authority of the Church His deſign is not to teach them in whoſe hands the Church authority lies, but to teach them the way of the recovery of their Brethren. When
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001999_0044_0FBA575F74D8AFC0"/>Chriſt ſpake theſe words there was no Church in being, but the Jewiſh Church, wherein the Elders did Rule: and this was no new Inſtitution, but a duty all along in the time of the Jewiſh Church: it was only a reviving of an old Law.</p>
            <p>It is no ways ſtrange that he ſhould call the Rulers of the Chuch, <hi>the Church.</hi> Congregational Men muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it is not the whole Church that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but only them that have ſome ſhare in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The Siſters do as much belong to the body of the Church as the Brethren. But beſides, it is frequent in Scripture, to call the Elders of the Congregation, <hi>the Congregation.</hi> Numb. 26.24, 25. <hi>Then the Congregation ſhall judge between the flayer &amp; the avenger of blood, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſhall deliver the ſlayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the Congregation ſhall reſtore him to the City of his refuge.</hi> The Elders repreſent the Congregation, and ſurely it is as proper to call the Elders of the Church, <hi>the Church,</hi> as to call the Elders of the Congregation, <hi>the Congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Obj. 2 Cor. 2.6. <hi>Sufficient to ſuch a Man is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted by many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It were better to read the words. <hi>The puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted before many.</hi> So Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> That this is the meaning is evident.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it was <hi>Paul</hi> alone that gave Sentence on this Man. 1 Cor. 5.3, 4, 5. <hi>I have judged already to deliver ſuch an one to Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is ſpoken as the Evidence of the Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of his puniſhment. If it had been by the Suffrage of many, that would have been no evidence of the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of his puniſhment, it would not been the heavier for the conſent of the Brethren. But this is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heavineſs of it, that it was a Publick puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he was put to open ſhame; he was puniſhed in the preſence of the whole Congregation. <hi>Paul</hi> had directed ſo, that they ſhould be gathered together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. Whereby he was expoſed to the greater ſhame.</p>

3. Obj. 1 Cor. 5.12. <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within</hi> Gal. 6.1. <hi>Ye that are ſpiritual reſtore him.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.14. <hi>Warn the umuly.</hi> Col. 4.17. <hi>Say to Archippus take heed to thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</hi> Rev. 2.20. <hi>Thou ſuffereſt that woman Jezabel</hi> Theſe things were written to the Churches, and ſo ſhew the power of the Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. When the Apoſtle writes to a ſingle Elder, he requires him to do acts of government. Tit 1.5. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Creet, that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City.</hi> And Chap. 3. v. 10. <hi>A man that is an Heretick, after the firſt &amp; ſecond admonition reject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They that are acquainted with the ſtyle of the Prophets, may eaſily obſerve two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they give the reproof to the People of Iſrael, in ſuch caſes, where the Rulers were the Perſons in fault. Am 5 12. <hi>Ye afflict the juſt, ye take a bribe.</hi> Iſai. 5 7 <hi>He looked for Judgment but behold Oppreſſion, for Righteouſneſs but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Cry.</hi> Jer. 6.6 <hi>It is a City to be viſited, ſhe is wholly oppreſſion in the midſt of her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That Commands are ſet down generally, when the Rulers are particularly intended. Iſai. 1 17 <hi>Relieve the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, judge the Fatherleſs, plead for the Widow.</hi> Am 4.15. <hi>Eſtabliſh judgment in the gate.</hi> Zech. 8.16. <hi>Execute the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace and truth in your gates.</hi> It would be ſtrange arguing that becauſe Prophets ſpake theſe things to Iſrael, that the common People muſt have an hand in judging. And that acts of Juſtice were to be done by the Suffrage of the Multitude.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Obj. <hi>The taking away of the power of Brethren is the way to let Corruption into the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. There never was any way of government, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by God and invented by Man, that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to keep Corruption out of the Church. In a little while moſt Churches have ſenſibly declined. The Church of Iſrael, notwithſtanding the order which they were put into by God himſelf, grew corrupt in a little time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Rulers &amp; Teachers of a People grow corrupt, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of Brethren will be a poor defence againſt
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001999_0046_0FBA57666A82B0C0"/>Corruptions. If Magiſtrates &amp; Miniſters grow corrupt, the People are not like to hold their Integrity long. If the beſt ſort of Men grow corrupt, they that are wont to be inferiour to them in Piety, will joyn in the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Jer. 5.31. <hi>The Prophets propheſy falſely, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and my People love to have it ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Humane inventions are not like to keep the Church pure. In Old <hi>England</hi> many Ceremonies are attended under an apprehenſion that they are for decency and to increaſe Devotion. And in <hi>New-England</hi> ſome methods are taken to prevent Corruption &amp; promote Edification. But it don't become Men to reflect upon the wiſdom of God, as if they had underſtanding to mend His Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Obj. <hi>The taking away the power of the Brethren, ſeems to exalt the Miniſter too much, and to degrade the People as if they were very inſignificant Perſons; Whereas ſome Miniſters are weak, and ſome of the Brethren be Men of very good Abilities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Miniſters of the Goſpel are hereby no more exalted than the Miniſters of the Jewiſh Church; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the People debaſed any lower than the People of the Jewiſh Church. The Tribe of Judah was very honourable, yet it is ſaid that of it, <hi>No man gave atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at the Altar,</hi> Heb. 7.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This doth no more exalt the Miniſter or debaſe the Brethren, than the confining of Preaching to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Preaching ſeems to be a Service of more dignity than governing, yet People don't take it hardly that the Miniſter only has the liberty of the Pulpit. It is no great honour to an able Brother, to have as good a Vote in the Church as a Man that can neither Write nor Read. If any of the Brethren be Men of Ability, there are other ways wherein they may uſe their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; and if the Miniſter have five times the Ability as ſome others, he will not think much to be debarred a Vote in Civil Affairs.</p>
            <p>This Matter being thus cleared, there is no occaſion for that Controverſy, <hi>Whether the Votes of the Fraternity in a Council are of equal authority with the Votes of the Elders?</hi>
