            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PLAIN TRUTH, Addreſs'd to the PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>AT a Time when we ſeem to be rent in Pieces by PARTY SPIRIT and PARTY RAGE, I think it a Duty incumbent on every good Subject to make diligent Search, in order to find out the Agreſſors, and then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Public how he has found Matters to ſtand; that ſo common Opinions may be confirm'd or refuted, and the Saddle at laſt be put on the right Horſe, and Peace again reſtored among us.</p>
            <p>FIRST THEN, Let us conſider the Paxton Voluntiers, and others, againſt whom ſome make ſuch an Outcry:— Shall we attempt to vindicate their killing Indians under the Protection of the Government? By no Means. The Fact is to be condemn'd as unlawful; but though we would not vindicate their Conduct in every Reſpect, is it not the Duty of every good Man impartially to conſider what have been the Circumſtances of thoſe People, and what they ſuffered to provoke them to this deſperate and unlawful Act?</p>
            <p>Would not this Courſe diſcover more of that meek and chriſtian Spirit, which ſome People ſo much profeſs and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009646_0004_0F773A3284BA3868"/>
ſo little exerciſe? Nay, do not Candor, Piety, and Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice require that we ſhould admit of every alleviating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in their Favour, rather than take ſo much Pains (as many do) to aggravate their Crime, and make bad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear worſe?</p>
            <p>THESE Incendiaries are not only enraged themſelves, at their dear Friends, the Indians, being ſlain, but would have all the Reſt of the World of their Temper;—To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which End, they have wrote and publiſh'd ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamatory Pamphlets, aſſerting many falſehoods, with a Deſign to enrage the Populace againſt theſe poor diſtreſſed, though raſh People.—Go but into the Houſe of a Quaker, and before you have Time to diſcover what you came for, he will aſk you, with an affected Meekneſs, "Haſt thee ſeen the Maſſacre of the Indians at Lancaſter?"—A Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet well known to be wrote by one of their zealous Friends, in Order to ſwell the Current of Prejudices againſt the aforeſaid People.</p>
            <p>I ſhou'd be glad to ſee the Maſſacre of the Back Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants drawn by the ſame able Hand, provided he would do it with the ſame Zeal in their Favour, and againſt the Savage Indian Butchers, as I'm confident he could have a much more affecting Subject to handle, and fill every Imagination with Horror.—None of thoſe killed at Lancaſter were by Deſign kept one Moment in Torment; whereas many of our Frontier Inhabitants have been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly kept whole Days and Nights in exquiſite Tortures, prolong'd and heighten'd with all the Contrivances infernal Malice could ſuggeſt before thoſe Savages (whoſe Cauſe and Intereſt Quakers ſo warmly eſpouſe) would vouchſafe to give the merciful finiſhing Blow!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:009646_0005_0F773A34841359A8"/>TERRIBLE! indeed beyond Deſcription, are the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties daily practiſed by thoſe Savages on our Fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, while Priſoners amongſt them! But where are the Quakers who have taken up Arms to defend them? Where are the Quakers who have ſympathized with them, or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied their Diſtreſſes? Let their Chriſtian Conduct ſince the Commencement of the War declare.—</p>
            <p>WHEN the Indian Incurſions laſt Summer laid waſte a conſiderable Part of our Frontier, by which near a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Families were drove from their Places, reduced to the utmoſt Poverty, and thrown upon the Public-Charity for the Support of their miſerable Lives.— How did theſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> merciful, compaſſionate Quakers (who would ſeem to monopolize Chriſtian Charity, and all the Tenderneſs of human Nature amongſt themſelves) behave on ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly an Occaſion?—To their immortal Infamy be it known, that when every other religious Society in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even the Roman Catholicks, whom they ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, (tho' ſaddled at the Time with the heavy Expence of building a Chapel) were ſenſibly affected with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of the poor unhappy Sufferers, and promoted very generous and liberal Contributions for their Relief and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, Theſe compaſſionate and merciful Chriſtians, ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily affected with Pity for Indians, would not grant a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Farthing (as a Society) for the Relief of their Fellow Subjects. Tho' Juſtice requires we ſhould exempt from this Odium a few worthy Individuals in the City, who contributed on the Occaſion; as alſo a few others in the Town and Neighbourhood of Lancaſter, who raiſed about Thirty Pounds for the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS when their Good Brethren the Indians (ſome of whom were well known by Officers now in the City, to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009646_0006_0F773A354D2E4480"/>
have been in the Battle againſt Col. BOQUET; and others at the Siege of Fort Pitt, during the Summer) ſeem'd to be in Danger of receiving their juſt Deſerts from the Hands of a bereft and injured People, no Toils or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues by Night or Day are thought too great, nor no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence too much to protect theſe Boſom Friends. Nay, their very fundamental Principles of Non-Reſiſtance, which would never before bend in Defence of King or Country, are chearfully ſacrificed on the intereſting. Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as a Compliment to perfidious Savages.</p>
            <p>THE PAXTON PEOPLE'S coming down armed, in a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hoſtile Manner, is alſo juſtly to be condemned, —But whilſt we condemn particular Facts, let us not miſrepreſent the general Characters of theſe People.</p>
            <p>LET it be conſidered, that they had, long before, ſent ſeveral Petitions to the Governor and Aſſembly, which, its ſuppos'd, have been conceal'd by ſome ill deſigning perſons: And tho' his Honour never receiv'd theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, yet the diſtreſs'd People believ'd he had, and look'd upon themſelves as utterly neglected and their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings deſpis'd by the Government.</p>
            <p>Now let any candid Perſon conſider this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, added to their numberleſs other Diſtreſſes, and he will certainly admit ſuch an Apology for their Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies as the wiſe SOLOMON ſuggeſts, that "Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will make a wiſe Man mad."—And have not all Nations and Generations found it ſo, that when People have been driven to Deſperation by Oppreſſion, they have broken thro' all Obſtacles to right themſelves, if at all in their Power:—Nay, is not the happy and glorious REVOLUTION, by which our civil and religious Rights, as
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009646_0007_0F773A35951FE9C8"/>
ENGLISHMEN and PROTESTANTS, were ſecured on their preſent Footing, a ſtriking Inſtance of this known truth?</p>
            <p>WHAT theſe People intended by their coming down arm'd let themſelves declare. I only obſerve, that the Manner of their Behaviour when they came, did them Honour; as it ſhew'd them to be brave, loyal and diſcreet.</p>
            <p>THEY ſent in a Memorial to the Governor, which was deliver'd by a Member of the Aſſembly (tho' it has ſince been falſely aſſerted, that they never had a Notion of Remoſtrating, till they ſaw how Things ſtood when they came to Germantown) ſetting forth their Grievances, and begging Redreſs; at the ſame Time giving Aſſurance that they did not intend to do the leaſt Injury to any of their fellow Subjects. And that they were ſincere in this Declaration their Conduct has ſufficiently prov'd. They let his Honour know that by ſuch a Time they wou'd be at Germantown, and there halt till he was pleas'd to give them an Anſwer.—It was then propos'd, by Gentlemen of Candour and Humanity, to ſend out Delegates to treat with thoſe People: But this was warmly oppos'd by ſome of the People call'd Quakers, who ſpoke to this Effect.
<q>That they had Force ſufficient to kill the whole, and tho' ſome of the Citizens ſhou'd loſe their Lives, it was better ſo than condeſcend to treat with ſuch a Banditti.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NEVERTHELESS the Gentlemen's Opinion, who were more averſe to ſhedding the Blood of their fellow Subjects than the meek, peaceful, inſpir'd Quakers, did prevail; and the Day following ſome Gentlemen of unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character, went to Germantown, and had a Meeting with Delegates from the Paxton Voluntiers. But inſtead of finding them a ſenſeleſs rude and lawleſs Banditti, they found them a well behav'd and orderly People who avowed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009646_0008_0F773A3649B32B68"/>
(and I believe very ſincerely) the greateſt Loyalty to his Majeſty, and Love to their Country. They were willing to diſperſe and return to their reſpective Homes, provided their Grievances might have a fair Hearing, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly agreed to. Perſons were appointed by them to attend for that purpoſe, and they accordingly diſpers'd without doing any the leaſt Miſchief. They have indeed charg'd the People call'd Quakers with groſs partiality to Indians, and their being unfit for Government: Nay they aſcribe the greateſt part of their ſufferings to them alone. And that Quakers have been partial, and ſhown more real Affection for Enemy Savages than for their fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, of certain Denominations, is ſo well known in this Province, and has on the preſent Occaſion been ſo fully demonſtrated to the World, that I ſhould deem it Loſs of Time to ſay any more on ſo recent and glaring a Fact: Whether the Affection which ſome Principals of that Sect have ſhewn to Indians, and the great Care they are now taking of them can poſſibly be owing to the Charms of their Squaws, to any particular Advantages that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from their Trade, or perhaps rather from the Uſe they have made of them to aſperſe the Proprietaries and oppoſe their Intereſts, may be conſidered as a vain Queſtion, which I will not undertake to determine. But this is certain, that there is not the leaſt Probability that any of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians will ever ſtand as Candidates for Seats in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and it is probable ſome of the Paxton Voluntiers may, if ſuch as bid faireſt ſhou'd not be murdered by ſome of the Savages now in our Cuſtody. Therefore it might ſeem Policy, agreeable to ſome Quakers, not to afford them that Protection, nor ſhew them that Regard they at this Time ſhew the Savages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009646_0009_0F773A3768E82330"/>LET us impartially next conſider Quakers with Reſpect to Government:—Can it be conſiſtent that a Perſon who declares that his Conſcience by divine Inſpiration forbids him to have any Hand in ſhedding Blood, ſhould be intruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a Repreſentative for People who look on themſelves to be obliged by the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature and the Laws of their King and Country to take up Arms to defend themſelves, and puniſh thoſe who would deprive them of Life or Property? Nay, is it not an inexpreſſible Abſurdity that a warlike People ſhould be governed by Perſons of Quaker Principles, and eſpecially in Time of War.—Yet that great Numbers of ſuch have long been Members of our Aſſembly is too true, and that they have often ſpent their Time in debating, whilſt our poor Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Inhabitants, have been Suffering is alſo Truth. And tho' they have at laſt voted Men and Money for warlike Uſes, it was not until they found they could no longer keep their Places of Honour and Truſt without doing ſo. But at the ſame Time they have done every Thing in their Power to prevent any of their own Sect taking up Arms in Defence of their Country; and if at any Time any of their young Men took up Arms againſt our common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they were ſure to be excommunicated, which they call reading out of Meeting.— And is it not certain, that when their King and Country call them to Arms, they plead Conſcience, and will tell thee, with a pious Air, and meek Countenance, "they would rather periſh by the Sword than uſe it againſt the Enemies of the State.— But if any of their Fellow Subjects become obnoxious to their mild and peaceful Rage, by oppoſing any of their arbitrary Meaſures, we then ſee the Quaker unmaſk'd, with his Gun upon his Shoulder, and other warlike Habiliments,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009646_0010_0F773A37CBEFC170"/>
eagerly deſiring the Combat, and thirſting for the Blood of thoſe his Opponents.</p>
            <p>AND here let me obſerve, that the very People whom the Quakers took up Arms to deſtroy, were thoſe who protected their Lives and Properties, whilſt theſe ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People ſat unmoleſted in their Houſes, and were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from feeling the Severities and Contrivances of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Cruelty.</p>
            <p>'TIS owing to the brave Stand which theſe unrequited Voluntiers have made againſt the Inroads of Savages, that the Quakers are now able to treat their Protectors with ſuch Ingratitude.— No Excommunications now for taking up Arms!— Behold the Meeting-Houſe converted into a Place of Arms!—No Preaching nor Praying heard there, but the beating of Drums, and confuſed claſhing of Arms, by Men who knew not how to uſe them. Whilſt ſome of their Preachers are buſied in procuring Powder and Shot, others are employed in refreſhing the Spirit of their brave Soldiers with Wine and other Liquors.— And are theſe the People who are taught by immediate Inſpiration that it is a heinous Crime to fight? What amazing Hypocriſy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in their Profeſſion! They muſt either confeſs that they have hitherto reſiſted the Holy Spirit, or impiouſly aſſert that the Spirit has changed his Mind, and now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to War and Blood, contradictory to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Inſpirations.— But this is to blaſpheme God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the Holy Ghoſt, yet ſuch is their Conduct!</p>
            <p>BUT one of theſe pious Quakers might here ſay,
<q>Thee art miſtaken Friend;— It is true, we profeſs to have an Averſion to War: But this, with moſt of us, is from Policy rather than Principle. Nay we ſecretly rejoice when we hear of whole Settlements murdered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009646_0011_0F773A3891CFB140"/>
And don't thee conſider that the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Back Inhabitants leſſens a growing Party againſt us; whilſt we are proſpering and thriving on the Fat of the Land: And tho' our Malice at preſent is openly pointed only at the Presbyterians; yet to be plain with thee, we are as much in our Hearts again all who differ from us in Opinion: And can thee blame us for ſeeking the Overthrow of all that oppoſe the good Schemes of the faithful? But thee knows it would be impolitic to diſcover our Reſentment to too many Sects at once, for by ſo doing we might endanger our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and our Affairs.</q>
I think there can be only one Objection to ſuch a Declaration from a Man call'd a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and that is, it would be acting with more Openneſs and Honeſty than is generally found amongſt them.</p>
            <p>BUT it may be aſk'd, Why all this Clamour againſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers! Surely they don't ſolely govern. True, Thank God they do not: But if a few artful bad Men in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration may be very detrimental, what may we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend where ſo many Quakers are intruſted, who have lately prov'd their very Religion to be a political Engine, to which they themſelves pay no conſcientious Regard, but as it ſuits their crafty Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>IT was the Obſervation of Conſtantius, Father to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine the great, that, "they who were falſe to their "God, would never be true to their Prince." Upon which he diſcarded the Pagans whom he had prov'd to be ready to embrace any Religion indifferently, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Chriſtians, who firmly adhered to their Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>LET us look round and ſee who are thoſe who enjoy the Places of Profit and Truſt in this Province; (a very few excepted) are they not Quakers or Quaker's Creatures
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009646_0012_0F773A3998624388"/>
and was it not from Policy more than Juſtice, I doubt not they would long e'er now have monopoliz'd the whole to themſelves.</p>
            <p>IT has been argued, if the Indians are guilty, let their Accuſers appear, and not put them to Death without a fair Trial.— Indeed it is a hard Matter to prove an Indian guilty, unleſs he was taken in the Fact; for to Day they are painted red, To-morrow blue, and the next Day any other Colour that they think will beſt prevent their being known; But tho' hard, it is not impoſſible with Reſpect to ſome.— It is certified that a Dutch Woman, now in the Jerſeys, and her little Daughter, ſeeing the Gang of Indians now in our Barracks, paſſing thro' that Province, knew the very Perſons with whom they were Priſoners.— But it has been proved, by a very circumſtantial Oath of a young Man, (who has ſince very unaccountably diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared) that the Quakers, or Perſons who appeared to be ſuch, have conveyed off and concealed thoſe that were moſt ſuſpected.—If this be true, are not they the People who deſpiſe the Laws of their Country, and fly in the Face of Government, by ſtopping the Courſe of public Juſtice? Believe me my Countrymen, thoſe who will ſhelter and conceal a Murderer, would perpetrate a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſuborn or ſuppreſs an Evidence.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid, I hope my Countrymen will coolly conſider whether Quakers are fit to be their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives or not, after ſuch glaring and poſitive Proofs of their Inſincerity; and whether we ought to continue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt them with our Lives and Liberties: But I do not ſpeak of them all, nor condemn the Lump; I do not doubt but there are good Men amongſt them, Men who would not hold the leaſt Part in Government for all the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009646_0013_0F773A3A147096F8"/>
Wealth in the Province.—To govern, is abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the avowed Principles of Quakers: Therefore if they are conſcientious Men, they will not undertake it, and if they are not ſo, ſurely we ſhould not truſt them.— Can any Man of Senſe believe that a conſcientious Quaker will lay hold of any Part of the Reins that govern a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple engaged in Wars, and at the ſame Time declare, that from Conſcience he can have no Hand in War? It is true, every man has Liberty to profeſs his Belief, nor ſhould any be forced to act contrary to it; I only contend for People's adhereing ſtrictly to what they Profeſs, and that thoſe who do not ſhould be looked upon as Deceivers of Men, and therefore not fit to be entruſted.</p>
            <p>THAT Peace and Truth may be promoted, that Juſtice may be practiſed, and that the Hypocrite reign not, leaſt the Peple be enſnared, is the Deſire of</p>

            <p>SINCE I wrote the foregoing, I have had the Pleaſure of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in print the DECLARATION and REMONSTRANCE of the Frontier-Counties. From thence it is evident, That the People have long ſuffered great Hardſhips, and with as much Patience as any of their Neighbours would have done, the Quakers by no Means excepted; who have, on every Occaſion, manifeſted much greater Impatience, and leſs Fortitude of Spirit, if only their political Schemes have been vigorouſly oppos'd.</p>
            <p>IT will appear that the Frontier Inhabitants have been both loyal and peaceable Members of Society, and do not now plead for Favours, but Juſtice; nor ſtrive for Pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, but their eſſential Rights, and a moderate Equality.</p>
            <p>AND I preſume it will be obvious, that whoever endeavours to oppreſs and deprive them of their Rights, act partially, and maliciouſly, and aim to drive them to Extremities, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of what they, in a Manner, forced them to do, and, it would ſeem, deſired they might do.—Let but real Grievances, ſuch as none can pretend to deny, be removed; and let plain Juſtice be done, and the People will be quiet and peaceable Members of the Community as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>IN a Word, let but all juſt Cauſes of complaint be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and then let them be puniſh'd if they make a Noiſe
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009646_0015_0F773A3D07EB38C0"/>
without Cauſe; and all ſenſible Men will approve the Severity.—But—to provoke, and then puniſh them, as it were for that Provocation, raiſes Compaſſion for them even in the Midſt of their Extravagancies, and Reſentment againſt the wilful Oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>TO talk againſt Preſbyterians as ſuch, on this Occaſion, is the Effect either of Malice and Party Spirit, or Nonſenſe; for tho' they happened to be generally Preſbyterians who were ſo abuſed and injured, yet Principles of BRITISH LIBERTY and the Senſe or Sentiments of Nature alone, not of Preſbyteriniſm, or any other Denomination, breath in their Remonſtrance and Petition.—Let any cool Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, before they paſs Sentence, imagine themſelves to be in the very ſame Circumſtances, and then think how they would feel? and let ſuch as obſerve how a juſt Reſentment is apt to tranſport their own Minds, and cauſe them, on leſs Occaſions, to go beyond proper Rules—at leaſt excuſe, tho' not approve ſome unguarded Actions of an injured People.</p>
