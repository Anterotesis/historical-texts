            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>KING <hi>David,</hi> having appointed <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son to ſucceed him in the Throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> expreſs'd his Concern that he might be a wiſe and juſt Ruler, by praying for him, as in the firſt Verſe of this Pſalm, <hi>Give the King thy Judgments, O God, and thy Righteouſneſs unto the King's Son.</hi> The <hi>King's Son</hi> is ſtyl'd the <hi>King,</hi> becauſe he was anointed, and did ſit on the Throne of the Kingdom, his aged Father yet living. This Prayer of <hi>David</hi> for his Succeſſor was acceptable to God, who immediately gave him aſſurance that it ſhould
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003282_0004_0FF03DAA4BBBAD68"/>be granted, by enabling him to foreſee and foretel the Glories of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reign; tho' it muſt be obſerv'd and acknowledg'd, that the Prophecy thereof recorded, does ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately refer to the Kingdom of a <hi>greater than Solomon,</hi> the bleſſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Glory was an illuſtrious Type.</p>
            <p>In this remarkable Prediction (which am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and elegantly deſcribes a happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as we are this Day rejoycing in) we may take Notice,
<list>
                  <item>1. Of the Equity of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>He ſhall judge thy People with Righteouſneſs, and thy Poor with Judgment.</hi> This his good Father pray'd that he might do, and this the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy.</hi> ſaid that he would do; and that he accordingly did ſo, appears from the ſacred Hiſtory of his Reign. He ſoon gave proof of the Wiſdom of God that was in him to do Judgment. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> diſcern'd and pronounc'd, that it was <hi>becauſe the Lord loved Iſrael, that he made him King, to do Judgment and Juſtice.</hi> The Throne is eſtabliſhed by Righteouſneſs, and the King adorned therewith. Job 29.14. <hi>I put on Righteouſneſs, and it clothed me: my Judgment was as a Robe and a Diadem.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Peaceableneſs of his Government; <hi>The Mountains ſhall bring peace to the People,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003282_0005_0FF03DAC99B97AD0"/>and the little Hills by Righteouſneſs—In his days ſhall be abundance of peace.</hi> It is ſaid, that the Mountains and Hills ſhall bring Peace, either only becauſe <hi>Judea</hi> was a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous and hilly Country; or becauſe Peace ſhould ſo abound, as that even thoſe places ſhould be ſafe and quiet, where wild Beaſts and Robbers were wont to lurk, that they might do Miſchief. Happy is the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under which Men lead a quiet and peaceable Life.</item>
                  <item>3. The Mercifulneſs of his Government towards the poor and oppreſſed, and the ſeverity of it toward the inſolent Oppreſſors. <hi>He ſhall judge the poor of the People, he ſhall ſave the Children of the needy, and ſhall break in pieces the Oppreſſor.—He ſhall deliver the needy when he crieth: the poor alſo, and him that hath no helper—he ſhall redeem their Soul from deceit and violence: and precious ſhall their Blood be in his ſight.</hi>—Whereas many Princes did not value the Lives of their poor Subjects, he would make a precious Account of the Blood of the meaneſt and moſt deſpiſed among his People, and defend them againſt thoſe who thirſted for it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it on any that ſhould ſhed it. As good Magiſtrates are Fathers to their Country in general, ſo particularly to the poor, that are moſt helpleſs and expoſed.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003282_0006_0FF03DAEE1FE3988"/>
4. The Piety of his Government: that Religion ſhould flouriſh under it: <hi>They ſhall fear thee</hi> (i. e. God) <hi>as long as the Sun and Moon endure, throughout all Generations.</hi> The building of the Temple, and eſtabliſhing God's Worſhip therein, did promote Religion in <hi>Solomon's</hi> time, which was continued, tho' not without Interruption, in the time of his Succeſſors, the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards until Chriſt, in and by whom this Prediction and Promiſe was moſt fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed <note n="*" place="bottom">Pool.</note> The advancement of pure and undefiled Religion is the great End and higheſt Honour of Civil Government.</item>
                  <item>5. The refreſhing Influence of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, metaphorically ſet forth; <hi>He ſhall come down like Rain upon the mown Graſs: as Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that water the Earth.</hi> Whereas cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are like Storms of Wind and Hail, that deſtroy the Fruits of the Earth, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s juſt and wiſe, kind and gentle Adminiſtration, would be like the Rain that diſtils on the Graſs, and cauſeth it to ſpring again after it has been mowed; like the ſweet Showers that water the Earth, and make all the Fruits of it to revive and look pleaſant. <hi>In his days ſhall the righteous flouriſh.</hi> So when <hi>Job</hi> ſat Chief, and dwelt as a King in the Army,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003282_0007_0FF03DB096278628"/>and choſe out the way of the People, <hi>they waited for him as for the Rain, and they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Mouths wide as for the latter Rain.</hi> Job 29.23. Good Government is like the Rain, comfortable and beneficial; the Fruits produced thereby are alike grateful and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</item>
                  <item>6. The large Extent and vaſt Riches of his Kingdom; <hi>He ſhall have dominion alſo from Sea to Sea,</hi> (from the red to the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Sea) <hi>and from the River</hi> (Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes) <hi>unto the ends of the Earth.</hi> The utmoſt bounds of the Land towards <hi>Egypt. Solomon</hi> reigned over all Kingdoms, from the River unto the Land of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and unto the border of <hi>Egypt.</hi> 1 Kin. 4.21. <hi>They that dwell in the Wilderneſs ſhall bow before him: and his Enemies ſhall lick the duſt,</hi> in token of humble ſubjection to him. <hi>The Kings of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh and of the Iſles ſhall bring Preſents: the Kings of Sheba and Seba ſhall offer Gifts: Tea, all Kings ſhall fall down before him: all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall ſerve him.</hi> This was hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſpoken of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that all Kings ſhall fall down before him, and all Nations ſerve him: but it may be ſtrictly applied to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſhall be literally verified in him, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, at whoſe Name every Knee under Heaven ſhall bow.— <hi>He ſhall live,</hi> i. e. long and proſperouſly, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did, <hi>and to him ſhall be given of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003282_0008_0FF03DB2DD105690"/>Gold of Sheba.</hi> This was done firſt to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> by the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> 1 Kin. 10. and afterwards to Chriſt by the wiſe Men that came from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to worſhip him as ſoon as he was born, Matt. 2.11.</item>
                  <item>7. The pious and dutiful Behaviour of the King's Subjects with reſpect to him, is ſpoken of in my Text, <hi>Prayer alſo ſhall be made for him continually, and daily ſhall he be praiſed.</hi> His People ſhould conſtantly pray for him, which would make him and his Reign ſo great a Bleſſing to them; and every Day ſhould they have occaſion to praiſe him, to commend the Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Goodneſs of his Government.</item>

               <head>
                  <hi>Prop I.</hi> That Prayer ſhould continually be made for the Ruler of a People.</head>
               <p>To pray continually, is, according as the Phraſe is uſed in Scripture, to give one's ſelf to Prayer, to pray very frequently, in all
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003282_0009_0FF03DB6544D0198"/>fit Seaſons, and with unſainting perſeverance. And thus is the Ruler of a People to be prayed for by them. King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s People did no more than was their Duty, when Prayer was made by them for him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>Our ſtrict Obligation to, the great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Reaſonableneſs and Advantage of this religious and loyal Practice, may eaſily be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Will</hi> of the univerſal <hi>Sovereign,</hi> almighty Law-giver and Judge, revealed in the Scriptures, hath made it the indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unqueſtionable Duty of a People to pray continually for their Ruler, or Rulers under him. The declared Will of God is the Meaſure and Ground of our Duty, and ſhould be the Reaſon and Motive of our Obedience. His Commandment is exceeding broad: It extends to all the Relations, civil, ſacred, and domeſtic, which Men ſuſtain, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins and urgeth every Duty belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Among the Duties required in his Word, of a People toward a Magiſtrate, this is undeniably one, that they pray continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for him. We are commanded to <hi>pray for all Men,</hi> and conſequently for thoſe that rule over us. By what is ſaid in our <hi>Text,</hi> the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were admoniſh'd of, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to this their Duty toward <hi>Solomon,</hi> to make continual Prayer for him. The Words
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003282_0010_0FF03DB8C6B1C690"/>of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.1, 2, 3. plainly ſhew what the Will of <hi>God</hi> is concerning this Practice: <hi>I exhort therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that firſt of all Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority.— For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi> It is <hi>good,</hi> being agreeable to the Will and Commandment of God; and <hi>acceptable in his ſight,</hi> becauſe enjoined by his Law. The Service which pleaſeth him is preſcribed by him. In vain do we worſhip him otherwiſe than according to his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is therefore the good and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Will of God, that we ſhould pray, as for all Men, ſo particularly for thoſe in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard to the <hi>publick Good,</hi> Prayer ſhould continually be made for the Ruler of a People. The State of a People is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly proſperous or adverſe, according as their Rulers are good or bad. The ſafety of the Common-Wealth very much depends on the Skill and Faithfulneſs of thoſe who ſit at Helm, and ſteer its Affairs. As Rulers were ordained for this End, ſo they are in the higheſt Capacity to advance the publick Weal; and they have alſo the greateſt Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Opportunities to obſtruct the ſame. The Peace and Proſperity, the Glory and Happineſs, which a juſt and religious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003282_0011_0FF03DBA5D51D430"/>brings to a People, the Spirit of the Lord declares by the Mouth of <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 3, 4. <hi>The God of Iſrael ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael ſpake to me. He that ruleth over Men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God: And he ſhall be as the light of the Morning, when the Sun riſeth, even a Morning without Clouds; as the tender Graſs ſpringing out of the Earth by clear ſhining after Rain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rulers are the light of a People, and as when the Sun ſhineth brightly, there is a pleaſant Day over the face of the Earth, ſo when they ſhine with Wiſdom, Juſtice, Meekneſs and the like, and ſhed abroad the reviving Rays and benign Influences of good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is a chearful Day of Proſperity enjoyed; truly their Light is ſweet. But if they are over clouded with Ignorance and Vice, there is commonly much Darkneſs upon a People, and a melancholly ſtate of things to be ſeen. If they know not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will underſtand, but walk on in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unrighteous and miſchievous Courſes, all the Foundations of the Earth are out of Courſe: And if the Foundations be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what can the righteous do?— Religion flouriſheth or decayeth in a Kingdom or Country, according as Rulers ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves affected thereto in their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Their Examples are uſually more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential on the Morals of People, than their Laws. And therefore, ſince Righteouſneſs
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003282_0012_0FF03DBCA939DD10"/>exalteth a Nation, and Sin is the Reproach and Ruin of a People, it is of unſpeakable Conſequence to them, that their Rulers be Men fearing God, walking before them as their Guides in all paths of Vertue. The Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Rulers deriveth many Bleſſings on a People, and their Wickedneſs involves them in Miſery, and pulls down the ſoreſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on a Land, as the Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> ſheweth, and the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Ages may atteſt. <hi>God</hi> often deals with a People as their Rulers do good or evil in his ſight. <hi>David</hi> was an eminent Saint, <hi>a. Man after God's own Heart,</hi> and remarkable Proſperity did attend his Reign: Yea, the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> far'd the better for that good King after he was dead. "How often did God profeſs for his Servant <hi>David</hi>'s ſake to preſerve <hi>Judah</hi> from Deſtruction?"</p>
               <p>When the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time, was coming with a mighty Hoſt againſt <hi>Jeruſalem, God</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will defend this City to ſave it, for mine own ſake, and far my Servant David's ſake,</hi> Iſa. 37.35. On the other hand, the Inſtances of <hi>God</hi>'s Vengance on a People for the Sins of their Rulers are many. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> did wickedly above all that the <hi>Amorites</hi> did, therefore <hi>the Lord ſtretched over Jeruſalem the Line of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and the Plunament of the Houſe of Ahab.</hi> Among all the Iniquities which drew down ſuch heavy Judgments upon the Land of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003282_0013_0FF03DBEF1BA4538"/>
                  <hi>Judah,</hi> the Sins of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> are reckon'd the chief, the moſt provoking Cauſe. His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try felt the ill Effects of his Wickedneſs after his Death, notwithſtanding his Humiliation and Repentance. When <hi>Joſiah</hi> wrought ſuch a notable Reformation, it is ſaid, <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lord turned not from the fierceneſs of his Wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled againſt Judah, becauſe of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations that Manaſſeh had provoked him withal.</hi> 2 Kin. 23.26 <hi>God</hi> avenged <hi>Saul</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Cruelty toward the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> with a triennial Famine after his deceaſe, 2 Sam. 21.1. <hi>There was a Famine in the Days of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid three Years, Year after Year: And David enquired of the Lord, and the Lord anſwered, it is for Saul, and for his bloody Houſe, becauſe he ſlew the Gibeonites.</hi> Not only the groſs Iniquities of vicious Rulers, but alſo the Faults and Miſcarriages of thoſe that are pious, are the Cauſe, or at leaſt the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God's inflicting Judgments on their People. When good King <hi>David,</hi> in fit of Pride, numbred his People, 'tis expreſly ſaid, 1 Chr. 21.7. <hi>God was diſpleaſed with this thing, therefore he ſmote Iſrael.</hi> So <hi>God</hi> viſited the Pride and Ingratitude of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> upon his Subjects, 2 Chr. 32.25. <hi>Hezekiah ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not again according to the Benefit done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for his Heart was lifted up: therefore there was Wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jeruſalem. God's</hi> Way is equal in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003282_0014_0FF03DC15BF91260"/>tho' Men are apt to be ſtumbled at it: Yea, <hi>David</hi> himſelf ſeems to ſpeak as if He thought, it otherwiſe, 1 Chr. 21.17. <hi>David ſaid unto God, Is it not I that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the People to be numbred? even I it is that have finned and done evil indeed; but as for theſe Sheep, what have they done? let thine Hand, I pray thee, O Lord my God, be on me, and on my Father's Houſe, but not on thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they ſhould be plagued.</hi> Rulers are political <hi>Fathers</hi> of their People, and God righteouſly <hi>viſits the Iniquities of Fathers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Children,</hi> unto the third and fourth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Ex. 20.5. Not that <hi>God</hi> arbitrarily inflicts undeſerved Puniſhment on any: He never puniſheth a People more than their own Iniquities deſerve: But he might exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe more Patience toward them; His Anger would not break out ſo ſoon, nor burn ſo fiercely, were it not for the Provocations of theſe their Fathers. The holy <hi>God,</hi> that he might engage People to do all that in them lieth, to prevent the Corruption of Rulers, and the more deter Rulers from Sin, doth in the Courſe of his Providence viſit the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Rulers upon People.</p>
               <p>From all which it is evident, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good calls for Prayer to be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for the Rulers of a People; that they may be wiſe as Angels of God, impartially juſt, and truly religous, inclin'd to all Vertue, and reſtrain'd from all Sin. In praying for
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003282_0015_0FF03DC429502048"/>thoſe in Authority, we pray for the <hi>peace of Jeruſalem,</hi> the proſperity of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State:</hi> We exerciſe and expreſs Love to our Country, and a due Concern for the publick Welfare. If by Prayer we obtain God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon Rulers, we procure his Favour to the Land, and take the ſhorteſt and moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Way of furthering the publick Good. We are exhorted to <hi>pray for Kings and all in Authority,</hi> on this Account, for this End, <hi>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> Would a People live, and enjoy Quietneſs and Proſperity? Would they have any Honeſty or Godlineſs found amongſt them? then let them pray for all in Authority. They ſhew themſelves true Friends to the publick Intereſt, who pray continually for the Rulers of a People: and thus it may be advanced by thoſe who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any other way be Serviceable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. As without praying for our ſelves, we can have no ground to expect perſonal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; ſo without praying for Rulers we cannot reaſonably hope for publick Bleſſings. We ought to pray for all Men; and we do ſo, and for all kind of Bleſſings in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, when we pray for Kings, and all that are in Authority.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Law of <hi>Gratitude</hi> obligeth People continually to pray for their Rulers. They that exerciſe Authority upon Men are called
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003282_0016_0FF03DC66961FE80"/>
                  <hi>Benefactors,</hi> Luk. 22.25. and if Magiſtrates duly exerciſe the Power they have over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they highly merit this Title from them, for they do a great deal of Good. They are ſtiled <hi>Gods,</hi> not only in reſpect of their Dignity, but becauſe they reſemble him in their extenſive Beneficence. They are the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the Common-Wealth, the main Supporters of it, without which the Fabrick would unavoidably ſink.— They are the <hi>Shields of the Earth,</hi> defending a People from their Enemies. They are the <hi>Shepherds of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that with tenderneſs and Compaſſion feed the People according to the Integrity of their Hearts, and guide them according to the Skilfulneſs of their Hands. To them under <hi>God</hi> People are indebted for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their Lives and Liberties, Names and Eſtates, for the Preſervation of good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and happy Peace, for the Security and Comfort they have in all their Enjoyments. Rulers are <hi>God's Miniſters for good</hi> to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>attending continually on this very thing.</hi> Rom. 12.— They are vigilant and ſolicitous for the temporal Intereſt and ſpirititual Benefit of their People: ſtudious in contriving, and induſtrious in proſecuting Meaſures for the advantage of the Publick. They take much Care and Pains to diſpenſe Judgment, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Virtue, and ſuppreſs Vice. Such Rulers are call'd Lam. 4.20. <hi>the Breath of</hi> a People's <hi>Noſtrils,</hi> and <hi>under their Shadow</hi> they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003282_0017_0FF03DC820CFE318"/>enjoy Safety, eat the Fruits of their Labour, "poſſeſs the Comforts and Conveniencies of Life, with ſecurity from Rapine, from Contention, from Solicitude, from continual fears of Wrong and Outrage."</p>
               <p>People are greatly obliged to ſuch Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and are in Gratitude bound to pray for them, that God would reward them with the choiceſt Bleſſings: <hi>think upon them for good, accoding to all the good which they do to his People.</hi> It is true, that unjuſt and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Rulers do a great deal of Miſchief. <hi>Prov:</hi> 28.15. <hi>As a roaring Lion, and a ranging Bear, ſo is a wicked Ruler over the poor People.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of feeding them as a Shepherd, he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies and devours them, like a roaring Lion and hungry Bear. Yet if Rulers are bad, People receive ſome Good from their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at leaſt in compariſon of the Miſchiefs they would ſuffer from Anarchy, or a total want of Government. And ſo far as any Rulers are beneficial to a People, they ſhould acknowledge the ſame, and deſire and pray for their Good and Happineſs, which they beſt do by praying heartily for their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. <hi>Let the King live,</hi> or <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> was an ancient Form of Prayer, which good Men have uſed even for bad Princes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Need</hi> which the <hi>Ruler</hi> of a People ſtands in of continual Prayer to be made for him, enforceth the Duty under Conſideration.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003282_0018_0FF03DCC0880BE18"/>It is a weighty and difficult Buſineſs which Magiſtrates are employed in: There is a heavy burden lying on them, who have the Government on their Shoulders: And tho' they are called <hi>Gods,</hi> yet are they by Nature Men <hi>of like Paſſions</hi> with others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they depend on <hi>God</hi> for Wiſdom, and all neceſſary Qualifications for Government, and diſireable Succeſs in the management of it. They receive from him, not only Their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but alſo their Ability to rule. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice: By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi> And they need the Prayers of all for them, that the Spirit of the Lord may reſt upon them, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge, and the fear of the Lord; that they may be aſſiſted and proſpered in their Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They have the Infirmities which are common to Men, and they are ſurrounded with peculiar Temptations. Principalities and Powers, wicked Spirits in high Places, the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World bend their Malice and Force eſpecially againſt them. 1 Chron. 21.1. <hi>Satan ſtood up againſt Iſrael, and provoked David to Number Iſrael.</hi> The Devil is reſtleſs in his Endeavours to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Leaders of a People, that theſe may <hi>cauſe the People to err.</hi> They are expoſed more than others to the Snares of this World,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003282_0019_0FF03DCE51EF81C8"/>the Pleaſures, Honours and Riches of it, which are very dangerous Temptations unto them to Luxury, Pride, Avarice and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: So that they need extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Grace, reſtraining and ſanctifying, and ſpecial Aſſiſtances from <hi>God,</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their own and People's Prayers. Such Rulers as have any ſenſe of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God, their need of his Counſel to direct them, his Power to help them, and Mercy to pardon them, <hi>deſire</hi> the Prayers of their People for them: And People violate the <hi>Law of Charity,</hi> if they do not conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly perform this good Office for them. <hi>Darius,</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch, was willing to have an Intereſt in the Prayers of <hi>God</hi>'s Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> therefore he commanded his Officers to furniſh the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Elders with whatſoever they had need of, <hi>that</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>they may offer Sacrifice unto the God of Heaven, and pray for the Life of the King, and of his Sons.</hi> Ezr. 6.10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>GOD</hi> is <hi>glorified</hi> in a ſpecial manner by continual Prayer made for the Ruler of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.— We glorify God whenever, and for whom, and whatſoever we pray as we ought. But by praying for thoſe in Authority, we give Glory to <hi>God</hi> in a way ſomewhat pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar: We do ſpecial Honour to his great Name. For hereby we emphatically confeſs him to be the <hi>God of Gods, the Lord of Lords,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003282_0020_0FF03DD0975EC5D8"/>and King of Kings;</hi> that he is higher than the higheſt on Earth; that Rulers are dependent on him, and ſtand in abſolute need of his Counſel, Succour, and Bleſſing: that without him they can do nothing: that it is he that giveth Salvation to Kings, and to People by them: that the King's Heart is in the Hand of the Lord, as the Rivers of Water he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it whitherſoever he will. We own and avow Him to be our ſupream Benefactor, from whom we receive all that Good which cometh to us thro' the Hands of the chief viſible Miniſters of his Providence. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that we put not our truſt in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom is no help: that we don't repoſe our Confidence in them, nor raiſe our Expectations from them, any otherwiſe than as they are his Agents and Inſtruments, which he is pleaſed to make uſe of for our Comfort and Happineſs. That we don't look that they can be any farther a Bleſſing to us, than he ſhall ſee good to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them ſo. Pſal. 20.9. <hi>Save, Lord, let the King hear us when we call.</hi> As if the People ſhould ſay, <q>Save the King, Lord, preſerve and bleſs him, that when we are diſtreſſed and cry to him for help, he may be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and enabled to help us. Or, Save us, Lord, and that by making our King inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental for our Preſervation, when we ſeek to him for help.</q>—Hence then as we regard the Honour of God, and wou'd bring a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003282_0021_0FF03DD21C29E660"/>Glory to his Name, we ſhou'd pray, continually for the Government over us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Continual Prayer made for the Ruler of a People tends to <hi>engage</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> them to diſcharge their <hi>whole Duty</hi> to him. Men having revolted from <hi>God,</hi> they are naturally averſe from honouring of, and ſubmitting to his Authority which Rulers are veſted with, and are prone to carry irreverently, froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtubbornly toward their lawful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates: Having practically renounced Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the glorious King of all, they are unwilling to yield due Reſpect unto his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Vice-gerents. Not being in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the original Power of the Creator, they do not readily obey the derivative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of earthly Governours.</p>
               <p>Now what better and more effectual Means can People uſe to mortify that Corruption in them, which prompts them to undutiful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour toward their Rulers, than to pray continually for them? The ſincere practice of this Duty would have a mighty Influence into all the reſt which they owe to ſuch as are in Authority, and make them ſubject to the Powers that be ordained of God, and move them to <hi>render Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour.</hi> If we ſincerely pray that Rulers may be faithful in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of <hi>their</hi> Duty, we ſhall be ſeriouſly
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003282_0022_0FF03DD469BB5980"/>concern'd that we may be ſo in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>ours.</hi> If we earneſtly pray for the ſucceſs of their Adminiſtrations, we ſhall be forward to contribute what we are able thereunto. This would keep the Hearts of People well diſpoſed toward their Rulers, and prevent or cure all Tho'ts and Deſires of invading their Prerogatives, infringing their Rights, and impeding their Government. Prayer is the exerciſe of holy Love; and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe increaſeth and confirmeth Habits; and <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> If People are ill affected to their Rulers, Conſcience will accuſe them of Hypocriſy in praying for them: and ſo either their Prayers will be hindered by their evil Diſpoſitions, or elſe theſe will be extinguiſhed by their Prayers.</p>
               <p>Thus it is a plain and important Duty, a reaſonable Service, an excellent, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and uſeful Practice, which is ſpoken of in our Text, as that which ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd with reſpect to a Civil Ruler, <hi>Prayer ſhall be made for him continually.</hi>

But theſe as natural brute Beaſts, made to be taken and deſtroyed, ſpeak evil of the things that they underſtand not, and ſhall utterly periſh in their own Corruption.</hi> See alſo <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 8-10. It may be as commonly from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as ill-Will, that Men ſpeak evil of Dignities: They are wont to accuſe, arraign and cenſure thoſe Proceedings, which they are incompetent Judges of, not having Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or Opportunity to know the Reaſons thereof.

               <p>People ſhould take to themſelves <hi>their ſhare</hi> of the blame of the Miſ-Conduct and Mal-Adminiſtration of the Government over them, and not impute it <hi>all</hi> to their Rulers. Much of the Fault is their own. Their Sins incenſe God's righteous Diſpleaſure, ſo that he withholds or withdraws his Spirit and Preſence from their Rulers, and then thro' the prevalence of Temptations, the Influence of bad Counſel, and the power of their own Luſts and Paſſions, they are miſled into thoſe Courſes, which are deſtructive to the Weal and Tranquillity of a People. It is ſaid, 2 Sam. 24.1. <hi>The Anger of the Lord was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſrael, and he moved David againſt them, to ſay, go number Iſrael and Judah.</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be more ready to judge themſelves, than to inveigh againſt their Rulers, when it goes ill with them: ſhould look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003282_0027_0FF03DE0F45B84C8"/>to be, in part, if not principally, the faulty Cauſe of the ill management of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, and not lay all the blame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of on their Rulers.</p>
               <p>Indeed Magiſtrates are not to be flatter'd in their Vices, nor praiſed for what they do amiſs: They who are to reprove in the Gate, ſhould not fear their Faces, nor ſpare their Sins: But People ſhould not aggravate their Faults, nor raſhly cenſure their Decrees and Acts, which they apprehend to be Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in Government. They ſhould more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obſerve, and with more pleaſure relate, what thoſe in Authority do that is tending to the publick Welfare. They ſhould be very thankful to them for all the Care and Pains they take in conſulting and promoting their Good, in zealouſly defending their Rights, impartially diſpenſing of Judgment, encouraging of good Works, and correcting the evil. People ſhould rejoyce in them as their Light, and ſpeak of them as their great Benefactors: Should praiſe them in the Gate; riſe up and call them <hi>bleſſed;</hi> and ſo encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and comfort the Hearts, and ſtrengthen the Hands of their Rulers, by ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eaſy under their Government.</p>
               <p>Wiſe and pious Rulers, it is true, do not love the praiſe of Men, more than the praiſe of God: Nor ſeek honour of Men in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003282_0028_0FF03DE279DC39B0"/>of the honour that cometh from God only. They are not pleaſed and puffed up with the extravagant Commendations that any beſtow upon them; as <hi>Herod</hi> was, when the People <hi>gave a ſhout</hi> at his fine Oration, and ſaid, <hi>It is the Voice of a God, and not of a Man,</hi> Act. 12.32. They have a greater Reward in view than that of <hi>popular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe:</hi> They are ſolicitous to improve the Talents committed to them, ſo as that they may receive the life-breathing <hi>Euge</hi> from the Mouth of their great Maſter and Judge, <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servants, ye have been faithful over a few things: enter ye into the Joy of your Lord,</hi> Matt. 25.</p>
               <p>But tho' good Rulers don't make the praiſe of Men their great Aim, or ſeek it as <hi>their Reward,</hi> yet they value an Intereſt in the <hi>Eſteem</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> of their People, which their praiſing of them declares; and it is an Encouragement and Comfort to them in all their Cares and Labours for the Publick, to fee People fatisfied with, and thankful for their Adminiſtrations. <hi>Prov. 27.21. As the fining Pot for Silver, and the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace for Gold; ſo is a Man to his Praiſe.</hi> If a Man be wiſe and good, he is by his praiſe made better, more thankful to God, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful to Men, more watchful againſt every thing that may blemiſh his Reputation, more diligent to improve himſelf, and do good to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003282_0029_0FF03DE4E6D27230"/>others, that he may anſwer the juſt Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his Friends from him. Rulers are encouraged to lay out, themſelves for the publick Good, when they are accepted of the multitude of their Brethren. <hi>Eſth.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai the Jew was next unto King Ahaſuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his Brethren, ſeeking the Wealth of his People, and ſpeaking Peace to all his Seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly much Praiſe is due unto good Rulers from an obliged People: It is a <hi>juſt Debt</hi> they owe to their Protectors and Benefactors. The prudent and tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a Country ſhould be acknowledged and bleſſed, as <hi>Job</hi> was when he ſat Chief: <hi>Job</hi> 29.11, 12, 13. <hi>When the Ear heard me, then it bleſſed me; and when the Eye ſaw me, it gave witneſs to me. Becauſe I delivered the Poor when he cried, and the Fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him. The bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me.</hi> Daily ſhould the good Ruler of a People be praiſed, they ſaying of him, or to him, as <hi>Tertullus</hi> unto <hi>Felix,</hi> Act. 24.2, 3. <hi>By thee we enjoy great quietneſs, and that worthy Deeds are done unto this Nation by thy Providence, we accept it always, and in all places with great thankfulneſs.</hi>

To conclude, Let us now be <hi>exhorted</hi> to the ſincere Practice of the Duties recommended from this Text.</p>
               <p>Among the Directions which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and ſo to every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the regular and faithful diſcharge of his Office in the Houſe of God, this was a principal one, That he ſhould take care that <hi>Supplications, Prayers, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men; eſpecially for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</hi> 1. Tim. 4.</p>
               <p>I thought it proper for me to attend this part of my Duty, as a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, at this time, when a univerſal Joy runs thro' this Province, at the ſafe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Arrival of His Excellency <hi>Governour</hi> BELCHER: hoping that a Diſcourſe of this Nature would make the deeper Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on your Hearts, now you are expreſſing ſo much of Duty and Affection toward him our <hi>welcome</hi> Ruler. It was once a Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Eze. 19.14. <hi>She hath no ſtrong Rod to be a Scepter to rule!</hi> But bleſſed be God, this is not yet our Caſe: He hath raiſed up from among the Sons of <hi>New-England,</hi> and by the good hand of his Providence led into the higheſt Seat of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003282_0031_0FF03DEA79745408"/>here, One, who (we truſt) <hi>will naturally care for our State,</hi> and induſtriouſly ſeek the Welfare of his People, rule us with Clemency and Juſtice, and be unto us with Clemency and Juſtice, and be unto us as <hi>the light of the Morning,</hi> when the Sun riſeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a darkſome Night; as the tender Graſs ſpringing out of the Earth by clear ſhining after Rain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let Prayer be made for him continually, and daily let him be praiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is great Cauſe of Thankfulneſs and Praiſe to Almighty <hi>God,</hi> whatever a murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit in any may ſuggeſt to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the Bleſſing we enjoy in our Civil Rulers.— That our <hi>KING</hi> is a nurſing Father, and our <hi>QUEEN</hi> a nurſing Mother, who have expreſs'd their tender Care of, and Concern for us, their poor but dutiful Children, in theſe diſtant parts of their Dominion.— That we have ſuch in <hi>immediate</hi> Authority over us, as are Men of Wiſdom, Integrity, and Piety: <hi>Judges,</hi> in ſo good a meaſure, <hi>as at the firſt,</hi> and <hi>Counſellors as at the beginning: Officers</hi> who are <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Exactors Righteouſneſs.</hi> Solomon obſerves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.2. <hi>When the Righteous are in Authority, the People rejoyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the People mourn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O let us for Conſcience ſake ſtudy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Duty to our Rulers!— Let us pray heartily and continually for them. This is not thought of and practiſed by many, as the importance of the Duty requires. Too many
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003282_0032_0FF03DECC2150520"/>ſpend more of their Time and Breath in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them, cenſuring their Conduct, and venting Complaints againſt them, than they do in imploring God's Direction for them, and Bleſſing on them. Continual Prayer would be found the beſt Method People can uſe for the prevention or redreſs of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that ariſe from the Male-Adminiſtration of Government. This is indiſputably a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Weapon with which they may defend themſelves againſt tyrannical Powers. "I muſt obſerve (ſaid a holy Miniſter of Chriſt, who liv'd in ſome of the unhappy Reigns in <hi>England</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter.</note>) that moſt Chriſtians are ſo cold and formal in their Prayers for the Rulers of the World, and of the Church, that we have great Reaſon to impute the Unhappineſs of Governours, very much to their neglect: Almoſt all Men (ſays he) are taken up ſo much with their own Concernments, that they put off the publick Concernments of the World, and of the Church and State, with a few cuſtomary heartleſs Words; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not the meaning of the three firſt Petitions of the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their precedency, or put them not up with that feeling, as they do the other three. If we could once obſerve, that the generality of Chriſtians were more earneſt and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with God, for <hi>the hallowing of his Name thro all the World, and the coming of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003282_0033_0FF03DEE460CF340"/>and the obeying of his Will in Earth, as it is in Heaven, and the Converſion of the Kings and Kingdoms of the World,</hi> than for any of their perſonal Concernments, I ſhould take it for a better Prognoſtick of the Happineſs of Kings and Kingdoms, than any that hath yet appeared in our Days".</p>
               <p>O that this Duty might be better conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obſerved by us than hitherto it has been!</p>
               <p>Let our Rulers have our ſincere Praiſes, as well as fervent Prayers. They are ſent by God, <hi>for the praiſe of them that do well,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 14. and we are ungrateful indeed to ſuch Benefactors, if we don't make the ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of our Praiſe to them, and accept of their very worthy Deeds for the publick Weal, with great Thankfulneſs. And if we pray, as we ought, continually for thoſe in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, we ſhall have more Occaſion and Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive daily to praiſe them, and to bleſs God for them.</p>
               <p>I conclude the preſent Diſcourſe with the Words that <hi>David the Son of Jeſſe</hi> did his Prophecy concerning <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Government, which was a Type of Chriſt's, and alſo his Prayers, in the cloſe of this Pſalm [And you all join in the Doxology, Interceſſion, and double Amen] <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, the God of Iſrael, who only doth wondrous things. And bleſſed be his glorious Name for ever, and let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory. Amen, and Amen.</hi>
