            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I CANNOT expect to add any thing to your reputation, by dedicating to you the following pages. I mean not, by this act, to chooſe a patron who ſhall veil my faults, or ſcreen me from the cenſure of the public critic. The actions of men, particularly perhaps of young men, are ſometimes diſintereſted. It is with pleaſure I declare to the public, how much I admire your exertions for the extenſion of that amiable ſcience which both of us cultivate: you with the happieſt ſucceſs; I with an humble ardour.</p>
            <p>THE age in which we live is the age of natural ſcience. The mind of LINNAEUS has effected more than the combined intellects of all the naturaliſts of any preceding century. Natural hiſtory, however, is ſtill an infant ſcience. This is particularly the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:033377_0004_0FF6DAAA558F8FD0"/>
caſe with reſpect to America. Even the <hi>nomenclature</hi> of our productions is extremely imperfect. We are ſtill leſs acquainted with the <hi>properties</hi> of our productions. I view this blank in the hiſtory of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with pain. This pain, however, is daily dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: for ſomething is daily added to the ſtock of our knowledge.</p>
            <p>I AM far from inſinuating, that what I offer you is important in its kind. I am fully ſenſible of the imperfections of this Eſſay. I could wiſh it were more worthy of your attention. If I ſucceed in convincing you, that there are ſome lovers and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators of botany in the United-States, one of my objects in writing this dedication will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
            <p>ACCEPT of my ſincere wiſhes for your happineſs, and believe me to be, with great reſpect,</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I HOPE the following pages will be received as an earneſt of my deſire to extend our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the medical properties of the indigenous vegetables of the United-States. I do not expect to acquire any reputation by the publication. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in making this aſſertion, I ſhall not be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when I confeſs that in every thing which I have hitherto publiſhed, I have had reputation in view. If I have not acquired it, I have borne the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment with tranquil indifference.</p>
            <p>THE readers of theſe <hi>Collections</hi> (for every thing that is written and publiſhed ſolicits ſome readers), will form different opinions about my medical faith. Some of them will think I have too much; and others that I have not enough. I certainly do not repoſe implicit confidence in the half of what is ſaid concerning the powers of medicines. Accordingly, I have not given a place in theſe pages to many of our vegetables which have been praiſed as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifics for the cure of diſeaſes; in particular, as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifics againſt the bites of venomous ſerpents. But, on the other hand, it will be aſked, whether I mean
<pb facs="unknown:033377_0006_0FF6DAAF3B31EA58"/>
that all the different vegetables which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſhould have a place in the materia medica of phyſicians? I anſwer, No. But how are we to know what plants are moſt proper for the purpoſes of medicine, until we ſhall have examined the properties of a great body of vegetables? The Digitalis is now thought one of the moſt important of the diuretic me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: but perhaps future inquiries will diſcover a diuretic which ſhall, in a great meaſure, ſuperſede the frequent uſe of this active plant. I wiſh to turn the attention of our phyſicians to an inveſtigation of the properties of their native productions. When it is conſidered how little has hitherto been done in this way, every attempt (mine is an humble one) ſhould be candidly received. I do not mean that its faults ſhould not be pointed out.</p>
            <p>THE arrangement of the articles which I have mentioned is by no means faultleſs: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is liable to many objections. I ſhould not have followed this arrangement had I been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>all</hi> the articles of the materia medica. I ſhall give a ſketch of my ideas of a method of the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in my ſtrictures on the arrangement of the learned and elegant author of the <hi>Botanic Garden,</hi> a poem which unites the fire of Lucretius with the taſte of Virgil, and a learning unequalled by that of Camoëns or of Milton.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:033377_0007_0FF6DAB18E7D88A0"/>
I THINK it but candid to confeſs, that ſince read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this addreſs to the Medical Society, I have made ſome alterations in it. Theſe alterations, however, are very inconſiderable. In general, even the very ſtyle and faults of each phraſe are preſerved, for I had not time to alter or correct much. I have left out the concluding part of the addreſs, relative to the eſtabliſhment of a medical library: not that I doubt the ability of the ſociety to form a library of its own. The notes contained in the appendix were not read to the ſociety.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER may be the reception of this eſſay by the public, whether favourable or unfavourable, I ſhall purſue my inquiries concerning the nature and properties of the natural productions of my native country. I ſhall purſue them, becauſe there is at leaſt a poſſibility that they may ultimately tend to ſomething uſeful: and becauſe I have the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of ſeveral years to teach me, that the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſcience is the extenſion of my happineſs.</p>

            <p>WE have aſſembled together to celebrate the anniverſary of our foundation. It is an occaſion which ought to give pleaſure to us all. We have met, however, for the difficult purpoſe of mingling ſcience with pleaſure. This difficulty falls peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly upon me. By your vote, I have been called upon to deliver the annual diſcourſe. I accepted of the appointment cheerfully, becauſe I was anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to demonſtrate my attachment to the Society, of which I had the honor to be a member at a very early period of my life; a Society in which I firſt imbibed my love of the different ſciences which conſtitute the great fabric of medicine.</p>
            <p>BUT if I accepted of the appointment with pleaſure, I do not addreſs you with confidence. I have found it difficult to ſelect a ſubject for your
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:033377_0009_0FF6DAB6351E7708"/>
entertainment. I, at one time, contemplated a comparative view of the different theories which have prevailed in medicine, in the preſent century. But I ſoon found this ſubject too extenſive for our purpoſe: beſides, in the inveſtigation of this view, I ſhould have been obliged to ſpeak with a freedom, which might not have given pleaſure to every one of us. Men are often attached to theories, as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are attached to their children.</p>
            <p>AFTER ſome difficulty, I have ſelected a ſubject. It is An Eſſay towards a materia medica of the United-States; or, if you pleaſe, An Inquiry what indigenous vegetables of our country may be uſed with advantage in the treatment of diſeaſes. This, you will immediately perceive, is a taſk both exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and difficult. But it is an important one. I ſhall not, perhaps, perform a duty altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to you, if I furniſh you with a few facts, not generally known to you before. This is all I aim at.</p>
            <p>MINE is not the firſt attempt of this kind. Beſides the paper entitled <hi>Specifica Canadenſium,</hi>

                  </gap>nitates Academicae. Vol. iv. Diſſertatio lxxii.</note> Dr. Schoepf, of Erlangen in Germany, has favoured us with a ſpecimen of ſuch a work, under the title of <hi>Materia Medica Americana potiſſimum regni vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilis.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:033377_0010_0FF6DAB89BF2B578"/>
This work was printed in 1787. The author arranges the articles according to the ſexual ſyſtem of Linnaeus. This, though an objection, is not the greateſt. He has given us nothing from his own experience. He aſcribes active powers to plants which are nearly inert, and appears to me to be, in ſome meaſure, governed by the old notion of Signatures: one of the tyrants of the ancient ſchools. He diſcovers none of that infidelity, or, if you pleaſe, ſcepticiſm, which ought ever to be attached to phyſicians: I mean not an infidelity relative to religion; but an unwillingneſs to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce, without good proofs, in the truth of every tale concerning the powers of medicines. This pliant, this credulous diſpoſition, has been one of the cauſes which have obſtructed the regular march of medical ſcience. But as the effort of Schoepf is the beſt of the kind, ſo we ought to tread lightly on his work. He is at leaſt a man of learning; and learning ſhould always claim indulgence from the lovers and cultivators of ſcience.</p>
            <p>I AM far from ſuppoſing that it is in my power, eſpecially on this occaſion, to ſupply all the defects of Schoepf's book. It would be eaſy to point out its faults. I aim at a rude ſketch of our materia medica. It is ſo extremely unfiniſhed, that I have no objection to its being called by any inferior name. I confine myſelf entirely to vegetables.</p>

               <head>MATERIA ALIMENTARIA.</head>
               <p>YOU are all acquainted with the great general diviſion of the materia medica into two parts: that which relates to the aliments, or <hi>nutrientia,</hi> of mankind, and the medical part, more ſtrictly ſo called. Each of theſe is highly important; but I mean in this addreſs to confine myſelf almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the latter branch. Yet the former ſhould claim ſome of our attention. Much may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a country which has bleſſed us with the maize, the potatoe, &amp;c. I could readily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you with a long liſt of the indigenous nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trientia of this country; but ſuch a liſt would be very unintereſting.

THERE grows upon the river Mobile a ſpecies of palm, which is but little known to naturaliſts, but which promiſes to be an important article of food to man. It has no ſtalk or ſtem above ground. The leaves ſpread regularly all round, and when fully expanded are flabelliform. In the centre of theſe leaves is produced the receptacle of the fruit, which is of the form and ſize of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſugar-loaf. This receptacle conſiſts of a vaſt number of drupes, or berries, of the ſize and ſhape of common plumbs: each is covered with a fibrous, farinaceous, pulpy coating of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thickneſs. This ſubſtance is ſaid to reſemble manna in texture, colour and taſte; or, perhaps, it ſtill more reſembles moiſt brown ſugar, with particles of loaf ſugar mixt with it. It is a moſt delicious and nouriſhing food, and is diligently ſought after in the places where it grows. Upon firſt taſting it, it is ſomewhat bitter and pungent.<note n="*" place="bottom">From the information of Mr. William Bartram. MS <hi>penes me.</hi> Vol. i</note>

               <p>THE large tuberous roots of the Smilax China afford our ſouthern Indians a nouriſhing food. The freſh roots are well macerated in wooden mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars. The maſs is then put into veſſels nearly filled with clear water, where it is well mixed with pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.

the water is caſt off, leaving the farinace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubſtance at the bottom. When this is taken out and dried, it is an impalpable powder of a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour. Mixed with boiling water, it becomes a beautiful jelly, which, when ſweetened with honey or ſugar, affords a moſt nouriſhing and pleaſant food for children or aged people.

                  <head>SECT. I. ASTRINGENTS.</head>
                  <p>I THINK it proper, in the preſent ſtate of our knowledge of medicines, to give place to a claſs of ASTRINGENTS. There is the more propriety for the adoption of ſuch a claſs, becauſe we ſee more readily, than with reſpect to many other medicines, their direct mode of operation. Our vegetable aſtringents, I mean the purer and more unmixed aſtringents, are numerous. The barks of all our oaks are of this kind. But I may here particularly mention three or four native aſtringents, which ſeem to be more eſpecially entitled to your attention.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt is the Geranium Maculatum, or Spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Geranium, which grows very plentifully about this city: it flowers in the ſpring. The root is uſed: this boiled in milk has been found an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent medicine in the cholera of children. It is not neceſſary to be very nice about the doſe. I imagine it would alſo prove uſeful in old diarrheas, where
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033377_0015_0FF6DAC473029030"/>
the kino, and other aſtringents are exhibited. If nephritis, of certain kinds, be relieved by aſtringents, this geranium would ſeem entitled to attention, not merely becauſe it is a powerful aſtringent, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſpecies of the ſame genus, the Geranium ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertianum, or Herb-Robert, has been employed with advantage in this diſtreſſing complaint.<note n="*" place="bottom">I am not certain that the Geranium robertianum is a native of any part of America.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Heuchera Americana is the next aſtringent. This is ſometimes called American Sanicle. It is more commonly called Alum-Root. The root is a very intenſe aſtringent. It is the baſis of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which has lately acquired ſome reputation in the cure of cancer. I ſuppoſe all its virtue, in this caſe, depends upon its aſtringency. I may here obſerve, that the diſeaſe of cancer is not confined to civilized nations. It is known among our Indians. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the Cheerake cure it with a plant which is thought to be the Hydraſtis Canadenſis, one of our fine native dies. I do not believe that the Heuchera has cured genuine cancer: but it ſeems certain that it has proved very beneficial in ſome obſtinate ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, which have been miſtaken for cancer. In ſuch caſes, the aſtringent medicines are too much neglected.</p>

                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:033377_0016_0FF6DAC6CD846748"/>
THE Actaea racemoſa, or Black Snake-root, is alſo a valuable medicine. It is ſometimes called Squaw-root, I ſuppoſe from its having been uſed as a medicine by our Indians. The root of this plant is conſiderably aſtringent. In a putrid ſore throat which prevailed in Jerſey, many years ago, a ſtrong decoction of the roots was uſed, with great benefit, as a gargle. Our Indians ſet an high value on it. A decoction of it cures the itch. In North-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, it has been found uſeful, as a drench, in the diſeaſe of cattle called the murrain.</p>
                  <p>THE Uva Urſi<note n="*" place="bottom">Arbutus Uva urſi of Linnaeus.</note> is conſiderably aſtringent. Yet I ſuſpect that it does not operate entirely by virtue of its aſtringent quality. This plant, from my own experience, I can recommend to you as a moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable medicine. It ſhould be in the hands of every phyſician. I have uſed it with advantage in old gonorrhea. But its great virtue is that of a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in nephritis. I am inclined to think that it is peculiarly adapted to caſes of what I call nephritis podagrica, or nephritis depending upon gout. This is one of the plants which is common to the old and to the new-world. It grows plentifully in Canada, New-York, New-Jerſey, &amp;c. Schoepf ſays, the Indians mix the leaves with tobacco.<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 68.</note>

                  <head>SECT. II. TONICS.</head>
                  <p>I BELIEVE all the aſtringent medicines are more or leſs TONIC. But there are a good many tonics which are not aſtringent. There is, certainly, ſome propriety in conſidering the aſtringents and tonics under two diſtinct heads, as Dr. Cullen has done. But, perhaps, the tonics ſhould only form one ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great claſs of ſtimulants. Certain it is, that many of the tonic medicines are conſiderably ſtimulant.</p>
                  <p>THE claſs of tonics is extremely intereſting to phyſicians. It embraces ſome of the moſt valuable medicines with which we are acquainted, ſuch as the Peruvian bark, the extenſive tribe of bitter medicines, as the gentians, &amp;c. The natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of mankind, and perhaps eſpecially the vices to which civilized nations are ſo propenſe, will always render the tonics moſt neceſſary implements in the hands of phyſicians.</p>

OUR woods poſſeſs ſeveral medicines which I am inclined to think might to be uſed, with advantage, as ſubſtitutes for the Peruvian bark. Perhaps, moſt of our Oaks, which are in general different from the oaks of the old-world, are of this kind. Sufficient trials have not been made with them; at leaſt <hi>internally</hi> uſed. <hi>Externally</hi> ſome of them have been employed with advantage. I have uſed the bark of the Spaniſh oak<note n="*" place="bottom">Quercus rubra montana of Marſhall.</note> in gangrene, and I had every reaſon to think it was, in this caſe, equal in power to the beſt Peruvian bark. The bark of the Prunus Virginiana, or Wild-Cherry-tree, has been uſed in intermittent fevers, and found uſeful. This is a very common tree. Its leaves are poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to certain animals, as calves. Even the ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries intoxicate different kinds of birds. The barks of the Common Saſſafras (Laurus Saſſafras) and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimmon (Dioſpyros Virginiana) have likewiſe been found uſeful in intermittents. In the year 1793, I uſed the bark of the laſt of theſe vegetables in an ulcerous ſore throat.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Woodhouſe has favoured us with ſome intereſting information concerning the Perſimmon. See his Inaugural Diſſertation. Philadelphia. 1792.</note> Our Willows have not been attentively examined. We have ſeveral native ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and I believe they poſſeſs nearly the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties which have been aſcribed to the willows of

Europe,<note n="*" place="bottom">Particularly the Salix alba, Salix pentandra, Salix latifolia, &amp;c.</note> by Stone, Haller, and other writers. The Dogwood is a genus which ſeems well worthy of attention. Of this, the Cornus of the botaniſts, there are ſeveral ſpecies in North-America. The moſt common is the Cornus Florida, or Common Dogwood. I find this in every part of the United-States. It is one of our moſt beautiful ſhrubs. It flowers early in the ſpring, and with ſo much regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, that ſome of our ſouthern tribes were accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to name the ſpring ſeaſon from its flowering. The bark is conſiderably aſtringent. It has long been employed in intermittent fevers. A decoction of it has alſo been employed, and found very uſeful, in a malignant fever, called the yellow water, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada diſtemper, &amp;c. which, within the laſt eight years, has carried off great numbers of the horſes in the United-States. The ripe fruit, or berries, infuſed in ſpirit or brandy, make an agreeable bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Our Indians employ an infuſion of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in intermittents. The ſame infuſion has been much recommended by ſome in flatulent cholic. I have uſed it as a tea.</p>
                  <p>THE Cornus ſericea, another ſpecies, is called Red-Willow and Roſe-Willow; which are very improper names. The bark of this is often mixed with tobacco and ſmoken by the ſavages. It has
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033377_0020_0FF6DACDB29E2528"/>
been found but little inferior to the common pale Peruvian bark, in intermittent fevers. This ſpecies grows in wet places, on the ſides of rivers, creeks, &amp;c. and flowers in Auguſt and September. I know nothing of the medical properties of the other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpecies of this genus; viz. Cornus Canadenſis, Cornus Cincinata, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>MANY years ago, Zannichelli, and of late, Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and other writers, recommended the bark of the AEſculus Hippocaſtanum, or Common Horſe-Cheſnut, as a ſubſtitute for the Peruvian bark. This AEſculus is not a native of America, though it thrives very well in the open ground of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, &amp;c. But we have at leaſt two native ſpecies of the ſame genus within the limits of the United-States.<note n="*" place="bottom">AEſculus Pavia of Linnaeus, and AEſculus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I MUST not omit to mention, under this head, the Magnolias. Of this fine genus, we have at leaſt ſix ſpecies, viz. the Magnolia glauca, the acuminata, the tripetala, the grandiflora, the auriculata, and the Fraſeri. I believe they all poſſeſs nearly one general aſſemblage of properties; but of this I am
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033377_0021_0FF6DAD004C275C8"/>
not quite certain. The ſpecies that is beſt known to me is the glauca, commonly called Magnolia, Beaver-tree, and Swamp-Saſſafras. The bark of this is an agreeable aromatic, tonic, bitter medicine. It has been uſed in intermittent fevers. The flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have a powerful and to moſt perſons an agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſmell. It is an emanation which muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a potent ſtimulant, or incitant. I am well acquainted with a phyſician in whom the newly-expanded flower evidently increaſed the paroxyſm of a fever which came on every afternoon; and alſo increaſed the pain of inflammatory gout. This is an intereſting fact. In Virginia, a ſpirituous tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the cones, or ſeed-veſſels, of the Magnolia acuminata, which is commonly called Cucumber-Tree, has been uſed, and we are told very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly, in rheumatic complaints.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. Duncan's Medical Commentaries, for the year 1793. Vol. xviii. p. 445.</note> The bark of the root of the Magnolia grandiflora, ſometimes called Tulip-tree, is uſed in Florida, in combination with the Snake-root, as a ſubſtitute to the Peruvian bark, in the treatment of intermittent fevers. The flowers of the Magnolia tripetala, or Umbrella-tree, have a very powerful ſmell. They often induce nauſea and head-ache.</p>
                  <p>I AM inclined to think that the Cortex Anguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, which has lately been introduced into medical
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033377_0022_0FF6DAD258CA92A8"/>
practice, and is ſo greatly celebrated as a tonic, by the practitioners of Britain, is the bark of ſome ſpecies of Magnolia.</p>
                  <p>THE Liriodendron Tulipiſera, well known in the United-States, by the names of Tulip-Tree, Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, White-Wood, &amp;c. is very cloſely allied, by its botanical character, to the Magnolias. They both belong to the ſame claſs of the ſexual ſyſtem, and both, I believe, poſſeſs nearly the ſame properties. The bark of the Liriodendron is ſometimes uſed in intermittents. Many perſons are of opinion, that in this caſe, it is but little inferior to the Peruvian bark. I have never employed it.</p>
                  <p>THE bark of the Populus tremula? or Aſpin? has likewiſe been uſed in caſes of intermittent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. This is a powerful tonic, and deſerves the attention of the American phyſician. It has been found very uſeful, as a ſtomachic, in the diſeaſes of our horſes.</p>
                  <p>THE Snake-root, the Ariſtolochia Serpentaria, is one of the more ſtimulating tonic bitters. It is certainly a valuable medicine, in the ſecond ſtage of certain fevers, after the inflammatory diatheſis has been removed. It was uſed with great benefit, in a moſt malignant fever, attended with carbuncles,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033377_0023_0FF6DAD4D93BDAA8"/>
which prevailed at Briſtol, on the Delaware, in this ſtate, in the years 1749 and 1753. Another ſpecies of this genus, the Ariſtolochia ſipho of L'Heritier, grows in the neighbourhood of Pitts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, and in other parts of the United-States. This is a large, climbing plant. The root has a pungent, aromatic taſte, and for certain purpoſes is perhaps preferable to the common Snake-root.</p>
                  <p>I SHALL conclude this ſubject of tonics by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we poſſeſs a good many of the bitter plants of Europe, which have long claimed the attention of phyſicians. Our Gentians have not been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examined. We have one ſpecies which appears to be equal to any of the officinal kinds yet known.</p>

                     <p>I THINK that many of our different balſamic pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts may, with propriety, be conſidered under the head of GENERAL STIMULANTS, though they are certainly not the moſt diffuſible articles of this claſs. Such is the reſin of the Populus balſamifera, called Balſam, or Tacamahaca-Tree. This is a native of North-America and of Siberia. The reſin is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the leaf-buds. This balſam is ſo very penetrating, that it communicates its peculiar ſmell and taſte to the fleſh of certain birds which feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the buds.

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033377_0025_0FF6DAD985452AB8"/>
in diarrheas. Some of our ſouthern Indians mix the dried leaves with tobacco, for ſmoking.</p>
                     <p>To the head of ſtimulants I have no heſitation in referring a number of poiſonous vegetables, with the properties of which we are not ſo well acquainted as we ought to be. Such are the Datu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Stramonium, or James-town-weed, the Cicuta maculata, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>THE Datura is one of our moſt common plants. It is certainly a medicine poſſeſſed of uſeful powers. The properties of this vegetable have lately been more ſatisfactorily inveſtigated by one of our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Dr. Samuel Cooper.</p>
                     <p>WE have ſeveral native plants of the natural order umbelliferae. That deſcribed by the late Dr. James Greenway, under the name of Cicuta vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa, ſhould be carefully inveſtigated. This, from his account, muſt either be a direct ſedative, or a ſtimulant, whoſe firſt operation is very ſoon accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. It kills without inducing pain or convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Perhaps the plant with which ſome of our Indians, when weary of life, deſtroy themſelves, is the ſame. It grows in meadows, and has a root like a parſnip.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE I take leave of theſe poiſonous plants, I may mention ſome others whoſe properties are but
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033377_0026_0FF6DADBE9696CD8"/>
little known. The firſt is the Rhododendron max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imum, or Pennſylvania Mountain-Laurel. This is certainly a poiſon. It is a ſpecies of the ſame genus as the Rhododendron Cryſanthmum, which has lately acquired much reputation in the cure of chronic rheumatiſm.</p>
                     <p>NEARLY allied to the Rhododendron is the genus Kalmia. Of this we have ſeveral ſpecies, and all of them are poiſons. The Kalmia latifolia, or Broad-leaved Laurel, is beſt known to us. It kills ſheep and other animals. Our Indians ſometimes uſe a decoction of it to deſtroy themſelves. In the county of Lancaſter, an empiric has uſed the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered leaves with ſucceſs in certain ſtages of fevers, and in tinea capitis. A decoction of the plant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally applied has often cured the itch; but it muſt be uſed with great care, for thus applied it has been known to occaſion diſagreeable ſubſultus, or ſtartings, and convulſions. I have given the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this plant internally in a caſe of fever, and have thus, at leaſt, aſcertained that it may be uſed with ſafety.</p>
                     <p>THE medical properties of our different ſpecies of Andromeda and Azalea, which in botanical character are very nearly akin to the Rhododendron and Kalmia, are but little known to me. I have long ſuſpected that they are poiſons. A decoction of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033377_0027_0FF6DADE4914F768"/>
the Andromeda Mariana has been found uſeful as a waſh in a diſagreeable ulceration of the feet, which is not uncommon among the ſlaves, &amp;c. in the ſouthern ſtates.</p>
                     <p>THE Gaultheria procumbens, which we call Mountain-Tea, is ſpread very extenſively over the more barren, mountainous parts of the United-States. It belongs to the ſame claſs as the plants juſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. I have made uſe of a ſtrong infuſion of this plant, which is evidently poſſeſſed of a ſtimulant and anodyne quality. I am told it has been found an uſeful medicine in caſes of aſthma. But I have not learned to what particular forms of this diſeaſe it is beſt adapted, nor in what manner it operates.</p>
                     <p>OUR native ſpecies of Laurus deſerve to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigated. The Camphor and the Cinnamon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this genus: but hitherto, they have not been diſcovered within the limits of the United-States. The properties of the Common Saſſafras, which is a ſpecies of Laurus, have not been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently examined. It is the Laurus Saſſafras of the botaniſts.

                     <p>THE celebrated Gynſeng, or Panax quinquefoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, may, with propriety, be thrown into the claſs of ſtimulants. I find it difficult to ſpeak of this plant with any degree of certainty.

                     <p>THE Eryngium aquaticum, or Water-Eryngo, is one of the ſtimulants which more eſpecially act as ſudorific. It is nearly allied in its qualities to the

The whole body of the patient is covered with the leaves. An univerſal ſweat, or rather veſcication, is induced, and the patient often recovers.

                     <p>THE bark of our White-Walnut, or Butternut, the Juglans cinerea of Wangenheim, is a pretty efficacious bliſter. The bark of the root is more powerful than that of the ſtem or branches. It has been applied with advantage, as a bliſter, to the bite of ſome of our venomous ſerpents.</p>
                     <p>I BELIEVE the bark of our Mooſe-wood, or Leather-wood, the Dirca paluſtris of Linnaeus, is alſo a bliſter. This plant, by its botanical habit, is nearly allied to the genus Daphne, all the ſpecies of which are bliſters; eſpecially the Daphne Gni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</p>
                     <p>SOME of our Indians make uſe of a plant, which, when maſhed a little, induces nearly as good a bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as the cantharides. It has been uſed with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in ſciatica. I do not know this plant.</p>
                     <p>THE Ranunculus ſceleratus, or Celery-leaved Crowfoot, is a very acrid plant.

                  <p>AMONG the indigenous vegetables of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there are ſeveral which are entitled to your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention as EMETICS. Such are the Euphorbia Ipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacuanha, the Spiraea trifoliata, the Aſarum Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt of theſe, the Euphorbia Ipecacuanha, like all the ſpecies of the genus, is an extremely active plant. It is employed as an emetic by ſome of the country-people. I do not know the doſe. I ſuppoſe it is ſmall, for it belongs to the head of draſtic emetics. I am not certain that it would be a valuable addition to the materia medica; but, perhaps, it would. There are many caſes in which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033377_0034_0FF6DAEE8A8490E0"/>
we have occaſion to make uſe of immediate and active emetics; as when certain poiſons, ſuch as laudanum, &amp;c. have been ſwallowed. In ſuch caſes it may poſſibly be of much uſe.</p>
                  <p>I CAN ſpeak with more confidence of the Spiraea trifoliata. This is a ſhrub, which grows very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in various parts of the United-States. It is one of the few active plants of the claſs <hi>Icoſandria,</hi> to which it belongs. The root, which is the part made uſe of, like that of the officinal ipecacuanha, conſiſts of a cortex or bark, and a ligneous or woody part. The active power of the root ſeems to reſide excluſively in the bark. It is a ſafe and efficacious emetic, in doſes of about thirty grains. Along with its emetic, it ſeems to poſſeſs a tonic power. It has accordingly been thought peculiarly beneficial in the intermittent fever, and it is often given to horſes to mend their appetite. This plant has a number of different names, ſuch as Ipecacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anha, Indian-Phyſic, Bowman's Root, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>WE have ſeveral ſpecies of the genus Aſarum, or Aſarabacca. I am beſt acquainted with the Aſarum Canadenſe, which is well known by the name of Wild-Ginger. In Virginia it is called Coltsfoot. Both the root and leaves may be uſed. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed juice of the freſh leaves is a powerful emetic.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:033377_0035_0FF6DAF0DED3D0B0"/>
SOME of our Indians alſo prepare an emetic from the bark of a certain vine, which a good deal reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Celaſtrus ſcandens of Linnaeus. This vine bears bunches of red berries of a ſweetiſh taſte, but of a poiſonous nature. I know nothing of this plant from my own experience; but a gentleman<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. John Heckewelder.</note> who has uſed it prefers it to every other emetic. The Indians make a decoction of the bark. A large doſe is required to produce the effect. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an objection againſt its uſe.</p>
                  <p>A DECOCTION of the Eupatorium perfoliatum, or Thorough-wort, is alſo emetic. I might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that this plant is uſed by our Indians as a medicine in intermittent fevers.</p>
                  <p>THE root of the Sanguinaria Canadenſis<note n="†" place="bottom">Called, in the United-States, Indian-Paint, Puccoon, Turmeric, &amp;c</note> has been mentioned to me as an emetic. I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing particular of this property of the plant. I ſhould have obſerved, under the head of General Stimulants, that the ſeeds appear to poſſeſs nearly the ſame quality as the ſeeds of the Datura Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE been aſſured, that the Six-Nations make uſe of at leaſt twelve or fourteen different emetic.

All them, except the ſulphat of iron, are vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. It is probable that the Spiraea, Euphorbia Ipecacuanha, &amp;c. are among the number of theſe vegetable emetics.</p>
                  <p>I SHALL conclude this ſubject of emetics by recommending to your attention an examination of the properties of ſome of our native ſpecies of Viola, or Violet. I ſuſpect it will be found, that the roots of ſome of theſe are endued with an uſeful emetic quality.</p>

                  <p>WE have many indigenous CATHARTICS. Some of them are well worthy of your attention. Theſe may be divided into two kinds, the milder, and the more draſtic.</p>
                  <p>AMONG the more mild, I may mention the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſteum perſoliatum, ſometimes called Baſtard-Ipecacuanha. This, when given in very large doſes, ſometimes proves emetic; hence the vulgar name. But I find it a good cathartic. The cortex, or bark, of the root is employed. I give it in doſes of twenty and thirty grains. On ſome occaſions, it has ſeemed to operate as a diuretic. But this may have been only an accidental circumſtance. Rhubarb ſometimes produces the ſame effect, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by C. Piſo.</p>

                     <pb n="30" facs="unknown:033377_0037_0FF6DAF58AE1E768"/>
NEARLY allied to the Trioſteum, I mean in its properties, is the Aſclepias decumbens. This is one of our moſt beautiful and common plants. It has received many vulgar names, ſuch as Pleuriſy-root, Flux-root, Butterfly-weed, &amp;c. It has been much celebrated in Virginia, as a remedy in dyſentery. I have uſed it, and I think with advantage. I believe it does good principally by its purgative quality. The doſe is from twenty to thirty grains of the root in powder. A great deal has been ſaid about the virtue of this vegetable in pleuriſy.</p>
                  <p>THE powder of this Aſclepias is eſcarotic, and has been found uſeful in reſtraining fungous fleſh in ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. I believe this, and not the Poke, as has been ſuppoſed, is the plant which is employed by our ſouthern Indians in caſes of venereal chancre.</p>
                  <p>THE dried fruit of our Papaw, or Cuſtard-apple, the Annona triloba of Linnaeus, is likewiſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. I can ſay nothing of it from my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                  <p>I KNOW nothing, from experience, of the <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meck,</hi> or Wild-Rhubarb, of ſome of our Indians. It is, certainly, a ſpecies of Convolvulus, or Bind-weed, and I believe the Convolvulus panduratus, which in Virginia is called "wild potatoe." Its name Wild-Rhubarb, implies that it is a purgative. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033377_0038_0FF6DAF804B6E4D8"/>
but little, if any thing, inferior to the Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſhops, has been procured from one of our ſpecies of Convolvulus.

                  </p>
                  <p>MORE active than any of the native purgatives which I have mentioned is the Podophyllum pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum of Linnaeus. This is a very common plant through the whole of the United-States, and in other parts of North-America. It is known by a variety of names, ſuch as May-apple, Mandrake, Ipecacuanha, Wild-lemons, &amp;c. The fruit is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent, and by many perſons is thought delicious. The leaves are poiſonous.—It is the root which is uſed in practice. In doſes of twenty grains, it is an excellent cathartic. It has ſome advantages over the rhubarb and jallap. It is moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly uſed in combination with calomel, or the cryſtals of tartar. I have heard much of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of an extract prepared of this root; but have never uſed it.</p>
                  <p>THERE is a plant which was thought by Linnaeus to be a ſpecies of the ſame genus. He called it Podophyllum diphyllum. I have ſhown, that it is
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033377_0039_0FF6DAFA51B251B8"/>
a new genus.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Tranſactions of the American Philoſophical Society. Vol. III. No. XLI.</note> I have not been able to collect a ſufficient quantity of this to aſcertain its powers; but, judging by the taſte and ſmell, which it muſt be confeſſed are ſometimes fallacious teſts, I ſuſpect its root poſſeſſes the virtues of the May-Apple, or Podophyllum peltatum.</p>
                  <p>THE Caſſia Marilandica, one of our fineſt plants, belongs to the ſame genus as the ſenna of the ſhops. The American ſpecies poſſeſſes nearly the ſame vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as the eaſtern ſpecies. It is uſed as a purgative in different parts of the United-States.</p>
                  <p>AN extract prepared from the inner bark of the Juglans cinerea, or Butternut-Walnut, has long been uſed as a purgative in the United-States. It is a valuable medicine. As it is often, however, very careleſsly prepared by the country-people, it has gone into ſome kind of neglect. It ought to be prepared by the better informed apothecaries, and have a place in the Pharmacopoeia of this country, WHEN SUCH A DESIDERATUM SHALL BE SUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLIED. The doſe of this extract is from ten to thirty grains. I have thought it poſſeſſes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an anodyne property.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE been told, that ſome of our Indians uſe as a cathartic a decoction of the bark of the root of

The Seneca ſhould have a trial.</note> This medicine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times operates ſo powerfully as a ſudorific, that I have been aſſured it has been known to remove por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mucous body, or rete mucoſum, from

the ſkin of blacks who have uſed it. I do not vouch for the truth of this fact: but I muſt confeſs that to me the circumſtance does not ſeem improbable. Our Indians uſe a decoction of this root in ſyphilis. I have no confidence in the powers which have been aſcribed to the Seneca, in curing the bite of the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-ſnake. Beſides the Polygala Senega, we have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other native ſpecies of this genus. I do not know how far they poſſeſs the powers which have been aſcribed to the Seneca itſelf. It is probable that they only differ in degree. Kiernander, a long time ago, remarked that the Polygala vulgaris, which grows ſpontaneouſly in Europe, poſſeſſes, though in a leſs eminent degree, the virtues of the celebrated American ſpecies.<note n="*" place="bottom">See his paper, entitled Radix Senega, in the ſecond volume of the Amoenitates Academicae.</note>

                  <p>THE Lobelia ſiphilitica is alſo conſiderably diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. This plant was purchaſed from the northern Indians, by the late Sir William Johnſon, as a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the venereal diſeaſe: hence its ſpecific name, ſiphilitica. I do not believe, after paying ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ſubject, that this plant has cured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſyphilis. I know that the Indians, even thoſe who are beſt acquainted with the plant, are glad to have an opportunity of applying to the whites for relief, when they have the diſeaſe. They certainly do not truſt the cure entirely to the Lobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:033377_0044_0FF6DB061D94E810"/>
They uſe the bark of the wild cherry (Prunus Virginiana), the root of the May-apple (Podophyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum peltatum), and many other plants.<note n="*" place="bottom">I do not believe that the diſeaſe of ſyphilis was known among the North-American Indians before they became acquainted with the whites. Mr. John Heckewelder informs me, that the Indians ſpeak of it as a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign diſeaſe communicated by the whites.</note> I believe, however, that the Lobelia has been of ſervice in the diſeaſe. In gonorrhea it has certainly performed a cure; but the tendency of the conſtitution, unaid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by medicines, to get rid of this complaint, is well known. I may here obſerve, that gonorrhea ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be much more common among the Indians than ſyphilis. The Lobelia ſeems to operate chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by its diuretic quality. From their ignorance of botany, many perſons in the weſtern country have been uſing a plant, which they call Lobelia, in the ſame complaints. I have received ſpecimens of the plant under the name of Lobelia. It proves to be the Serratula ſpicata, or Spiked Saw-wort. There is good reaſon to believe, that it has been found uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, not only in veneral complaints, but alſo in caſes of nephritis calculoſa, or gravel. Thus igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſometimes leads to knowledge. This ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lobelia is a powerful diuretic. The Indians ſometimes drink the decoction of it ſo ſtrong that it occaſions gleets.<note n="†" place="bottom">They cure theſe gleets by eating turpentine, as I am informed by Colonel Winthrop Sargent. An old Indian aſſured this gentleman, that a decoction of this Serratula, cures ſyphilis in all its forms. Dr. Alliſon, one of the army-phyſicians, has an high opinion of the plant, in this diſeaſe. I am told Dr Bedford, of Pittſburg, has found it an efficacious medicine in the gravel. It certainly ought to have a fair trial in theſe diſeaſes. The late Major Jonathan Hart aſſured me, that the Indians northweſt of the Ohio could not cure confirmed ſyphilis. He ſaid the Lobelia (I ſuppoſe the Serratula ſpicata) had been of ſervice in ſlight caſes; but he was perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Indians would fall victims to the general complaint, if they were to truſt wholly to their own remedies. A Mr. Wilſon, who is well acquainted with the Indians, particularly the Delawares and Shawneeſe, moſt confidently aſſerts, that they cannot cure the venereal diſeaſe, "when it gets into the blood;" but that they can cure the gonorrhea. He alſo ſaid, they can remove the venereal diſeaſe for a time, but "that it will break out again."</note> It is the root of the plant
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033377_0045_0FF6DB08748CED38"/>
which is commonly employed, but the flowers and the leaves may alſo be uſed.</p>
                  <p>An infuſion of another ſpecies of Lobelia, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Lobelia inflata, has been found very uſeful in the leucorrhoea, or whites. It is a lacteſcent, and very active plant. I do not know that this acts as a diuretic, and it would have been more proper to have mentioned the plant under the head of ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants.</p>
                  <p>The Caſſena is a ſpecies of Ilex, or Holly. It is the Ilex vomitoria of Aiton, and is a native of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina, Weſt-Florida, &amp;c. It has been called South-Sea-tea, or Evergreen Caſſine. It is thought to be one of the moſt powerful diuretics hitherto diſcovered. It is held in great eſteem among the ſouthern Indians. They toaſt the leaves and make a decoction of them. It is the men alone that are
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033377_0046_0FF6DB0AD5554208"/>
permitted to drink this decoction, which is called Black Drink.</p>
                  <p>The Medeola Virginica grows plentifully in the vicinity of this city, and in almoſt every other part of the United-States. Its root is white, and taſtes a good deal like the cucumber, which has given the plant the name of Cucumber-root. I am told that this root is diuretic, and has cured dropſies. The ſenſible qualities of the plant do not promiſe much; but this does not prove that it is not an uſeful medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>

                  <p>OF the claſs of medicines called ANTHELMIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICS, or deſtroyers and expellers of worms, we have ſeveral which are entitled to your notice. One of the moſt celebrated of theſe is the Carolina Pink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>root, the Spigelia Marilandica of Linnaeus. This is a very common plant in our ſouthern ſtates. It is a valuable medicine, as has been demonſtrated by the phyſicians of Europe and of this country. It is commonly given in the form of an infuſion, or tea; but I prefer the exhibition of it in powder. It has been accuſed of occaſioning, for a ſhort time, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable affection of the eyes. But this effect may often be prevented by combining with the Spigelia ſome of the common Virginia Snake-root. The
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033377_0047_0FF6DB0D47F110D8"/>
Cheerake-Indians have ſo high an opinion of this plant, that it would ſometimes be dangerous for a perſon to be detected in digging it up, to carry it out of the country. The whites learned the anthelmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic powers of this vegetable from the Indians. The Spigelia is ſaid to poſſeſs other valuable properties. Infuſed in wine, it has been found an uſeful medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in intermittent fevers. But I can ſay nothing particular concerning the preciſe mode of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering it in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>THE Chenopodium anthelminticum grows plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the United-States. It is commonly called Worm-ſeed. The whole plant has a moſt powerful ſmell, of which it is very retentive. The taſte is bitter, with a good deal of aromatic acrimony.</p>
                  <p>THE root of the May-apple, (Podophyllum pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum), which I have mentioned to you under the head of cathartics, has often been found to operate as an anthelmintic. It is uſed as ſuch by the Chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rake, and other ſouthern Indians. Whether it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates by its cathartic quality excluſively, or partly by ſome other quality, deleterious to the worms, I cannot ſay. The whites learned from the Indians the anthelmintic power of this plant.<note n="*" place="bottom">The beſt time for gathering the may-apple, for medical purpoſes, is the autumn, when the leaves have turned yellow, and are about falling off The Indians dry it in the ſhade, and powder it for uſe.</note>

THE Helleborus foetidus, or Stinking Hellebore, has been mentioned as a powerful anthelmintic, by Biſſet, and other European writers. It has been uſed in this country, and has been found very effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious.

                  <p>THE Cheerake uſe a decoction of the root of the beautiful Lobelia Cardinalis, or Cardinal-Flower, as a remedy againſt worms. I have already mentioned the diuretic quality of another ſpecies of this genus, the Lobelia ſiphilitica.</p>
                  <p>THE ſeeds of the Common Tobacco (Nicotiana Tabacum) have alſo been found uſeful as an anthel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintic.</p>
                  <p>THE Silene Virginica, or Ground-Pink, as it is called in ſome parts of our country, is another native anthelmintic. A decoction of the root is uſed, and is ſaid to have been found a very effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious remedy.</p>

I HAVE not loſt all confidence in the anthelmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic powers aſcribed to the Polypodium vulgare, or Male-Fern. I do ſuppoſe, however, that too much has been aſcribed to this plant. We have ſeveral native ſpecies of this genus, which it would, at leaſt, be a matter of curioſity to examine. The Polypodium Virginianum grows about this city, and probably poſſeſſes the ſame powers as the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>A PLANT, called the "Pride of India," has lately been mentioned as an excellent anthelmintic. The bark of the root has been uſed as ſuch in South-Carolina.

                  <p>I SHALL conclude this account of anthelmintics by obſerving, that the ſouthern Indians dreſs all their diſhes, prepared of the Indian-corn, or maize, (Zea Mays) with a ſtrong lixivium, or lye, of the aſhes of bean-ſtalks and other vegetables, in order to prevent the generation of worms.

I HAVE thus, Gentlemen, endeavoured to preſent you with a ſpecimen, or rather rude outline, of an Eſſay towards a Materia Medica of the United-States. My object has been a collection of facts. I could have wiſhed for more leiſure to have purſued the ſubject: but that leiſure I do not poſſeſs. I hope, however, that with all its imperfections, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented you with a ſketch which will not prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to you. I have opened a path which deſerves to be trod by you all.</p>
                  <p>THE man who diſcovers one valuable new medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is a more important benefactor to his ſpecies than Alexander, Caeſar, or an hundred other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors. Even his glory, in the eſtimation of a truly civilized age, will be greater, and more laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than that of theſe admired ravagers of the world. I will venture to go farther. All the ſplendid diſcoveries of Newton are not of ſo much real utility to the world as the diſcovery of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian bark, or of the powers of opium and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in the cure of certain diſeaſes. If the diſtance of time, or the darkneſs of hiſtory, did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us from aſcertaining who firſt diſcovered the properties of the Poppy, that "ſweet oblivious anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote" for alleviating pain, and for ſoothing, while the memory remains, thoſe rooted ſorrows which diſturb our happineſs; if we could tell who firſt diſcovered the mighty ſtrength of Mercury in ſtrangling the hydra
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033377_0051_0FF6DB16A5951FD0"/>
of pleaſures and of generation; if we could even aſcertain who was the native of Peru, that firſt experienced and revealed to his countrymen the powers of the Bark in curing intermittent fevers; would not the civilized nations of mankind, with one accord, concur in erecting durable monuments of granite and of braſs to ſuch benefactors of the ſpecies? Would not even the ſavage, who wants not a ſenſe of benefits conferred upon him, be ſeen to form the tumulus of ſtones, or to raiſe the green ſod, the only monuments his humble condition would admit of his erecting? And may we not yet look for the diſcovery of medicines as important to mankind as opium, the bark, and mercury?</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe, the diſcovery of new and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble medicines, your ſituation, Gentlemen, (I addreſs myſelf at preſent, more eſpecially to the younger part of my audience); for this purpoſe, your ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is peculiarly happy. In the purſuit of one of the moſt dignified and moſt uſeful of all the ſciences, you are placed in an extenſive country, the productions of which have never been inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with accuracy, or with zeal. From this ſchool, I will venture to call it the <hi>punctum ſaliens</hi> of the ſcience of our country, you are to ſpread yourſelves over the happieſt and one of the faireſt portions of the world. In whatever part of this vaſt continent you may be placed, you will find an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033377_0052_0FF6DB1913698F08"/>
field of new and intereſting objects to reap in. The volume of nature lies before you: it has hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet been opened: it has never been peruſed. But by your aſſiſtance, the knowledge of the natural productions of our country may be greatly extended, and travellers ſhall then no longer upbraid us with an utter ignorance of the treaſures which an all-bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Providence has ſo largely beſtowed upon us. May I not flatter myſelf that among the number of thoſe whom I am now addreſſing, there are ſome of you for whom medical diſcoveries of importance are reſerved? diſcoveries which would add a luſtre to your names, whilſt they would enſure to you that which is much more to be deſired, in this mixed ſcene of affairs, an happineſs that is imboſomed in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of one's country, and the world.</p>

This complaint is very common, particularly among the negroes, and the poorer ſort of white people, in Carolina, Georgia, &amp;c. It is called "Toe-Itch and Ground-Itch." It is a kind of ulcerous excoriation between the toes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times extending as high as the inſtep, and is attended with moſt intolerable itching. It is probably, in a great meaſure, the conſequence of inattention to cleanlineſs. Is it occaſioned by particular infects? Some perſons, with whom I have converſed on the ſubject, are of opinion, that it is owing to the great warmth of the waters to the ſouthward, in which the inhabitants are accuſtomed to wade a great deal. The diſeaſe is ſometimes ſeen in Pennſylvania. Beſides the Andromeda Mariana, or Broad-leaved Moor-wort, a decoction of the leaves of the Kalmia latifolia is uſed for the cure of this complaint.

This is a true intermittent or remittent, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a local pain, either in the ſide, or in the head. When it is in the head, the diſeaſe is called (a ridiculous name) the pleuriſy in the head.
