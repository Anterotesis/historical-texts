            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SHAH AULLIM's affairs having been for upwards of theſe thirty years ſo inſeparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the Eaſt-India Company, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it difficult to proceed on any intelligible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of their complex ſyſtem in India, until what gave riſe to this above hinted connection was eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, as a ſcene ſeemingly in ſome meaſure neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to open, before any ſatisfactory deſcription could be given of a people of different religions and ſects, the fate of war, revolutions in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and unaccountable viciſſitudes of fortune in an Empire like Indoſtan, jumbled together, and rendered ſubſervient to the mercenary views of Regents and different made Emperors, tottering on a diſlocated throne, and a ſet of upſtart <hi>Soubahs</hi> and <hi>Nabobs,</hi> ſet up by the contrivances of the Engliſh Eaſt-India Company's ſervants, at the expence of rapine and bloodſhed, I reſolved, by way of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, on an illuſtration of the matter; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Maire has in as few words, and as expreſſive terms as conveniently need be, related how the Engliſh Eaſt-India Company happened to be ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated, I have taken the liberty to quote him on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>'THE Engliſh Eaſt-India Company,' ſays this ingenious gentleman, <q>was incorporated about the 42d year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, A. D. 1600, and empowered to trade to all theſe new countries to the eaſtward of the Cape of Good-Hope, excluſive of all others; but about A.D.
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:022380_0007_0FB85963982FF4A0"/>
1698, application being made to Parliament by private merchants, for laying this trade open, an act paſſed empowering every ſubject of England, upon raiſing a ſum for the ſupply of government, to trade to theſe new parts; upon which a great many ſubſcribed, and were called the New Eaſt-India Company; but the Old Company being maſters of all the forts on the coaſt of India, the New Company found it their intereſt to unite with them, and trade with one joint ſtock, and have ever ſince been ſtiled the United Eaſt-India Company.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>THE moſt conſiderable forts and factories and places of trade wherein this Company are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, are as follows, <hi>viz.</hi> Mocha, or Moco; Aden, Macalla, Shahara, Dofar and Muſcat, in Arabia Felix; Baſſora, Iſphahan and Gom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broon, in Perſia; Cambaya, Amedabad, Borotch, Swalley, Surat, Bombay, Dabul, Cunvar, Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichery, Calicut and Anjengo, on the coaſt of Malabar; Fort St. David's, Connonore and Fort St. George, on the coaſt of Coromandel; Maſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapatam, Vizaggapatam, and Ballaſore, in the bay of Bengal, to the northward of theſe ſettlements. On the iſland of Sumutra Achin, Bambat, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loun, Ippo, Bencoolen, or Fort Marlbro' and Fort William at Calcutta; Hugely, Caſſimbuzar, Dac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Malda, Midnapore, Monghere, Rajahmawl, Chunamchoprah, Patna, Burdawan, and Chitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang, in the province of Bengal; and in China Canton, Amoy and Chyſum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS may ſuffice to inform the reader of the origination of the Eaſt-India Company, in which quotation, I have taken the liberty to add ſome few important ſettlements made by the Engliſh ſince Mr. Mair's publication. I ſhall now return to the affairs of <hi>Shah Aullim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="unknown:022380_0008_0FB8596646C11488"/>HISTORIANS pretty unanimouſly concur in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan's being firſt peopled by emigrants, or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like adventurers, from Perſia: if ſo, 'tis equally probable they deſcended from the fraternities of Noah, as now it remains an uncontroverted point, that Noah and his followers firſt ſettled in theſe parts after the deluge. This is tracing them as far back as hiſtory will admit, and the oral tradition of the Bramins in India can be relied on. Thus peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled from Perſia, as already mentioned, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained 'till Alexander the Great penetrating India with an army and fleet, after meeting with a torrent of oppoſition, but principally from <hi>Porus,</hi> a leading warrior in theſe parts, whom he defeated and made priſoner, he ceaſed his purſuits at the mouth of the Hydaſpes, a branch of the Indus, and made that, ſeemingly, the limitation of his conqueſts; after which, with his armament he ſailed down the Indus, and entering the ocean he returned by the way of the Perſian gulph.</p>
            <p>AFTER this, Alexander being dead, there is a report in hiſtory, that Seleucus ſurrendered up this vaſt country to Sandracottus, for 500 elephants, which Sandracottus, it is ſaid, conquered all India, both this and the other ſide the Ganges. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts we have from that time 'till Auguſtus, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus and Aurelian, who received Embaſſadors from India, from the then reigning monarchs, are obſcure and not to be relied on any more than is the account of Trajans conqueſt of theſe parts; from whence it appears, India remained inhabited by theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſets of Perſians 'till invaded by the Saracens, who, it is well known, conquered the major part of it; but without being able to retain long their hold; for after their firſt expedition, Mahmud Gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, and others made frequent incurſions into Indoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, plundered and carried off immenſe treaſures
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:022380_0009_0FB85967870499B0"/>
and riches, and had poſſeſſion of many principalities there, but obliged to relinquiſh them and fly, as well as the Moguls, who though they invaded this country A. D. 1300, and extended their victorious arms from it's utmoſt eaſtern to it's weſtern boundaries, and apparently made a compleat conqueſt of the whole, were obliged, after a bloody defeat, to fly before the face of the Indians and quit the premiſes. Theſe are the only events, as authenticated can be relied on, that took place in Indoſtan ſince it's firſt being peopled by the Perſians, (as before obſerved ſuppoſed to be the abſolute deſcendants of Noah) 'till about the 14th century, Tamerlane, a Mogul Tartar, with an army of horſe, conquered theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan domains, and put to the ſword innumerable of it's inhabitants, and aſſuming the title of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, diſtributed the conquered lands amongſt his countrymen and warriors.</p>
            <p>FROM Tamerlane deſcended the ſucceeding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors in Indoſtan, which formerly ſat on the throne uninterrupted, without any conſiderable increaſe in their territory, or inteſtine or foreign annoyance, 'till Aurengzebe, in the year 1667, mounting the throne with unheard of celerity and valour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſword in hand, his dominions to the ſouthernmoſt verge of this immenſe country, back to the foot of the mountains of Thibet, reduced the Marattas to implicit obedience, and in ſhort, compleated the conqueſt of this Empire, and lived 'till 1707.</p>
            <p>JEHANDAR SHAH, grandſon to Aurengzebe, after a bloody conteſt with his brothers, on a plain within about ten miles of Agra, gaining his point, returned in triumph to the capitol, and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Emperor by his army. Jehandar Shah was ſoon maſſacred by his <hi>Omrahs</hi> and <hi>Aumeers,</hi> they making his attachment to his Empreſs an excuſe for
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:022380_0010_0FB8596BD7DCBFD8"/>
the perpetration of this horrid act; and placed in his ſtead <hi>Furrukſhir,</hi> whom they had employed to ſtrike off his uncle's head.</p>
            <p>FURRUKSHIR was not long reigning Emperor of Indoſtan; two of his brothers became ſo obnoxious to him by their arrogance and aſſumption, that he ordered them to be privately aſſaſſinated; but they diſcovering the plot, got him dethroned, and after impriſoning and ſtrangling him, they raiſed to the throne a grandſon of <hi>Aurengzebe's,</hi> a youth about ſeveenteen years of age, who not anſwering the purpoſes of his brothers, they ſoon gave him a doſe that ſent him to everlaſting ſleep, and put in his place the elder brother, who took the title of <hi>Shah Jahan. Shah Jahan</hi> was ſucceeded by <hi>Mahommed Shah,</hi> who giving umbrage to <hi>Nizam Muluck,</hi> the ſovereign of the <hi>Decan,</hi> and a branch of the Mogul family, this vindictive Prince, though a near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a <hi>ſoubah,</hi> ſworn ſubject, and Generaliſſimo to <hi>Mahommed Shah,</hi> invited ſecretly <hi>Nadir Shah,</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>Thamas Kouli Kan</hi>) to invade the country; which ſucceeding in, <hi>Nadir Shah,</hi> after beating <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hommed Shah,</hi> and poſſeſſing himſelf of the capitol, entered into amicable treaty with the Mogul; but unhappily during the negociation, a diſturbance happening amongſt the natives on the ſpot, <hi>Nadir Shah</hi> being fired at by a muſket from the crowd, (though before no ways inclined to draw blood) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his <hi>Cuttlebaſhes</hi> to ſtand forth and ſpare no man they ſhould fall in with, and from about ten in the morning were to cut away 'till on the top of the <hi>Jummah Moſque,</hi> (as related to me by people who were then on the ſpot, and pointed out to me the very ſtreets the greateſt maſſacre happened in, which was the concerted ſignal to ſheath their ſwords,) the Peerzadahs, as uſual, with a loud voice ſhould call out <hi>Allah!

invocations they make to God, and a public notice for evening prayer.</p>
            <p>AS this event is as remarkable as important, I will without breaking in much with the thread of my Introduction, relate it ſo as painted to me in lively colours by <hi>Shake Haggabdullah,</hi> and <hi>Shah Nazur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg,</hi> two men of veracity, who had not only been preſent to the tranſaction, but the former in office, then under <hi>Mahommed Shah,</hi> and the latter an <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarce,</hi> or commander of a thouſand of the very <hi>Cuttlebaſh</hi> horſe employed in this deſtructive bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
            <p>AFTER <hi>Nimage,</hi> ſaid this Cuttlebaſh, our <hi>Patcha</hi> hearing a noiſe, mounted, and we followed him, and ordering ſilence in the <hi>Chandny Choque,</hi> where a riotous mob had aſſembled, and making ſigns for them to be pacific, without being regarded, and ſhot at by an Indoſtan <hi>Burghundaſs,</hi> with a large iron ball, he ſaid they were refractory, and wanted chaſtiſement, and concluded by ſaying, go and <hi>bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Shumſhere, ſofmekund waw tuxeer moph ne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoned,</hi> i. e. go clear the way and give them no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—When ordered by <hi>Nadir Shah,</hi> we diſperſed ourſelves amongſt the crowd, and, <hi>allah hufurſt!</hi> what blood did we ſpill; within the eight hours, <hi>kod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duh ab na punnah Patcha Nadir Shah Sarrah lack,</hi> that is a lack and a quarter, or 125,000 youths and men of all deſcriptions, fell a ſacrifice to this conqueror's reſentment.</p>
            <p>THIS carnage over, the <hi>Patcha</hi> exacted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution; in the completion of which many cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were practiſed on the unhappy inhabitants; after which he marched back to his own dominions, in 1739, with the immenſe ſum in ſpecie of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty-one millions ſterling, including the peacock throne, &amp;c. ſeventy millions of which fell

            <p>THIS was the firſt ſhock the Mogul Empire ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and put a final end to the ſway of the race of Tamerlane. <hi>Nadir Shah</hi> quitting Delhy, he left the Mogul in quiet poſſeſſion of all his territories to the ſouthward of the Attock; reſerving the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces before belonging to that Sovereign to the northward of it, for himſelf; and to diminiſh the ſovereign authority, by dividing it's intereſts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on <hi>Mahommed Shah,</hi> to make the <hi>ſoubah ſhips</hi> throughout his empire, hereditary: but <hi>Nadir Shah</hi> had not long left Indoſtan, before the country was invaded by a numerous army of <hi>Rouhillus</hi> and <hi>Patans,</hi> who were oppoſed by the Emperor's ſon, a youth about eighteen years of age, and totally defeated. During this conteſt <hi>Mahommed Shah</hi> was ſtrangled by his Vizier; when the young Prince ſucceeding him by the name of <hi>Amet Shah,</hi> (the Emperors in Indoſtan ever aſſuming a new name and title on their aſcending the throne) offering as a reward a <hi>mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſub,</hi> and <hi>phill naſhan</hi> to any one who ſhould diſcover the conſpirators againſt his father's life, they were detected and put to death: but a freſh invaſion of the <hi>Patans</hi> and <hi>Marattas</hi> conjoined, being made, <hi>Amet Shah</hi> was dethroned and impriſoned in <hi>Selin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur,</hi> and <hi>Allingheer,</hi> father to the preſent Mogul, put on the throne by <hi>Ghazodinkan,</hi> the then Grand Vizier:—But <hi>Allimgheer</hi> tampering ſecretly with <hi>Amud Shah,</hi> ſovereign of Candahar and Piſhoar, in order to purchaſe his friendſhip, and a quota of troops, to cut off the thread of the obnoxious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection ſubſiſting between him and <hi>Ghazodinkan,</hi> his letters being intercepted by <hi>Ghazodinkan,</hi> a branch of the Nizam family, that long owed a grudge to their couſins the deſcendants of Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, inheriting the honors and profits of the Mogul

Empire, though then very young, a daring and enterpriſing genius, to revenge himſelf on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and anſwer his ſanguinary and ambitious views, engaged two <hi>Molvies</hi> who had juſt returned from a pilgrimage they had made to Mecca, to aſſaſſinate the aged <hi>Allimgheer,</hi> which they effected in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner:</p>
            <p>ALLIMGHEER advanced in years, and though not more remarkable for his attention to faſt or prayer than Muſſulmans in general, yet <hi>Fakirs</hi> and <hi>Hagies</hi> and theſe ſort of people found eaſier acceſs to him than what other Emperors had been uſed to give; and hearing that two <hi>Molvies,</hi> with reverend beards, and of a reſpectable aſpect, who had arrived from the tomb of Mahomet, and wiſhed to pay him homage, he ordered them in his preſence, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of preſenting him two ſmall Alcorans, as a <hi>nazur,</hi> at the ſame time ſtabbed him to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals with their poignards, and the retinue, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated orders of young <hi>Ghazodinkan,</hi> threw him from the top of the terras of the palace he was then ſeated on to breath the freſh air in the evening, and daſhed him againſt the pavement below; when <hi>Ghazodinkan</hi> aſſuming the regency, and aiming at the life of <hi>Alligore,</hi> the eldeſt ſon of the demiſed Emperor, amidſt a tumult that this occaſioned in the capitol, the <hi>Shah Zadah,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Ilelroy,</hi> a <hi>Maratta</hi> Chief then at Delhy, made his eſcape, and croſſed the Jumna with his Princeſs and the ſelect part of his <hi>Zunnanah,</hi> what jewels he could muſter, which were to a prodigious amount, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by a few Mogul Noblemen; amongſt whom were Morahjahdowlah, Akborillykan, Bahah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Dowlah, and others of note, with his <hi>Cojahs, Bahahdarilly Kan, Mecah Almas</hi> and <hi>Mecah Yaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koote,</hi> incognito, flew acroſs Anterbade, and croſſed to the Commong Hills, where he met with an hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

reception from the hill <hi>Rajahs</hi> or Potentates, in theſe parts, which he made an aſylum for ſome years; during which time his Princeſs, now Empreſs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan, was brought to bed of <hi>Akborſhah, Alligore's</hi> third ſon, who on account of the remarkable beauty of his perſon, natural and acquired abilities, as a favorite of his father and the <hi>Divan,</hi> will, if ever the Mogul gets perfectly eſtabliſhed in his rights, ſucceed to the throne, 'tis preſumed.</p>
            <p>THESE circumſtances hitherto, though of moment to the political world and all European powers to be known, have artfully been kept a ſecret by the Honourable Eaſt-India Company, and more ſo by their Governors and Counſellors, Senior Merchants and Factors abroad. Why? That by not letting tranſpire the legitimacy of Alligore's birth-right, (diſputed by <hi>Ghazodinkin,</hi>) though ſufficiently known, they might occaſionally have a pretext of aſſiſting any competitor for the ſovereignty of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan among the <hi>Maratta</hi> Chiefs againſt the right heir, ſhould <hi>Alligore</hi> ever eſtrange his affections from them; and even after Ragouby (appointed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent during the minority of <hi>Madarow</hi>) aſſaſſinated this promiſing young Prince, the Engliſh have kept in to all intents and purpoſes with <hi>Ragouby,</hi> aſſiſted him laterly with troops to fight his battles, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Barrow-bye,</hi> and finally, after having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the reduction of <hi>Pounah,</hi> and the whole Decan, in order to pave the way for this <hi>Ragouby</hi>'s acceſſion to the throne, and throw by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, the Mogul into the hands of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rattas.</hi>

revenue, preſuming that under the auſpices of the Great Mogul all imaginable ſanction would be given to their proceedings, could they but induce him to fall in with their meaſures, ſent a deputation to <hi>Alligore,</hi> with an offer of their ſervices, by Meſſrs. Cartier and Claude Ruſſell; which <hi>Alligore</hi> accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was conducted to Eleabas, a fortified city on the banks of the Ganges, and by them (the Engliſh) with great ſolemnity crowned King of Delhy and Indoſtan, not Emperor: the Company were pleaſed to ſay that title was redundant, and when ſpoken of by them he is only ſtiled the King, or <hi>Shahzadah,</hi> which implies Prince. On aſcending the throne he aſſumed the name and title of <hi>Shah Aullim,</hi> that is in Engliſh, the King of the world. <hi>Rupees</hi> were ſtruck in his name, with the above title thereon. Two battallions of <hi>Seapoys</hi> were allotted him for his guards, and one hundred <hi>lack</hi> of <hi>rupees</hi> per annum for his maintenance, that it might not be ſaid the <hi>Badſhaw</hi> wanted <hi>doll rouice,</hi> (i. e. a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent phraſe in Indoſtan, which idiomatically tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, is bread to his meat) whilſt among the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous brave Engliſh <hi>Toppe-wallas,</hi> i. e. hat-men; but this <hi>Shah Aullim</hi> as ſoon ſuſpected was but an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſtipend, as he did that the civilians who on various pretences frequented his court, were as much ſpies over his actions, as the <hi>Seapoys</hi> he had been honored with to attend him, were bars to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Nor were theſe ſuſpicions ill-founded, for his agents in their attempt to collect the taxes of the adjacent <hi>purgunnas,</hi> (that being the channel through which he was to come at his ſtipend) with difficulty obtained a <hi>taſcel,</hi> i. e. gather of land-tax for a ſix months back balance, due to the <hi>Sircar,</hi> that made it out in the proportion of no more than twenty-five <hi>lacks</hi> per annum. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's ſervants in India anticipated the complaints
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:022380_0016_0FB85978138CAB50"/>
of <hi>Shah Aullim</hi> on theſe occaſions, by waiting on him with rich European preſents, which they diſtributed amongſt thoſe of his ſons that attended Court; and renewing their aſſurances of friendſhip induced him to give them grants for all the lands they had purloined from the natives, with <hi>Jaghires</hi> and grants for immenſe tracts more of lands in the richeſt provinces of the kingdoms of Bengal, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har and Oriſſa, with a <hi>Phirmaund</hi> to collect revenue <hi>vi et armis</hi> throughout all theſe three extenſive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricts, and the liberty of ſtriking <hi>Siccas</hi> in his name at Calcutta, and diſtributing juſtice in their own dominions, with ſome few pretended reſtrictions, relative to the <hi>Soubah Bullmouſin,</hi> the Beneras Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah and other officers and perſons of property and diſtinction it would be policy not to be too ſtrenous with at firſt ſetting off.</p>
            <p>FRESH Surveyors, with detachments of Seapoys, were employed to ſurvey and penetrate the country, in order to find out new towns, <hi>gonges</hi> and <hi>gunges,</hi> and aſcertain, or rather extend the Company's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</p>
            <p>NO Prince on the throne at Delhy, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign authority annihilated, the Princes tributory to the Mogul, viz. <hi>Rajahs, Nabobs, Faſdars,</hi> &amp;c. and others, affecting independence, each one grew deſpotic in his reſpective diſtrict, exacted and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected revenue and taxes of all kinds; favoring the <hi>Zemendars, Banyans</hi> and <hi>Bockalls,</hi> as their avarice, intereſt or inclination guided them.</p>
            <p>THE northern provinces of Indoſtan, at this time open on the one hand to the viſits of the <hi>Marattas,</hi> on the pretext of collecting their <hi>Chouty</hi> or fifth part of the revenue granted to them out of certain portions of territory by <hi>Aurengzebe;</hi> and on the other by the incurſions of the <hi>Rouhillas, Sicks,</hi> and <hi>Patans;</hi> without enumerating the miſchief done

by various tribes of robbers and thieves this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try abounds with, viz. <hi>Gougers, Gowars, Minnees, Mewattees, Tuggs,</hi> and bodies of <hi>Fakirs;</hi> without theſe inteſtine oppreſſions, would have been ſufficient to account for the anarchy and confuſion this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at this juncture was in.</p>
            <p>WHAT was the conſequence? The pretended hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable reception the <hi>Toppee-wallas</hi> had afforded <hi>Shah Alluim</hi> and his family, had taken wind, and the head <hi>Zemindars, Sowdawgurs,</hi> and <hi>Shroffs,</hi> not only alarmed for their property, but for the ſafety of their lives, from ſuch an inundation of deſpoilers that now overſpread the country, converting what of their property they could, into gold or precious ſtones, for the eaſier conveyance of it, through by ways would travel down to the ſettlements of the Engliſh <hi>Toppe-wallas,</hi> for protection. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul had ſhown them an example, and a report was circulated amongſt the Muſſulmans, (that <hi>Allah,</hi> i.e. God, in the Arabic language) and amongſt the <hi>Hindoos,</hi> that <hi>Bogwan,</hi> i. e. the ſupreme God, had made choice of the tribe of <hi>Hadgerat Eeſah,</hi> to be an engine to redreſs their grievances.</p>
            <p>THESE families of merchants and others ſwarming into the Engliſh ſettlements, amongſt whom were many monied men, the Company's ſervants made a point of receiving them in the moſt courteous manner; theſe invited others, and their ſettlements became, ſeemingly, aſylums for the rich or ruined emigrants of Indoſtan.</p>
            <p>THIS migration was productive of many imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and future advantages to the <hi>Sircar,</hi> for theſe men, particularly the <hi>Banyans,</hi> early making the Company acquainted with the pecuniary abilities of the <hi>Riets</hi> in the adjacent and remoter parts of their new acquired territory, pointed out to them <hi>Gongés Gunges,</hi> and even towns, in receſſes they had never

            <p>THE Engliſh inveſted now with full powers from the Mogul to act in a civil, military, and judicial capacity, without control, ſaw a neceſſity for an augmentation of their Seapoys, and their European brigades, and wrote home accordingly, as well for a ſupply of civilians to fill up the vacancies of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Merchants, Factors and Writers, by this time diſpatched from the Preſidency at Fort William to new ſubordinates in the different parts of Bengal, Behar, and Oriſſa, and employed in the new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſſes of the Mint, the Lapidaries office, the ſurvey of the revenue, and the <hi>Catchary;</hi> they felt a ſhortneſs of Agents for the ſorting their cloths, and for the completion of their annual inveſtments of ſalt-petre, opium, &amp;c. as uſual, and repreſented in their general letter, that their eſtabliſhment abroad called upon all civil, military and naval aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilaries to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>THE military reputation of the Company in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed daily. Major Clive (ſince Lord Clive) had enhanced the idea of their valour by his conduct. He had gained the battle of Plaſſey, A. D. 1757, when the head of <hi>Surahjahdowlah</hi> was knocked off, and <hi>Meerjaffierallykan,</hi> put on the <hi>muſnud</hi> in his ſtead; from which epocha we may date the Company's making and unmaking Nabobs: <hi>Jaffier Ally Kan</hi> was afterwards depoſed, after being handſomely fleeced out of his jewellery and gold <hi>mohars,</hi> and <hi>Coſſimally-kan,</hi> a Syed of good family and a man of good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts and acquired abilities, made <hi>Soubah.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fault was found with the conduct of <hi>Coſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Kan,</hi> and another <hi>Soubah</hi> thought of to fill up the <hi>ſede vacante</hi> when called upon; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ears of <hi>Coſſimally Kan,</hi> it provoked this new <hi>Soubah</hi> to take up arms againſt the Company,
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:022380_0019_0FB8597CA62AE3A8"/>
and an army employed to conquer him and reduce him to reaſon, under the command of Major Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac. Notwithſtanding a menacing letter this officer ſent him, when fortified within the walls of <hi>Patma,</hi> he ſacrificed to his reſentment a number of Engliſh gentlemen in their factory there; employing one Sombra, a German officer, to execute his orders. This was during the government of Mr. Vanſittart, who had been the means of raiſing <hi>Coſſimally</hi> to the <hi>Muſnud.</hi>—But all friendſhip being now at an end between him and the Company, he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed throughout the empire by the Engliſh, and a reward offered for his head of ten lack of <hi>rupees.</hi> A new <hi>Soubah</hi> was ſet up at Maxedabads, and many events took place between that and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous battle of Baxar, where to end a diſpute long ſubſiſting between the Grand Vizier <hi>Sujahdowlah,</hi> and the Company, Hector Munro was employed againſt him, and beat him fairly in the field, and took him priſoner on his elephant, with a ſmall party of European horſe, after the battle; who, ſubdued, and in the hands of the Engliſh, was glad to enter into an amicable treaty with them.</p>
            <p>SUJAHDOWLAH, one of the moſt voluptuous and luxuriant Princes that ever appeared in Aſia, at amity now with the Company, but jealous of their power, by degrees added to his military force an army of twenty thouſand well diſciplined <hi>Seapoys,</hi> and ſet afoot a large train of artillery, caſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by one Monſieur Samſon, a French officer, his <hi>Douan</hi> had invited into his ſervice; which artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, was under the direction of this Commandant, and a number of Europeans, the loweſt of them paid at the rate of five rupees per day, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at wages from three hundred to one thouſand rupees per month.</p>

               <pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:022380_0020_0FB8597DF9006840"/>THE Company ſtrengthened with the additional alliance of the Grand Vizier, in the eyes of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Indoſtan, and having gained a permanent footing in Bengal, their ſervants began to acquire amazing and rapid fortunes; as verified in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Lord Clive, Carnac, Munro, Johnſon, Holwell, Haſtings, Vanſittart, and others. The <hi>Jaghire</hi> alone of Lord Clive was near eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling per annum, an hereditary eſtate ſettled on him by the Mogul; beſides upwards of two millions of ſpecie, and one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds worth of jewels and pearls.</p>
            <p>THE means by which theſe rapid and immenſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes were acquired, though too well known by this time not to be notorious to all Indoſtan, if not to America and the European world, were at firſt but ſuggeſted, until men who had been treated hard by theſe deſpotic Lords of the Eaſt, though Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans of repute and unexceptionably connected at home, among whom was Mr. Bolts, a free merchant of Calcutta, who with others, laying open at home the illicit and unwarrantable means by which the Company's ſervants in India acquired their fortunes, and the Company's charter that had been granted them by Parliament having nigh expired, it put the Government upon making an inveſtigation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eaſt-India Company's affairs; the reſult of which was, that they ſhould ſurrender up their Charter at the expiration of the limited time; but the Court of Directors deſiring a ſufficient time to ſettle their affairs in, it was granted them, on condition that they paid to the King four hundred thouſand pounds ſterling per annum; which they readily aſſenting to, they carried on their buſineſs as uſual. About this time, Mr. Vanſittart was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with full powers to go to India, and with a number of new nominated officers, civil and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,

ſailed for Bengal, but ſome diſaſter befalling the ſhip, ſhe never arrived, nor a veſtige of her, or a ſoul belonging to her heard of. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, however unfavorable to the intereſt of the proprietors of ſtock, and Company in general, was a ſtroke of fortune that reverberated with <hi>eclat</hi> on the former ſtandards in India, for apprized of the meaſures Government had taken to ſecure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome of the great emoluments the Company ſhared before amongſt themſelves, and apprehenſive of this ſtep's being followed by a ſpeedy diſſolution of their Company's excluſive right to the India trade, (which ſuggeſtions were not a little ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by a report having been propagated that the territorial revenue of Bengal would be inveſted in the right of the Crown,) prompted them to be the more ſtrenuous in their pecuniary purſuits, and to have recourſe to thoſe many unjuſtifiable means for the ſpeedier accompliſhment of their ends, which have ſo ſtigmatized this body of men, and diſgraced the character of the Britiſh nation.</p>
            <p>LORD CLIVE, a ſtar of the firſt magnitude in the Eaſt, whoſe words became mottos' in India, and maxims eſtabliſhed laws, not only at the <hi>Durbar</hi> of the Company, but at the Courts of the Mogul <hi>Sujahdowlah</hi> and the <hi>Soubahs,</hi> declared in Council and openly, that all acquiſitions made under the commiſſion of any body politic, were legal, and that it was neither immoral or irreligious to (by force of arms) exact contribution, and eſtabliſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordination; and that it was the nature of mankind to contend for ſuperiority and dominion; that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this bend reſulted from the exigency of their ſituations, real or imaginary wants, it mattered not; an invincible diſpoſition to acquire wealth, honor and fame, like the fixed principles in nature that leads rational or animal beings to the propagation

               <p>YOU deſired me to write to you on my arrival in India, and promiſed in return to anſwer my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I ſend you this by the ſhip I took my paſſage in, now on the eve of her departure for Europe.</p>
               <p>On our leaving the Downs, having a leading wind down channel, we ſoon cleared the land, and running between the <hi>Azores,</hi> i. e. the Weſtern Iſlands and the main continent of Europe, made the iſland of Madeira in about fourteen days; where, without coming to an anchor, we took on board 150 pipes of Madeira wine, (a drink highly acceptable to the Europeans in India) and on our way to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, anchored at St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verd iſlands; where, after fitting up our empty water caſks, and taking in poultry, goats, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, we weighed and ſteered to the ſouth, when Teneriffe remaining in ſight 'till it's peek or vertex, which terminates in a conical point and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the clouds; (the whole iſland being but a baſe as it were, to this pyramid) was by a meridian ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſun, viſible even at the diſtance of 150 nautic miles, which argued the great height of that remarkable mountain. We continued on our way to the Cape of Good-Hope, the ſouthernmoſt promontory of Africa; having croſſed the equinox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ial line in the longitue of about 19 degrees weſt from the meridian of London.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:022380_0024_0FB8598470C5EE70"/>You have learned the uſe of the globes, and muſt recollect that if London is brought under the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated edge of the brazen meridian, and then the ſphere moved on it's axis until the Cape of Good-Hope is brought under the ſame artificial circle, that the difference of longitude between the two places can be obtained by counting the degrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between the two meridians; and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for any other two places whatever. In croſſing the Equator, we had thunder ſqualls, calms, and heavy rains, attended with ſharp lightning, which is frequent in theſe climes; after which, falling in with the S. E. i. e. ſouth eaſt trade wind, which blows as conſtant in that quarter of the compaſs to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the equator, as the N. E. i. e. the north eaſt trade wind, blows to the northward of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Tropics, viz. Cancer and Capricorn. We made the moſt of the wind, and doubling the Cape of Good-Hope, after very tremendous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which obliged us at times to lie <hi>hull too,</hi> with our yards and topmaſts ſtruck, and lower yards at portland, in a mountainous ſea; and at other times to ſcud before menacing waves for life and death, under a cloſe reefed main-topſail laſh'd down to the cap of the maſt, thinking this the ſafeſt to ſcud under, as the loftieſt ſail that could be carried, and moſt out of the reach of our briny ſtern-chaſers, the bellowing foaming billows that followed our ſhip, and every ſucceſſive ſurge menaced our ſtern. In this dangerous and boiſterous ſeaſon of the year (it being the winter of this part of the globe) hawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the northward, to uſe a ſea phraſe, we entered the Moſambique channel; (which caſt your eye on a map of the world, you will find lies between the iſland of Madagaſcar, which is 1000 miles in length, and the main continent of Africa) within the courſe of a week we anchored at Joanna, one of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:022380_0025_0FB859860A6623D0"/>
the Comora Iſlands (in ſight of the above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned iſland of Madagaſcar.) This Comora is a ſmall iſland, but of a beautiful appearance, viewed from the ſea; it riſing all round with an eaſy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from the beach, in little ſwelling hills project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the main body of the mountain, of which the bulk of the iſland is ſeemingly compoſed. This mountain, and it's hills and intermediate val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, are covered with trees and verdure, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce dates, lemons, limes, and tropical fruits in general; fronting the little bay where the ſhips lie at anchor is the watering place, which is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural receiver of ſine ſweet water, precipitated from the top of the iſland down a channel formed by the celerity of the ſtream, which running in a ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine direction through the buſhes and vallies, has a pleaſing effect that cannot but attract the ſight. About one third of a mile from this watering place, is a compact little village, compoſed of two ſmall narrow ſtreets that run parallel to each other about two hundred yards in length; it's houſes are ſmall, and neatly built with ſtone and cement, and was the work of the noted Avery, the pirate, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who made this iſland their principal rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. This place is remarkable (as are all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora iſlands, likewiſe Madagaſcar) for a breed of bats, or flying ſquirrels, the colour of foxes, as big as cats in general, and as full of hair and fur as weaſels; as well as mococks and mungooſes, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals in make like greyhounds, but no bigger in their bodies than a large cat, with long buſhy tails, which are both held in eſtimation in India and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, particularly the mococks, which are the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of dark ſables, but covered with a thick fur. Theſe animals the ladies in Europe affect ſuch fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for, that they frequently permit them to wrap their ſoft buſhy tails round their necks, and repoſe
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022380_0026_0FB859880AF94F98"/>
with their heads on their boſoms. This iſland alſo abounds with a race of ſmall bulls and cows, about the ſize of yearlings, which are very fleſhy and fat; they have a hunch on their ſhoulders, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle horns, very ſharp, but no longer than a man's thumb.</p>
               <p>At this iſland we watered and refreſhed, and then proceeded through the Maldavia Iſlands for Bengal, after which making in our way, the Iſland of Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, (famous for it's cinnamon, the ſmell of which was very perceptible in the neighbourhood of the land) we entered the Bay of Bengal, and in about forty-eight hours diſcovered the high land of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſore, when taking a pilot on board that had been looking out for the Europe ſhips, we ſtood on for the mouth of the river Hugely, a branch of the Great Ganges, a very critical navigation, the mouth of this river being frontiered with ſands, ſome of which ſhift, and are equally blocked up with ſwampy iſlands, infeſted with tygers of an enormous ſize, and aligators, alſo large ſerpents. The pilot had not been long on board before (whether through his obſtinacy or the precipitancy of the Captain) the ſhip ſhallowing her water, ſhe ſtruck on the tail of the eaſtern brace, one of the moſt dangerous ſands in that vicinity, and had very nigh been loſt; but eſcaping this danger, ſhe anchored at Ingillee the latter part of July, when, with the ladies we had on board, ſome Company's ſervants, and other paſſengers, I proceeded in a <hi>budgero</hi> to Calcutta.</p>
               <p>This firſt part of my letter is written in a ſtile calculated for the peruſal of a ſeafaring gentleman apparently, rather than that of a young lady; but as intended for your amuſement and information, as introductory to the letters to come, I have hazarded it's inſertion.</p>

               <p>ON our arrival at Calcutta, which was the day following, we paſſed by Fort-William, and the <hi>budgero</hi> gaining the front of the ſettlement, ſhe hawled into a landing called Bibby-Watts, i. e. the Woman Watt's landing, where a number of boats, different in their conſtruction from any I had ſeen before,—<hi>burrs, dinghees, budgeros,</hi> and Moor <hi>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kys,</hi> added to the exotic appearance of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants aſſembled in innumerable bodies, (Moors, <hi>Genloos,</hi> Armenians, <hi>Callo-fringhees,</hi> or Country-born Chriſtians,) men, women and children, all in general remarkably well dreſſed, particularly in the ſtile of the country, who I was informed were of the Gentoo tribes, attracted my attention, as well that of the reſt of the paſſengers; and being given to underſtand that ſomething extraordinary was to be tranſacted on or about the ſpot we had come to at, being as well ſituated in the varandos of the <hi>budgero</hi> as we could wiſh, we waited the event of theſe novel preparations, and in the interim through the means of the <hi>mangy,</hi> under whoſe direction the boat was, who ſpoke Engliſh in common tollerably well, I informed myſelf which were the different caſts or tribes amongſt this numerous aſſemblage of people; who pointed them out to me much to my ſatisfaction, ſaying, that is a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi>—that is a Hindoo,—this a <hi>Callo-fringhee,</hi>—that an Armenian. This man, from his childhood employed by Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, had acquired a conſiderable ſhare of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in polemical matters, and amongſt other things could tell us, that though the <hi>Toppe-wallees</hi> governed Bengal and all the coaſt of India, and did

as they pleaſed with the <hi>Badſhaws</hi> and <hi>Nabobs,</hi> there were Moor men enough, ſtanch <hi>Shakes, Syeds, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guls</hi> and <hi>Patans,</hi> without the <hi>Gentoos,</hi> to bury them all alive in a day, with but a handful of ſand each, had they but courage; for that there were, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the account of the Bramins, who knew the number of the inhabitants, ten millions of Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans in Indoſtan, and not half one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Toppe-wallees, including the <hi>Callo-fringhees</hi> in all; but, added the <hi>Mangy,</hi> ſo immenſe a number of <hi>Hindoos,</hi> that were they not as timid as women, without any other weapons than even <hi>bamboos</hi> in their hands, they could drive both Mahometans and <hi>Fringhees</hi> out of the country; for that there were ten Hindoos for one Muſſulman, which made an hundred million of <hi>Gentoos</hi> in all, but the <hi>Hindoos</hi> are infidels and idolaters, ſays this man, and <hi>Pyrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur</hi> will not let them rule over true believers, though he permits the <hi>Toppe-wallees</hi> to be a ſcourge to them for a time. This and other diſcourſe he held us while I was ſurveying the crowd, and paying at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to their dreſſes, which I ſhall in their proper place deſcribe minutely. The <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Gentoos</hi> dreſs alike, with <hi>jammers</hi> and <hi>turbans</hi> of fine white muſlin or callico, and ſaſhes of the ſame, and <hi>cryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> ſtuck into their ſaſhes, which are bound tight around their waiſts, and have edges to them of gold fringe, &amp;c. Theſe <hi>jammers</hi> are gowns made much like the women's in America or Europe, but with long ſleeves that taper as they come down to the wriſts, and are ſo long in general, both before and behind, that when walking the ſtreets they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of gathering up a bunch in one hand, to keep the border from being trampled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot: theſe <hi>jammers</hi> are bound with ſilk, mode or ribband, or elſe with a binding of the ſame ſtuff they are made of. Their turbans are traverſed chequer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022380_0029_0FB859918D382BA8"/>
and the ends of ſome of them a foot and others a ſpan deep, which they take care to let come out at the top, by way of ornament. Over this tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban frequently is tied obliquely to the forehead, a handſome ſhawl, handkerchief, or a ſmall ſilk or ſattin ſaſh, and fringed with gold or ſilver. The Moors eſteeming themſelves Seapoys, wear ſwords on all occaſions, and when in <hi>ſawawry,</hi> or on a viſit, carry in their hands ſhields made of Rhinoceros or wild Buffalo's hide, thick enough to ſend off the blow of a ſcymitar, but not an arrow or muſket ball. The <hi>Gentoos</hi> go equally armed, but none but <hi>Rajahpoots,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it is to ſight, and <hi>Bramins</hi> of diſtinction amongſt them, wear any other arms than a <hi>Chury</hi> or <hi>Chryſs,</hi> except on particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as, for inſtance, on celebration of their nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, or the feſtivals held amongſt themſelves, when the addition of the ſword and ſhield take place, though a mere matter of parade. Theſe two caſts of people made up the aſſembled crowd, excepting a few Armenians and <hi>Callo-fringheees</hi> that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with them, commonly called Portugueze, of which latter there are a great number in Bengal, and in all the European ſettlements in India. The Armenians are a fair complexioned people, and dreſs much like the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Gentoos,</hi> except their caps, which they wear inſtead of turbans, which are moſtly made of black velvet, or broad cloth. The Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze or <hi>Callo-fringhees</hi> dreſs exactly like the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, and being as remarkable for their vanity as their ſuperſtitious attachment to the papiſt religion, endeavour to envy each other in finery and equipage. The <hi>Gentoo</hi> women and girls from all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts had likewiſe gathered together on this occaſion, and were mixed with the multitude, but few or no Moor women were to be ſeen, except ſome of inferior ſtamp; the females amongſt the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022380_0030_0FB8599496D1CFE8"/>
Mahometans in India, like the women belonging to the Turks in Aſia and Europe, not expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to public view, nor going out without being compleatly covered from head to foot with a veil. Theſe <hi>Gentoo</hi> women in general are dreſſed in a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin or callico <hi>pizwawge,</hi> reſembling the gown I have deſcribed the men wear, which I ſhall be more particular in the account of hereafter; under this <hi>pizwawge</hi> they wear an upper and under ſkirt, the upper one ſome brilliant colour and the under one fine linen: they wear no ſhoes, but go barefoot through the ſtreets, except the Ranahs, i. e. wives and daughters of Rajahs, and Hindoo ladies of the firſt rank, who keep themſelves as hidden as the Moor women from the ſight of men. Over the <hi>pizwawge</hi> they wear a <hi>lungah,</hi> and over that a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putah;</hi> the <hi>lungah</hi> is to cover them when they are bathing and the <hi>deputah</hi> is their veil, both which they throw over them in a careleſs manner, but will occaſionally peep out from under their veils, and diſcover their faces as they paſs through the ſtreets, or remain ſtanding in a crowd. The palms of their hands and the ſoles of their feet are tinged with <hi>mindy,</hi> as likewiſe their finger and toe-nails, which being a beautiful pink colour ſhews to no diſadvantage. They wear rings in their right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils and the middle ſtnip of their noſes; the rings they carry in their noſtrils are frequently the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of a dollar, and ſometimes not exceeding that of a piſtareen, which always have two preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, ſaphires, rubies or amethyſts, with pearls between the two jewels ſuſpended, and the ſame to the rings that are reeved through the ſnip of their noſes, which are leſs than the noſtril rings, being ſo contrived as only to admit the jewels ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended thereto to come down to the upper-lip.— We had not long amuſed ourſelves with contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022380_0031_0FB85995D522F320"/>
this crowd, when the ſun ſetting below the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon of a beautiful ſerene ſky, I was ſtruck with the ſplendid and ſudden appearance of ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand little pagodas, or Indian temples of different magnitudes and proportions, (all of them painted and gilded, from three to ſix feet in height, with their reſpective porticos, galleries, balluſtrades, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, domes and ſpires,) launched from the ſtrand; and numbers of pleaſure boats in different parts of the river, on flat boards of ſufficient bearings to float them; which illuminated with little gilded ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers within ſide and without, reflecting on and ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through caſements of tranſparent iſinglaſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in a very advantageous light the images that were fixed on pedeſtals in the centre of theſe edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: ſome of <hi>Bramin</hi> bulls, and peacocks with their tails expanded, and others of <hi>Jagarnaut</hi> and <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou Swamy,</hi> and different idols worſhipped by theſe deluded uninformed people. Theſe glittering tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had no ſooner been launched, than a report as ſmart and as loud as muſketoons, like a feu-de-joye or ſtreet firing, was heard from all quarters. They were a number of Chineſe crackers, diſcharged from the hands of boys, dreſſed, painted and decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with jewels, on the occaſion; the boys in theſe parts wearing necklaces and earrings, with rings in their noſes like the women; and even men, when full dreſſed, will never appear without them. Theſe crackers are neatly made up and bound tight with ſmall wires, cat-gut and Indian weed, and filled with ſtrong double fortified elaſtic powder; thus artfully confined though the interior tube that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the powder, will be no bigger than a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine quill: on being fired they make an incredible loud report.</p>
               <p>This ſcene was novel and pleaſing enough to have attended to awhile, but the turning of the tide
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022380_0032_0FB8599811B5B4E8"/>
againſt a breeze of wind that began to increaſe, ſoon overſet this fragile navigation, extinguiſhed the luminaries of theſe little floating temples, and immerged in the ſtream theſe various Indoſtan dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, amidſt the repeated ſhouts and acclamations of the Gentoo tribes on the river and adjacent ſhores, and compleated what the Europeans in Bengal call drowning Jagernaut: this day happening to be the celebration of an annual feſtival held in commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that Pagan divinity, who by the <hi>Gentoos</hi> is looked upon as a mediator between <hi>Bogwau</hi> and man.</p>

               <p>JAGERNAUT drowned, as I wrote you by the laſt year's ſhipping, the different equipages by this time brought down to the landing for conveying we new-comers to our reſpective connections, <hi>viz.</hi> phaetons, chariots and palanquins, in diſembark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we were felecitated on our arrival by ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen on the ſpot, the ladies handed into carriages and drove to the government (it being an invariable rule for every gentlewoman who is ſent from Europe to viſit the Governor firſt) who never parts with her 'till he delivers her into ſafe hands, and ſees her honorably accommodated. Theſe ladies, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to gentlemen of narrow fortunes, with the conſent of their friends, annually, ſome two or three in a ſhip, go to India, where having nobody on the ſpot to ſupercede them, they in a ſhort time make
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022380_0033_0FB8599ACAF15888"/>
a conqueſt of ſome gentleman or other, advanced in the Company's ſervice; for no one leſs than a factor dare preſume to think of an European lady, nor will the Governor (without whoſe conſent they cannot be married) admit of ſuch a match, which reſtrictions ſecures to them conſiderable ſettlements, and I believe an inſtance never was known for a young maiden of ſpotleſs character not making a brilliant fortune by a trip to Bengal. The women bowled off in their ſuperb carriages; a palanquin that had been ſent for me by Mr. Lambert, a ſenior merchant in the Company's ſervice, I ſtepped into it, and was ſhewn how to fix myſelf without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering it's tilting, and orders given in a language that I did not underſtand, (as I was afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) to carry me to the houſe of a Mr. Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a gentleman then in Council at Calcutta. As this vehicle is not only a ſhining but a neceſſary equipage in India, I will give you a ſhort deſcription of it, and refer you to my gloſſary for further par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. A <hi>palanquin</hi> may with great propriety be called a valant couch; it is oblong in it's make, and beſpread with mattraſſes, and a ſilk or ſattin covering called an <hi>epinjary,</hi> that is ſpread over the arch of the <hi>bamboo,</hi> to keep out the dew and ſun beams, and is carried by four men at a time on a thick <hi>bamboo,</hi> that forms an arch over the main body of the <hi>palanquin,</hi> and runs projecting out ſome ſix feet before, and about four feet behind; two of the men keeping forward and the other two in the rear. Theſe <hi>bamboos</hi> have their ends neatly covered with leather, and the arches of them with velvet or broad-cloth. Three handſome taſſels hang under the <hi>bamboo,</hi> the body of the middle one as big as an oſtrich egg, and the taſſels in general a couple of ſpans deep. Theſe are of uſe and ornament both, for bobbing this way and that way with the motion
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022380_0034_0FB8599D71470938"/>
of the <hi>palanquin,</hi> they ſerve to keep off the flies and muſquitoes, with which this country abounds. At the but end of the fore part of the <hi>bamboo</hi> is fixed in caſt metal, gold, ſilver or braſs, the head and claws of a dragon, a griffin, or crocodile; and at the other end of the <hi>bamboo,</hi> the tail and poſterior parts of the ſame animal that is fixed in the front: and a palanquin being a mark of honor and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Indoſtan, no ſubject preſumes to mount one, except authorized by the Mogul himſelf, a <hi>Soubah, Nabob</hi> or <hi>Rajah;</hi> which right remains hereditay, or only during office or life, at the will of the Prince who confered it.—Thus fixed in my <hi>palanquin,</hi> though in a very inexpert manner, as it then ſtood on it's four feet on the ground, the ſides of it were held by two men, whilſt the bearers ſtooped down and dexterouſly raiſed it up by clapping the ends of the <hi>bamboo</hi> under their ſhoulders, when they ſet off in a dog trot, at a rapid rate, ſinging out as they jogged along, in a plaintive tone, a kind of a ſong I did not underſtand. In this way I was conveyed to the houſe of my friend, where the <hi>palanquin</hi> was ſet down, and I conducted up ſtairs and received by Mr. Middleton, who introduced me to his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and gave orders for a <hi>notch,</hi> and as we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up and down the varando, amongſt other things told me that he would furniſh me with a <hi>banyan,</hi> when his <hi>carrany</hi> called me aſide to inform me there were ſent into an apartment deſtined for me, two bags of <hi>rupees;</hi> upon which I took the hint, and with this <hi>carrany</hi> withdrew, who counted out to me two thouſand <hi>rupees,</hi>—I depoſited them in my eſcrutoire, which was no ſooner done, than a fat ſhort man of a ſtraw coloured complexion, accompanied by his ſon, a boy about twelve years of age, accoſted me: this man was a <hi>Gentoo,</hi> of the <hi>bramin</hi> caſt, and a ſubſtantial <hi>banyan.</hi> They both were richly dreſſed

in the ſtile of the country, and had all the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of people of credit. The ſubject they waited on me was that of my employing the father as my <hi>banyan;</hi> who producing a line from my friend, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of his offer, with a <hi>nazar,</hi> he preſented me, conſiſting of five gold <hi>mohars</hi> and three <hi>ſicca rupees,</hi> which was looked upon, I was informed, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of an agreement; when they paid their compliments by meeting their right hands with their foreheads, and letting them fall in a graceful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner while they bowed their bodies, (which is called making a <hi>ſallam</hi>)—after this they retired, and left me to my private cogitations. My friend returning after ſupper, we went into a large ſaloon, when a company of women, about fifteen in number, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as it were, in the front of a theatre, by <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> i.e. ſets, with their <hi>bajana wallas,</hi> and paid their compliments by <hi>ſallaming</hi> us in the manner the <hi>banyan</hi> and his ſon <hi>ſallamed</hi> me; the women varying nothing in this particular from the men, in Indoſtan. This done, they ſeated themſelves croſs-legged on the carpet, according to the cuſtom of all Aſiatics, when a <hi>typha,</hi> which always conſiſts of three of theſe dancing girls, ſang a ſong (much in vogue then, and accompanied it by the <hi>ſerindas,</hi> to the ſatisfaction of the audience) that was called the fate of the <hi>Soubah Serajahdowlah,</hi> which name introduced in the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus occaſionally, ended every verſe; when beatle was brought in to entertain them.</p>

               <p>THE girls to whom I have hitherto addreſſed myſelf from India, correſpond with each other, and will be as proud to tranſmit you my letters as I am to underſtand by yours that you wiſhed for a peruſal of them: in future, it will be improbable I ſhould neglect writing to you the firſt. Your letter I have made the frontispiece to my Europe miſcellanies. The letters antecedent to this, ſhould ere now, by the ſteps I am informed you had taken, have fallen into your hands. The company ſeated, (as I wrote Louiſa ******'s ſiſter in my laſt letter) afforded me an opportunity of contemplating their perſons and examining their dreſs, both which I ſhall give you a ſketch of in my letters to the ladies I correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with in general.</p>
               <p>The dreſſes of theſe females, cloſely copied from the faſhions of the Seraglios, which are conſtant ſtandards for the women in thoſe parts to regulate themſelves by in that important article of dreſs and the decoration of their perſons; it being to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked that theſe Aſiatics are as tenacious in the points of dreſs, and any ſignificant addition or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition might be made thereunto by a predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant party of belles in the Seraglio of the Mogul, Vizier or <hi>Soubah,</hi> as ever a ſet of the firſt rank la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that ever formed a route in London or Paris. To return from which digreſſion, the Indoſtan wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wear ſhifts which differ but little in make from thoſe of the European women, and under their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022380_0037_0FB859A49D697310"/>
ſkirts, which are always made of tiſſue or a brilliant coloured ſilk or ſattin, ſet off with a deep gold or ſilver fringe below, and as often embroidered with ſprigs of the ſame, they wear likewiſe a white li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen petticoat, and within that ſtriped ſilk drawers, drawn round the waiſt with ſilk, knit, or wove ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages, and in the ſame manner drawn tight round the ancles of their legs; whilſt the <hi>Gentoo</hi> women, who differ from the other Indoſtan women in this particlar, diſpenſe with theſe drawers and wear an extraordinary ſkirt in their ſtead. Over the dreſs above deſcribed goes the <hi>pizwawge,</hi> a robe or gown made in the following manner; two pieces of muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin are laid flat on each other like ſheets of writing paper in a quire, then doubled from the middle, which making them fourfold adds to the ſtrength of them, and makes the whole better calculated for the lower part of the <hi>pizwawge,</hi> which forms a ſkirt with a handſome gold border to it of about a ſpan deep all round; theſe pieces of muſlin being finiſhed off in that manner while fabricating on the bamboo ſtands, are made of ſuch lengths as to admit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally their being converted into <hi>pizwawgee</hi>'s, in the making of which by doubling the lengths to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it may eaſily be conceived how the ends of theſe pieces by making them meet, may be contrived to anſwer the purpoſes of a border to the lower part of the <hi>pizwawge,</hi> which the <hi>Zundirjees,</hi> i.e. the women taylors, pay particular attention to, as well as the length of the train of the <hi>pizwawgees,</hi> in the making of which, with the Indoſtan ladies they muſt never be infringed on. In order to accompliſh this, the <hi>Zundirjees</hi> employed for that purpoſe in meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lady the dreſs is intended for, begin by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her circumference from juſt below her ſhoulder-blades, and that part of the body that coincides with them, not from the ſmall of the back above
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022380_0038_0FB859A6FAEBC938"/>
the hips, according to the cuſtom of the American and European ladies. This done, they cut off the upper part of the folded muſlins and lay them apart for the body or veſt of the robe, whilſt the part that forms the ſkirt is drawn up into a convenient number of gatherings; then they adjuſt the body, and fix it to the ſkirt to their liking, making the hind part terminate in a train as propoſed, while the fore part but barely meeting the floor has loops to raiſe it and keep it from incumbering the feet, by contriving it ſo as to admit of the border's juſt reaching the inſtep; which contraction of the robe diſcovering (as the party walks or dances) the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering annulets, and large hoop rings incruſted with pearls and gems of different culours with which her toes, ancles and legs (if a female of the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions) will be in a manner incaſed, whilſt her train flowing behind ſweeping the rich Perſian carpet ſhe treads on, exhibits to great advantage the graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the perſon, and elegance of the dreſs.</p>
               <p>I am addreſſing myſelf to ladies, or I ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be leſs diffuſive on a ſubject that by the other ſex might be thought effeminate; in future I will be leſs minute, but beg leave to finiſh the detail of an Indoſtan lady's attire in the manner I have began.</p>
               <p>I will now write in the plural number, and not confine myſelf to the dreſſes of the women in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their diſpoſition and manners in particular, but treat of them in general.</p>
               <p>The ſleeves of Indoſtan ladies robes are fixed to their <hi>pizwawgees</hi> much in the ſame manner the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican or European women's gowns are, only theſe growing narrower by degrees are made to extend to about half a yard, when pulled out, beyond their finger ends, that by that contrivance a number of muſlin ringlets may be made to form a pretty cuff when ſhoved up above the wriſt, without concealing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022380_0039_0FB859A8DCF97718"/>
the gold rings and bracelets adorned with precious ſtones that they wear night and day on their fingers and wriſts. Theſe ſleeves being ſtrait, to render them more convenient for the motion of their arms, are ſlit at the elbows; and the edge of that aperture worked round in needle-work, like the edge of a Dreſden wriſtband. They wear neither tippets nor handkerchiefs over their necks and ſhoulders, but have a half veſt or bodice of muſlin, edged with ſmall rubies, ſapphires, emeralds, or pearls, if able to purchaſe them; if not, a narrow binding of ſilk anſwers the purpoſe; which demi veſt they ſlip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſhifts and clap over their breaſts: theſe demi veils are called <hi>chatty bunds,</hi> and are made exactly to fit, and being diaphanous, the women ſolely depend on the contexture of their veils for the concealment of their charms, which, as one of the moſt indiſpenſable parts of an Indoſtan female's dreſs, you muſt not be ſurprized ſhould I be rather leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in the deſcription of it in my next.</p>

               <p>THESE veils I had promiſed you a deſcription of are about three ells long, and an ell and one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wide, of an azure, purple, pink, green, ſcarlet, or any fancy colour whatever; and though of an extreme fine manufactured muſlin, are ſo thick as not to be tranſparent but from within ſide: they have all gold or ſilver edges to them of about four fingers wide, and the ends terminate like the ends of the ſaſhes or bottoms of their <hi>pizwawgees,</hi> in a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022380_0040_0FB859AA21F6DEB8"/>
deep gold or ſilver border, and as one of the moſt eſſential appendages of an oriental lady's dreſs, as I have already intimated, are by them manouver'd and handled with as inexplicable art and inimitable eaſe and oconomy: whether when travelling in their <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanquins, doolies</hi> or hackerries abroad, or when walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their varandoes, ſaloons or gardens at home, or ſitting down in public, or tète à tête in private with a friend, it matters not, the veil muſt be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. When in a ſtate of real or ſeeming deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the head reclined on the arm inwrapt in one end of the veil, a part of the face will be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able under the ſhining border of the other end or golden edges, with the marks of anxiety or care de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picted thereon. At funerals the veil the diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late mother, ſiſter or relict, throws over her in ſuch a manner as to cover the whole body from head to foot except her hands, which wringing with a bunch of it retain'd in them, ſhe ſuddenly will convert into a <hi>ramol</hi> to abſorb the tears dropping from her eyes. When exaſperated by the perfidy or frowns of a lover, the veil, by the irritated dame who wears it, will be diſtended, then twiſted firſt one way and then another, and the ends converted into taſſels to beat time to the ſighs and ſobs intervening her ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. When overjoyed at the unexpected ſight of a long abſented friend, parent, huſband or lover, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to in marriage perhaps, and given over for loſt) the veil then, like wings, will be expanded at the full extent of the hands and arms, whilſt the enraptured female with rapidity and obvious ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, will fly to the embraces of the welcome and unexpected gueſt; and if a parent or huſband, fall down at their feet and wipe them therewith. The veil in ſhort, under all circumſtances of the mind or body, whether fortuitous or premeditated, exigent or voluntary, comes of uſe in courſe; and without
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022380_0041_0FB859ABC5763568"/>
it, with ſatisfaction and decorum, nothing trivial or important can be effected. I have deſcribed in my letter, No. 2, to your neighbour Louiſa ******, the necklaces, bracelets and annulets they wear on their wriſts and ancles; which but differ more or leſs from each other in mode or value, in proportion to the circumſtances and taſte of the women who wear them; which rings, &amp;c. except the thumb ring wore by women of all degrees in Indoſtan, are all the trinkets that at preſent occur to me, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them. The thumb ring is about the ſize of a common ſignet, of the diameter of a quarter of a dollar, and worn on the right thumb; the ſurface of it is a bright ſpeculum of plain poliſhed ſteel, or a bit of good looking-glaſs, ſet in a ſocket of gold, environed with little gems. They are cut out into ovals, perfect circles, or polygons, at the pleaſure of the goldſmith or female it is intended for. This little mirror ſerves the women to adjuſt their hair by, pencil their eye-brows, accommodate to their fancy their veils, or contemplate their faces in, and anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers the purpoſe both of portable mirrors and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There remains nothing now but the ſaſh and the ſlippers to compleat the inventory of the decorations and dreſs of an Indoſtan female: The ſaſh differs in nothing from the veil but in colour, (which is always by way of contraſt different) and in dimenſions, it being in general about one third leſs than the veil. Theſe ſaſhes they wear partly round their waiſts and partly round their bodies, as fancy or chance at times decides, with frequently one end of them circumflected round an arm, whilſt the other end careleſsly playing about will reach down to the bottom of their <hi>pizwawgees,</hi> and fall in with the border before or behind. Their ſlippers are either ſilk, velvet or red leather, and ornamented with ſpangles, and often with gems. They likewiſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022380_0042_0FB859AD6947F670"/>
uſe <hi>ramols,</hi> i. e. handkerchiefs, and are in as perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual want of them, it may be ſuppoſed, in a cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſituate under one of the tropics, but do not convert the one and the ſame handkerchief to all the menial purpoſes Europeans do theirs, for their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs would revolt at the idea of wiping their faces with the ſame <hi>ramol</hi> they had wiped their noſes with; which is not the only inſtance of the delicacy of theſe women, for they are the epitome of neatneſs in body and apparel: in every other reſpect, bathing themſelves, and having their hair comb'd out and cleanſed, their bodies and clothes perfumed, their ears picked, and their nails pared at the ſame time, daily, not neglecting their teeth every morning; to preſerve which and keep clean they rub with <hi>munjun,</hi> (a ſearching powder in uſe in thoſe parts) and once a month apply <hi>mindy</hi> to their fingers, toe-nails, palms of their hands, and ſoles of their feet, which keeps them cool, and gives them a beautiful crimſon tinge. [See in gloſſary further deſcribed.]</p>
               <p>In this manner do the women in Indoſtan dreſs and adorn themſelves, with little if any variation in thoſe particulars, except in the different degrees of magnificence of their cloathing and intrinſic value of the auxiliary decorations.</p>

               <p>The piece was called the Durrabas Sardar, (this is the deceitful Lord) and the perſons of the drama were as follows: Sardarilly Kan, a ſovereign Prince amongſt the <hi>Patans,</hi> at war with the <hi>Sicks;</hi> Shah Jahan, Emperor of Indoſtan; a <hi>peerzadah,</hi> i.e. prieſt, and two eunuchs.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022380_0049_0FB859BD1E2BC910"/>
Lahor with Zemroude, who had been ſeduced by Sardarilly Kan. Mawtab is contracted in marriage to Sardarilly Kan, whom the Emperor diſpatches after this contract, to engage the <hi>Sicks,</hi> propoſing the nuptials to be conſummated on his return from battle, who having ſet off to meet the enemy, Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tab impatiently waiting her lover's return; but he paying his addreſſes to another lady at the ſame time, one Sittarradar, of Lahor (unknown to Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tab and the Emperor her father) after having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the victory, he ſends a rich dooly with an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered <hi>ramol</hi> as a private token to Sittarradar, in order to convey her incog. to the palace at Agra, where he propoſes meeting her with a prieſt that ſhall join their hands immediately on her arrival; and prior to that, he having wrote two letters, one to Mawtab at Delhy, and another to Sittarradar, the Princeſs at Lahor, which letters, in the hurry of his affairs he making a miſtake in the ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by addreſſing the letter intended for Sittarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar to Mawtab, and the one intended for Mawtab to Sittarradar; allowing Sittarradar ſufficient time to pay him the propoſed viſit and return before Maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tab could, from the nature of his appointment with her, reaſonably expect him at the capitol, which opening an unexpected ſcene to theſe two ladies, (neither of which, as women of the firſt rank, could brook the idea of a competitor in their pretenſions to the aſcendency in matrimonial rights, the firſt wife amongſt Mahometans, notwithſtanding a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of wives is admiſſible, ever claiming a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative over the reſt) enraged at Sardarilly Kan's diſſimulation, (though apart) theſe ladies formed ſimilar plans, at meeting together at Delhy (being intimate from their childhood) they unbending their minds to each other, and concerting meaſures for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their deceiver, and being revenged on him for

               <p>YOU form one circle of correſpondence, and communicate your letters I know to each other, I ſhall therefore in future not point out to any of you any more the methods you may take to get at this or that particular number, but leave it to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do as you pleaſe therein, as I ſhall confine my addreſſes entirely to this circle of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and thinking myſelf highly honored by the attention paid to my ſcralls, my ſtudy ſhall be to render them as worthy your acceptance as poſſible.</p>
               <p>The perſons among the dancing girls who were fixed upon to repreſent the characters in the drama, we may ſuppoſe a long while prepared before hand, and exerciſed in the like performances by ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repreſentations, muſt have got their particular parts well off by heart, and be ſufficiently adequate to the taſk. The parts of Mawtab and Sittarradar were to be acted by two young beautiful girls, whoſe real names taken from hiſtory happened to be the ſame as thoſe of the perſonages they were going to repreſent: theſe girls moreover happening to be maidens, and as females in Indoſtan during the ſtate of virginity are particularly diſtinguiſhed and more than ordinary attended to during that ſtate, before I proceed any further I will give you an account of them.—A girl that is a maiden never wears a pink or ſcarlet <hi>pizwage</hi> or ſkirt, except it is on the day of her wedding, when her friends if they think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may inveſt her with this mark of diſtinction; and as an important indication of virginity the pearl that is wore in common and ſuſpended by a little ring reeved through the middle ſnip of the noſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022380_0053_0FB859CA529F3A28"/>
the pearl down to the top of the upper lip, has during her virginity no collateral jems on each ſide like the middle pearls wore by the reſt of her ſex who have been joined in hymeneal bands, as an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mark of innocence and purity, nothing but the bare pearl drop on her lip appearing till after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation in marriage; and being in general the youngeſt of the females in a family, a greater atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is paid to her by her connections, and more means uſed to improve as well as amuſe her, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly amongſt the dancing girls, when a <hi>cheerabund,</hi> as the flower of the flock and favorite of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or ſet ſhe belongs to, being on account of her youth the beſt calculated to pleaſe, no pains are ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to render her equally attractive in other reſpects by an extraordinary attention paid to the decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her perſon, that her ſuperficial ornaments added to her natural charms and acquired accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, ſhe may by being exhibited in the moſt advantageous point of view the more readily attract the eye of a <hi>Shazahdah;</hi> a <hi>Soubah,</hi> or opulent <hi>Rajah,</hi> or a rich young libertine amongſt the Engliſh or French <hi>Toppe-wallas</hi> in their ſettlements at a notch, and by making a ſignal conqueſt of a man of fortune ſecure to herſelf and her friends a capital ſum of <hi>rupees,</hi> with rich preſents from the faſcinated <hi>Syab,</hi> whom ſhe has allured with her charms on taking leave; beſtowed as an equivalent for the favors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and the ſacrifice ſhe has made of her charms to the lofty <hi>borrah Syab</hi> or pompous aſiatic lord. The two perſons pointed out to repreſent the two princeſſes, I have noticed; which with a ſpirited young female who was pitched upon to act the part of Zemroode, and two perſonable grown women larger than the reſt, to do that of Shajahan, the Emperor and the Prieſt with two tall palled looking girls who were at hand to act the parts of the eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022380_0054_0FB859CC9B83EA30"/>
conſtituted the whole of the perſons of the drama.</p>
               <p>Theſe leading characters dreſſed in a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous manner than the reſt of their comrades, to ſuit the occaſion, advanced in front forming three <hi>Typhas,</hi> with Mawtab in the centre of the firſt, Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarradar in the centre of the ſecond, and Zemroode in the like poſition with reſpect to the third, when the opera opened, and was conducted in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner,—the <hi>Typhas</hi> thus in readineſs, on the entrance of about ten <hi>Moſſolljees</hi> with their lighted <hi>moſſalls</hi> blazing in their hands, (which are flambeaux uſed all over India) fixed in braſs handles, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their <hi>Typhas,</hi> and Mawtab between Settarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar and Zemroode, in trio, ſang a ſong, the tune of which reſembled in ſome meaſure the tune of 'Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parted from the ſea,' &amp;c.—This was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the <hi>Serindas, Tomtoms,</hi> and <hi>Beringealls;</hi> in the courſe of which ſcene the abuſed Princeſſes would interchange frowns and ſmiles in different ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, riſe and fall their voices, and modulate them to the different keys or pitch of the inſtruments of the band then playing, and to the meaſure of the tune in hand; which artfully adapted to the ſenſe of the words, being <hi>alto</hi> and <hi>fortiſſimo,</hi> where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ſhould be expreſſed in rage, and <hi>moderato adagio</hi> or <hi>piano,</hi> in leſs irritable altercations when the dialogue was cheerful, &amp;c. &amp;c. All this while the bodies and limbs of every muſician belonging to the band was in motion, from the <hi>Serindawallas</hi> down to the <hi>Tomtoms</hi> and <hi>Beringealls;</hi> the <hi>Serindawallas</hi> notwithſtanding the ſoftneſs with which they drawed their bows acroſs the ſtrings of their viols, and the delicacy with which they ſtopped their fingers, would give at times ſuch ſudden exertions of their creſts and ſhoulders, and violent retrogradations of their elbows, that a ſpectator who had never ſeen them
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022380_0055_0FB859CE1411D528"/>
perform before, would imagine they had thrown themſelves into convulſive fits; and the ſame with the others in the different departments of their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The <hi>Tomtoms</hi> and <hi>Beringealls</hi> being on oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſides of the place, emulated in endeavouring to outdo each other in a variety of odd poſitions they put their bodies in, and as uncommon geſticulations they made with their limbs, and grimaces with their faces, by various aggravations of the features, and confronting each other like combattants who had entered the liſts to decide ſome warlike diſpute, would begin the conteſt by mutual nodding, wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beckoning acroſs the ſaloon; after which the <hi>Tomtoms</hi> perhaps leading the van for the then preſent, would with fingers and thumbs (for thoſe are all the implements they have to extort ſounds out of the inſtruments with) in order to ſucceed without failing in the part they were playing at that particular juncture, ſhrink their heads to ſuch a degree into the hollow formed, by ſhrugging up of the ſhoulders at the ſame time, in order to facilitate and humor the ratling the revilleè they were beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their fingers on their hollow inſtruments or <hi>Tomtoms,</hi> while the <hi>Beringealls</hi> not idle on their part, and equally ambitious to demonſtrate their abilities, would draw up their mouths, grin and bite their lips, ſtare the oppoſite <hi>Tomtoms</hi> full in the face, then graſping their <hi>Berringealls,</hi> menace with them, ſeemingly, the <hi>Tomtoms;</hi> and continue this ſport for ſome time in the following manner: the Serin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawallas now conjoin both timbrels together, clap them in that poſition to one ear, and with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rapidity and violence ding for half a minute or ſo, then rattle them over their heads, or with leſs violence when any ſoft tender air was playing, gently ſound them within a reſpectful diſtance of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ears; and on a tranſition of the tune from
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022380_0056_0FB859D2FA858970"/>
                  <hi>piano</hi> to <hi>fortiſſimo,</hi> from that poſition that was partly erect, ſuddenly bending their bodies downwards with their fiſts employed as before, as ſuddenly ſweep the ſurface of the carpet on which they were ſtanding, and looking eagerly at the performers in the face, however uneaſy the poſture they might be in by the unnatural curvature of their necks; whilſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes on their part obſerving carefully their quee throughout the different ſcenes of action, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied this vocal and inſtrumental muſic with as great a variety of agreeable alterations in the diſpoſition of their robes and the inclination of their heads and elegant poſitions of their feet and hands and arms; while the veils all this time, like different coloured enſigns and pendants waving about ſhips ſterns and maſt-heads in light intermitting breezes, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving round theſe brilliant aſiatic actreſſes in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable gyrations, heightened the complexion of the entertainment, and obliged the company to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur that it tranſcended any theatrical performance they ever ſaw exhibited in Europe. Thus did they proceed, enveloping and developing themſelves with their veils; ſometimes exhibiting to full view their whole perſons from top to toe, at others affording but as tranſient a glimpſe thereof, whilſt in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual motion of their bodies and limbs, without jumping up or down or beating time with their heels, or croſſing over and figuring in, as is done in hornpipes, jiggs, &amp;c. amongſt us, which they would eſteem rude in a female to pretend to attempt; they went through the innumerable evolutions of the dance, to the end of the piece. This may convey to you a tolerable good idea of what is called in Indoſtan a <hi>notch;</hi> there remains now but to determine what name, with propriety, might be given to this aſiatic entertainment, in Engliſh. In treating of it all along, I have occaſionally called it an opera, a
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022380_0057_0FB859D523CF57D8"/>
dance, or a dramatic performance, which latter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all productions of the drama whatever, and a name general to all theatrical productions, I thought with great propriety might be applied to a <hi>notch:</hi> they have all the properties of a dramatic piece, viz. an hiſtory, with an epiſode, a plot, and a counter-plot, which are well wound up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and the characters as well ſupported and contrived, replete with variety and incidndence; and the laws of time, place and action, as minutely obſerved, inaſmuch that were theſe pieces to be acted in one of the Theatres in London, by his Majeſty's comedians, they would meet with as general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe as any opera that ever was acted; which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpecies of writing I think they ſhould be claſſed amongſt; but this diſadvantage theſe operas labour under in Indoſtan, where no man cannot even as much as ride out in the ſame carriage with a female, or ſit near her in public, without becoming an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ridicule, it would be abſurdity then to the laſt degree, and a ſubject of admiration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to ſee men and women indiſcriminately mixed together on an occaſion like the one I am alluding to; but for a man to offer to kiſs a lady's lips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a company, or take her in his arms, would be an offence that could not be pardoned, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inadmiſſable in Indoſtan; which will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently account for the women acting the part of men on theſe occaſions, and the reaſon they have not public Theatres on purpoſe for exhibitions of this nature is as plain. The natives of Indoſtan fond of permanent things, and holding all ſcenery and pictureſque repreſentations of palaces and groves as puerile and tawdry, prefer carrying on their country diſſipations in actual Saloons covered with rich Perſian carpets; and ſuperb Varandos, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural auguſt groves formed by nature, with ſome
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022380_0058_0FB859D64E753BA0"/>
elegant edifice therein to retire to; and flattering myſelf that you will ſide with me in opinion of the rectitude of the Indoſtan gentry, in theſe laſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and in that of their <hi>notches</hi> being dramatic pieces that may come within the deſcription of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic operas, I will conclude and bid you adieu.</p>

My military conſiſted of an Huvle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar and fifteen Seapoys, with their arms and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and two field pieces, four <hi>Gollandaſhes;</hi> which with two <hi>Claſſees,</hi> my <hi>Mangy</hi> and ſixteen <hi>Dandees</hi> to govern and row the <hi>Budgero,</hi> and a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> and ſixteen <hi>Dandees</hi> to the <hi>Dinghies,</hi> with five men to each cook-boat beſides, compleated my naval force; my own private equipage and attendants were as follow, a new and handſome Palanquin, with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dolphin's head and tail in their proper place, a ſprightly ſizeable <hi>tarſy</hi> horſe, that coſt me about fifteen hundred rupees, with European bridle and ſaddle and furniture, conſtituted my equipage; and my attendance were in the order and rank I have below placed them, leaving them to you to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,—Ramramboſs my <hi>Banyan,</hi> a <hi>Bramin</hi> and of

The <hi>Peuns</hi> are a ſpecious of military men, and are armed with daggers, ſwords and ſhields, and act the part of body guards. The <hi>Harcarars,</hi> who are Hendoos, are employed in no other ſervice than that of delivering letters and meſſages, though it is part of the duty of either of the former to do either, or to arreſt men they have controverſial buſineſs with, collateral to this equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page and to theſe attendants.

This melancholy affair was aſcribed to the raſh and premeditated orders of the Nabob:<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis as cuſtomary in writing or ſpeaking of a Soubah, to ſtile him Nabob as Soubah.</note> but without palliating the matter or exculpating him from blame, this was the caſe as repreſented to me, by people of undoubted veracity, who were witneſſes to the whole tranſaction.

The <hi>Soubah</hi> immerged in his pleaſures, and his troops employed, ſome in reſting themſelves and others in dividing their ſpoils, the repeated cries of the priſoners, panting and gaſping for air and water, unattended to, they died in a heap, in the happening of which cataſtrophe, if the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah was reprehenſible in any thing, it was the little attention, 'tis ſaid, he paid to the news that was brought him the morning following of the death of theſe people, when it was ſuggeſted he would have puniſhed the commandant of <hi>Seapoys</hi> for his remiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in not examining into the ſize of the priſon before he ordered ſuch a number of men into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement; but calling for his Hooker, whilſt ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, inſtead of attending to the matter in queſtion, tho' ſerious enough in its nature to have exacted a greater ſhare of his attention, he ſatisfied himſelf with ſaying, <hi>Allap kuhhookum,</hi> i. e.

               <p>Theſe anecdotes I thought proper to introduce, as they contribute to ſhew the temper of this man, and to point out by what an unexpected chain of events the credit of the Engliſh factors in Bengal was re-eſtabliſhed, and the overthrow of this reſtleſs young Prince brought about; who not many months after fell a victim to the reſentment of the Engliſh, by their contrivance, and loſt his life in a diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner in the fray, for major Clive arriving with commodore Watſon, from Europe, he engaged one <hi>Meer Jaffier Alli Kan,</hi> a <hi>Syed</hi> of ſome repute, who was then a general under the Soubah, to head an army againſt his maſter, in conſort with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's

Theſe lines are always made of a ſufficient ſtrength to ſuſtain

any jerk they may receive from a ſudden zigzag mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the veſſel, when repelled on the bow or the quarter by the violent retrograde direction of the ſtream, and long enough to afford a ſufficient ſcope for the veſſel to keep always at a ſafe and convenient diſtance from the ſtrand, and equally to admit of ſix, ten, fifteen or twenty <hi>coolies,</hi> more or leſs as may be required, to haul the veſſel along ſhore by this tracting line, which coolies, the conductors of boats belonging to the Company in Bengal, are never at a loſs to obtain; a <hi>Harcarar</hi> being ſufficient at any time, or on any occaſion, to ſupply that defecct by only ſhewing himſelf in the out-ſkirts of a town, or village, and calling out <hi>Begary! Begary!</hi> When whether <hi>Zemindars</hi> buſied in making or repairing their granaries, in grinding grain or ſugar canes, howing, harrowing or ploughing, or mechanics of any denomination whatever, weavers, maſons, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, ſmiths, taylors, and in ſhort, men of all the above deſcriptions, at the ſignal given for Begaries, muſt quit their reſpective occupations, however deeply engaged in them, and away with the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carars</hi> to draw the <hi>Toppee Wallas</hi> boats along, or if travelling by land, to carry their luggage, in as much that the loom, agriculture, mechanics with all its branches, muſt be thrown aſide till the Company is ſerved; and as a diſcovery of the leaſt repugnancy to obeying theſe unreaſonable orders of the folks belonging to theſe Toppe Wallas, be attended with ſmart <hi>Chaw Bucking</hi> (i. e. whipping) theſe ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated people knowing the conſequences of heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or being refractory, on the appearance of the above-mentioned emiſſaries, will flock round them with ſubmiſſion till they ſhall have aſſembled perhaps double the number wanted, when one half of thoſe there ſhould be no need of: on their bribing the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caras or Seapoys with two or three rupees, or more

Theſe Indoſtan hirelings under the Company valuing themſelves on the important offices they fill, imagine they ſhow their conſequence by treating the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants cheap, as verified, not only in this inſtance, but in others, will generally return their compliments with kicks and cuffs.—I ſhall now return to the thread of my narrative and continuing my account of my voyage up the river Hughly to Plaſſey.</p>
               <p>Our proximity to the ſhore in ſailing along, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me all the opportunity I could wiſh to ſurvey the country, its buildings, animal and vegetable produce; the images of which are lively in my mind, I think I ſee them now in the Budgero I then was in. Figure to yourſelf a large river, bounded by a flat ſandy beach, with a bank of tough earth and clay cut through with gutters running in an oblique di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the front, made by the deſcent of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters during the rains, at a diſtance ſufficient to admit two or three carriages driving abreaſt between it and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022380_0070_0FB859F19036F870"/>
the ſtream, and you will have a tolerable good idea of the ſide of the river. The country, which is in general level from Calcutta to Muxadabads, runs back in plains to a conſiderable diſtance till it meets the Burampore hills, and others that divide it from the ſouthern provinces and the Decan, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with little groves and lone trees here and there in the midſt of fields and verdant plains, gives it a rural and pleaſing proſpect. Theſe lands are of a rich ſoil, and favorable to the production of grain or vegetables, and the trees in general are as friendly in bearing variety of fruits.</p>
               <p>The groves I mentioned are of the utmoſt utility to the country and its inhabitants;—in them the Mahometans and <hi>Gentoos</hi> have their places of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Moſques and <hi>Pagodas,</hi> public Bagnios and wells, or reſervoirs of water. If a Moſque, and ſituate in one of theſe groves, a <hi>Fakir</hi> or a <hi>Peerza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> will have his abode there, and ſometimes ſix or ſeven others of the ſame denomination with him, conſtant reſidents, and perhaps proprietors by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance or by purchaſe; Mahometans and Gentoos both frequently buying of the <hi>Sircar</hi> diſtricts for an abode during life or pleaſure, in one of theſe ſhady, ſolitary or frequented ſpots. If the grove is occupied by a <hi>Gentoo Fakir,</hi> a Bramin or Byrahghy, it is as likely he may be accompanied by ſome of his ſect as not, but ſeldom or ever a Fakir, whether Gentoo or Mahometan, is without a man or a boy to keep his company and attend him. In theſe groves, let the proprietor be what ſect he will, an alter will be erected of mud, brick or ſtone, with a turret over the platform, and a pedeſtal for an alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran to lie on, if a Muſſulman; and if a Hendou, there will be in the place of an alcoran the figures of a Branim, Braminbull, Jaggernaut, or Kriſnou Swamey, hewed in ſtone or cut in wood. Theſe

Fakers making theſe places their conſtant home, have likewiſe at leaſt a little ſhade made of thatch, to keep of the dew whilſt ſleeping, and a kind of a cook-room to put their utenſils in, with a fire-place adjacent to dreſs their victuals at; which fire-place being nothing but three lumps of baked clay ſtuck on the ſurface of a little terras of the ſame material, roſe about two inches from the ground, that they ſmooth at the top by wetting their hands and then rubbing them over it 'till it is even, are made with little trouble; ſo that a traveller can be provided with victuals, be accommodated with a fire-place, with wood for fuel; which article can alſo be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as readily, it being ſcattered all over the country amongſt the buſhes and trees; fire is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be had at theſe Fakir's ſtands, as they never are without tinder, flints and matches.—Theſe groves ſerve likewiſe for the cattle to retreat to in the middle of the day, as well as all kinds of repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitories for travellers: in the neighbourhood of large towns or villages, or in the vicinity of thick ſettled parts of the country, theſe groves, with which all Indoſtan is ſhaded, are the ſpots fixed upon for their moſt ſuperb Pagodas and Moſques, particularly the latter, in Bengal, where the Gentoo religion has from immemorial and centuries back, had ſuch innumerable adherents, and where Brumma being perhaps born, and his doctrine firſt originated, the diſcipline of it has ſince been ſo tenaciouſly obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which together with the number of rich, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Hindoos, who at the inſtances of the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins, and as munificent and liberal Rajahs, that during their lives and at their deaths bequeathed as many more for the ſame purpoſe; together with the innumerable donations from the various reſort of the Hindoo tribes, who from all parts of Indoſtan annually flock down to the Pagodas to pay their

devotions and compleat the different vows they have made to their reſpective divinities, by way of expiation for their ſins, may account principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for theſe temples being in greater number in Bengal than in any other part of Indoſtan.— The ſuperb appearance of which buildings, ſituated amidſt theſe verdant groves, excited my curioſity to take a cloſer view of them, (particularly a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble large one about half way between Syram Pore and Chandernegore). I quit my Budgero, and with my <hi>Banyan</hi> and <hi>Munſy,</hi> made a little incurſion from the place we landed at, ordering the boats to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed up to Hugly, and directed our ſteps towards this Indian temple, It ſtood in the middle of a large grove of mangoe trees, the fruit of which being ripe, and ſome of them preſented us by a Bramin, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on this building, we ate of them and I thought it delicious fruit. An avenue cut thro' this grove lead up to the front of the Pagoda, a very lofty pile, and of ſome conſiderable magnitude. It ſtood on an oblong platform of bricks, with a revetement of fine white <hi>Chunnan</hi> about ſix feet roſe from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of a large eſplanade pavement, compoſed of the ſame materials, that extended every way about forty yards from this platform. On the platform, which I take to have been thirty yards by ſixty, was erected the temple, conſiſting of one compleat ſquare, and a lofty hall in the midſt, included within four larger exterior apartments that had all arched entrances at right angles, with little columns at their gate-ways or entrances, whoſe pedeſtals were demi-urns cut through the conjugate diameter of their out-lines, and inverted, which met pine apples rector on the top, from the baſes of which ran diminiſhing regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upwards, fluted columns that met capitals correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding with whole pines above, with a corniſh that in the larger columns went round the building both
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:022380_0073_0FB859F74EE500E8"/>
within and without ſide theſe apartments, were niches in the walls, with ſeats large enough for to ſit down croſs-legged; and another ſtory above this were correſpondent apartments, much in the ſame ſtile, but with the addition of a gallery that went all round and was ornamented with balconies that projected conſiderably without the main body of the building. The ſecond ſtory was flat, and above it ran the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the <hi>Pagoda,</hi> in form of a pyramid, with a number of narrow niches and arched ſlips and peep holes in it; in which was hung, according to the cuſtom of all the large <hi>Pagoda's,</hi> a ſet of bells about the ſize of ting-tangs, that the <hi>Gentoos</hi> ring on feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivals. On the ſides and angles of this upper terras, were other leſs ſpires and turrets, with a bullaſtrade all round, and little balconies at convenient intervals, without which, ſupported by a double colonade of large pillars, whoſe pedeſtals met the out-line of the main oblong platform below, was carried round on a flat roof parade, covered with cement, about thirty feet in breadth and two hundred and forty feet in length, the two longeſt ſides which was ſcreened with a wall of ſix feet in height, divided into niches and arched windows, filled up with chequers, or brick work, like pidgeon holes, that let in the light, and anſwered the purpoſes of windows. Upon this wall, at equal diſtances, ſtood urns and pine apples, and both within and without, in every other nich, in has relief, were the figuers of men, ſome mounted on bulls, others on rams, and others on fiſhes, pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks and <hi>Braminy</hi> kites, with a variety of other extravagant repreſentations of men with enormous heads and large eyes, and a number of hands and arms projecting out from their bodies, with figures repreſenting demons, with horns to their heads and claws to their hands and feet, and wings to their bodies, with the uglieſt aſpects can be conceived, all

which were characters taken out of the <hi>Hindoo</hi>'s holy writ. The <hi>Vidam</hi> and <hi>Shaſtra</hi> which matters were learnedly expatiated on by my <hi>Banyan</hi> and a <hi>Bramin</hi> belonging to the <hi>Pagoda,</hi> that accompanied me as a virtuoſo and antiquarian, to explain the inſcriptions that were written under many pieces of ſtatuary, and tell me in brief, the names and hiſtories of the various idols with which the walls of this Indian temple were inveſted; that he did indeed extremely to my ſatisfaction. From this gallery I had a nearer view of the upper part of the Pagoda, that diminiſhed by degrees into a point, in about the proportion of the pictures of the pyramids of Egypt. On the top of which pyramid was a large gilt copper flat-rim form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a circle of about four feet diameter, traverſed croſs wiſe with two other flat pieces of gilt copper, the ſame dimenſions of the outward rim, which was fixed with its plain perpendicular to that of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon (facing the eaſt) on an iron rod, meaſuring ten feet from a gilded ball it paſſed through. On the upper part of this circle was a figure, reſembling a trident, with this difference, that it had five prongs on which were inſcribed five black letters, in the character of the <hi>Shaſtrah,</hi> which were the initials of five myſterious cabaliſtical names, viz. <hi>Shey Ou Dee Ou Dee,</hi> the ſenſe of which is only known to the <hi>Bramins;</hi> and every cupola, dome or ſpire, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the building, had theſe prongs on their tops, or the holy leaf of the <hi>Peepal</hi> tree—a tree held in ſuch veneration amongſt the <hi>Hindoos</hi> that they never wound its body or preſume to pluck a leaf from its boughs; only daring to take them up when they fall, or are blown down by the wind: and as a greater argument of the important lights it is conſidered in by theſe people, a <hi>Gentoo</hi> to ſwear by this leaf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the oath he takes be adminiſtered to him by a <hi>Bramin</hi> in a court of judicature, or on a leſs public

               </p>
               <p>The large pillars that went round the building were much in the ſame ſtile as thoſe ſmall ones I have already deſcribed, forming lofty and ſpacious Varandos on all ſides of the Pagoda. In the four ſides of the building were four porticoes, ſupported by eight pillars on each ſide, projecting out from the range of their reſpective calonades, ſquare with the flights of ſteps that lead up to the platform on which the main body of the building ſtood with balconies and cupaloes over them.</p>
               <p>In the centre of the middle chapel there was erected an altar, on which ſtood the figure of a bull ſitting, with four ſmall bull calves at the corners, in butting poſitions: the <hi>Gentoos</hi> worſhiping theſe idols, it is cuſtomary for them to accompany their adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with offerings of <hi>Ghee,</hi> milk, honey, cream, ſugar, ſweet-meats and money, which offerings being brought from all parts adjacent to the <hi>Pagodas,</hi> by the inhabitants, a conſiderable quantity of donations daily are accumulated, which monies and vegetable food theſe inanimate bulls and calves having no need of, fall to the lot of more rational creatures, viz. <hi>Bramins,</hi> who frequent, and in a manner reſide in theſe places of worſhip, a part of which will be beſtowed by them on the <hi>Byraghees</hi> that occaſionly viſit theſe temples, and make them places of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary abode. Fronting the entrance of the middle chapel was a gygantic figure of <hi>Jagernaut,</hi> to whom the <hi>Pagoda</hi> is dedicated, and in niches in the other ſides of it, were, in a leſs proportion, the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the various births, lives, and tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Chriſnou Swamey,</hi> from his firſt being born of a woman, and then tranſmigrated into a hog, and from that into a fiſh, until his tranſlation to heaven according to the <hi>Shaſtrah.</hi>

Having ſufficiently ſatisfied my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in the examination of this temple, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by my Banyan and a few attendants, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in my <hi>Palanquin</hi> to Chandernagore, the head ſettlement belonging to the French, in Bengal, where I was received with politeneſs by monſ. Jean Babtiſt Chevalier, the then governor, and ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of his factory; and paſſed from thence to Chinchura, the firſt Dutch preſidency in Bengal, and met my Budgero and people at Hughly, a large town belonging to the Nabob, about four coſs to the northward of Chandernagore, where reſides a <hi>Fazdar.</hi>—This city is ſituated on the banks of the river it gives name to; it is very populous, but the ſtreets irregular, and the houſes in general in decay; but commanding a paſs, the Nabob, and Company, have their <hi>Choques</hi> there to examine the Duſtocks, and take duties,—the latter having erected a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery there to command reſpect, as it is one of the greateſt thorough-fares by land and water between Calcutta and Patna. All the <hi>Burrs</hi> laden with ſalt, tranſient Budgeroes, <hi>Dinghees</hi> and fleets of boats laden with goods, going up or coming down the river Hughly, being obliged to ſend off a Nabob's or Company's <hi>Duſtock,</hi> or hawl along ſide the gott, and be examined by the <hi>Choques,</hi> fixed there to collect the cuſtoms. It being about ſun ſet when I arrived there, I quit my <hi>Palanquin</hi> and went on board my <hi>Budgero,</hi> where I had not been long before a <hi>Chubdar</hi> from the <hi>Fazdar</hi> brought in his maſter's <hi>Sallam</hi> with a cuſtomary preſent, called in India <hi>Meerſmahny;</hi> conſiſting of goats, fowls, eggs, ghee, butter, ſugar, milk, fruit, ſweet-meats, and twenty rupees in caſh.

This cuſtom of ſending preſents to travellers of any credit, from the chief man of the town, on the firſt of their arrival, in proportion to the rank they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover they bear, is as ancient as laudable, as inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably obſerved throughout Indoſtan by both Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans and Gentoos, who daily ſend eatables to their reſpective places of worſhip in the towns or villages they belong to, for the ſupply of the various tribes of itinerant <hi>Fakirs,</hi> or pilgrims and fanatics, who traverſe the boundaries of this extenſive empire, viz. <hi>Hadgees, Hafuſts, Taveegewallas, Hackeems,</hi> amongſt the Muſſulmen, and amongſt the Hindoos, <hi>Bramins, Byraghees, Bambollahnautmen;</hi> either of which ſects, without infringing on the rigid precepts of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective religions, by which means, from the mouth of the great Ganges to the weſternmoſt limits of Indoſtan, a diſtance of fifteen hundred miles, and from Cape Comorin, the ſouthern promontory of this empire, to the foot of the mountains of Thibet, in length two thouſand miles, can the wearied tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller find a place to repoſe in, and ſuſtenance as well as the wealthy merchant, or <hi>Sardar,</hi> in this country, who though pagans and infidels, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant characteriſtics notwithſtanding, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled urbanity and hoſpitality.</p>

I repent I did not addreſs my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to but one perſon alone, inſtead of diſtributing them amongſt a number of my acquaintance; but that would have prevented my keeping my promiſe with them all. Should they ſwell out big enough to form a little volume—ſhould I live to return to the Weſtern Hemiſphere, perhaps I may publiſh them. In the interim they muſt remain in different hands as directed. I was relating the account of my paſſage from Calcutta to Hugly, by land and water, where I had arrived, and remained all night with a few <hi>Seapoys</hi> and attendants, in boats on a branch of a ſurvey I had ſet off to aſſiſt in.

rites over a pile, which was made of dry ſticks and pieces of <hi>Bamboo</hi> that was about five feet above the ground, in the conſtruction of which a kind of order ſeemed to have been aimed at, by their having laid the ſticks as nigh as they could in ſquares, and croſſed them with others in the diagonals; the lower part of which pile was limited by two long <hi>Bamboos</hi> and two ſhort ones, forming a long ſquare, and between this bottom and the top were parallel to thoſe at equal intervals, two ſets more of ſuch <hi>Bamboos</hi> placed in the like manner, and another correſpondent ſet of <hi>Bamboos</hi> above all, which were faſtened with lines leading acroſs the main body of the pile. On this was laid the corps extended, and an earthen pot, filled with water that having been mixed with the water of the holy <hi>Ganges,</hi> became by confluence and adoption both related to the ſacred ſtream. The widow and her children, with all the female relations, ſtood apart on the left ſide of the hill, and the male relations oppoſite to them on the right ſide: a <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> then pulled off his <hi>Lungah,</hi> as did the eldeſt ſon of the deceaſed, (a boy about 11 years of age) when both he and the <hi>Bramin,</hi> after pouring the water out of their <hi>Loutahs</hi> over their heads and bodies, and making libations by pouring water likewiſe into the river, and ſome into the palms of their hands, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in a low key, with great precipitation at the ſame time, a number of words, and at intervals hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands towards the ſun, and locking the backs of their hands together by interlinking their fingers and thumbs in the manner baſkets are begun at the making of their handles, and forming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a variety of circumplications, which part of the ceremony over, the <hi>Bramin,</hi> with an air of true ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, addreſſing himſelf to Bogwan, i. e. the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God, with his eyes and hands directed towards heaven, expatiated in truly philoſophic terms, on the

               <p>YOUR curioſity has been excited at my relating to you the manner the Spaniards fight the bulls at Barcelona, Valentia, Malaga, and other parts in Spain; I will now give you an account of a fight I was witneſs to laſt week, of elephants, rhinoceroſes, tygers, and wild buffaloes. The <hi>Nabob</hi> was viſited by a brother of the <hi>Nizam,</hi> and ſome other men of diſtinction from the Decan, at the ſame time, and meaning to compliment them with an elephant fight, amongſt other diverſions he gave orders to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and preparations were made accordingly.

The combat was to begin at eight o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at which time the <hi>Soubah,</hi> magnificiently dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, appeared with his company, and <hi>Aumeers</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, in the balcony deſcribed; when the <hi>nobut</hi> that had been playing ceaſed, and a diſcharge of artillery was made, it being the concerted ſignal for the fighting elephants to begin the combat; a female elephant, by her driver, was then puſhed on to the middle of the plain, when two large elephants from oppoſite ſides of the ſquare, made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:022380_0084_0FB85A10D0FADCE0"/>
theſe elephants had, previous to this recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, been painted, after firſt being well waſhed and ſcrubbed with pumice ſtone in the river, whilſt lying on their ſides; which operation theſe creatures (fond of wallowing in water) conform to with alacrity and pleaſure; after which being expoſed to the ſun, their ſkins drying and growing hot, they rubbed them with linſeed-oil, which the heat of their bodies ſoon abſorbing, they painted them from head to foot with a ſhining jet black, that as ſoon as laid on dried up, and was ſo fixed a colour that though rubbed hard with clothes afterwards left ſcarcely a ſtain thereon. I was witneſs to this ſcrubbing and painting match, and took notice of the proceſs. This ground work laid on the whole ſuperficies of the creatures, two painters with their pencils, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning juſt below the upper part of their heads, completed conſpicuous ornamental circumferences about thoſe parts, reſembling laurel, muric, or civic crowns. Circles of different colours were likewiſe drawn round their eyes, with well defined edges, and large broad ſtreaks of vermillion drawn from thence down to the extremeties of their trunks, and the inſides of their ears painted with the ſame colour, which added conſiderably to the fierceneſs of their aſpects. Their heads and bodies thus painted, ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let cloth or crimſon velvet coverings, fringed and embroidered with gold, were thrown over their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſecured from falling off by girths faſtened under their bellies. Each elephant had a bell about the ſize of a half gallon pot, ſuſpended to a broad leather collar, right under his neck, with round bells of different ſizes fixed at convenient diſtances from the large bell, towards the upper part of his head, on the ſame collar: theſe bells are both of ornament and uſe, for chiming when the elephants enter a <hi>buzar</hi> or a town, they give warning of their

approach, and give people time to take their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren out of their way, and to avoid them themſelves if they think proper, as notwithſtanding their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſagacity and docility, amidſt multitudes of people tricks being plaid them, the creatures at times reſent the affronts, and kill or maim the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The elephants thus painted and decorated, the drivers preſented themſelves to them, in order to mount, when the beaſts knowing their duty, gently extending their trunks downwards in a curve, with a ſtriking dexterity clapping them under the hams of theſe their drivers, gave them each a ſucceſsful cant on to the back of their heads; when they fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to their conveniencies, by ſtriding over the necks of the elephants, when their legs and thighs were ſcreen'd by the elephants ears, as large at leaſt as ſmall round tea-tables. Theſe drivers were both ſtout perſonable men, well dreſſed and armed in the ſtile of the country, with additional weapons in their hands called <hi>punjahs,</hi> about the length of ſhips boat-hooks, and pointed ſharp enough to wound their elephants on the top of their heads, which purpoſes alone they apply them to when they prove diſobedient or refactory, and to menace them with occaſionally on the march.</p>
               <p>The drivers thus mounted, with their <hi>punjahs</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifted, and their right hands to their left ſides, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bows, in an oſtentatious manner as they paſſed their elephants on and urg'd them to the charge, who prepared for the fight, in an inſtant faced each other, and irritated with the ſpirits they had given them before they had left their ſtands, and jealous of each others approaches to the female ſhewn to them on the ground, the riders with both hands ſeizing the iron <hi>punjahs</hi> and driving them into the fleſh on the top of the creatures heads, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

their blows, while at every ſtroke the blood ſpouted out and trickled down their cheeks, which added to their fury, they ruſhed on towards each other with the moſt violent impetus, their drivers in approaching, before the attack, reciprocally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting, by lifting their right hands up to their heads and calling out in Arabic <hi>aſſallam allycam! allycum ſallam!</hi>

               <p>THE ſpectators more uſed to theſe ſights than myſelf, formed, I diſcovered earneſt and different ideas of the determination of the battle, and laid wagers accordingly: two parties ſubſiſted, one in favour of the Aurangabad elephant, and one in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Gorackpore elephant; two places whoſe vicinities are famous for good elephants. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rackpore elephant was a ſize ſmaller than the other, but ſeemed poſſeſſed with more activity though leſs craft, and the expectations of the crowd were raiſed to a conſiderable pitch when the attack began, in the manner following:</p>
               <p>The larger elephant being on the level of the plain, while the ſmaller one was on the declevity of an hillock, the big elephant ran one of his fangs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mouth, that in the puſh paſſed through the fleſhy part of his cheek under the ear, and hooking him at the ſame time with the other tuſk under one of his hams, got himſelf ſo entangled that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his repeated endeavours to overſet him, he failed in his attempt; when the other elephant tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advantage of a ſtumble his opponent made with one of his fore feet (that buried itſelf up to the middle of the leg in a ſand hole) expeditiouſly ran him through the gullet with one of his tuſks, and ſet him in a gore of blood. All this while their trunks, like two ropes, were twiſted in one, and thus entangled together they ſeeſawed backwards and forward for the ſpace of about five minutes, beweltered in blood, and their eyes ſwelled with the diſtention of their trunks, and the agony it put them in, to ſuch a degree they appeared as though they would burſt in their heads; while their ſtrength and ſpirits waſted with fatigue, the pain of their wounds
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:022380_0088_0FB85A17C9C553D8"/>
and the great loſs of blood they had ſuſtained, they ſtood ſtock ſtill for perhaps another five minutes, panting and puffing, and blowing ſo loud that the ſound of their reſpiration was diſtinguiſhable amidſt even the din and clamour of the ſurrounding popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; notwithſtanding which enfeebled ſtate, they vigorouſly maintained their hold, in order, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, to recruit their wind and ſpirits, that they might be the better enabled to begin the combat anew; while at intervals the drivers calling out to their elephants aloud by their reſpective names, to hold out to the laſt, and never yield while there was breath in their body, for the honor of their illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maſter the <hi>Souhah,</hi> and his ſubjects the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, both drivers, laterly with their <hi>punjahs</hi> prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heads of their reſpective elephants (already like honeycomb with the holes that had been made in them in the courſe of the action by theſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons) both unable to bear the repeated ſtabs of the <hi>punjahs,</hi> and the excrutiating pain they indured by this rude circumplication of each others trunks, after making two-moſt hedious roars, with obvious repugnance let go each others trunks, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with as great a reluctance withdrew their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable fangs from the bloody inciſſions they had made in each others bodies (hitching back at the ſame time, and watching each others motions with unremitted attention) when the rider of the ſmaller elephant urging his beaſt to the charge again, they both by this time being reinforced with wind and ſpirits, he advanced with tolerable celerity towards his antagoniſt, who inſtead of facing him, turned from him and ran as hard as he could drive towards that part of the plain that was barrier'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the people above mentioned, and getting amongſt the thick of them before they could get out of his way, both men and horſes he ſcooped up

with his tuſks and toſſed over his head with the ſame facility a cat would as many mice, until the elephant in purſuit of him having come up with him, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned round to face him, and a freſh combat enſued, when (as theſe animals are very apt to do on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting) they receded back ſome few fathoms, in order to join with the greater force on renewing the attack, then puſhing on towards each other with ſeeming greater violence than ever, the ſmaller ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant with his trunk circumflected round a tooth, the better to ſecure it perhaps from danger, which gave him an arch look and made him appear the more formidable, with remarkable activity on meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his antagoniſt, after giving a loud roar, run his other tooth down the throat of his enemy with ſuch ſucceſs that its point came out below the ſhoulder blade, brought him to the ground, and killed him dead on the ſpot; when the other elephant was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by horſemen, who felicitating his driver on the conqueſt, conducted him to the front of the balcony where the <hi>Soubah</hi> and his nobles were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when both the victorious elephant and his dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſaluted the <hi>Nabob</hi> in form, attended by this eſcort and a <hi>Chubdar</hi> on horſeback in the front, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his <hi>ſallam</hi> and the creatures, they both paying their compliments at the ſame time, the <hi>Fazdar</hi>

               <p>Any injuries done to individuals by the elephant on the day of the fight, the Soubah ordered ample reſtitution to be made, and ſaw it done himſelf, by having called into his preſence the relations of thoſe people who had been killed or maimed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict;

when the evening was appointed for a main of cocks to be fought, and little <hi>lolls,</hi> and a battle of antelopes and fighting rams,—while which orders were going forward ſeveral other diverſions were carried on, on the plain; boys, Gentoos and Moors, all richly armed and dreſſed, mounted on Arabian and Perſian ſteeds, with bows and arrows ſlung over their ſhoulders, without any thing on their horſes but cloths and ſilk nets fringed with gold or ſilver, circling round the plain in different parties, made ſham attacks on each other, ſometimes with javelins, at others with ſcymitars, and at others with their battle-axes; whilſt ſome extending themſelves on their backs, with their heads on their horſes rumps, would draw their bows charged with arrows, and bring down with them hawks, kites, and vultures hovering above them in the air: when two elephants making their appearance, and ſhutterwans, viz. armed cameliers, and dividing themſelves into two diſtinct parties, ruſhed on towards each other with their drawn ſwords, which flouriſhing and claſhing together, after diſcharging a ſhower of arrows over each other's heads, diſperſed; when followed by the horſes, the elephants with their drivers on their necks, menacing them at times with their <hi>punjahs,</hi> and at others encouraging them with fair words, plunged into the river with the whole of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry; when the elephants diſporting themſelves in the ſtream, encompaſſed with the ſquadrons of horſe and ſhutterwans, ſhewed their remarkable craftineſs by filling their trunks with water they had ſucked up with them as they ſwam along, and ſpouting it out again at times, like grampuſes, up in the air, and wetting the adjacent horſemen with the ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it as it fell again; and at others, when nigh enough to do execution, blowing a quantity ſmartly in the faces of any two or three horſes and their

               <p>LADIES, I have been deſcribing to Mr. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the diverſions I was witneſs to yeſterday fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, which letters there is no doubt but you have ſeen and will impart to thoſe of your acquaintance, with whom I correſpond.</p>
               <p>The heat of the day coming on the <hi>Soubah</hi> retired within the walls of his palace, and the ſpectators withdrew to their reſpective homes, whoſe example I followed by going to my friend's at Moradbaugh, an Engliſh captain, commanding two battalions of Seapoys in this department. This gentleman had been ſome years in the country, ſpoke the Indoſtan language perfectly well, and was even a critic in it; and initiated along while into the ways of the natives, whether Gentoos or Mahometans; likewiſe of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirical turn, and a young fellow of excellent wit and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:022380_0092_0FB85A1E58041240"/>
finiſhed education, proved an agreeable companion, and was, during my ſtay at Muxadabads of great ſervice to me, in his informations reſpecting the country.</p>
               <p>In the cool of the evening we returned to the place of action, in a few minutes after which the Nabob, with his viſiters and aumeers, appeared again in the ſame balcony they did in the morning, on which a rhinoceros, and an elephant prepared for battle, were brought forth, who on the ſight of each other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly approaching, begun with the utmoſt fury to engage. The elephant, at the firſt onſet, overſetting the rhinoceros in ſcringing back to get ſufficient play for his teeth, which were at leaſt between eight and nine feet long, he being a very large elephant, and upwards of ten feet in height, and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſtrong and robuſt, and in appearance double the magnitude of his foe, but failing in his attempt by only helping the unweildly animal up by lifting him bodily with his teeth, that he ran compleatly under him, inſtead of through his vitals as he intended; the recovered brute, with all his might, ruſhing his head under the elephant's belly, in order to rip it open with the horn that projected out from his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head (which is always the rhinoceros's play when engaging his common enemy the elephant) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued poking at his antogoniſt's guts, having got at laſt both his head and ſhoulders between the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant's hind legs, which being out of the reach of the elephant's teeth, giving him pain without his being able to diſengage himſelf.</p>
               <p>Provoked with his ſituation, he gave three ſudden ſucceſſive roars, followed by a violent jerk of his whole body backwards, which bringing the rhinoceros in front, with an incredible rapid puſh of one of his teeth, he maimed him to ſuch a degree, that unable to continue longer the fight, he turned tail and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:022380_0093_0FB85A1FE5F456D0"/>
marched off, and left him maſter of the field, amidſt the ſhouts and acclamations of the crowd; when he was conducted by an eſcort in the ſame manner the conquering elephant had been in the forenoon to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the Soubah his ſovereign lord and maſter. The rhinoceros I have been treating of, though deſcribed in the encyclopedia, and by writers of natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, as an animal not ſo generally known as many others of a leſs note, I will, before I proceed in my account of the diverſions I have promiſed in my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſay ſomething about this creature. The head of a rhinoceros has reſemblance to both a camel's and a boar's, and ſo thick the bone of his ſcull that it will repel a muſket ball, or the blow of an ax; but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to his body, which with his legs and thighs reſemble much an elephant's: upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head grows a horn, turning inwards towards his ears, to which his forehead is a baſe, this horn being about ſix inches in diameter below that part of it that coheres to his face, and ſeven inches in length, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating gradually from the baſe to a point; which horn though not very large is very ſolid and ſtubborn and is the only weapon he has to truſt to for offence or defence, except his hide, which is a compleat coat of mail, nature having provided this animal with, above all others known in the creation, the moſt redoubtable barriers againſt the miſſive weapons of men, or the formidable talons and voracious jaws of other beaſts, an hard knobby cruſt of ramifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and thick impenetrable ſcales covering the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfices of his hide, excepting his belly and lower parts, that, though retained within a ſkin of an inch thick, and of a more glutinous and elaſtic nature than that of even a buffaloe's, lies expoſed to the wound of ſhot and pointed weapons. His food is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, and when kept up a while, he will grow do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile and pacific; and his horn is ſaid to be ſo certain
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:022380_0094_0FB85A21507C8CF0"/>
an antidote, that liquor even drank out of it, though mixed with poiſon, will have no fatal effects.</p>
               <p>After this engagement, I obſerved the multitude ſuddenly broke the line they had formed on the ſouth ſide of the plain, and were contending who ſhould gain the banks of the river firſt, till by degrees thouſands of ſpectators aſſembled on both ſides. The ladies of the ſeraglio had been taking a party of pleaſure on the water, and were then returning in their <hi>Bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geroes.</hi> A fleet of theſe Budgeroes, or Indian barges with about three hundred boats of different ſizes and conſtruction, appeared on the river winding into that branch of it that ran between Muxadabads and the oppoſite ſhore, that I amongſt the reſt of theſe ſpectators ſtood on. Theſe boats formed a three diſtinct diviſions, viz.—front, centre and rear. In the centre of each diviſion was a large <hi>Budgero,</hi> commanding the reſt, and in the centre of the middle diviſion, ſeven of greater magnitude, the middle of which was at leaſt as big again as the <hi>Budgeroes</hi> in general amongſt the whole. The leſſer boats were painted <hi>Dinghees</hi> and <hi>Moor Punkies</hi> with little <hi>Kiſties</hi> attending them, and rowing a-head at times, and then dropping a-ſtern, according to the ſignals given from the reſt of the fleet, which ſignals were made by the firing of ſmall braſs cannon from the large <hi>Budgeroes,</hi> and waving particular flags, and from the <hi>Dinghees</hi> and <hi>Moor Punkies</hi> by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging ſeveral guns or large <hi>Burghundaſſes.</hi> In this order divided, they advanced down the river, but the current running againſt them, which was pretty ſtrong, the progreſs they made was but ſlow, whilſt the wind, being contrary, likewiſe which prevented their carrying ſails; it gave good opportunity for examining the form of the boats, the dreſs of the people that managed them, and their mode of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting them. The <hi>Budgeroes</hi> were all painted and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:022380_0095_0FB85A23760C3A38"/>
gilded, and decorated with carved work heads and ſterns, with elegant varandos to them, ſcreened by ſilk and ſattin, venetian blinds, and windows of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered glaſs to the apartments of the <hi>Budgeroes,</hi> that the ladies within ſide might ſee without being ſeen. The tops of the <hi>Budgeroes</hi> were all covered with ſcarlet broad cloth, and fringed with gold, and waiſt cloths and quarter cloths of the ſame. The oars were painted red, and the <hi>Manjies</hi> and <hi>Dandies</hi> were all dreſſed in ſcarlet cloth coats with narrow ſleeves, and long trowſers of the ſame, but different coloured, ſaſhes and turbans, with gold borders and fringes to them, which variety and contraſt in theſe parts of their dreſs had the more pleaſing effect. In this manner were the crews of the <hi>Budgeroes, Dinghies</hi> and <hi>Kiſties</hi> dreſſed, throughout every ſquadron, but the <hi>Manjies</hi> and <hi>Dandies</hi> of the <hi>Moor Punkies,</hi> wore a different garb, and additional ornaments, having all ſcarlet <hi>Jammers</hi> of ſtout linen, and turbans and ſaſhes of the ſame, whoſe extraordinary buſineſſes were to beat time to bands of muſic theſe boats were all furniſhed with.—They had appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages to their dreſs to anſwer that purpoſe, having bells faſtened by bandages round their arms and wriſts, likewiſe acroſs their bodies and round their waiſts, hanging bells in the form of thoſe that are in ſteeples, and others caſt like thoſe that are hung round the necks of ſlay horſes in America, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers horſes in Europe. The bandages theſe bells were tacked to were from two to three inches wide, and had tufts of black ſilk ſewed to them, with thick bunches of black horſe hair fixed in ſilver ſockets to their wriſts and elbows, and each <hi>Manjy</hi> and <hi>Dandy,</hi> an ornament of the ſame kind hanging to the back part of his turban.</p>
               <p>The largeſt of the <hi>Budgeroes</hi> that was in the centre of the fleet was called the Sultana, on board of which

was the <hi>Beagum</hi> or queen, and the others were named in general after ladies in the ſeraglio;—ſhe had twenty-four <hi>Dandies</hi> on a ſide to row her along, making forty-eight in all, with a fore-caſtle that was about twelve feet in length, and a cabbin or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations abaft, that reached from the after oar to the ſtem, at leaſt thirty feet, making the Budgero in all about ninety feet long; on her poop or top of the cabbin were ſeated guards of <hi>Seapoys, Peuns,</hi> and <hi>Harkarars,</hi> all handſomely dreſſed, and officers of truſt, with a number of female Arabs, (women in the capacity of menial ſervants) were ſeen going in and out of the Varando of the <hi>Budgero;</hi> likewiſe eunuchs, young and old, ſuperbly dreſſed and armed, a large band of muſic was on the fore-caſtle, and a quantity of muſicians, more or leſs in every boat, and <hi>Moor Punky</hi> in the fleet. The colours that were flying on board the Sultana, were a large ſcarlet ſilk enſign faſtened to the toping-lift of the main-boom, (as ſhe was rigged ſloop faſhion) and in form of the ſection of a cone, ſnipt at the vertical point, that formed two ends, with a pair of black ſheers in the centre: with a large long pendant, that extended by the breeze of wind that was ſtiff, ran beyond the taffel of the Budgero that was in a right line with the Sultana a ſtern, with ſmaller pendants faſtened to the ſame flag-ſtaff, in the ſhape of ſwallows tails, and a large flag on a ſtaff, fixed on the bowſprit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeveral enſigns of different colours. Men and boys carried others, faſtened to painted and gilded ſtaffs. The other <hi>Budgeroes</hi> of the fleet were all in the ſame ſtyle that the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s was. The <hi>Dinghies</hi> were open boats painted, and their heads, ſterns and waiſts, covered with cloths of different colours, and filled with people differently dreſſed; theſe boats belonging to individuals amongſt the inhabitants who had accompanied this fleet in order to take

their pleaſure had joined in with this fleet, but each boat had at leaſt a muſician on board, and ſome two or three, and ſome a whole band; the boats being near two hundred in all, formed at leaſt two-thirds of the fleet. The <hi>Moor Punkies,</hi> of which there might be fifty of different ſizes, were ſome five or ſix of them 70 feet in length, made like petiauguas, but with high poops and little top-gallant decks or fore-caſtles and prows, ſome of them carrying thirty or forty <hi>Dandies.</hi> Theſe petiauguas or <hi>Punkies</hi> were rowed with paddles (not oars) which were neatly made, about five feet ſix inches long, with blades to them about eight inches wide, and made upon the whole exactly like a ſpatula. The <hi>Kiſties</hi> were a number of ſmall ſkiffs in the form of whale boats, that paſſed to and fro the fleet, and did the buſineſs of tenders for them, and were painted and ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like the reſt, on the occaſion.</p>
               <p>The fleet thus in three diviſions having gained the front of the palace, all hauled into the ſhore, where a large elephant with a ſilver turret on his back, with columns of ſolid gold and incruſtations of diamonds, made his appearance, with <hi>Pelanquins, Doolies,</hi> and <hi>Hackerries,</hi> on the water ſide, to convey the ladies of the ſeraglio, to their reſpective apartments, when, the ſun going down, orders being given for a ſalute, a diſcharge of artillery was made from the walls of the Killah; platoons were fired by the Seapoys drawn up along ſhore, and a general diſcharge of all the guns of the <hi>Burgundoſſes</hi> and <hi>Muſketoons</hi> of the <hi>Shutterwans;</hi> which being anſwered by the guns on the oppoſite ſide at Moradbaugh, made what might with great propriety be called, a <hi>feu de joye,</hi> which ceaſing when the ſun-ſet, the ladies, covered with ſcarlet cloths, were huddled into their equipages, and conveyed through different avenues into the palace, when the multitude quitting this ſcene of diſſipation

               <p>THE day thus ended, I returned with my friend to his place of reſidence, as uſual, and after refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves (which indeed we were in want of) a <hi>Chubdar</hi> coming in with the compliments of the <hi>Soubah</hi> to this captain, inviting him to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the evening; and underſtanding by him that there were to be illuminations and fire-works, (beſides a grand <hi>Notch</hi>) that were to be exhibited before the public, my friend declining the viſit, and returning his compliments to the <hi>Nabob,</hi> accompanied by my <hi>Banyan</hi> and <hi>Munſey,</hi> and a few neceſſary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, I returned with this <hi>Chubdar,</hi> and croſſing the river, with my ſervants cloſe to me, through the means of the <hi>Nabob's Chubdar,</hi> got a very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſeat in the front of a balcony that commanded a proſpect of the ſquare the principal diverſions were to be exhibited in, and faced exactly a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Varando the <hi>Nabob</hi> and his company were to be ſeated in, with a <hi>Muſnud</hi> erected for the <hi>Soubah;</hi>

a difference being paid me on account of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I appeared in, of an Engliſh gentleman, which put me upon a footing with a <hi>Soubah</hi> or <hi>Rajah,</hi> and above any other Mahometan or Gentoo in the realm. The whole palace was illuminated within ſide and without with gilded and painted candles and lamps, that were placed ſo thick that the windows, niches, and arches of the building, were in a manner cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them; beſides a number of glaſs and iſinglaſs lanthorns, of various colours and ſizes, and of as many different forms; ſome repreſenting Pagodas, and others barges, ſuſpending in the air, with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and lamps burning; both without ſide and within a number of trophies, enſigns and pendants, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered cloths and velvets were ſpread at intervals over the balluſtrades; and in the front of the balco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of all the different galleries, up to the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the building, which was lined with ſpectators. On one ſide of this ſquare were ſix or ſeven elephants, richly adorned, with magnificent turrets on their backs, and the ſons of Omrah's and Aumeer's ſitting on them: a guard of <hi>Seapoys</hi> were on each ſide of the gate-way, with braſs cannon pointed acroſs the paſſage, and the intervals of the colonnade that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the lower gallery, crowded with ſpectators of all ages and deſcriptions; whilſt below in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the court, which to me appeared to be one hundred yards ſquare every way, was an amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, whoſe top ran up to the ſummit of the palace, by means of ſcaffolding that was erected for that purpoſe; the walls of which were emboſſed with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious circular, aſteric and gibbons figures of ſulphur, camphire, and other pyrotechanic compoſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intended for an exhibition of fire works, had a ſtage or platform within ſide, level with the middle ſtory of the palace court; and was ſtout enough to bear a number of people on, with a gallery run round

it within ſide and without. This platform which might be twenty yards ſquare, was plained ſmooth and fixed on for the ſpot on which the game cocks and <hi>Lolls</hi> were to fight their battles, while the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals between this amphitheatre, below on each ſide on the pavement, were deſtined for the battles to be fought between the fighting rams and fighting antelopes.</p>
               <p>Theſe princely matters all in readineſs, the <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah</hi>'s arrival was announced aloud by the <hi>Chubdars</hi> and eunuchs, who advancing in the front of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando, accompanied by his <hi>Omrahs</hi> and <hi>Aumeers,</hi> ſeated himſelf on the <hi>Muſnud,</hi> and received the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments of the ſpectators in general, and returned the ſame by putting his hand to his head, when the <hi>Peerzadas</hi> calling out, <hi>Dowlat Zadah Bahadar Gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeo!</hi> that is, Long live and proſper! The words were repeated by the throng in ſuch loud peals the palace trembled with the ſound, which compliments paſſed the amphitheatre, which was illuminated, and a number of cocks brought in, by men in ſhort jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, to fight a general battle as propoſed; they all belonged to different owners on the ſpot, and being, if not different breeds, were of different coops and ſtands, and as ſtrangers to each other, wherever they ſhould meet would fight; which cocks being let looſe on the platform, at a ſignal given, began with great fury to engage.</p>
               <p>Theſe creatures varying in their ſhape conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from European or American fowls of the ſame ſpecies, being of a ſmaller breed and reſembling fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons in their heads and formation of their bodies and limbs, diſplayed as obvious a difference in their ſtrength and ſpirits, both of which they poſſeſs to ſuch a ſuperior degree, that without gaffs or ſteel weapons (the game cocks are armed with amongſt Europeans) they will ſtrike ſuch deciſive blows, that
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:022380_0101_0FB85A2EE13A8FB0"/>
in but a ſhort conteſt, a combatant will be ſtruck dead by a blow through his head, the back bone or rump, or ſome vital part, or knocked down and laid ſtruggling at his adverſary's feet, when the vindictive conqueror, not ſatisfied with his conqueſt, or the mere death of his enemy, will ſeize with his talons, the dead or wounded fowl, and by digging them into the fleſh, with the moſt pointed exertions of his whole body and limbs, with his bill and claws together, peck the eyes out of his head, tear a hole in the carcaſs, and pluck out the entrails and heart, and finally, lay it open to the back bone; and exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his conqueſt, beſprinkled over with blood, and though wounded himſelf and pricked to the quick, in a majeſtic poſture treading on the mangled car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs with his feet, will clap his wings and crow, and proclaim his victory aloud, then walk with as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing and imperious an air over others in the ſame condition, towards cocks of an oppoſite party, until he meets with one to take up his challenge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins a new fight. From this intimation you form ſome idea of the battle that was fought by the cocks brought upon the ſtage of the amphitheatre before the Nabob, when I add that amongſt twelve ſets let looſe upon each other, making about ſixty game cocks in all, who peremptorily engaged and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling each other out by pairs, fought amidſt a cloud of feathers and ſtreams of blood, 'till only eleven were left ſtanding erect on the place of action, peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the mutilated carcaſes of the fowls they had vanquiſhed; ſome of them during the conflict, at times ſpringing up by pairs, to the height of, ſome four, others five, and others ſix feet, before they met each other's heels, or exchanged with their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons their formidable blows; whilſt others in pairs would fall down dead with their talons in each other's ſkulls, or ſome as ſenſitive apart amongſt expiring
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:022380_0102_0FB85A30D743F2A8"/>
cocks gaſping for life, and defending themſelves to the laſt, on their ſides or backs: which ſcene was not a little heightened in its ſanguinary appearance, by the contraſt of ſome milk white cocks amongſt them painted crimſon with the blood of their own wounds, and the gore of other bleeding warriors they were fluttering among and trampling over, which, added to the repeated clapping of wings, and reciprocal crowings of the inveterate incorrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures, made it upon the whole as intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtriking a conteſt of animals as I think I ever beheld. Theſe combatants all killed or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, excepting the eleven remaining upon their legs in the field, were taken up by their keepers, chucked under the gills, and commended both by them and the ſpectators, for their behavior; and on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried off the ſtage, proclaimed unanimouſly <hi>Borrah Bahadars,</hi> by the ſpectators.</p>
               <p>This ſcene of action over, the killed and wounded were carried off and thrown to leopards to devour, and the ſtage cleared and covered with <hi>Setringees</hi>

               <p>THIS battle over, the antelopes, about twenty in number, and as many rams, were brought in upon the pavement below, tied by the horns with ſilk cords, and held in hand by their keepers until the propoſed ſignal was given for engaging, when they were let looſe at the four angles of the ſquare, and the rams diſpoſed of in the ſame manner at the ſides; the keepers of the latter having plentifully rubbed their noſes with garlic preparatory to the ſight, which they pretend ſharpens the ſenſations and has a cephalic effect, and likewiſe making them

ſnort and ſneeze, irritates them the more, and fits them the better for action; and thus both parties at liberty, they ruſhed on towards each other with great celerity, the antelopes approaching erecting themſelves on their hind legs that their heads might meet with greater force, while the rams, poſſeſſed of more ſtrength but leſs activity, rencontred in a more quadruped-like manner, receiving the blows of each other's heads in a more horizontal directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſtunning them in general at the inſtant of the point of contact, they remained twiſting each other's heads about with their horns interlocked until the dizzineſs wearing off, the keepers forced them aſunder, and hauling them back to their former diſtances, after a freſh application of garlic, let them return to the charge, when meeting as before with the ſhock of the formidable blows they repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly exchanged, made the colonnades and galleries of the whole building rebound, in which manner the engagement was continued (the antelopes with the antelopes, and rams with the rams) for about half an hour, during which time the rams and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopes both were ſo bruiſed about their heads and faces that their eyes were cloſed up in general, and their mouths and noſes battered and ſwoln to ſuch a degree, that but one mutilated gibbous lump re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, the original out-lines of their faces were totally deſtroyed, and not the leaſt degree of excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity diſcernable on them; in which condition the conquering rams and antelopes, with their keepers, had their <hi>Sallam</hi> announced by the <hi>Chubdar</hi> to the <hi>Soubah,</hi> who, returning their compliments, they retired with their parties.</p>

               <p>IN my letter, No. 6, in treating of the dancing girls, I declined, including in a deſcription of them, the women in general of the country, from a defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I wiſhed to ſhew women of other ſtamp, on the one hand, and from my want of a ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Indoſtan females in general on the other, ſince the writing of which letter my experience in the country has enabled me to form a tolerable good idea of the temper, character and manners of it's inhabitants, and particularly of the females, oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities that have been afforded me and very lately of becoming acquainted with the domeſtic oeconomy of women of the firſt ſtamp, having ſupplied me with materials enough, not only to fill up a letter, but a little volume on the occaſion, I ſhall venture upon a general deſcription, however conciſe, of their perſons, morals and manners. The Indoſtan women, whether Gentoos or Mahomedans, are allowed by all travellers, to be remarkable for animated and beautiful countenances, proportionable bodies and
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:022380_0117_0FB85A541311F928"/>
limbs, and a delicacy of behaviour, which charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic may be ſaid to be general, for though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from parents of different tribes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, which a long intercourſe with foreign nations and between the Mahomedans and Gentoos that did not ſubſiſt in any conſiderable degree until the total ſubverſion of the Hindoo authority and their ſubordination to the Mogul's took place, may account for, that has notwithſtanding produced an obvious difference in their complexions, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the colour of their progenitors, a ſimilarity of looks, gait and actions, and even formation of body and limbs; ſubſiſts to the ultimate degree.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to their perſons, the unwearied at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention they pay to them, and indefatigable pains that are taken by them to keep them clean (parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly among women of rank) is ſo unparalleled that, in the eyes of any other nation than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or people who had reſided amongſt them, however expedient the mode, and indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it would appear as ridiculous as uſeleſs, an appropriation of time, and as undeniable a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of it, notwithſtanding not only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of their religion, independent of the invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cuſtom of the country; their invincible deſire to render themſelves agreeable to their connections, whether feminine or maſculine, and if married, to pleaſe their partners to whom they are inviolably attached, and owe implicit obedience; their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with reſpect to latitude, and a combination of other mental and local conſiderations, as evident to themſelves as indiſtinguiſhable to others, in a cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate like the one alluded to, where the intenſe heat of the ſun that keeps both the rational and animal part of the creation in a ſtate of fumigation and perſpiration, which calls upon all the precautions prudence can dictate for the preſervation of health;

               <p>I propoſe confining my remarks for the preſent, to the deſcription of the manners of women of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, who, enemies to indolence, and brilliant in their nature, riſe with the ſun, make a ſhort prayer to heaven, and invoking Mahomet, call for their attendance, conſiſting of eunuchs, ſervant maids and women, with their ſhawls and veils thrown careleſly over their bodies, and a few coriander ſeeds mixed, with their <hi>beatle</hi> in their mouths, in an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſpirits that is always attendant on health and an unclouded mind, in a cluſter huddled up in this undreſs retire, to a bath in a garden, ſituate under an arborage or bower, within the walls of the <hi>Zunnannah;</hi> where, with their <hi>lungahs</hi> round their waiſts, and their veils over their ſhoulders, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat a ſecond prayer proſtrate on the ground, then riſe and plunge into the bagnio, taking care to ſtop their ears up with little plugs of cotton perfumed, and corns of pimento within ſide as preventatives againſt colds and the obſtruction of water, and uſe ſimilar precautions with their noſtrils, by pinching them cloſe between their fingers and thumbs before they dive, and keeping them confined in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner while immerged in the water, where, as a part of their education, taught from their infancy to ſwim, diſporting in the limpid plain, they will emulate with each other in feats of activity, waſhing and rubbing themſelves at the ſame time with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> that their attendants continually ſupply them

Theſe diverſions they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for the ſpace of a quarter of an hour: upon quitting the bath a ſcreen will be made of their <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gahs</hi> and veils, by hanging them on ſilk lines that always environ the ſides of their baths, and large callico cloths thrown over their bodies that cover them from head to foot; this done they ſeat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on wove mats, and with multan <hi>mittee</hi> and water, prime their whole bodies, and clot their hair likewiſe, (when they expoſe themſelves to the ſun, which dries it up inſtantaneouſly) after which their maids take balls of Indian meal and ſand and rub well their whole bodies with it, while others are employed in pouring water over them and waſhing away the dregs, 'till they have ſufficiently cleared them of the multan <hi>mittee,</hi> when the ladies inveſting themſelves anew in the order they had done at riſing, plunge themſelves again into the baths, and after a ſecond lavation return to their apartments, when another proceſs is begun.—The ladies then throw themſelves on their ſettees, and their ſervants pare their nails and file them, prick their ears and clean them, then comb out their hair, braid it and perfume it, and after that, hand them <hi>Munjun</hi> to rub and cleanſe their teeth and gums with, and two or three waters to waſh them withal, when almond powder is uſed as a ſubſtitute for ſoap, which to thoſe ladies would be as obnoxious as the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of odour, after which they perfume them with <hi>Ottah,</hi> by ſlightly rubbing their ſkins with it when

they inveſt them with their jewels and dreſs them in freſh attire; when after reading part of a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the alcoran, they join in a ſhort prayer, and withdraw into a ſaloon to breakfaſt, within an <hi>epin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jary</hi> or cage, being a light portable fabrick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of frames, like thoſe of a ſcreen, the top covered with tiſſue the inſide with coloured gauze, in order to prevent the intruſion of flies and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetoes, at meals,—ſo offenſive to Indoſtans, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the women, that a large fly to enter one of their apartments alone, or in company, would occaſion ſuch an hue and cry that a troop of domeſtics would aſſemble, and with forceps made on purpoſe for the entrapping theſe voltigent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders (conſtructed after the manner of drum battle-doors, but of a larger circumference, and covered with gauze) chace and catch the buzzing maroder, and confined in that manner, have him conveyed beyond the confines of their <hi>Zunnannahs</hi> before they will venture to ſit down and enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

it is not the caſe, as a ſmall proportion of it is ſpent that way; the buſineſs I am upon exacts a rigid attention: I have angles to take from the ſides of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and creeks, and tracts of land to meaſure acroſs <hi>Jungles</hi> I am ſurveying, and other places as difficult to penetrate; when on board of my Budgero, or in my marquee, maps and charts of different data and different proportions and projections to methodiſe; ſome gnominic, ſome ſtereographic, ſome artho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphic, and ſome mercators; differing both in their longitude and latitude of places; ſome being obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete and ſome modern: in general, all rude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted materials, which I have to reduce to one ſcale and ſpecies of projection, and from them and other materials of <hi>Gentoos,</hi> men but little experienced in the buſineſs, and Europeans as inexpert, or juſt initiated into the art of Geodoſia; beſides, a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of my proceedings I have to keep to throw before the committee at the precedency appointed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine into the buſineſs of the ſurvey.

Laſt ſeaſon troops were ſent to them from Bengal, and now we are informed they are in want of more ſupplies. How the governor and council at Calcutta will order matters I cannot tell; but it is ſaid here by the old ſtandards in the country, that they are apprehenſive the folks at Madraſs have got themſelves in a predicament they will not ſo readily extricate themſelves from. Hyder Ally has more than once hemmed in the Company's brigades. He ſtorms their camps (as their letters report) ſword in hand, and obliges them to form whenever he thinks proper, and gallops up with his horſe to the mouth of their cannon, cuts down their artillery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and turns their pieces againſt them; in ſhort, by his ſtratagems, and a run of ſucceſſes he has had, he has ſo hampered the military, and diſconcerted the meaſures of the governor and council there, that, unable to act any longer on the offenſive, and of extending Mamadilly, the Nabob of Arcot's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended territorial rights, they find themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the alternative of paying Hyder his own demands for the expence they have put him to by a war, and ſurrendering him up Sandyſyab's family, now priſoners in the fort of St. George, with other weighty requiſitions Hyder, it is rumored, expects them to make him before he ſheaths his ſword, or let the re-eſtabliſhment of their credit (not a little hurt by their conduct towards this man) reſt on the riſk of a battle with him, on the ſucceſs of which would ſolely depend the completion of their annual inveſtments of cloths, diamonds, and other articles, the produce of the Carnatic, in which, if they fail,

the Company's affairs will receive a ſhock in theſe parts that muſt materially effect their whole credit in India and at home; be it as it will, there are nothing but rumours of wars with us here; a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia is raiſed at Calcutta, and all it's ſubordinates to be prepared for the Marattas, now encamped near Eleabas, in caſe their confederates on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of our ſettlements to the ſouthward ſhould have planned an invaſion from two quarters, and in conſequence of ſome diſpatches arrived this inſtant from the Decan, the three European brigades are ordered with a large army of Seapoys and artillery, to march to Monghere.</p>

                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:022380_0126_0FB85A611319B988"/>This man was ſhort and robuſt, about 70 years of age, had a venerable black beard, they having an art to tinge the hair black to a great degree of perfection. He was copper-coloured, had a black ſparkling eye, and was a native of Iſpahan, and from his infancy, intimate with Thomas Koulikan, afterwards ſtyled-Nadir Shaw, following the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of this eminent warrior, became one of his principal confidents and leading officers: but on Nadir Shaw's being killed, retreating with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and a body of horſe to Indoſtan; to ſtrengthen his intereſt, he married one of his daughters to the Vizier, who retained him in his ſervice, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him and his followers. He was ſeated on a carpet leaning againſt a large cuſhion, in a circle of Mogul officers who lined the apartment.</p>
               <p>Theſe Moguls had a fierce look methought, which their ruddy complexions, buſhy beards, ſharp white teeth, fiery eyes, and big turbans, did not a little contribute to any more than their arms and dreſs; they wearing all high cylindrical caps within their turbans, exactly in the proportion and form of an high crowned hat of different coloured velvets, ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, broad-cloths and <hi>kincobs,</hi> and traverſed round with ſhawls, or ſome beautiful manufacture, and tied over all with a <hi>ramol</hi> to keep them ſnug, and from falling off when on horſeback. Their coats were like <hi>Huſſar</hi>'s veſts, both in the body and ſleeves, but longer and fuller in the ſkirts, they coming down to their ancles, and are bound all round their waiſts with large ſhawls or ſilk, or chequered linen ſaſhes, in which they ſtuck their poignards and their ſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitars, which are eccentrical, and hung by their ſides by handſome belts paſſed under the ſaſh. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of breehches they wear drawers, and over them velvet or broad cloth long full trowſers; all which clothes were neatly made, and under all their ſhirts,

which differ in no wiſe from women's ſhifts, having neither collars nor wriſt-bands to them. Their boots vary in nothing from European boots but in the heels, which are made exactly like our women's high heeled ſhoes, and their ſlippers are made in the ſame manner but ſtouter, and are moſtly of vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet or cloth, or of red, blue or green leather. The claſps of their belts, and the hilts of their ſwords, and in ſhort, all the metal about their arms and miſſive weapons, were in general gold, and ſtudded with jewels; and upon the whole, they cut as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like as reſpectable an appearance, and being the flower of Nadir Shaw's ſoldiers, tho' moſt of them advanced to 40 or 50 years of age, and numbers of them upwards of 60 or 70; they neither wanted vigour of body or mind, which were both evident in their looks and actions, having in general a warlike aſpect, and had upon the whole, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of men of credit and wealth; they having, moſt of them, more or leſs gold in ſpecie and jewels they had accumulated at different times in battle, and favorites of the Grand Vizer were perpetually employed on lucrative jobbs that added to their wealth; theſe men being cuttlebaſhes, not common horſemen, but even part of the identical body of men who had been employed by Nadir Shah, to exact the contribution of the inhabitants of Delhy and Indoſtan, when he invaded the empire.</p>
               <p>On my making my appearance the old man aroſe and met me half way, took me in his arms, according to the cuſtom of the country, and ſat me down at his right hand, placing a cuſhin between us both to lean on; when I ſignified to him that I wiſhed for a private conference, on which the company and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants were told to withdraw, and no one but eunuchs, who are admitted to all privacy whatever, remained in the ſaloon; when after ſome few queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

of courſe independent of the buſineſs I was upon of a ſurvey, I opened to him my mind on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject quite remote; it was on that of my quitting the connection of the Engliſh and trying my fortune by joining <hi>Sujah Dowlah.</hi> The exalted idea I had formed of that Vizier from the various accounts I had had of his magnificence and the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens I had ſeen of his opulence amouſt the Engliſh, who had made their fortunes by the plunder they gained at the battle of Buxar; added to the great wages he gave to Europeans of even the loweſt ſtamp, and the ſuperior encouragement he had given to ſome French gentlemen, and other foreigners who had ſought employment under him, with a number of other powerful incentives, ſtrongly biaſſed me towards the ſtep. He was an enterprizing prince, with no bounds to his generoſity, and it appeared to me in a ſtrong light, that could I but get intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into his ſervice, I could not fail of anſwering his purpoſe and making my fortune; but ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments laid in my way againſt accompliſhing ſuch a deſign, that it was evident to me, without uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon luck and ſome extraordinary effort of intereſt, out of the uſual channel, exerted in my favour, I ſhould never gain my point.</p>
               <p>The Company, to their ſorrow, had experienced already the diſagreeable effects of Europeans having ſtraggled up the country, and joined the country powers; but particularly in the body of them this prince had got together, by whoſe means he had not only raiſed an army of thirty thouſand ſeapoys, equal, if not ſuperior, in diſcipline, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's troops; ſet a foot a large train of artillery, as well mounted and ſerved as any at Fort-William; and initiated his artificers and mechanics in all the collateral branches of artillery and warlike appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus; circumſtances ſo diametrically oppoſite to the

Company's politics, that it getting to the ears of the court of directors at home, they reprimanded the governor and council in their letters to them from Europe, for tacitly permitting the Vizier to taile ſuch a military force; who made it an object of ſuch conſequence to them in the main, that they ſent a meſſenger to him by one of their factors, to diſmount his artillery and diſband his ſeapoys; which Sujah Dowlah conſidered in ſuch an approbrious light that he diſmiſſed their ambaſſador without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him an anſwer; and provoked with this meaſure, and not knowing what ſiniſter deſigns they might have, he aſſembled his whole army, and marched through Gorackpore towards Patna, when a ſecond meſſage from the Company, to know the reaſon of ſuch a warlike appearance on the frontiers of their lands, that gave his highneſs an opportunity of coming to an explication of his motives for aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his troops. After they came to an eclairciſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ended his expedition in a drill campain, and his army, artillery, and European detachments have been encreaſing ever ſince; from which time, while the Company to prevent any future migrations of Europeans up into the interior parts of the country, have given orders tolet no white men, without their permit, paſs the Choques forts or ſettlements, and enacted in council, that any ſervant of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's who ſhould preſume to viſit the <hi>Patcha, Vizier, Soubah,</hi> or any of the country powers, without their leave, he ſhould be diſmiſſed their ſervice; and if a free merchant, free mariner, or any other adventurer in the country (though not in their ſervice) for ſuch on offence be ſent a priſoner to the Preſidency, and as ſuch conveyed to Europe. Theſe reſtrictions ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, were the ſtumbling blocks in my way, which apparently had hitherto prevented my attempting affecting any buſineſs with Sujah Dowlah; in order

to remove which obſtacles, on my arrival at Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>germau, it occurred to me that the Faſdar, who ſaw with an envious eye the growing power of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and had talked loudly of their late imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent behaviour to the Vizier, might poſſibly liſten to a prepoſition that had a tendency to the aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſement of his ſon in law; as my vanity made me preſume, that the offer of an Engliſh <hi>Toppee Wallas</hi>'s ſervices (of my conſequence) might not be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an object of no importance, and flattered with that idea, I determined on explaining myſelf to this Mogul of eminence on the occaſion, which, in the interview I had required of him, I did in <hi>earneſt</hi> and ſufficient terms, that he liſtened to with the greateſt attention; and though prepared with an anſwer, as he afterwards informed me, then told me it was a matter of the utmoſt moment, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſome mature and deliberate conſideration, to which he would attend, and give his opinion of in the evening: in the interim, informing me break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt was ready, that had, he added, been retarded upon my account, which he would be glad I would partake of; I accordingly went with him into the apartment adjoining.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt time I ever ate with a Mogul, and as the entertainment was to me new, I will give you an account of it: a large covering was ſpread in the middle of the apartment, made of camel's leather, neatly ſewed together and fringed with the ſame, with diaper cloths and beautiful mats above all, to place the diſhes on; Madeira and claret wines were then, by order of the <hi>Faſdar,</hi> brought in from my own caſes, for my uſe, when after they had ſeated themſelves croſs-legg'd, as uſual, with the <hi>Faſdar</hi> at the head of his company, conſiſting of about forty Moguls and others, bread of two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds was handed round,—the one ſort was

                  <hi>nonpor</hi> bread, the other <hi>chappaty</hi> bread; the <hi>nonpoy</hi> bread was leavened, and about the ſize of thick pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes or ſlapjacks, and the <hi>chappaty</hi> or unleavened bread, (the dimenſions of a common china plate) made of fiber and water, converted into dough, faſtened out with hands, and afterwards baked on <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> or hollow iron utenſils. Their meats were of various kinds, and too tedious to enumerate; however ſome of them I will introduce by way of variety; which were their <hi>Pilloes,</hi> ſaline <hi>Sourrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adars</hi> and meat <hi>Curryadar.</hi> Their pilloes are their favourite and ſtanding diſhes, and are made of rice and the meat of kid, mutton, antelope, deer or fowls, and cooked much after the manner as in Europe, with this difference, that the flavour of them is not heightened by the addition of ham, which to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, though ſo agreeable to Mahomedans, is ſo obnoxious that what quantity of it would ſatisfy the appetite of a child amongſt us, would not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminate the meats of a ſingle repaſt, but pollute a whole tribe of <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> that ſhould partake of it. The ſmaller diſhes were kid, mutton and fowl; fried, boiled and roaſted, and ſome of each made into forc'd-meat-balls; with fiſh, fleſh and fowls dreſſed with <hi>Curryſtuff</hi> and <hi>Salline Sourrouadar</hi> (of which two laſt articles, <hi>See Gloſſary</hi> for explication). The pilloes were ſerved up in diſhes of about three feet in diameter; the one of gold, the other two of ſilver: the other meats were ſerved up, ſome in thin wooden trenchers, and ſome on plates and diſhes of china, ſilver and gold, of different ſorts and ſizes; they prefering this variety, in thoſe articles, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the country, to that uniformity therein we ſo much admire. Thus ſeated, and grace being ſaid by the <hi>Faſdar,</hi> as head of the family, he began to officiate at table in diſtributing the different meats that were before us, which he did with great alacrity
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:022380_0132_0FB85A71A7F9CF78"/>
and chearfulneſs; and ſhewing me a deference as a ſtranger, had the diſhes of <hi>Pilloe</hi> handed to him, when taking two of theſe large flat <hi>Nonpoys,</hi> above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, with a proportion of the <hi>Chappaty</hi> bread, clapping both hands firſt into one diſh and then into another, filled them with <hi>Pilloe,</hi> and ſent me at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times, double handfuls of theſe articles, with a pickled mango in each, on the ſurface of theſe broad cakes pinch'd up like a hat to confine the meat as it was handed from the Faſdar to me; when rejecting the knife and fork that was laid on purpoſe for me, that I might conform to the manners of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I was in, I ate with my right hand, though without being able to acquit myſelf with that faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and faſhion the Faſdar and his company did.</p>
               <p>Theſe Aſiatics in general, averſe to uſeleſs and trivial altercation, are more remarkable for their taciturnity than loquacity, which I diſcovered at this interview, notwithſtanding which they are ſtill ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable and communicative, deciſive, and laconic in their ſpeech, and without uſing ſtrained compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like the Chriſtians, are naturally hoſpitable and generous, rather than polite and ceremonial; eſteeming any thing that will excite laughter as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, whether an act, word or deed: a perſon by his writings or expreſſions, to acquire the name of a wit amongſt them, would be eſteemed, if not a fool, a buffoon, without being pitied or deſpiſed.</p>

in public or private companies, no ſudden ſtart or flirts of body or mind, will with the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny, be diſcovered in an intercourſe of ſeven years with theſe people, to hear them break out into a loud vociferation or horſe laugh, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the natural brightneſs and chearfulneſs of their temper: though uſed to depredation in war, and deciſive when they ſtrike a blow, as they never draw their ſwords in vain, they ſtill know when to ſhow mercy or when to give no quarter: as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, an aged or defenceleſs man, woman or child, would be ſure of an aſylum, from all quarters, amongſt Moguls or Indoſtans, under any circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtances whatever, whether in war or peace; and with reſpect to women, ſo ſacred is held the perſon of a female in thoſe parts, that a <hi>Dooly, Palanquin,</hi> or <hi>Hackerrey,</hi> with women therein, covered with ſcarlet cloth and announced to be a <hi>Zunnannah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween even contending armies, would not only paſs unmoleſted, but eſcorts from both parties would be detached to convey them out of harms way; for to violate this law is death without reprieve; inaſmuch that even to lift up, through curioſity or any other motive, the mantle of the carriage, if apprehended, the party's right hand will be cut off, and the other branded with an hot iron, for infamy, let the woman or women in queſtion be of whatever ſtamp or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may be; it matters not be they rich or poor, their honour and perſons are held ſacred in theſe parts and amongſt theſe people.</p>
               <p>They are not leſs rigid in the obſervance of the payment of their debts, and equally as charitably diſpoſed, having a natural propenſity to give alms without being urged to it from the commandments of their alcoran, which makes charitable acts as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential a duty in men as prayer, but actuated by inherent principles of humanity when aſked for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

by a diſtreſſed perſon, without framing idle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts to evade helping the needy, or aggravating the ſuppliant's misfortune by aſcribing them to idleneſs, drunkenneſs, gaming, or other extravagance, as is too frequently the caſe amongſt many very apparent good chriſtians, but immediately order him victuals, and if any company, a ſmall collection will be made amongſt them for the poor mendicant, and when diſmiſſed, give them their farewell in earneſt terms, by ſaying <hi>allah hafuſt,</hi> which ſignifies God be with you.</p>
               <p>They are not leſs commendable in points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and morality, never taking God's name in vain; that is, have not recourſe to oaths, but when called upon by courts of judicature, or exacted of them on emergent occaſions, when the formalities of laws, and juſtice require it. When a Seapoy ſwears by his ſcymitar or the alcoran, putting his hand on the one or the other, both being equally held ſacred in this caſe, and no provocation can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to uſe execrations, or illiberal language to each other, or neglect their duty to their parents, whom they love to exceſs, tho' the ſame affection does not ſubſiſt between brothers and ſiſters, which ariſes entirely from the liberty of their alcoran, (i. e. their bible) that permits them to have plurality of wives, from which different branches of ſons and daughters may ſpring, and all claim equal right to parental affection and inheritance. Hence the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious paricides, fratricides, and maſſacres, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Mahometan dominions, that the wiſdom of the chriſtian laws happily precludes.

               <p>I ſhall now return to our repaſt, which having finiſhed, a deſart of fruit was brought in, and an apple and a pear preſented me as a rarity, in which light indeed they might be conſidered; they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been produced on the frontiers of Arabia, and brought from thence in little ſcrew boxes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately packed and ſtowed in cotton, and ſold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at the rate of two rupees a-piece when not plentiful, and at a rupee a-piece on an average.

               <p>From Rajahmaul I proceeded to Monghere, where the Company have fortifications, it being their ſecond military department, their firſt being at Fort William, and the other at <hi>Kaſſim Buzar;</hi> this being one of the principal paſſes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to narrow (being cut through a ſolid rock) that a file of muſqueters, or a ſingle field piece can defend it againſt the invaſion of an army.

It was early in the morning, and he was mounted on a ſmall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, without a <hi>Houdah</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">A turret.</note>, ſtriding his neck him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with his <hi>punjah</hi> in his hand, and a broad ſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter by his ſide His Highneſs was exactly five feet ten inches high, as I have been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but appeared to be a taller man on his elephant; he was corpulant, without being fat, of a dark copper colour, wearing both beard and whiſkers, and in any garb, or under any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, would by a remarkable authority, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in his countenance, be known to be a perſon of repute. The circumſtance of his being mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this manner, attracted a greater crowd to ſee him than otherwiſe probably it would have aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. He had been to pay the Patcha a viſit, and
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:022380_0148_0FB85A9650E3E210"/>
was on his retain to Phyzabad, when, remarkable for his courage, ſtrength, and feats of activity on elephants and horſeback, the boats not being in readineſs that were to have conveyed him and his retinue over the river; notwithſtanding it's breadth oppoſite the place, he changed the elephant he had paſſed through the city on, for the one I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed, and mounting him in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner above mentioned, he proceeded for the river ſide, when plunging in thus mounted, he croſſed this great ſtream in deſpite of a rapid current, and within a piſtol ſhot of the oppoſite ſhore, cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an alligator that attacked his elephant, and landed ſafe in about 20 minutes, in ſight of above a thouſand Europeans then at Patna, including their military.</p>
               <p>From Patna I proceeded to Eleabas, which city ſtands on an angle of land that terminates where the confluence of the ſtreams of the Great Ganges and the river Jumnah meet, and is one of the grand paſſes of the empire.</p>
               <p>At Eleabas, the other parties engaged in the ſurvey agreeable to appointment, met, when we compared our works; a few days after which, we took different routs, and I proceeded to Frackabad, and from thence to Bangermau; whence, after a week's ſtay, I paſſed by land through Lucknoar, and other towns in my way to Phyzabad, where I propoſed meeting my <hi>Budgero</hi> and other boats, with all diſpatch to avoid the approaching rains, which would interfere with the buſineſs I was upon, and had ordered the boats round by the way of the Gogra accordingly. During my ſtay at Banger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau, my leiſure hours were agreeably enough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, ſome of them in converſation with the <hi>Faſdar,</hi> wherein the accounts I gave him of Europe, the coaſt of Africa, its inhabitants, and the Weſt-Indies, &amp;c. were not leſs agreeable to him, than were thoſe he gave of the interior parts of Aſia he

               <p>The girls, when they have learned to walk, the uſe of ſpeech coming to them generally about the ſame time, have their baby cloths thrown aſide, and in their ſtead other dreſſes prepared for them, viz. long drawers, pizwagees, veils, ſaſhes, ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, annulets, bracelets on their hands and arms, with necklaces, pendants for their noſes and ears, and round the neck, and <hi>taveeges</hi>

               <p>Having finiſhed my buſineſs in the neighbourhood of Bangermau, I took leave of the Faſdar, and by the way of Lucknoar, as I mentioned, proceeded to Phyzabad to join my <hi>Budgero</hi> and department there, where I viſited the Vizier, and preſented him with a <hi>Nazur</hi>

This wilderneſs is equally habited by tigers, leopards, baboons, and apes of all ſorts and ſizes, elks, deer, antelopes, innumerable jackalls, ſerpents, alliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and crocodiles; of the bird kind, eagles, vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, pilicans, hawks, kites, peacocks, all prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (beaſts and birds) the one preying on the other. In croſſing which wilderneſs, penetrating the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the northward, I diſcovered the Napal hills, where I was obliged to precipitate my march, in order to avoid the <hi>Rajah poots</hi> of thoſe mountains, then out upon the ſcout to intercept the Company's ſurveyors and detachments ſent to explore their country, and diſcover the paſſage up thoſe hills, in order to come at the knowledge of the rich gold mines their country is replete with; and one and twenty days from the time I left Brangermau, I arrived at <hi>Chunnam Choppah,</hi> when I embarked in my budgero, and proceeded with the reſt of my boats by the way of <hi>Jillinghee</hi> to Dacca, one of the largeſt cities in Bengal, and capital of a province, and famous for its muſlin manufactures, that are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricated by men who work under groves of trees, in walks reſembling rope-walks, where they have the threads of the muſlins extended on bamboo ſtands, with croſs pieces on them, and traverſed through and through with ſhuttles in this manner, without being manufactured, as ſome have imagined, in a

From Dacca, I proceeded down the Great Ganges to Chittagan.

A few days after this, he marched towards his capitol, and general Smith had orders, which were with the conſent of Hyder, to watch his motions, by marching within a few miles of his rear, till he had entirely quit the boundaries of Mamhudilly's territory.

               <p>I proſecuted my voyage to Bengal, and in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hours after my leaving Madraſs, arrived at Calcutta, where I was employed anew in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſurvey; but theſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>It is not ſurpriſing then that people ſo tenacious of their religious rites and cuſtoms, and delicate with reſpect to their ideas of women, ſhould rather

               <p>A monoply of grain of all ſpecies was thought of, and it was decreed in council at Calcutta, that all the ghee, wheat, rice, Indian corn, bodgero, gram and grain in general, within the three provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Bengal, Behar and Orixa (on the pretext of meaſuring and ſharing it for the reſpective proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) ſhould be delivered up to the Company's agents on pain of death, confiſcation, or impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at ſuch a ſtipulated price; and officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſee it done.

time of need. What were the effects of the mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply? It produced a famine throughout the country. Gentoos and Mahometans would be ſeen begging aloud for <hi>routtee;</hi> and however contrary to the tenets of their reſpective religions, the latter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring ſwine's fleſh, and the former, to them all animal food as obnoxious, particularly beef. The calls of nature breaking through all religious ties, glad were theſe famiſhed people, the Gentoos, to devour the fleſh of the cow; and the Mahometan's ſwine's fleſh, which pollutes, according to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, both body and ſoul, and excludes them for ever the manſions of the bleſſed.</p>
               <p>The famine increaſed; the natives began to die for hunger in abundance, inaſmuch that the ſtreets of Calcutta were ſo beſtrewed with dead bodies, that it made it neceſſary for people to have their palanquins hung round with ſprigs of rue, and chaffindiſhes with burning charcoal and frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe evaporating in them, to keep off the noxious fumes of the dead bodies; for ſo thick were the human carcaſes, that the bearers, in narrow ſtreets, and at the turnings of corners, were obliged to walk over them; the dead bodies increaſing daily it was more than the Hallalcores and Sewerwallas could do to keep the ſtreets clear of them, though they were well paid for throwing them into the adjacent rivers.</p>
               <p>Men, women and children, ſtaggering after paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, craving for alms, unable to hold out any longer, world be ſeen to fall amongſt other expiring Gentoos and Mahometans, to ſhun the common fate of their famiſhed countrymen; while the name of Allah by the Mahometans, and Bogwan by the Gentoos, which ſignifies God, in their reſpective languages, alternately rung by peals in one's ears, would add conſiderably to the horror and awfulneſs of the ſcene.</p>

                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:022380_0167_0FB85ABEE73B7500"/>The banks and ſides of the river Hughly, which runs by Calcutta, lined with the bodies of theſe unhappy people, attracting in prodigious numbers the jackalls, piadogs, pillicans, Braming kites, vultures, and carrion crows, with which this country abounds; the dead bodies and ſome of them but expiring (men, women and children) ſcreened from the eye by theſe contending parties of vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious animals, and the amazing volumes of flies that the ſtench had drawn together, formed a ſcene as horrid as obnoxious to behold.</p>
               <p>The quadrupedes, ſome of them ſatiated with their repaſt, would be ſeen ſleeping, ſome watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and others baſking in the ſun; whilſt ſome finiſhing and beginning their meal, interrupted by the intruſion of new comers (four footed animals and winged fowl) ſkirmiſhes would enſue, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently terminate in a general battle, in which all parties would be indiſcriminately engaged,—the crow, kite, vulture, dog and jackcall, pell mell; at which juncture, ſhould caprice or curioſity lead a ſpectator to fire a gun towards them, flocks of fowl would riſe in bodies, thick and extenſive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to caſt an obvious ſhadow to conſiderable diſtances on the banks of the river, that would ſeem to darken the adjacent ſhore.</p>
               <p>After the height of this famine was over, the news being confirmed at Calcutta of the Badſhaw having broke with the Engliſh, in a ſmall <hi>Budgero,</hi> with a fixed determination of joining him I ſet off, with a few attendants and a Banyan, one whom I could confide in, for Eleabas, and proceeded up the Ganges to above Frakabad, where in a creek, a few miles from that city, I harboured my <hi>Budgero</hi> not chooſing to be ſeen by the Engliſh then at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore with Sir Robert Barker, the then commander in chief of their troops; and made Frakabad my reſidence, where I was accommodated with an eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible

houſe for me and my attendants, by order of the <hi>Nabob</hi> Muſſoffre Jung, a Patan, about eighteen years of age, where I waited until the Engliſh took leave of the Patcha and returned to Bengal, which as a very intereſting event, before I proceed on a detail of any other matters, I will give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Badſhaw's motive for this ſtep, and of the ſituation of his affairs when I arrived at this place.</p>
               <p>The Badſhaw having early diſcovered the ſiniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter views of the Engliſh Eaſt-India Company, had a long while determined on ſtriking up a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with the Marattas, who, glad to liſten to any propoſition that might favor a plan they had in view, of laying all the country without Bulmonſin, the Beneras Rajah, Sujahdowlah's, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's territory, under contribution, affected to make it a buſineſs on purpoſe to march for, in order to join Alligore, who receiving aſſurances from Rumchundergunnis, Tucojah-hulkah and Sindia, to that effect he regulated himſelf accordingly, and Nannaby, an important Maratta, and a Bramin, likewiſe with Sindia, otherwiſe Petellzibe, and Tucojah-hulkah, (three powerful chiefs) moved their armies from the Decan, and croſſing the Jumnah, encamped in Anterbade, while Nagebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan, an enterpriſing Mogul, of repute in the Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw's houſhold, augmented his body guard to the number of 6000 Mogul horſe, and engaged about double the number of Indoſtan cavalry, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Indoſtan Burgondoſſes, perhaps a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandmen, viz. mercenaries, the Badſhaw reſolved to take the field, and riding through the gates of Eleabas mounted on an elephant, followed by his Zunnannah and confidents, attended by his court, and the two battalions of Seapoys the Company had all along alotted him for his ſafeguard, he croſſed the Great Ganges in a boat without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:022380_0169_0FB85AC1CE6CCB78"/>
and in a few hours afterwards joined the Maratta army on the banks of the Ganges, and encamped; having, prior to this, ſignified his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to the Britiſh commander in chief, Sir Robert Barker, then on the ſpot, who remonſtrated to the Emperor with all his eloquence and artifice in vain, to decline all thoughts of proſecuting ſuch a plan, pointing out to him the inexpediency of taking the field, and expoſing himſelf to the mercy of a rapacious ſet of troops; but the Pacha, tired out with the reiterated impertinances of the Engliſh and their barefaced impoſitions, reſolutely ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as deſcribed, and joined this new formed connection as intended, who received him with all the marks of friendſhip in their power, and Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas evacuated in a manner by this ſtep of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul, it taking wind through the country, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes were followed by ſuch a number of opulent men, bankers and merchants from all parts, who, having experienced the cruel oppreſſions of Clive, Cartier, Verelſt and Sikes, while at Caſſambuzer and Bouehier, and Dupee at Madraſs, with Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at Bombay, and their agent in general, eagerly embraced this opportunity to ſave their lives and fortunes, and travelling back up into the country again in diſguiſe, by the ſame unfrequented by ways, &amp;c. they firſt paſſed to join the Engliſh, gained the Patcha's army, and offering him their pecuniary aſſiſtance, he found himſelf unexpectedly in a condition to augment his forces, and add ſtrength to his credit, while the provinces of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Behar and Orixa, the vicinities of Madraſs, Bombay and Surat, felt a ſudden want of monied men to furniſh them as uſual, with loans upon their bonds.

which time the Badſhaw was employed in receiving <hi>nazurs,</hi> returning preſents, and conferring honors upon his grandees and officers of the two armies, when he aroſe, and encircled by the eunuchs and <hi>Aumeers</hi> of his houſhold, who on that occaſion link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands together, conducted him to the tents where he kept his ſeraglio; when I was ſhewn to a tent by order of the acting Vizer, who informed me that I ſhould not be able to do any buſineſs with the Patcha till after the expiration of nine days, which interim I employed in obſerving the Maratta army and the Patcha's, a ſight eaſier to conceive at once than to relate in few words, but confined in time, I muſt cut this and other matters ſhort.</p>
               <p>The then army of the Marattas conſiſted of one hundred and twenty-five thouſand horſe, interſperſed with perhaps 200 elephants, commanded by three of the moſt important chiefs of the Decan, viz.

body of men and animals are ſo formidable and numerous, that on encamping on the frontiers of a territory, without drawing their ſwords, they can exact contribution. The wood they require for fuel and the graſs they require for forage for their horſes and cattle being ſo great that wherever they encamp, the ſpot thereon and circumjacent country is laid waſte, the trees are cut down, the graſs pulled up by the roots, and the wells and ponds in general dried of their waters, and dreary barren plains left behind; which, with above army of the Patcha, conſtituted the force prepared to reduce to obedience the revolted power of the country.

taken priſoner by the Vizier's troops, and carried before Sujah Dowlah, ſtruck with her beauty he paid his addreſſes to her, but diſappointed in his expectations of her yielding to his deſires, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting illicit means, this princeſs determined not tamely to yield to his unlawful embraces, in a conteſt between them that happened on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, by a blow from a poiſoned poignard that ſhe aimed at his heart, that in fending off with his right hand entered deep into his thigh; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the advice of many eminent phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and the joint efforts of doctor Fullerton, (then ſurgeon to the Engliſh army, and to whom the Vizier's mother promiſed ten lacks of rupees, ſhould he ſave the life of her ſon) the wound mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying, and the baneful taint of the poignard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminating his vitals, he expired in great agony fourteen days from that on which he received the blow;—and to prevent the circumſtances of his death tranſpiring but as little as poſſible, he was buried incognito, in Mawtabbaugh, at Phyzabad, in the forty eight year of his age.</p>
               <p>Thus after having rendered himſelf conſpicuous, and even formidable in the eyes of Aſiatic nations, by a long ſeries of warlike enterpriſes, (by the hands of a female, a girl, and a captive!—in the centre of armed troops) fell this blazing ſtar of the eaſtern hemiſphere; he having in point of retinue, grandeur of his army, and brilliancy of his Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, obliterated all his cotemporary princes in the Eaſt,—a juſt ſacrifice to his folly and diſhonorable aim.
