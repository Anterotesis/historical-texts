            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO the Patrons of this Work, the Publiſher preſents his moſt ſincere thanks. He ſhould conſider himſelf highly wanting in gratitude, to the memory of that illuſtrious character, the late Honorable THOMAS RUSSELL, Eſq. were he not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to mention the diſtinguiſhed kindneſs of that gentleman, by whoſe patronage and advice the Propoſals for this work were iſſued. The Members of Harvard Univerſity have a claim upon the Publiſher's gratitude, which he flatters himſelf will never be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffaced from his memory. It was the Publiſher's intention to have inſerted all the Complimentary Addreſſes and Anſwers; but a number of the Subſcribers having expreſſed a wiſh that the "Circular Letter" of General Waſhington to the Governors of the ſeveral States, and his "Farewell Orders" to the Armies of America, and the "Anſwer," might be inſerted in lieu of ſome of thoſe Addreſſes, they are accordingly printed in an Appendix.</p>
            <p>The Proprietor of the work having now done every thing in his power to contribute to its beauty and uſefulneſs, ſhould any thing have eſcaped his obſervation, in this arduous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive undertaking, he would thank any friendly hand to point it out; and ſhould he meet with encouragement (of which there is little doubt, from the patronage afforded to works of this kind, by American citizens) ſufficient to iſſue a ſecond edition, additions ſhall be made, if poſſible, to univerſal ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. How far he has ſucceeded in his feeble though well-meant exertions, is left to an indulgent Public to determine.</p>

               <p>THIS day the great and illuſtrious WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, the favourite ſon of liberty, and deliverer of his country, entered upon the execution of the office of Firſt Magiſtrate of the United States of America; to which important ſtation he had been unanimouſly called by the united voice of the people. The ceremony which took place on this occaſion was truly grand and pleaſing, and every heart ſeemed anxious to teſtify the joy it felt on ſo memorable an event. His Excellency was eſcorted from his houſe, by a troop of light dragoons, and the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion under the command of colonel LEWIS, attended by a committee of the Senate and Houſe of Repreſentatives, to Federal Hall, where he was formally received by both houſes of Congreſs, aſſembled in the Senate Chamber; after which he was conducted to the gallery in front of the hall, accompanied by all the members, when the oath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Conſtitution was adminiſtered to him by the Chancellor of this State, who then ſaid,
"LONG LIVE GEORGE WASHINGTON,
Preſident of the United States;" which was anſwered by an immenſe concourſe of citizens, aſſembled the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by the loudeſt plaudit and acclamation, that love and veneration ever inſpired. He then made the following ſpeech.</p>

                  <p>AMONG the viciſſitudes incident to life, no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was tranſmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the preſent month. On the one hand, I was ſummoned by my country, whoſe voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat which I had choſen with the fondeſt predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable deciſion as the aſylum of my declining years: A retreat which was rendered every day more neceſſary as well as more dear to me, by the addition of habit to inclination, and of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent interruptions in my health to the gradual waſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the truſt to which the voice of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try called me, being ſufficient to awaken in the wiſeſt and moſt experienced of her citizens, a diſtruſtful ſcrutiny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence one, who, inheriting inferior endowments from nature, and unpractiſed in the duties of civil adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought to be peculiarly conſcious of his own defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver is, that it has been my faithful ſtudy to collect my duty from a juſt appreciation of every circumſtance by which it might be affected. All I dare hope is, that if in executing this taſk I have been too much ſwayed by a grateful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of former inſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by an affectionate ſenſibility to this tranſcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens; and have thence too little conſulted my incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as well as diſinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me; my error will be palliated by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which miſled me, and its conſequences be judged by my country, with ſome ſhare of the partiality in which they originated.</p>
                  <p>Such being the impreſſions under which I have, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the public ſummons, repaired to the preſent ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031402_0008_0FEF91906B11E4E8"/>
it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this firſt official act, my ſervent ſupplications to that Almighty Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who rules over the univerſe, who preſides in the councils of nations, and whoſe providential aids can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply every human defect, that his benediction may conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to the liberties and happineſs of the people of the United States, a government inſtituted by themſelves for theſe eſſential purpoſes, and may enable every inſtrument employed in its adminiſtration, to execute with ſucceſs, the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the great Author of every public and private good, I aſſure myſelf that it expreſſes your ſentiments not leſs than my own; nor thoſe of my fellow citizens at large, leſs than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the inviſible hand, which conducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States. Every ſtep, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, ſeems to have been diſtinguiſhed by ſome token of providential agency. And in the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant revolution juſt accompliſhed in, the ſyſtem of their united government, the tranquil deliberations and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conſent of ſo many diſtinct communities, from which the event has reſulted, cannot be compared with the means by which moſt governments have been eſtabliſhed, without ſome return of pious gratitude along with an humble an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the future bleſſings which the paſt ſeem to preſage. Theſe reflections, ariſing out of the preſent cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, have forced themſelves too ſtrongly on my mind to be ſuppreſſed. You will join with me, I truſt, in thinking that there are none under the influence of which, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of a new and free government can more auſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly commence.</p>
                  <p>By the article eſtabliſhing the executive department, it is made, the duty of the Preſident "to recommend to your conſideration, ſuch meaſures as he ſhall judge neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and expedient." The circumſtances under which I now meet you, will acquit me from entering into that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject farther than to refer you to the great Conſtitutional Charter under which we are aſſembled; and which, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031402_0009_0FEF919675B11E00"/>
is to be given. It will be more conſiſtent with thoſe circumſtances, and far more congenial with the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which actuate me, to ſubſtitute in place of a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of particular meaſures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotiſm which adorn the characters ſelected to deviſe and adopt them. In theſe honourable qualifications, I behold the fureſt pledges, that as on one ſide, no local prejudices or attachments, no ſeparate views nor party animoſities, will miſdirect the comprehenſive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great aſſemblage of communities and intereſts: ſo, on another, that the foundations of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and the pre-eminence of a free government be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens, and command the reſpect of the world.</p>
                  <p>I dwell on this proſpect with every ſatisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inſpire; ſince there is no truth more thoroughly eſtabliſhed, than that there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in the economy and courſe of nature, an indiſſoluble union between virtue and happineſs—between duty and advantage—between the genuine maxims of an honeſt and magnanimous policy, and the ſolid rewards of public proſperity and felicity. Since we ought to be no leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the propitious ſmiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that diſregards the eternal rules of order and right, which Heaven itſelf has ordained. And ſince the preſervation of the ſacred fire of liberty, and the deſtiny of the republican model of government, are juſtly conſidered as <hi>deeply,</hi> perhaps, as <hi>finally</hi> ſtaked, on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment entruſted to the hands of the American people.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the ordinary objects ſubmitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the occaſional power delegated by the Fifth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Conſtitution is rendered expedient at the preſent juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged againſt the ſyſtem, or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them. Inſtead of undertaking particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar recommendations on this ſubject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031402_0009_0FEF919675B11E00"/>
ſhall again give way to my entire confidence in your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and purſuit of the public good: For I aſſure my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that whilſt you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, or which ought to await the future leſſons of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; a reverence for the characteriſtic rights of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and a regard for the public harmony, will ſufficiently influence your deliberations on the queſtion, how far the former can be more impregnably fortified, or the latter be ſafely and advantageouſly promoted.</p>
                  <p>To the preceding obſervations I have one to add, which will be moſt properly addreſſed to the Houſe of Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives. It concerns myſelf, and will therefore be as brief as poſſible. When I was firſt honoured with a call into the ſervice of my country, then on the eve of an arduous ſtruggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty, required that I ſhould renounce every pecuniary compenſation. From this reſolution I have in no inſtance departed. And being ſtill under the impreſſions which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it, I muſt decline as inapplicable to myſelf, any ſhare in the perſonal emoluments, which may be indiſpenſably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a permanent proviſion for the executive depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and muſt accordingly pray that the pecuniary eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates for the ſtation in which I am placed, may, during my continuation in it, be limited to ſuch actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require.</p>
                  <p>Having thus imparted to you my ſentiments, as they have been awakened by the occaſion which brings us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I ſhall take my preſent leave; but not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting once more to the benign Parent of the human race, in humble ſupplication, that ſince he has been pleaſed to favour the American people with, opportunities for deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating in perfect tranquillity, and diſpoſitions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity on a form of government for the ſecurity of their Union, and the advancement of their happineſs; ſo his divine bleſſing may be equally <hi>conſpicuous</hi> in the enlarged views, the temperate conſultations, and the wiſe meaſures on which the ſucceſs of this government muſt depend.</p>

                  <p>WE, the Senate of the United States, return you our ſincere thanks for your excellent ſpeech, delivered to both Houſes of Congreſs, congratulate you on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete organization of the federal government, and felicitate ourſelves and our fellow-citizens, on your elevation to the office of Preſident, an office, highly important by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers conſtitutionally annexed to it, and extremely honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the manner in which the appointment is made. The unanimous ſuffrage of the elective body in your favour, is peculiarly expreſſive of the gratitude, confidence and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the citizens of America, and is the higheſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial at once of your merit, and of their eſteem. We are ſenſible, Sir, that nothing but the voice of your fellow-citizens, could have called you from a retreat, choſen by the fondeſt predilection, endeared by habit, and conſecrated to the repoſe of declining years; we rejoice, and with us, all America, that, in obedience to the call of our common country, you have returned once more to public life. In you all parties confide, in you all intereſts unite, and we have no doubt, that your paſt ſervices, great as they have been, will be equalled by your future exertions; and that your prudence and ſagacity as a ſtateſman, will tend to avert the dangers to which we were expoſed, to give ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the preſent government, and dignity and ſplendour to that country, which your ſkill and valour as a ſoldier, ſo eminently contributed to raiſe to independence and empire.</p>
                  <p>When we contemplate the coincidence of circumſtances, and wonderful combination of cauſes, which gradually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the people of this country for independence; when we contemplate the riſe, progreſs and termination of the late war, which gave them a name among the nations of the earth, we are, with you, unavoidably led to acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge and adore the great Arbiter of the univerſe, by whom empires riſe and fall. A review of the many ſignal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031402_0010_0FEF919804C68CA8"/>
of divine interpoſition in favour of this country, claims our moſt pious gratitude. And permit us, Sir, to obſerve, that among the great events which have led to the formation and eſtabliſhment of a federal government, we eſteem your acceptance of the office of Preſident as one of the moſt propitious and important.</p>
                  <p>In execution of the truſt repoſed in us, we ſhall endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to purſue that enlarged and liberal policy, to which your ſpeech ſo happily directs. We are conſcious that the proſperity of each State is inſeparably connected with the welfare of all, and that in promoting the latter, we ſhall effectually advance the former. In full perſuaſion of this truth, it ſhall be our invariable aim to diveſt ourſelves of local prejudices and attachments, and to view the great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage of communities and intereſts committed to our charge with an equal eye. We feel, Sir, the force, and acknowledge the juſtneſs of the obſervation, that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our national policy ſhould be laid in private mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. If individuals be not influenced by moral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, it is in vain to look for public virtue; it is, therefore, the duty of legiſlators to enforce, both by precept and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the utility as well as the neceſſity of a ſtrict adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the rules of diſtributive juſtice. We beg you to be aſſured, that the Senate will at all times cheerfully co-oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate in every meaſure, which may ſtrengthen the Union, conduce to the happineſs, or ſecure and perpetuate the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties of this great Conſederated Republic.</p>
                  <p>We commend you, Sir, to the protection of Almighty GOD, earneſtly beſeeching him long to preſerve a life ſo valuable and dear to the people of the United States; and that your adminiſtration may be proſperous to the nation and glorious to yourſelf.</p>

The coincidence of circumſtances which led to this auſpicious criſis; the confidence repoſed in me by my fellow-citizens, and the aſſiſtance I may expect from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which will be dictated by an enlarged and liberal pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icy, ſeem to preſage a more proſperous iſſue to my admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration, than a diffidence of my abilities had taught me to anticipate.

                  <p>We well know the anxieties with which you muſt have obeyed a ſummons, from the repoſe reſerved for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining years, into public ſcenes, of which you had taken your leave forever; but the obedience was due to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. It is already applauded by the univerſal joy which welcomes you to your ſtation, and we cannot doubt but that it will be rewarded with all the ſatisfaction, with which an ardent love for your fellow citizens muſt review ſucceſsful efforts to promote their happineſs.</p>
                  <p>This anticipation is not juſtified merely by the paſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of your ſignal ſervices.

Your reſolution in a moment critical to the liberties of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to renounce all perſonal emolument, was among the many preſages of your patriotic ſervices, which have been amply fulfilled; and your ſcrupulous adherence now to the law then impoſed on yourſelf, cannot fail to demonſtrate the purity, whilſt it increaſes the luſtre of a character, which has ſo many titles to admiration.</p>

In the arrangements which may be made reſpecting it, it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable ſupport of the officers and ſoldiers, with a due regard to economy.</p>
                  <p>There was reaſon to hope, that the pacific meaſures adopted with regard to certain hoſtile tribes of Indians, would have relieved the inhabitants of our ſouthern and weſtern frontiers from their depredations. But you will perceive, by the informations contained in the papers, which I ſhall direct to be laid before you, (comprehending a communication from the Commonwealth of Virginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford protection to thoſe parts of the Union; and, if neceſſary, to puniſh aggreſſors.</p>
                  <p>The intereſt of the United States requires, that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with other nations ſhall be facilitated by ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions as will enable me to fulfil my duty in that reſpect, in the manner which circumſtances may render moſt conducive to the public good: And to this end, that the compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made to the perſons who may be employed, ſhould, according to the nature of their appointments, be defined by law; and a competent fund deſignated for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying the expenſes incident to the conduct of our foreign affairs.</p>
                  <p>Various conſiderations alſo render it expedient, that the terms on which foreigners may be admitted to the rights of citizens, ſhould be ſpeedily aſcertained by a uniform rule of naturalization.</p>
                  <p>Uniformity in the currency, weights and meaſures of the United States, is an object of great importance, and will, I am perſuaded, be duly attended to.</p>
                  <p>The advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, by all proper means, will not, I truſt, need rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommendation. But I cannot forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction of new and uſeful inventions from abroad, as to the exertions of ſkill and genius in producing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031402_0013_0FEF919EC695D638"/>
them at home; and of facilitating the intercourſe between the diſtant parts of our country, by a due attention to the poſt office and poſt roads.</p>
                  <p>Nor am I leſs perſuaded, that you will agree with me in opinion, that there is nothing which can better deſerve your patronage, than the promotion of ſcience and literature. Knowledge is in every country the ſureſt baſis of public happineſs. In one, in which the meaſures of government receive their impreſſion ſo immediately from the ſenſe of the community, as in ours, it is proportionably eſſential. To the ſecurity of a free conſtitution it contributes in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways. By convincing thoſe who are entruſted with the public adminiſtration, that every valuable end of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is beſt anſwered by the enlightened confidence of the people: And by teaching the people themſelves to know, and to value their own rights; to diſcern and provide againſt invaſions of them; to diſtinguiſh between oppreſſion and the neceſſary exerciſe of lawful authority; between burthens proceeding from a diſregard to their convenience, and thoſe reſulting from the inevitable exigencies of ſociety; to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate the ſpirit of liberty from that of licentiouſneſs, cheriſhing the firſt, avoiding the laſt, and uniting a ſpeedy, but temperate vigilance againſt encroachments, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable reſpect to the laws.</p>
                  <p>Whether this deſirable object will be the beſt promoted by affording aids to ſeminaries of learning already eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, by the inſtitution of a national univerſity, or by any other expedients, will be well worthy of a place in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations of the Legiſlature.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>I SAW with peculiar pleaſure, at the cloſe of the laſt ſeſſion, the reſolution entered into by you, expreſſive of your opinion, that an adequate proviſion for the ſupport of the public credit is a matter of high importance to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional honour and proſperity. In this ſentiment I entirely concur.

of the other branch of the legiſlature. It would be ſuperfluous to ſpecify inducements to a meaſure in which the character and permanent intereſts of the United States are ſo obviouſly and ſo deeply concerned; and which has received ſo explicit a ſanction from your declaration.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE, AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>I HAVE directed the proper officers to lay before you reſpectively ſuch papers and eſtimates as regard to affairs particularly recommended to your conſideration, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to convey to you that information of the ſtate of the Union, which it is my duty to afford.</p>
                  <p>The welfare of our country is the great object to which our cares and efforts ought to be directed. And I ſhall derive great ſatisfaction from a co-operation with you, in the pleaſing though arduous talk of enſuring to our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens the bleſſings which they have a right to expect, from a free, efficient, and equal government.</p>

The information which we have received, that the meaſures of the laſt ſeſſion have been as ſatisfactory to our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents as we had reaſon to expect from the difficulty of the buſineſs in which we were engaged, will afford us much conſolation and encouragement in reſuming our delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

in the preſent ſeſſion for the public good; and every exertion on our part ſhall be made to reaſize and ſecure to our country thoſe bleſſings which a gracious Providence has placed within her reach. We are perſuaded that one of the moſt eſſential means of preſerving peace, is to be prepared for war, and our attention ſhall be directed to the objects of common defence, and to the adoption of ſuch plans as ſhall appear the moſt likely to prevent our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on other countries for eſſential ſupplies. In the arrangements to be made reſpecting the eſtabliſhment of ſuch troops as may be deemed indiſpenſable, we ſhall with pleaſure provide for the comfortable ſupport of the officers and ſoldiers, with a due regard to economy. We regret that the pacific meaſures adopted by government with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to certain hoſtile tribes of Indians, have not been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the beneficial effects towards the inhabitants of our ſouthern and weſtern frontiers, which we had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope; and we ſhall cheerfully co-operate in provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt effectual means for their protection; and if neceſſary, for the puniſhment of aggreſſors.

Literature and ſcience are eſſential to the preſervation of a free conſtitution; the meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of government ſhould therefore be calculated to ſtrengthen the confidence that is due to that important truth. Agriculture, commerce and manufactures, forming the baſis of the wealth and ſtrength of our confederated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, muſt be the frequent ſubject of our deliberation, and ſhall be advanced by all proper means in our power.

                  <p>IN meeting you again, I feel much ſatisfaction, in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects which continue to diſtinguiſh our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have bleſſed our country with plenty, and with the means of a flouriſhing commerce. The progreſs of public credit is witneſſed by a conſiderable riſe of American ſtock abroad, as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purpoſes have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated. This latter circumſtance is the more pleaſing, as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our reſources, but as it aſſures us of a further increaſe of the national re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability and credit; and, let me add, as it bears an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable teſtimony to the patriotiſm and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens. The punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the former in diſcharging their engagements has been exemplary.</p>
                  <p>In conforming to the powers veſted in me by the acts of the laſt ſeſſion, a loan of 3,000,000 of florins, towards which ſome proviſional meaſures had previouſly taken place, has been completed in Holland. As well the celerity with which it has been filled, as the nature of the terms (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the ſituation of Europe) give a reaſonable hope, that the further execution of thoſe powers may proceed with advantage and ſucceſs. The ſecretary of the treaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury has my directions to communicate ſuch further partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulars as may be requiſite for more preciſe information.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="unknown:031402_0017_0FEF91AC24B30500"/>Since your laſt ſeſſions, I have received communications by which it appears, that the diſtrict of Kentucky, at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent a part of Virginia, has concurred in certain propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a law of that State, in conſequence of which the diſtrict is to become a diſtinct member of the Union; in caſe the requiſite ſanction of Congreſs be added. For this ſanction application is now made. I ſhall cauſe the papers on this very important tranſaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, will be found to do great honour to both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the ſentiments of warm attachment to the Union and its preſent government, expreſſed by our fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Kentucky, cannot fail to add an affectionate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for their particular welfare, to the great national im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions under which you will decide on the caſe ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you.</p>
                  <p>It has been heretofore known to Congreſs, that frequent incurſions have been made on our frontier ſettlements by certain banditti of Indians, from the north-weſt ſide of the Ohio. Theſe, with ſome of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabaſh, have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and, being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes, and aided by ſuch parts (the neighbouring tribes as could be ſeduced to join in their hoſtilities, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them a retreat for their priſoners and plunder, they have, inſtead of liſtening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States, renewed their violences with freſh alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, and ſome of them under circumſtances particularly ſhocking, whilſt others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.</p>
                  <p>Theſe aggravated provocations rendered it eſſential to the ſafety of the weſtern ſettlements, that the aggreſſors ſhould be made ſenſible that the government of the Union is not leſs capable of puniſhing their crimes, than it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to reſpect their rights and reward their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defenſive meaſures, it became neceſſary to put in force the act which empowers THE PRESIDENT to call out the militia for the protection
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031402_0017_0FEF91AC24B30500"/>
of the frontiers: And I have accordingly authoriſed an expedition, in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with ſuch drafts of militia as were deemed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. The event of the meaſure is yet unknown to me. The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the information on which it is founded, as well as an eſtimate of the expenſe with which it will be attended.</p>
                  <p>The diſturbed ſituation of Europe, and particularly the critical poſture of the great maritime powers, whilſt it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and ſecurity enjoyed by the United States, reminds us at the ſame time of the circumſpection with which it becomes us to preſerves theſe bleſſings. It requires alſo, that we ſhould not overlook the tendency of a war, and even of preparations for a war among the nations moſt concerned in active commerce with this country, to abridge the means, and thereby at leaſt enhance the price of tranſporting its valuable productions to proper markets. I recommend it to your ſerious reflections, how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard againſt embarraſſments from theſe contingencies, by ſuch encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture leſs dependent on foreign bottoms, which may fail us in the very moments moſt intereſting to both of theſe great objects. Our fiſheries, and the tranſportation of our own produce, offer us abundant means for guarding ourſelves againſt this evil.</p>
                  <p>Your attention ſeems to be not leſs due to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean. So many circumſtances unite in rendering the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtate of it diſtreſsful to us, that you will not think any deliberations miſemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.</p>
                  <p>The laws you have already paſſed for the eſtabliſhment of a judiciary ſyſtem, have opened the doors of juſtice to all deſcriptions of perſons. You will conſider in your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whether improvements in that ſyſtem may yet be made, and particularly whether an uniform proceſs of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution on ſentences iſſuing from the federal courts, be not deſirable through all the States.</p>

It ſeems expedient to regulate by law the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that juriſdiction and thoſe functions which are permitted them, either by expreſs convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their reſidence. The Conſular Convention too, with his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, has ſtipulated, in certain caſes, the aid of the national au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his conſuls eſtabliſhed here. Some legiſlative proviſion is requiſite to carry theſe ſtipulations into full effect.</p>
                  <p>The eſtabliſhment of the militia, of a mint, of ſtandards of weights and meaſures, of the poſt office and poſt roads, are ſubjects which (I preſume) you will reſume of courſe, and which are abundantly urged by their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>THE ſufficiency of the revenues you have eſtabliſhed for the objects to which they are appropriated, leaves no doubt that the reſiduary proviſions will be commenſurate to the other objects for which the public faith ſtands now pledged. Allow me, moreover, to hope, that it will be a favourite policy with you, not merely to ſecure a payment of the intereſt of the debt funded, but as far and as faſt as the growing reſources of the country will permit, to exon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate it of the principal itſelf. The appropriation you have made of the weſtern lands explains your diſpoſitions on this ſubject, and I am perſuaded the ſooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute, along with other means, to the actual reduction of the public debt, the more ſalutary will the meaſures be to every public intereſt, as well as be more ſatisfactory to our conſtituents.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE, AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>IN peruſing the various and weighty buſineſs of the preſent ſeſſion, I indulge the fulleſt perſuaſion, that your conſultations will be equally marked with wiſdom, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you ſhall have all the co-operation which an

undiminiſhed zeal for its welfare can inſpire. It will be happy for us both, and our beſt reward, if, by a ſucceſsful adminiſtration of our reſpective truſts, we can make the eſtabliſhed government more and more inſtrumental in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the good of our fellow-citizens, and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.</p>

                  <p>WE receive, Sir, with particular ſatisfaction, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications contained in your ſpeech, which confirm to us the progreſſive ſtate of the public credit, and afford at the ſame time a new proof of the ſolidity of the foundation on which it reſts; and we cheerfully join in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is due to the probity and patriotiſm of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile and maritime part of our fellow-citizens, whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened attachment to the principles of government is not leſs conſpicuous in this, than it has been in other import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant reſpects.</p>
                  <p>In confidence that every conſtitutional preliminary has been obſerved, we aſſure you of our diſpoſition to concur in giving the requiſite ſanction to the admiſſion of Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucky, as a diſtinct member of the Union; in doing which, we ſhall anticipate the happy effects to be expected from the ſentiments of attachment towards the Union and its preſent government, which have been expreſſed by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic inhabitants of that diſtrict.</p>
                  <p>While we regret that the continuance and increaſe of the hoſtilities and depredations which have diſtreſſed our north-weſtern frontiers, ſhould have rendered offenſive meaſures neceſſary, we feel an entire confidence in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the motives which have produced them, and in the wiſdom of the diſpoſitions which have been concerted, in purſuance of the powers veſted in you; and whatever may have been the event, we ſhall cheerfully concur in the proviſions, which the expedition that has been undertaken

                  <p>The critical ſituation of the European powers will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a due portion of our attention; and we ſhall be ready to adopt any meaſures which a prudent circumſpection may ſuggeſt, for the preſervation of the bleſſings of peace. The navigation and the fiſheries of the United States, are objects too intereſting not to inſpire a diſpoſition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote them, by all the means which ſhall appear to us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their natural progreſs and permanent proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Impreſſed with the importance of a free intercourſe with the Mediterranean, we ſhall not think any deliberation miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed which may conduce to the adoption of proper meaſures for removing the impediments that obſtruct it.</p>
                  <p>The improvement of the judiciary ſyſtem, and the other important objects to which you have pointed our attention, will not fail to engage the conſideration they reſpectively merit.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>THE Repreſentatives of the people of the United States have taken into conſideration your addreſs to the two Houſes at the opening of the preſent ſeſſion of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>We ſhare in the ſatisfaction inſpired by the proſpects which continue to be ſo auſpicious to our public affairs. The bleſſings reſulting from the ſmiles of Heaven on our agriculture, the riſe of public credit, with the further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages promiſed by it, and the fertility of reſources which are found ſo little burdenſome to the community, fully au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe our mutual congratulations on the preſent occaſion. Nor can we learn without an additional gratification, that the energy of the laws for providing adequate revenues have been ſo honourably ſeconded by thoſe claſſes of citizens whoſe patriotiſm and probity were more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>The ſucceſs of the loan opened in Holland, under the diſadvantages of the preſent moment, is the more import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, as it not only denotes the confidence already placed in the United States, but as the effect of a judicious applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that aid, will ſtill further illuſtrate the ſolidity of the foundation on which the public credit reſts.</p>
                  <p>The preparatory ſteps taken by the State of Virginia in concert with the diſtrict of Kentucky towards the erection of the latter into a diſtinct member of the Union, exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it a liberality mutually honourable to the parties. We ſhall beſtow on this important ſubject the favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration which it merits; and with the national policy which ought to govern our deciſion, ſhall not fail to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the affectionate ſentiments, which are awakened by by thoſe expreſſed in behalf of our fellow-citizens of Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucky.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt we regret the neceſſity which has produced of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive hoſtilities againſt ſome of the Indian tribes north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt of the Ohio, we ſympathize too much with our weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern brethren not to behold with approbation the watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031402_0020_0FEF91B7031BEDD0"/>
and vigour which have been exerted by the executive authority, for their protection; and which, we truſt, will make aggreſſors ſenſible that it is their intereſt to merit by a peaceable behaviour the friendſhip and humanity which the United States are always ready to extend to them.</p>
                  <p>The encouragement of our own navigation, has, at all times, appeared to us highly important. The point of view under which you recommended it to us is ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by the actual ſtate of things in Europe. It will be incumbent on us to conſider in what mode our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and agriculture can be beſt relieved from an injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dependence on the navigation of other nations, which the frequency of their wars renders a too precarious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource for conveying the productions of our country to market.</p>
                  <p>The preſent ſtate of our trade to the Mediterranean, ſeems not leſs to demand, and will accordingly receive, the attention which you have recommended.</p>
                  <p>Having already concurred in eſtabliſhing a judiciary ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, which opens the door of juſtice to all, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of perſons, it will be our diſpoſition to incorporate every improvement which experience may ſuggeſt: and we ſhall conſider in particular, how far the uniformity which in other caſes is found convenient in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the general government through all the States, may be introduced into the forms and rules of executing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences iſſuing from the federal courts.</p>
                  <p>The proper regulation of the juriſdiction and functions which may be exerciſed by conſuls of the United States in foreign countries, with the proviſions ſtipulated to thoſe of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty eſtabliſhed here, are ſubjects of too much conſequence to the public intereſt and honour, not to partake of our deliberations.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall renew our attention to the eſtabliſhment of the militia and the other ſubjects unfiniſhed at the laſt ſeſſion, and ſhall proceed in them with all the diſpatch, which the magnitude of all, and the difficulty of ſome of them, will allow.</p>
                  <p>Nothing has given us more ſatisfaction than to find that the revenues heretofore eſtabliſhed have proved adequate to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031402_0020_0FEF91B7031BEDD0"/>
the purpoſes to which they were allotted. In extending the proviſion to the reſiduary objects, it will be equally our care to ſecure ſufficiency and punctuality in the payments due from the treaſury of the United States. We ſhall alſo never loſe ſight of the policy of diminiſhing the public debt, as faſt as the increaſe of the public reſources will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and are particularly ſenſible of the many conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which preſs a reſort to the auxiliary reſource furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the public lands.</p>
                  <p>In purſuing every branch of the weighty buſineſs of the preſent ſeſſion, it will be our conſtant ſtudy to direct our deliberations to the public welfare. Whatever our ſucceſs may be, we can at leaſt anſwer for the fervent love of our country, which ought to animate our endeavours. In your co-operation, we are ſure of a reſource, which fortifies our hopes, that the fruits of the eſtabliſhed government will juſtify the confidence which has been placed in it, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommend it more and more to the affection and attachment of our fellow-citizens.</p>

                  <p>I MEET you, upon the preſent occaſion, with the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which are naturally inſpired by a ſtrong impreſſion of the proſperous ſituation of our common country, and by a perſuaſion equally ſtrong, that the labours of the ſeſſion, which has juſt commenced, will, under the guidance of the ſpirit, no leſs prudent than patriotic, iſſue in meaſures conducive to the ſtability and increaſe of national proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Numerous as are the providential bleſſings which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our grateful acknowledgments; the abundance with which another year has again rewarded the induſtry of the huſbandman, is too important to eſcape recollection.</p>
                  <p>Your own obſervations, in your reſpective ſituations, will have ſatisfied you of the progreſſive ſtate of agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation: in tracing their cauſes, you will have remarked, with particular pleaſure, the happy effects of that revival of confidence, public as well as private, to which the conſtitution and laws of the United States have ſo eminently contributed; and you will have obſerved, with no leſs intereſt, new and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive proofs of the increaſing reputation and credit of the nation. But you, nevertheleſs, cannot fail to derive ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from the confirmation of theſe circumſtances, which will be diſcloſed in the ſeveral official communications that will be made to you in the courſe of your deliberations.</p>
                  <p>The rapid ſubſcriptions to the Bank of the United States, which completed the ſum allowed to be ſubſcribed in a ſingle day, is among the ſtriking and pleaſing evidences which preſent themſelves, not only of confidence in the government, but of reſource in the community.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:031402_0021_0FEF91B9178CC348"/>In the interval of your receſs, due attention has been paid to the execution of the different objects which were ſpecially provided for by the laws and reſolutions of the laſt ſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Among the moſt important of theſe, is the defence and ſecurity of the Weſtern Frontiers. To accompliſh it on the moſt humane principles, was a primary wiſh.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, at the ſame time that treaties have been proviſionally concluded, and other proper means uſed to attach the wavering, and to confirm in their friendſhip, the well-diſpoſed tribes of Indians—effectual meaſures have been adopted to make thoſe of a hoſtile deſcription ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a pacification was deſired upon terms of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Theſe meaſures having proved unſuceſsful, it became neceſſary to convince the refractory of the power of the United States to puniſh their depredations; offenſive operations have therefore been directed; to be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however, as conſiſtently as poſſible with the dictates of humanity. Some of theſe have been crowned with full ſucceſs, and others are yet depending. The expeditions which have been completed, were carried on under the authority and at the expenſe of the United States, by the militia of Kentucky; whoſe enterpriſe, intrepidity and good conduct are entitled to peculiar commendation.</p>
                  <p>Overtures of peace are ſtill continued to the deluded tribes, and conſiderable numbers of individuals belonging to them have lately renounced all further oppoſition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from their former ſituations, and placed themſelves under the immediate protection of the United States.</p>
                  <p>It is ſincerely to be deſired, that all need of coercion, in future, may ceaſe; and that an intimate intercourſe may ſucceed, calculated to advance the happineſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and to attach them firmly to the United States.</p>
                  <p>In order to this, it ſeems neceſſary—That they ſhould experience the benefits of an impartial diſpenſation of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice—That the mode of alienating their lands, the main ſource of diſcontent and war ſhould be ſo defined and regulated, as to obviate impoſition, and, as far as may be practicable, controverſy, concerning the reality and extent
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031402_0022_0FEF91BAB9372010"/>
of the alienations which are made—That commerce with them ſhould be promoted under regulations tending to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an equitable deportment towards them, and that ſuch rational experiments ſhould be made, for imparting to them the bleſſings of civilization, as may, from time to time, ſuit their condition—That the Executive of the United States ſhould be enabled to employ the means, to which the Indians have been long accuſtomed, for uniting their immediate intereſts with the preſervation of peace—And that efficacious proviſion ſhould be made for inflicting ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate penalties upon all thoſe, who, by violating their rights, ſhall infringe the treaties, and endanger the peace of the Union.</p>
                  <p>A ſyſtem correſponding with the mild principles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and philanthropy towards an unenlightened race of men, whoſe happineſs materially depends on the conduct of the United States, would be as honourable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character, as conformable to the dictates of ſound policy.</p>
                  <p>The powers ſpecially veſted in me by the act, laying certain duties on diſtilled ſpirits, which reſpect the ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the diſtricts into ſurveys, the appointment of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and the aſſignment of compenſations, have likewiſe been carried into effect. In a matter, in which both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials and experience were wanting to guide the calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be readily conceived that there muſt have been difficulty in ſuch an adjuſtment of the rates of compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as would conciliate a reaſonable competency, with a proper regard to the limits preſcribed by the law. It is hoped that the circumſpection which has been uſed will be found in the reſult to have ſecured the laſt of the two objects; but it is probable, that with a view to the firſt, in ſome inſtances a reviſion of the proviſion will be found adviſeable.</p>
                  <p>The impreſſions with which this law has been received by the community, have been, upon the whole, ſuch as were to be expected among enlightened and well-diſpoſed citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, from the propriety and neceſſity of the meaſure. The novelty, however, of the tax, in a conſiderable part of the United States, and a miſconception of ſome of its provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031402_0022_0FEF91BAB9372010"/>
have given occaſion in particular places to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of diſcontent. But it is ſatisfactory to know, that this diſpoſition yields to proper explanations and more juſt apprehenſions of the true nature of the law. And I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a full confidence, that it will, in all, give way to motives which ariſe out of a juſt ſenſe of duty, and a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous regard to the public welfare.</p>
                  <p>If there are any circumſtances, in the law, which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with its main deſign, may be ſo varied as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move any well-intentioned objections that may happen to exiſt, it will conſiſt with a wiſe moderation to make the proper variations. It is deſirable, on all occaſions, to unite with a ſteady and firm adherence to conſtitutional and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary acts of government, the fulleſt evidence of a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as far as may be practicable, to conſult the wiſhes of every part of the community, and to lay the foundations of the public adminiſtration in the affections of the people.</p>
                  <p>Purſuant to the authority contained in the ſeveral acts on that ſubject, a diſtrict of ten miles ſquare, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent ſeat of the government of the United States, has been fixed, and announced by proclamation; which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict will comprehend lands on both ſides of the river Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towmac, and the towns of Alexandria and Georgetown. A city has alſo been laid out agreeably to a plan which will be placed before Congreſs; and as there is a proſpect favoured by the rate of ſales which have already taken place, of ample funds for carrying on the neceſſary build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there is every expectation of their due progreſs.</p>
                  <p>The completion of the cenſus of the inhabitants, for which proviſion was made by a law, has been duly notifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (excepting in one inſtance, in which the return has been informal; and another, in which it has been omitted or miſcarried) and the returns of the officers who were charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this duty, which will be laid before you, will give you the pleaſing aſſurance, that the preſent population of the United States borders on four millions of perſons.</p>
                  <p>It is proper alſo to inform you, that a further loan of two millions and an half of florins has been completed in Holland; the terms of which are ſimilar to thoſe of the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031402_0023_0FEF91C0D315A2A8"/>
one laſt announced, except as to a ſmall reduction of charges. Another, on like terms, for ſix millions of flor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, had been ſet on foot, under circumſtances that aſſured immediate completion.</p>

                  <p>IN entering upon the diſcharge of your Legiſlative truſt, you muſt anticipate with pleaſure, that many of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, neceſſarily incident to the firſt arrangement of a new government, for an extenſive country, have been happily ſurmounted by the zealous and judicious exertions of your predeceſſors in co-operation with the other branch of the Legiſlature. The important objects which remain to be accompliſhed, will, I am perſuaded, be conducted upon principles equally comprehenſive, and equally well calculated for the advancement of the general weal.</p>
                  <p>The time limited for receiving ſubſcriptions to the loans propoſed by the act making proviſion for the debt of the United States, having expired, ſtatements from the proper department, will, as ſoon as poſſible, apprize you of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act reſult. Enough, however, is already known to afford an aſſurance that the views of that act have been ſubſtantially fulfilled. The ſubſcription in the domeſtic debt of the United States, has embraced by far the greateſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that debt; affording at the ſame time, proof of the general ſatisfaction of the public creditors with the ſyſtem which has been propoſed to their acceptance, and of the ſpirit of accommodation to the convenience of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment with which they are actuated. The ſubſcriptions in the debts of the reſpective ſtates, as far as the proviſions of the law have permitted, may be ſaid to be yet more general. The part of the debt of the United States which remains unſubſcribed, will naturally engage your further deliberations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:031402_0023_0FEF91C0D315A2A8"/>It is particularly pleaſing to me to be able to announce to you, that the revenues which have been eſtabliſhed, promiſe to be adequate to their objects, and may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, if no unforeſeen exigency occurs, to ſuperſede, for the preſent, the neceſſity of any new burthens upon our conſtituents.</p>
                  <p>An object which will claim your early attention, is a proviſion for the current ſervice of the enſuing year, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſuch aſcertained demands upon the treaſury as require to be immediately diſcharged, and ſuch caſualties as may have ariſen in the execution of the public buſineſs, for which no ſpecific appropriation may have yet been made; of all which, a proper eſtimate will be laid before you.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE, AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>I SHALL content myſelf with a general reference to former communications for ſeveral objects, upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto poſtponed any defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itive reſolution. Their importance will recal them to your attention; and I truſt that the progreſs already made in the moſt arduous arrangements of the government will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you leiſure to reſume them with advantage.</p>
                  <p>There are, however, ſome of them of which I cannot forbear a more particular mention; theſe are, the Militia —The Poſt-Office and Poſt-Roads—The Mint—Weights and Meaſures—a Proviſion for the Sale of the Vacant Lands of the United States.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is certainly an object of primary importance, whether viewed in reference to the national ſecurity, to the ſatisfaction of the community, or the preſervation of order. In connexion with this, the eſtabliſhment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent magazines and arſenals, and the fortification of ſuch places as are peculiarly important and vulnerable, naturally preſent themſelves to conſideration. The ſafety of the United States, under divine protection, ought to reſt on the baſis of ſyſtematic and ſolid arrangement; expoſed as little as poſſible to the hazards of fortuitous circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>The importance of the Poſt-Office and Poſt Roads, on a plan ſufficiently liberal and comprehenſive, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031402_0024_0FEF91C48EEDB378"/>
the expedition, ſafety and facility of communication, is increaſed by the inſtrumentality in diffuſing a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the government; which, while it contributes to the ſecurity of the people, ſerves alſo to guard them againſt the effects of miſrepreſentation and miſconception. The eſtabliſhment of additional croſs poſts, eſpecially to ſome of the important points in the weſtern and northern parts of the Union, cannot fail to be of material utility.</p>
                  <p>The diſorders in the exiſting currency, and eſpecially the ſcarcity of ſmall change, a ſcarcity ſo peculiarly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing to the poorer claſſes, ſtrongly recommend the carrying into immediate effect the reſolution already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into concerning the eſtabliſhment of a Mint. Meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures have been taken purſuant to that reſolution for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing ſome of the moſt neceſſary articles, together with the requiſite apparatus.</p>
                  <p>An uniformity in the weights and meaſures of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is among the important objects ſubmitted to you by the Conſtitution, and if it can be derived from a ſtandard at once invariable and univerſal, muſt be no leſs honourable to the public councils than conducive to the public conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience.</p>
                  <p>A proviſion for the ſale of the vacant lands of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, is particularly urged, among other reaſons, by the important conſiderations—that they are pledged as a fund for reimburſing the public debt;—that if timely and judiciouſly applied, they may ſave the neceſſity of burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our citizens with new taxes for the extinguiſhment of the principal; and that being free to diſcharge the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, but in a limited proportion, no opportunity ought to be loſt for availing the public of its rights.</p>

                  <p>THE Senate of the United States have received with much ſatisfaction the aſſurance of public proſperity contained in your ſpeech to both Houſes. The multiplied bleſſings of Providence have not eſcaped our notice, or failed to excite our gratitude.</p>
                  <p>The benefits which flow from the reſtoration of public and private confidence, are conſpicuous and important; and the pleaſure with which we contemplate them is heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by your aſſurance of thoſe farther communications, which ſhall confirm their exiſtence, and indicate their ſource.</p>
                  <p>While we rejoice in the ſucceſs of thoſe military opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been directed againſt the hoſtile Indians, we lament with you the neceſſity that has produced them; and we participate the hope that the preſent proſpect of a general peace, on terms of moderation and juſtice, may be brought into complete and permanent effect; and that the meaſures of government, for the ſecurity of our frontiers, may equally embrace the general intereſts of humanity. Our ſolicitude to obtain, will enſure our zealous attention to an object ſo warmly eſpouſed by the dictates of benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and ſo highly intereſting to the honour and welfare of the nation.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral ſubjects which you have particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and thoſe which remain of former ſeſſions, will engage our early conſideration. We are encouraged to preſecute them with alacrity and ſteadineſs, by the belief, that they will intereſt no paſſion but that for the general welfare, by the aſſurance of concert, and by a view of thoſe arduous and important arrangements which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>We obſerve, Sir, the conſtancy and activity of your zeal for the public good. The example will animate our ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to promote the happineſs of our country.</p>

                  <p>IN receiving your addreſs at the opening of the preſent ſeſſion, the Houſe of Repreſentatives have taken an ample ſhare in the feelings inſpired by the actual proſperity and flattering proſpects of our country; and whilſt, with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming gratitude to Heaven, we aſcribe this happineſs to the true ſource from which it flows, we behold with ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating pleaſure, the degree in which the conſtitution and laws of the United States have been inſtrumental in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing it.</p>
                  <p>It yields us particular ſatisfaction to learn the ſucceſs with which the different important meaſures of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment have proceeded; as well thoſe ſpecially provided for at the laſt ſeſſion, as thoſe of preceding date.</p>
                  <p>The ſafety of our Weſtern Frontiers, in which the lives and repoſe of ſo many of our fellow-citizens are involved,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031402_0025_0FEF91C6268C2618"/>
being peculiarly intereſting, your communications on that ſubject are proportionably grateful to us.</p>
                  <p>The gallantry and good conduct of the militia, whoſe ſervices were called for, is an honourable confirmation of the efficacy of that precious reſource of a free ſtate; and we anxiouſly wiſh, that the conſequences of their ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enterprizes, and of the other proceedings to which you have referred, may leave the United States free to purſue the moſt benevolent policy towards the unhappy and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded race of people in our neighbourhood.</p>
                  <p>The amount of the population of the United States, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the returns of the cenſus, is a ſource of the moſt pleaſing reflections, whether it be viewed in relation to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſafety and reſpectabllity, or as a proof of that felicity in the ſituation of our country, which favours ſo unexampled a rapidity in its growth: nor ought any to be inſenſible to the additional motives ſuggeſted by this important fact, to perpetuate the free government eſtabliſhed, with a wiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it, to a portion of the earth which promiſes ſuch an increaſe of the number which is to enjoy theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings within the limits of the United States.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall proceed, with all the reſpect due to your pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotic recommendations, and with a deep ſenſe of the truſt committed to us by our fellow-citizens, to take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the various and important matters falling within the preſent ſeſſion.

                  <p>IT is ſome abatement of the ſatisfaction, with which I meet you on the preſent occaſion, that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national proſperity, generally, I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hoſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, which have, for ſome time paſt diſtreſſed our north<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> weſtern frontier, have terminated.</p>
                  <p>You will, I am perſuaded learn, with no leſs concern than I communicate it, that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto iſſued only in new and outrageous proofs of perſevering hoſtility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in conteſt. An earneſt deſire to procure tranquillity to the frontiers—to ſtop the further effuſion of blood—to arreſt the progreſs of expenſe—to forward the prevalent wiſh of the nation, for peace, has led to ſtrenuous efforts, through various chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, to accompliſh theſe deſirable purpoſes; in making which efforts, I conſulted leſs my own anticipations of the event, or the ſcruples which ſome conſiderations were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to inſpire, than the wiſh to find the object attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; or if not attainable, to aſcertain, unequivocally, that ſuch is the caſe.</p>
                  <p>A detail of the meaſures which have been purſued, and of their conſequences, which will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you the want of ſucceſs, thus far, will, I truſt, evince that means, as proper and as efficacious as could have been deviſed, have been employed. The iſſue of ſome of them, indeed, is ſtill depending; but a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one, though not to be deſpaired of, is not promiſed by any thing that has yet happened.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="unknown:031402_0027_0FEF91CB70248A08"/>In the courſe of the attempts which have been made, ſome valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public ſervice. A ſanction commonly reſpected, even among ſavages, has been found, in this inſtance, inſufficient to protect from maſſacre, the emiſſaries of peace; it will, I preſume, be duly conſidered, whether the occaſion does not call for an exerciſe of liberality towards the families of the deceaſed.</p>
                  <p>It muſt add to your concern, to be informed that beſides the continuation of hoſtile appearances, among the tribes north of the Ohio, ſome threatening ſymptoms have of late been revived among ſome of thoſe ſouth of it.</p>
                  <p>A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amagas, inhabiting five villages on the Tenneſſee river, have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring ſettlements.</p>
                  <p>It was hoped that the treaty of <hi>Holſton,</hi> made with the Cherokee nation, in July, 1791, would have prevented a repetition of ſuch depredations. But the event has not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered this hope The Chickamagas, aided by ſome banditti of another tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hoſtilities upon the citizens of the United States, in that quarter. The information which has been received on this ſubject will be laid before you. Hitherto defenſive precautions, only have been ſtrictly enjoined and obſerved.</p>
                  <p>It is not underſtood that any breach of treaty, or aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever, on the part of the United States, or their citizens, is even alleged as a pretext for the ſpirit of hoſtility in this quarter.</p>
                  <p>I have reaſon to believe, that every practicable exertion has been made, (purſuant to the proviſion by law for that purpoſe) to be prepared for the alternative of a proſecution of the war, in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops, authorized to be raiſed, have been recruited, though the number is ſtill incomplete; and pains have been taken to diſcipline, and put them in condition for the particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ind of ſervice to be performed. A delay of operations (beſides being dictated by the meaſures which were purſuing towards a pacific termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031402_0027_0FEF91CB70248A08"/>
of the war) has been in itſelf deemed preferable to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature efforts. A ſtatement, from the proper department, with regard to the number of troops raiſed, and ſome other points which have been ſuggeſted, will afford more preciſe information, as a guide to the legiſlative conſultations; and among other things, will enable Congreſs to judge whether ſome additional ſtimulus to the recruiting ſervice may not be adviſeable.</p>
                  <p>In looking forward to the future expenſe of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may be found inevitable, I derive conſolation from the information I receive, that the product of the revenues for the preſent year, is likely to ſupercede the neceſſity of additional burthens on the community, for the ſervice of the enſuing year. This, however, will be better aſcertained in the courſe of the ſeſſion; and it is proper to add, that the information alluded to proceeds from the ſuppoſition of no material extenſion of the ſpirit of hoſtilities.</p>
                  <p>I cannot diſmiſs the ſubject of Indian affairs, without again recommending to your conſideration the expediency of more adequate proviſion for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for reſtraining the commiſſion of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans muſt prove nugatory To enable, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent rewards, the employment of qualified and truſty perſons to reſide among them, as agents, would alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the preſervation of peace and good neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. If in addition to theſe expedients, an eligible plan could be deviſed for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes, and for carrying on trade with them upon a ſcale equal to their wants, and under regulations calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to protect them from impoſition and extortion, its influence in cementing their intereſts with ours could not but be conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>The proſperous ſtate of our revenue has been intimated. This would be ſtill more the caſe, were it not for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments which in ſome places continue to embarraſs the collection of the duties on ſpirits, diſtilled within the United States. Theſe impediments have leſſened, and are leſſening in local extent; and, as applied to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031402_0028_0FEF91D366664AB0"/>
at large, the contentment with the law appears to be progreſſive.</p>
                  <p>But ſymptoms of increaſed oppoſition having lately manifeſted themſelves in certain quarters, I judged ſpecial interpoſition on my part, proper and adviſeable; and under this impreſſion have iſſued a Proclamation, warning againſt all unlawful combinations and proceedings, having for their object, or tending to obſtruct the operation of the law in queſtion, and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be ſtrictly put in execution, for bringing to juſtice the infractors thereof, and ſecuring obedience thereto.</p>
                  <p>Meaſures have alſo been taken for the proſecution of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders. And Congreſs may be aſſured, that nothing within conſtitutional and legal limits, which may depend on me, ſhall be wanting to aſſert and maintain the juſt authority of the laws. In fulfilling this truſt, I ſhall count entirely upon the full co-operation of the other departments of the government, and upon the zealous ſupport of all good citizens.</p>
                  <p>I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legiſlature, the ſubject of a reviſion of the judiciary ſyſtem. A repreſentation from the Judges of the Supreme Court, which will be laid before you, points out ſome of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences that are experienced. In the courſe of the execution of the laws, conſiderations riſe out of the ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that ſyſtem, which in ſome caſes tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this ſubject, proviſions to facilitate the taking of bail upon proceſſes out of the courts of the United States, and ſupplementary definition of offences againſt the conſtitution and laws of the Union, and of the puniſhment for ſuch offences, will, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, be found worthy of particular attention.</p>
                  <p>Obſervations on the value of peace with other nations are unneceſſary. It would be wiſe, however, by timely proviſions, to guard againſt thoſe acts of our own citizens, which might tend to diſturb it, and to put ourſelves in a condition to give that ſatisfaction to foreign nations, which we may ſometimes have occaſion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your conſideration the means of preventing thoſe aggreſſions by our citizens on the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031402_0028_0FEF91D366664AB0"/>
of other nations, and other infractions of the law of nations, which furniſhes juſt ſubject of complaint, and might endanger our peace with them. And, in general, the maintenance of a friendly intercourſe with foreign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will be preſented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpoſe, which takes place, if not renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the cloſe of the preſent ſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>In execution of the authority given by the legiſlature, meaſures have been taken for engaging ſome artiſts from abroad to aid in the eſtabliſhment of our mint: others have been employed at home. Proviſion has been made of the requiſite buildings, and theſe are now putting into prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er condition for the purpoſes of the eſtabliſhment. There has alſo been a ſmall beginning in the coinage of half dimes; the want of ſmall coins in circulation calling the firſt attention to them.</p>
                  <p>The regulation of foreign coins, in correſpondency with the principles of our national coinage, as being eſſential to their due operation, and to order in our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be reſumed and completed.</p>
                  <p>It is repreſented that ſome proviſions in the law, which eſtabliſhes the poſt-office, operate, in experiment, againſt the tranſmiſſion of newſpapers, to diſtant parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Should this, upon due inquiry, be found to be the fact, a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information, will, I doubt not, lead to the application of a remedy.</p>
                  <p>The adoption of a conſtitution for the State of <hi>Kentucky,</hi> has been notified to me. The legiſlature will ſhare with me in the ſatisfaction which ariſes from an event, intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the happineſs of the part of the nation to which it relates, and conducive to the general order.</p>
                  <p>It is proper likewiſe to inform you, that ſince my laſt communication on the ſubject, and in further execution of the acts, ſeverally making proviſion for the public debt, and for the reduction thereof, three new loans have been effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, each for three millions of florins; one at Antwerp, at the annual intereſt of four and one half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charges; and the other two at Amſterdam, at the annual intereſt of four
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031402_0029_0FEF91D4EFEAB558"/>
per cent. with an allowance of five and one half per cent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in one caſe, and of five per cent. in the other, in lieu of all charges. The rates of theſe loans, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances under which they have been made, are confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the high ſtate of our credit abroad.</p>
                  <p>Among the objects to which theſe funds have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to be applied, the payment of the debts due to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain foreign officers, according to the proviſion made du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt ſeſſion, has been embraced.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>I ENTERTAIN a ſtrong hope, that the ſtate of the national finances is now ſufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a ſyſtematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and diſcharge of the public debt, according to the right which has been reſerved to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. No meaſure can be more deſirable, whether view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an eye to its intrinſic importance, or to the general ſentiment and wiſh of the nation.</p>
                  <p>Proviſion is likewiſe requiſite for the reimburſement of the loan which has been made for the Bank of the United States, purſuant to the eleventh ſection of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public ſtipulations in this particular, it is expected a valuable ſaving will be made.</p>
                  <p>Appropriations for the current ſervice of the enſuing year, and for ſuch extraordinaries as may require proviſion, will demand, and I doubt not will engage your early at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE, AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>I CONTENT myſelf with recalling your attention, generally, to ſuch objects, not particularized in my preſent, as have been ſuggeſted in my former communications to you.</p>
                  <p>Various temporary laws will expire during the preſent ſeſſion. Among theſe, that which regulates trade and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the Indian tribes, will merit particular notice.</p>
                  <p>The reſults of your common deliberations hitherto, will, I truſt, be productive of ſolid and durable advantages to our conſtituents; ſuch as, by conciliating more and more
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031402_0029_0FEF91D4EFEAB558"/>
their ultimate ſuffrage, will tend to ſtrengthen and confirm their attachment to that conſtitution of government, upon which, under Divine Providence, materially depend their union, their ſafety, and their happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Still further to promote and ſecure theſe ineſtimable ends, there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency, than the careful cultivation of harmony, combined with a due regard to ſtability in the public councils.</p>

                  <p>ACCEPT, Sir, our grateful acknowledgments for your addreſs at the opening of the preſent ſeſſion. We participate with you in the ſatisfaction ariſing from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the general proſperity of the nation; but it is not without the moſt ſincere concern that we are informed, that the reiterated efforts which have been made to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh peace with the hoſtile Indians have hitherto failed to accompliſh that deſired effect. Hoping that the meaſures ſtill depending may prove more ſucceſsful than thoſe which have preceded them, we ſhall nevertheleſs concur in every neceſſary preparation for the alternative; and, ſhould the Indians on either ſide of the Ohio perſiſt in their hoſtilities, fidelity to the Union, as well as affection for our fellow-cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens on the frontiers, will enſure our decided co-operation in every meaſure, which ſhall be deemed requiſite for their protection and ſafety.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>THE Houſe of Repreſentatives, who always feel ſatisfaction in meeting you, are much concerned that the occaſion for mutual felicitation, afforded by circumſtances favourable to the national proſperity, ſhould be abated by a continuance of the hoſtile ſpirit of many of the Indian tribes; and particularly, that the reiterated efforts for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting a general pacification with them, ſhould have iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in new proofs of their perſevering enmity, and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ſacrifice of citizens who, as the meſſengers of peace, were diſtinguiſhing themſelves by their zeal for the public ſervice. In our deliberations on this important depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our affairs, we ſhall be diſpoſed to purſue every meaſure that may be dictated by the ſincereſt deſire on one hand, of cultivating peace, and manifeſting, by every prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable regulation, our benevolent regard for the welfare of thoſe miſguided people; and by the duty we feel, on the other, to provide effectually for the ſafety and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our fellow-citizens.</p>
                  <p>While with regret we learn, that ſymptoms of oppoſition to the law impoſing duties on ſpirits diſtilled within the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, have manifeſted themſelves, we reflect, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, that they are confined to a ſmall portion of our fellow-citizens. It is not more eſſential to the preſervation of true liberty, that a government ſhould be always ready to liſten to the repreſentations of its conſtituents, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate its meaſures to the ſentiments and wiſhes of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of them, as far as will conſiſt with the good of the whole, than it is, that the juſt authority of the laws ſhould be ſtedfaſtly maintained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:031402_0031_0FEF91D9AC1A2558"/>Under this impreſſion, every department of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all good citizens, muſt approve the meaſures you have taken, and the purpoſe you have formed, to execute this part of your truſt with firmneſs and energy; and be aſſured, Sir, of every conſtitutional aid and co-operation which may become requiſite on our part. And we hope, that while the progreſs of contentment under the law in queſtion, is as obvious as it is rational, no particular part of the community may be permitted to withdraw from the general burthens of the country, by a conduct as irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable to national juſtice, as it is inconſiſtent with public decency.</p>
                  <p>The productive ſtate of the public revenue, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the credit of the United States abroad, evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the loans at <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations the more gratifying, as they enforce the obligation to enter on ſyſtematic and effectual arrangements for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the public debt, as far as the conditions of it will permit. And we take pleaſure in the opportunity to aſſure you of our entire concurrence in the opinion, that no meaſure can be more deſireable, whether viewed with an eye to the urgent wiſh of the community, or the intrinſic importance of promoting ſo happy a change in our ſituation.</p>
                  <p>The adoption of a conſtitution for the State of <hi>Kentucky,</hi> is an event in which we join in all the ſatisfaction you have expreſſed. It may be conſidered as particularly intereſting, ſince, beſides the immediate benefits reſulting from it, it is another auſpicious demonſtration of the facility and ſucceſs with which an enlightened people are capable of providing, by free and deliberate plans of government, for their own ſafety and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>The operation of the law eſtabliſhing the Poſt-Office, as it relates to the tranſmiſſion of newſpapers, will merit our particular inquiry and attention; the circulation of polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical intelligence, through theſe vehicles, being juſtly reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned among the ſureſt means of preventing the degeneracy of a free government, as well as of recommending every ſalutary public meaſure, to the confidence and co-operation of all virtuous citizens.</p>

                     <pb n="61" facs="unknown:031402_0031_0FEF91D9AC1A2558"/>The ſeveral other matters which you have communicated and recommended, will in their order receive the attention due to them; and our diſcuſſion will, in all caſes, we truſt, be guided by a proper reſpect for harmony and ſtability in the public councils, and a deſire to conciliate more and more, the attachment of our conſtituents to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by meaſures accommodated to the true ends for which it was eſtabliſhed.</p>

                  <p>SINCE the commencement of the term, for which I have been again called into office, no ſit occaſion has ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for expreſſing to my fellow-citizens at large, the deep and reſpectful ſenſe, which I feel, of the renewed teſtimony of public approbation. While on the one hand, it awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened my gratitude for all thoſe inſtances of affectionate partiality, with which I have been honoured by my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; on the other, it could not prevent an earneſt wiſh for that retirement, from which no private conſideration ſhould ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief, that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct would be eſtimated according to its real motives; and that the people, and the authorities derived from them, would ſupport exertions, having nothing perſonal for their object, I have obeyed the ſuffrage which commanded me to reſume the executive power; and I humbly implore that Being, on whoſe will the fate of nations depends, to crown with ſucceſs our mutual endeavours for the general hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the war in Europe had embraced thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with whom the United States have the moſt extenſive relation; there was reaſon to apprehend that our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them might be interrupted, and our diſpoſition for peace, drawn into queſtion, by the ſuſpicions, too often entertained by belligerent nations. It ſeemed therefore to be my duty, to admoniſh our citizens of the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a contraband trade, and of hoſtile acts to any of the parties; and to obtain, by a declaration of the exiſting le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſtate of things, an eaſier admiſſion of our rights to the immunities, belonging to our ſituation. Under theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031402_0032_0FEF91DD59DC4128"/>
the proclamation, which will be laid before you, was iſſued.</p>
                  <p>In this poſture of affairs, both new and delicate, I reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adopt general rules which ſhould conform to the treaties, and aſſert the privileges of the United States. Theſe were reduced into a ſyſtem, which will be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to you. Although I have not thought myſelf at liberty to forbid the ſale of the prizes, permitted by our treaty of commerce with France to be brought into our ports; I have not refuſed to cauſe them to be reſtored, when they were taken within the protection of our territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; or by veſſels commiſſioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the United States.</p>
                  <p>It reſts with the wiſdom of Congreſs to correct, improve or enforce this plan of procedure, and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code, and the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Courts of the United States, to many caſes which, though dependent on principles already recognized, demand ſome further proviſions.</p>
                  <p>When individuals ſhall, within the United States, array themſelves in hoſtility againſt any of the powers at war; or enter upon military expeditions, or enterprizes within the juriſdiction of the United States; or uſurp and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe judicial authority within the United States; or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indiſtinctly marked, or are inadequate; theſe offences cannot receive too early and cloſe an attention, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire prompt and deciſive remedies.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever thoſe remedies may be, they will be well adminiſtered by the Judiciary, who poſſeſs a long eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſe of inveſtigation, effectual proceſs, and officers in the habit of executing it. In like manner, as ſeveral of the courts have <hi>doubted,</hi> under particular circumſtances, their power to liberate the veſſels of a nation at peace, and even of a citizen of the United States, although ſeized under a falſe colour of being hoſtile property; and have <hi>denied</hi> their power to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory; it would ſeem proper to regulate their juriſdiction in theſe points. But if the Executive is to be the reſort in either of the two laſt mentioned caſes, it is
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031402_0033_0FEF91E0B9C8C538"/>
hoped, that he will be authorized by law, to have facts aſcertained by the courts, when, for his own information, he ſhall requeſt it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot recommend to your notice meaſures for the fulfilment of <hi>our</hi> duties to the reſt of the world, without again preſſing upon you the neceſſity of placing ourſelves in a condition of complete defence, and of exacting from <hi>them</hi> the fulfilment of <hi>their</hi> duties towards <hi>us.</hi> The United States ought not to indulge a perſuaſion, that, contrary to the order of human events, they will forever keep at a diſtance thoſe painful appeals to arms with which the hiſtory of every other nation abounds. There is a rank due to the United States among nations; which will be withheld, if not abſolutely loſt, by the reputation of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If we deſire to avoid inſult, we muſt be able to repel it; if we deſire to ſecure peace, one of the moſt powerful inſtruments of our riſing proſperity, it muſt be known, that we are at all times ready for war.</p>
                  <p>The documents which will be preſented to you, will ſhew the amount, and kinds of arms and military ſtores now in our magazines and arſenals; and yet an addition even to theſe ſupplies cannot with prudence be neglected; as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger. Not can ſuch arrangements, with ſuch objects, be expoſed to the cenſure or jealouſy of the warmeſt friends of republican government. They are incapable of abuſe in the hands of the militia, who ought to poſſeſs a pride in being the depoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itory of the force of the Republic, and may be trained to a degree of energy, equal to every military exigency of the United States. But it is an inquiry, which cannot be too ſolemnly purſued, whether the act, "more effectually to provide for the national defence by eſtabliſhing an uniform militia throughout the United States," has organized them ſo as to produce their full effect; whether your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the ſeveral States has not detected ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in the ſcheme; and whether a material feature in an improvement of it, ought not to be to afford an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the ſtudy of thoſe branches of the military art, which can ſcarcely ever be attained by practice alone?</p>
                  <p>

The occurrences which relate to it, and have paſſed under the knowledge of the Executive, will be exhibited to Congreſs in a ſubſequent communication.</p>
                  <p>When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmed that every reaſonable effort has been made to adjuſt the cauſes of diſſenſion with the Indians, north of the Ohio. The inſtructions given to the commiſſioners evince a moderation and equity, proceeding from a ſincere love of peace, and a liberality having no reſtriction but the eſſential intereſts and dignity of the United States. The attempt, however, of an amicable negociation having been fruſtrated, the troops have marched to act offenſively. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the propoſed treaty did not arreſt the progreſs of military preparation, it is doubtful, how, far the advance of the ſeaſon, before good faith juſtified active movements, may retard them, during the remainder of the year. From the papers and intelligence which relate to this important ſubject, you will determine, whether the deficiency in the number of troops, granted by law, ſhall be compenſated by ſuccours of militia; or additional encouragements ſhall be propoſed to recruits. An anxiety has been alſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the Executive, for peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn and with cloathing, and offenſive meaſures againſt them prohibited, during the receſs of Congreſs. To ſatisfy the complaints of the latter, proſecutions have been inſtituted for the violences committed upon them. But the papers, which will be delivered to you, diſcloſe the critical foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on which we ſtand in regard to both thoſe tribes, and it is with Congreſs to pronounce what ſhall be done.</p>
                  <p>After they ſhall have provided for the preſent emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, it will merit their moſt ferious labours, to render tranquillity with the ſavages, permanent, by creating ties of intereſt. Next to a rigorous execution of juſtice on the violators of peace, the eſtabliſhment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States, is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion, with conſtant
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031402_0034_0FEF91E4538C6500"/>
and plentiful ſupplies, with a ready market for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the Indians, and a ſtated price for what they give in payment, and receive in exchange. Individuals will not purſue ſuch a traffic, unleſs they be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to be reimburſed only. Should this recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion accord with the opinion of Congreſs, they will recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that it cannot be accompliſhed by any means yet in the hands of the Executive.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>THE commiſſioners, charged with the ſettlement of accounts between the United and individual States, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded their important functions, within the time limited by law; and the balances, ſtruck in their report, which will be laid before Congreſs, have been placed on the books of the treaſury.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt day of June laſt, an inſtallment of one mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of florins became payable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjuſted by a prolongation of the period of reimburſement, in the nature of a new loan, at intereſt at five per cent, for the term of ten years; and the expenſes of this operation were a commiſſion of three per cent.</p>
                  <p>The firſt inſtallment of the loan of two millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars from the bank of the United States, has been paid, as was directed by law. For the ſecond, it is neceſſary that proviſion ſhould be made.</p>
                  <p>No pecuniary conſideration is more urgent, than the regular redemption and diſcharge of the public debt; on none, can delay be more injurious, or an economy of time more valuable.</p>
                  <p>The productiveneſs of the public revenues hitherto, has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it; but it is not expected to prove commenſurate with all the objects which have been ſuggeſted. Some auxiliary proviſions will, therefore, it is preſumed, be requiſite; and it is hoped that theſe may be made, conſiſtently with a due regard to the convenience of our citizens, who cannot but
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031402_0034_0FEF91E4538C6500"/>
be ſenſible of the true wiſdom of encountering a ſmall preſent addition to their contribution, to obviate a future accumulation of burdens.</p>
                  <p>But here I cannot forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the tranſportation of public prints. There is no reſource ſo firm for the government of the United States, as the affections of the people, guided by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened policy; and to this primary good, nothing can produce more, than a faithful repreſentation of public proceedings, diffuſed without reſtraint, throughout the United States.</p>
                  <p>An eſtimate of the appropriations, neceſſary for the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſervice of the enſuing year, and a ſtatement of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of arms and military ſtores, made during the receſs, will be preſented to Congreſs.</p>

                  <p>THE ſeveral ſubjects, to which I have now referred, open a wide range to your deliberations; and involve ſome of the choiceſt intereſts of our common country. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your taſk. Without an unprejudiced coolneſs, the welfare of the government may be hazarded; without harmony, as far as conſiſts with freedom of ſentiment, its dignity may be loſt. But as the legiſlative proceedings of the United States will never, I truſt, be reproached for the want of temper or of candour; ſo ſhall not the public happineſs languiſh, from the want of my ſtrenuous and warmeſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operations.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031402_0035_0FEF91E5D7B27F70"/>
conſider it as an event every way propitious to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our country; and your compliance with the call, as a freſh inſtance of the patriotiſm which has ſo repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led you to ſacrifice private inclination to the public good. In the unanimity which a ſecond time marks this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant national act, we trace with particular ſatisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the diſtinguiſhed tribute paid to the virtues and abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities which it recognizes, another proof of that juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and conſtancy of ſentiments and views, which have hitherto characterized the citizens of the United States.</p>
                  <p>As the European powers with whom the United States have the moſt extenſive relations, were involved in war, in which we had taken no part—it ſeemed neceſſary that the diſpoſition of the nation for peace, ſhould be promulgated to the world, as well for the purpoſe of admoniſhing our citizens of the conſequences of a contraband trade, and of acts hoſtile to any of the belligerent parties, as to obtain, by a declaration of the exiſting legal ſtate of things, an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier admiſſion of our right to the immunities of our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we therefore contemplate with pleaſure, the Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamation by you iſſued, and give it our hearty approbation.

                  </opener>
                  <p>THE Repreſentatives of the people of the United States, in meeting you for the firſt time ſince you have been again called by an unanimous ſuffrage to your preſent ſtation, find an occaſion which they embrace with no leſs ſincerity than promptitude, for expreſſing to you their congratulations on ſo diſtinguiſhed a teſtimony of public approbation, and their entire confidence in the purity and patriotiſm of the motives which have produced this obedience to the voice of your country. It is to virtues which have commanded long and univerſal reverence, and ſervices from which have flowed great and laſting benefits, that the tribute of praiſe may be paid without the reproach of flattery; and it is from the ſame ſources that the faireſt anticipations may be derived in favour of the public happineſs.</p>
                  <p>The United States having taken no part in the war which has embraced in Europe the power with whom they have the moſt extenſive relations, the maintenance of peace was juſtly to be regarded as one of the moſt important du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Magiſtrate charged with the faithful execution of the laws. We accordingly witneſs with approbation and pleaſure the vigilance with which you have guarded againſt an interruption of that bleſſing, by your Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:031402_0036_0FEF91E98FEB0AF0"/>
admoniſhing our citizens of the conſequences of illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit or hoſtile acts towards the belligerent parties; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting, by a declaration of the exiſting legal ſtate of things, an eaſier admiſſion of our right to the immunities belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſituation.</p>
                  <p>The connexion of the United States with Europe has evidently become extremely intereſting. The communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which remain to be exhibited to us, will, no doubt, aſſiſt in giving us a fuller view of the ſubject, and in guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our deliberations to ſuch reſults as may comport with the rights and true intereſts of our country.</p>
                  <p>We learn with deep regret that the meaſures dictated by a love of peace for obtaining an amicable termination of the afflicting war on our frontier ſhould have been fruſtrated, and that a reſort to offenſive meaſures ſhould have again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary. As the latter, however, muſt be rendered more ſatisfactory in proportion to the ſolicitude for peace manifeſted by the former, it is to be hoped, they will be purſued under the better auſpices on that account, and be finally crowned with more happy ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>In relation to the particular tribes of Indians, againſt whom offenſive meaſures have been prohibited, as well as on all the other important ſubjects which you have preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our view, we ſhall beſtow the attention which they claim. We cannot, however, refrain at this time, from particularly expreſſing our concurrence in your anxiety for the regular diſcharge of the public debts, as faſt as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and events will permit; and in the policy of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any impediments that may be found in the way of a faithful repreſentation of public proceedings throughout the United States, being perſuaded with you, that on no ſubject more than the former, can delay be more injurious, or an economy of time more valuable, and that with reſpect to the latter, no reſource is ſo firm for the government of the United States, as the affections of the people, guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an enlightened policy.</p>
                  <p>Throughout our deliberations we ſhall endeavour to cheriſh every ſentiment which may contribute to render them conducive to the dignity, as well as to the welfare of the United States; and we join with you in imploring that Being, on whoſe will the fate of nations depends, to crown with ſucceſs our mutual endeavours.</p>

                  <p>WHEN we call to mind the gracious indulgence of Heaven, by which the American People became a nation; when we ſurvey the general proſperity of our country, and look forward to the riches, power and happineſs, to which it ſeems deſtined; with the deepeſt regret do I announce to you, that during your receſs, ſome of the citizens of the United States have been found capable of an inſurrection. It is due, however, to the character of our government, and to its ſtability, which cannot be ſhaken by the enemies of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, freely to unfold the courſe of this event.</p>
                  <p>During the ſeſſion of the year 1790, it was expedient to exerciſe the legiſlative power granted by the conſtitution of the United States, "to lay and collect exciſes." In a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the States, ſcarcely an objection was heard to this mode of taxation. In ſome, indeed, alarms were at firſt conceived, until they were baniſhed by reaſon and patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm. In the four weſtern counties of Pennſylvania, a prej<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udice, foſtered and embittered by the artifice of men who laboured for an aſcendency over the will of others, by the guidance of their paſſions, produced ſymptoms of riot and violence. It is well known, that Congreſs did not heſitate to examine the complaints which were preſented, and to relieve them, as far as juſtice dictated, or general convenience would permit. But the impreſſion which this moderation made on the diſcontented did not correſpond with what it deſerved; the arts of deluſion were no longer continued to the efforts of deſigning individuals.</p>
                  <p>The very forbearance to preſs proſecutions, was miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted into a fear of urging the execution of the laws;
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031402_0037_0FEF91EF93562648"/>
and aſſociations of men began to denounce threats againſt the officers employed. From a belief that, by a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal concert, their operation might be defeated, certain ſelf-created ſocieties aſſumed the tone of condemnation. Hence, while the greater part of Pennſylvania itſelf were conforming themſelves to the acts of exciſe, a few counties were reſolved to fruſtrate them. It was now perceived, that every expectation from the tenderneſs which had hitherto been purſued, was unavailing, and that further delay could only create an opinion of impotency, or irreſolution in the government. Legal proceſs, was, therefore, delivered to the Marſhal, againſt the rioters and delinquent diſtillers.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was he underſtood to be engaged in this duty, than the vengeance of armed men was aimed at his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the perſonal property of the Inſpector of the Rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enue. They fired upon the Marſhal, arreſted him, and detained him for ſome time as a priſoner. He was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by the jeopardy of his life, to renounce the ſervice of other proceſs, on the weſt ſide of the Allegany moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and a deputation was afterwards ſent to him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſurrender of that which he <hi>had</hi> ſerved. A nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous body repeatedly attacked the houſe of the Inſpector, ſeized his papers of office, and finally deſtroyed, by fire, his buildings, and whatſoever they contained. Both of theſe officers, from a juſt regard to their ſafety, fled to the ſeat of government; it being avowed, that the motives of ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages were, to compel the reſignation of the Inſpector; to withſtand by the force of arms, the authority of the United States, and thereby to extort a repeal of the laws of exciſe, and an alteration in the conduct of government.</p>
                  <p>Upon the teſtimony of theſe facts, an aſſociate juſtice of the ſupreme court of the United States notified to me, that "in the counties of Waſhington and Allegany, in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, laws of the United States were oppoſed, and the execution thereof obſtructed, by combinations, too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be ſuppreſſed by the ordinary courſe of judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, or by the powers veſted in the Marſhal of that diſtrict." On this call, momentous in the extreme, I ſought and weighed what might beſt ſubdue the criſis. On the one hand, the judiciary was pronounced to be ſtript of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031402_0038_0FEF91F124E4C360"/>
its capacity to enforce the laws: Crimes, which reached the very exiſtence of ſocial order, were perpetrated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out control; the friends of government were inſulted, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and overawed into ſilence, or an apparent acquieſcence; and to yield to the treaſonable fury of ſo ſmall a portion of the United States, would be to violate the fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our conſtitution, which enjoins, that the will of the majority ſhall prevail. On the other, to array citizen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt citizen—to publiſh the diſhonour of ſuch exceſſes— to encounter the expenſe, and other embarraſſments of ſo diſtant an expedition, were ſteps too delicate, too cloſely interwoven with many affecting conſiderations, to be lightly adopted. I poſtponed, therefore, the ſummoning the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia immediately into the field; but I required them to be held in readineſs, that if my anxious endeavours to reclaim the deluded, and to convince the malignant of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhould be fruitleſs, military force might be prepared to act, before the ſeaſon ſhould be too far advanced.</p>
                  <p>My proclamation of the 7th of Auguſt laſt, was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly iſſued, and accompanied by the appointment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, who were charged to repair to the ſcene of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. They were authoriſed to confer with any bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies of men, or individuals. They were inſtructed to be candid and explicit, in ſtating the ſenſations which had been excited in the Executive, and his earneſt wiſh to avoid a reſort to coercion; to repreſent, however, that without ſubmiſſion, coercion <hi>muſt</hi> be the reſort; but to invite them, at the ſame time, to return to the demeanor of faithful citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, by ſuch accommodations as lay within the ſphere of the executive power—pardon, too, was tendered to them by the government of the United States, and that of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania; upon no other condition, than a ſatisfactory aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of obedience to the laws.</p>
                  <p>Although the report of the Commiſſioners marks their firmneſs and abilities, and muſt unite all virtuous men, by ſhewing that the means of conciliation have been exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all of thoſe who had committed, or abetted the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, did not ſubſcribe the mild form, which was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as the atonement; and the indications of a peaceable temper were neither ſufficiently general, nor concluſive to
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031402_0038_0FEF91F124E4C360"/>
recommend or warrant a further ſuſpenſion of the march of the militia.</p>
                  <p>Thus the painful alternative could not be diſcarded. I ordered the militia to march, after once more admoniſhing the inſurgents, in my proclamation of the 25th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber laſt.</p>
                  <p>It was a taſk, too difficult to aſcertain, with preciſion, the loweſt degree of force competent to the quelling of the inſurrection. From a reſpect, indeed, to economy and the eaſe of my fellow-citizens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> belonging to the militia, it would have gratified me to accompliſh ſuch an eſtimate. My very great reluctance to aſcribe too much importance to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, had its extent been accurately ſeen, would have been a decided inducement to the ſmalleſt efficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. In this uncertainty, therefore, I put into motion fifteen thouſand men, as being an army, which, according to all human calculation, would be prompt, and adequate, in every view, and might perhaps, by rendering reſiſtance deſperate, prevent the effuſion of blood. Quotas had been aſſigned to the States of New Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Virginia; the Governor of Pennſylvania having declared on this occaſion, an opinion which juſtified a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition to the other States.</p>
                  <p>As Commander in Chief of the militia, when called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the actual ſervice of the United States, I have viſited the places of general rendezvous, to obtain more exact information, and to direct a plan for ulterior movements. Had there been room for a perſuaſion that the laws were ſecure from obſtruction; that the civil magiſtrate was able to bring to juſtice ſuch of the moſt culpable as have not embraced the proffered terms of amneſty, and may be deemed fit objects of example; that the friends of peace and good government were not in need of that aid and countenance, which they ought always to receive, and I truſt ever will receive, againſt the vicious and turbulent, I ſhould have caught with avidity the opportunity of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the militia to their families and home. But ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligence has tended to manifeſt the neceſſity of what has been done; it being now confeſſed, by thoſe who were not inclined to exaggerate the ill conduct of the inſurgents,

that their malevolence was not pointed merely to a partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular law, but that a ſpirit inimical to all order, has actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many of the offenders. If the ſtate of things had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded reaſon for the continuance of my preſence with the army, it would not have been withholden; but every appearance aſſuring ſuch an iſſue as will redound to the rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation and ſtrength of the United States, I have judged it moſt proper to reſume my duties at the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leaving the chief command with the Governor of Virginia.</p>
                  <p>Still, however, as it is probable, that in a commotion like the preſent, whatſoever may be the pretence, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of miſchief and revenge may not be laid aſide; the ſtationing of a ſmall force for a certain period, in the four weſtern counties of Pennſylvania, will be indiſpenſable, whether we contemplate the ſituation of thoſe who are connected with the execution of the laws, or of others, who may have expoſed themſelves by an honourable attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them.</p>
                  <p>Thirty days from the commencement of this ſeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the legal limitation of the employment of the militia, Congreſs cannot be too early occupied with this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Among the diſcuſſions which may ariſe from this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of our affairs, and from the documents which will be ſubmitted to Congreſs, it will not eſcape their obſervation, that not only the Inſpector of the Revenue, but other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the United States in Pennſylvania, have, from their fidelity in the diſcharge of their functions, ſuſtained mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial injuries to their property. The obligation and policy of indemnifying them, are ſtrong and obvious. It may alſo merit attention, whether policy will not enlarge this proviſion to the retribution of our citizens, who, though not under the ties of office, may have ſuffered damage by their generous exertions for upholding the conſtitution and the laws. The amount, even if all the injured were included, would not be great; and on future emergencies, the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment would be amply repaid by the influence of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that he who incurs a loſs in its defence, ſhall find a recompenſe in its liberality.</p>

It has demonſtrated that our proſperity reſts on ſolid foundations; by furniſhing an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional proof, that my fellow-citizens underſtand the true principles of government and liberty; that they feel their inſeparable union; that, notwithſtanding all the devices that have been made uſe of to ſway them from their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and duty, they are now as ready to maintain the author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the laws againſt licentious invaſions, as they were to defend their rights againſt uſurpation. It has been a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, diſplaying to the higheſt advantage, the value of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican government, to behold the moſt and leaſt wealthy of our citizens ſtanding in the ſame ranks as private ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; pre-eminently diſtinguiſhing by being the army of the conſtitution; undeterred by a march of three hundred miles, over rugged mountains, by the approach of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clement ſeaſon, or by any other diſcouragement. Nor ought I to omit to acknowledge the efficacious and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic co-operation which I have experienced from the Chief Magiſtrates of the States to which my requiſitions have been addreſſed.</p>
                  <p>To every deſcription, indeed, of citizens, let praiſe be given; but let them perſevere in their affectionate vigilance over that precious depoſitory of American happineſs, the Conſtitution of the United States. Let them cheriſh it too, for the ſake of thoſe, who, from every clime, are daily ſeeking a dwelling in our land. And when, in the calm moments of reflection, they ſhall have retraced the origin and progreſs of the inſurrection, let them determine, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it has not been fomented by combinations of men, who, careleſs of conſequences, and diſregarding the unerring truth, that thoſe who rouſe, cannot always appeaſe a civil convulſion, have diſſeminated, from an ignorance or perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of facts, ſuſpicions, jealouſies, and accuſations of the whole government.</p>

                     <pb n="78" facs="unknown:031402_0040_0FEF91F6A2B6D740"/>Having thus fulfilled the engagement which I took, when I entered into office, "to the beſt of my ability to preſerve, protect and defend the Conſtitution of the United States," on you, gentlemen, and the people by whom you are deputed, I rely for ſupport.</p>
                  <p>In the arrangements to which the poſſibility of a ſimilar contingency will naturally draw your attention, it ought not to be forgotten, that the militia laws have exhibited ſuch ſtriking defects, as could not have been ſupplied but by the zeal of our citizens. Beſides the extraordinary expenſe and waſte, which are not the leaſt of the defects, every appeal to thoſe laws is attended with a doubt of its ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>The deviſing and eſtabliſhing of a well-regulated militia, would be a genuine ſource of legiſlative honour, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect title to public gratitude. I therefore entertain a hope, that the preſent ſeſſion will not paſs, without carrying to its full energy, the power of organizing, arming and diſciplining the militia; and thus providing, in the language of the conſtitution, for calling them forth to execute the laws of the Union, ſuppreſs inſurrection, and repel invaſion.</p>
                  <p>As auxiliary to the ſtate of our defence to which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs cannot too frequently recur, they will not omit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether the fortifications which have been already licenſed by law, be commenſurate with our exigencies.</p>
                  <p>The intelligence from the army under the command of General Wayne, is a happy preſage to our military ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations againſt the hoſtile Indians north of the Ohio. From the advices which have been forwarded, the advance he has made muſt have damped the ardour of the ſavages, and weakened their obſtinacy in waging war againſt the United States; and yet, even at this late hour, when our power to puniſh them cannot be queſtioned, we ſhall not be unwilling to cement a laſting peace, upon terms of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, equity, and good neighbourhood.</p>
                  <p>Towards none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friendſhip been ſpared. The Creeks in particular are cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from encroachment by the interpoſition of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Government, and that of Georgia.

                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>THE time which has elapſed ſince the commencement of our fiſcal meaſures, has developed our pecuniary reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo as to open a way for a definitive plan for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of our public debt. It is believed, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult is ſuch as to encourage Congreſs to conſummate this work without delay. Nothing can more promote the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent welfare of the nation, and nothing would be more grateful to our conſtituents. Indeed, whatſoever is unfin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed of our ſyſtem of public credit, cannot be benefited by procraſtination, and, as far as may be practicable, we ought to place that credit on grounds which cannot be diſturbed, and to prevent that progreſſive accumulation of debt, which muſt ultimately endanger all governments.</p>
                  <p>An eſtimate of the neceſſary appropriations, including the expenditures into which we have been driven by the inſurrection, will be ſubmitted to Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE, AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>THE Mint of the United States has entered upon the coinage of the precious metals, and conſiderable ſums of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective coins and bullion have been lodged with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector by individuals. There is a pleaſing proſpect, that the inſtitution will, at no remote day, realize the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was originally formed of its utility.</p>
                  <p>In ſubſequent communications, certain circumſtances of our intercourſe with foreign nations will be tranſmitted to Congreſs; however, it may not be unſeaſonable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that my policy, in our foreign tranſactions, has been,

to cultivate peace with all the world—to obſerve treaties with pure and abſolute faith—to check every deviation from the line of impartiality—to explain what may have been miſapprehended, and correct what may have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to any nation; and having thus acquired the right, to loſe no time in acquiring the ability, to inſiſt upon juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice being done ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>Let us unite, therefore, in imploring the Supreme Ruler of nations to ſpread his holy protection over theſe United States—to turn the machinations of the wicked to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of our conſtitution—to enable us at all times to root out internal ſedition, and put invaſion to flight—to perpetuate to our country that proſperity which his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has already conferred, and to verify the anticipation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WE receive, with pleaſure, your ſpeech to the two Houſes of Congreſs. In it we perceive renewed proofs of that vigilant and paternal concern for the proſperity, honour and happineſs of our country, which has uniformly diſtinguiſhed your paſt adminiſtration.</p>
                  <p>Our anxiety, ariſing from the licentious and open reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the laws, in the weſtern counties of Pennſylvania, has been increaſed by the proceedings of certain ſelf-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated ſocieties, relative to the laws and adminiſtration of the government; proceedings, in our apprehenſion, founded in political error, calculated, if not intended, to diſorga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize our government, and which, by inſpiring deluſive hopes of ſupport, have been influential in miſleading our fellow-citizens in the ſcene of inſurrection.</p>
                  <p>In a ſituation ſo delicate and important, the lenient and perſuaſive meaſures, which you adopted, merit and receive
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031402_0041_0FEF91FA4127BB08"/>
our affectionate approbation. Theſe failing to procure their proper effects, and coercion having become inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; we have derived the higheſt ſatisfaction from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened patriotiſm, and animating zeal, with which the citizens of New Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Maryland and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia have rallied around the ſtandard of government, in oppoſition to anarchy and inſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Our warm and cordial acknowledgments are due to you, Sir, for the wiſdom and deciſion, with which you arrayed the militia, to execute the public will; and to them, for the diſintereſtedneſs and alacrity with which they obeyed your ſummons.</p>
                  <p>The example is precious to the theory of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and confers the brighteſt honour upon the patriots who have given it.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall readily concur in ſuch farther proviſions for the ſecurity of internal peace, and a due obedience to the laws, as the occaſion manifeſtly requires.</p>
                  <p>The effectual organization of the militia, and a prudent attention to the fortifications of our ports and harbours, are ſubjects of great national importance, and, together with the other meaſures you have been pleaſed to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, will receive our deliberate conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The ſucceſs of the troops, under the command of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Wayne, cannot fall to produce eſſential advantages. The pleaſure, with which we acknowledge the merits of that gallant General and army, is enhanced by the hope, that their victories will lay the foundation for a ſpeedy and durable peace with the Indian tribes.</p>
                  <p>At a period, ſo momentous in the affairs of nations, the temperate, juſt and firm policy, that you have purſued in reſpect to foreign powers, has been eminently calculated to promote the great and eſſential intereſts of our country, and has created the faireſt title to the public gratitude and thanks.</p>

                  <p>AMONG the occaſions, which have been afforded for expreſſing my ſenſe of the zealous and ſtedfaſt co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Senate, in the maintenance of government, none has yet occurred, more forcibly demanding my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified acknowledgments, than the preſent.</p>
                  <p>Next to the conſciouſneſs of upright intentions, it is the higheſt pleaſure to be approved by the enlightened Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of a free nation. With the ſatisfaction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which ariſes from an unalterable attachment to public order, do I learn, that the Senate diſcountenances thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, which would arrogate the direction of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs without any degree of authority derived from the people.</p>
                  <p>It has been more than once the lot of our government, to be thrown into new and delicate ſituations; and of theſe the inſurrection has not been the leaſt important.

                  <p>THE Houſe of Repreſentatives, calling to mind the bleſſings of the people of the United States, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the happineſs of living under conſtitutions and laws, which reſt on their authority alone, could not learn, with other emotions than thoſe you have expreſſed, that any part of our fellow-citizens ſhould have ſhewn themſelves capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an inſurrection; and we learn, with the greateſt concern, that any miſrepreſentations, whatever, of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment and its proceedings, either by individuals, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of men, ſhould have been made, and ſo far cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited, as to foment the flagrant outrage, which has been committed on the laws.</p>
                  <p>We feel with you the deepeſt regret, at ſo painful an occurrence in the annals of our country. As men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardful of the tender intereſts of humanity, we look with grief at ſcenes which have ſtained our land with civil blood. As lovers of public order, we lament that it has ſuffered ſo flagrant a violation. As zealous friends of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican government, we deplore every occaſion which, in the hands of its enemies, may be turned into calumny againſt it.</p>
                  <p>This aſpect of the criſis, however, is happily not the only one which it preſents. There is another which yields all the conſolations which you have drawn from it. It has demonſtrated to the candid world, as well as to the American people themſelves, that the great body of them, every where, are equally attached to the luminous and vital principle of our conſtitution, which enjoins, that the will of the majority ſhall prevail; that they underſtand the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble union between true liberty and regular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that they feel their duties no leſs than they are watchful over their rights; that they will be as ready at all times to cruſh licentiouſneſs, as they have been to defeat uſurpation. In a word, that they are capable of carrying into execution that noble plan of ſelf-government which
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031402_0043_0FEF920240BD54C0"/>
they have choſen as the guarantee of their own happineſs, and the aſylum for that of all from every clime, who may wiſh to unite their deſtiny with ours.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the juſt inferences flowing from the prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with which the ſummons to the ſtandard of the laws has been obeyed; and from the ſentiments which have been witneſſed in every deſcription of citizens, in every quarter of the Union. The ſpectacle, therefore, when viewed in its true light may well be affirmed to diſplay in equal luſtre the virtues of the American character, and the value of Republican government. All muſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly acknowledge and applaud the patriotiſm of that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of citizens, who have freely ſacrificed every thing leſs dear than the love of their country, to the meritorious taſk of defending its happineſs.</p>
                  <p>In the part which you yourſelf have borne through this delicate and diſtreſſing period, we trace the additional proofs it has afforded of y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Your laudable and ſucceſsful endeavours to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lenity in executing the laws conducive to their real energy, and to convert tumult into order, without the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of blood, form a particular title to the confidence and praiſe of your conſtituents. In all that may be found neceſſary, on our part to complete this benevolent purpoſe, and to ſecure the miniſters and friends of the laws againſt the remains of danger, our due co-operation will be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded.</p>
                  <p>The other ſubjects which you have recommended, or communicated, and of which ſeveral are particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, will all receive the attention which they demand. We are deeply impreſſed with the importance of an effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual organization of the Militia.</p>
                  <p>We rejoice at the intelligence of the advance and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the army under the command of General Wayne. Whether we regard it as a proof of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, proweſs and ſuperiority of our troops, or as a happy preſage to our military operations againſt the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Indians, as a probable prelude to the eſtabliſhment of a laſting peace, upon terms of candour, equity and good neighbourhood—we receive it with the greater pleaſure,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031402_0043_0FEF920240BD54C0"/>
as it increaſes the probability of ſooner reſtoring a part of the public reſources to the deſirable object of reducing the public debt.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall on this, as on all occaſions, be diſpoſed to adopt any meaſure which may advance the ſafety and proſperity of our country.</p>
                  <p>In nothing can we more cordially unite with you than imploring the Supreme Ruler of Nations to multiply his bleſſings on the United States—to guard our free and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Conſtitution againſt every machination and danger— and to make it the beſt ſource of public happineſs, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifying its character of being the beſt ſafeguard of human rights.</p>

                     <salute>FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE, AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I TRUST I do not deceive myſelf, while I indulge the perſuaſion, that I have never met you at any period, when, more than at the preſent, the ſituation of our public affairs has afforded juſt cauſe for mutual congratulation, and for inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the Author of all good, for the numerous and extraordinary bleſſings we enjoy.</p>
                  <p>The termination of the long, expenſive and diſtreſſing war, in which we have been engaged with certain Indians, northweſt of the Ohio, is placed in the option of the United States, by a treaty, which the commander of our army has concluded proviſionally, with the hoſtile tribes in that region.</p>
                  <p>In the adjuſtment of the terms, the ſatisfaction of the Indians was deemed an object worthy no leſs of the policy, than of the liberality of the United States, as the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry baſis of durable tranquillity. This object, it is believed, has been fully attained. The articles agreed upon, will immediately be laid before the Senate, for their conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration.</p>
                  <p>The Creek and Cherokee Indians, who alone of the ſouthern tribes had annoyed our frontiers, have lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their pre-exiſting Treaties with us; and were giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidence of a ſincere diſpoſition to carry them into ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by the ſurrender of the priſoners and property they had taken. But we have to lament, that the fair proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in this quarter, has been once more clouded by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton murders, which ſome citizens of Georgia are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031402_0045_0FEF8ECD67E541C0"/>
to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks; which have again ſubjected that frontier to diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude and danger; which will be productive of further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, and may occaſion more effuſion of blood. Meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures are purſuing to prevent or mitigate the uſual conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſuch outrages; and with the hope of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, at leaſt to avert general hoſtility.</p>
                  <p>A letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of our Treaty, made with his father the late Emperor; and, conſequently, the continuance of peace with that power. With peculiar ſatisfaction I add, that information has been received from an Agent deputed on our part to Algiers, importing that the terms of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Dey and Regency of that country had been adjuſted in ſuch a manner, as to authoriſe the expectation of a ſpeedy Peace, and the reſtoration of our unfortunate fellow-citizens, from a grievous captivity.</p>
                  <p>The lateſt advices from our Envoy at the court of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, give, moreover, the pleaſing information, that he had received aſſurances of a ſpeedy and ſatisfactory concluſion of his negociation. While the event depending upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjuſted particulars, cannot be regarded as aſcertained, it is agreeable to cheriſh the expectation of an iſſue, which, ſecuring amicably very eſſential intereſts of the United States, will at the ſame time, lay the foundation of laſting harmony with a power whoſe friendſhip we have uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſincerely deſired to cultivate.</p>
                  <p>Though not before officially diſcloſed to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, you, gentlemen, are all apprized, that a Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, has been negociated with Great Britain; and that the Senate have adviſed and conſented to its ratification, upon a condition which excepts part of one article. Agreeably thereto, and to the beſt judgment I was able to form of the public intereſt, after full and mature deliberation, I have added my ſanction. The reſult on the part of his Britannic Majeſty, is unknown. When received, the ſubject will, without delay, be placed before Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>This intereſting ſummary of our affairs, with regard to the foreign powers, between whom and the United States
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031402_0045_0FEF8ECD67E541C0"/>
controverſies have ſubſiſted; and with regard alſo to thoſe of our Indian neighbours with whom we have been in a ſtate of enmity or miſunderſtanding, opens a wide field for conſoling and gratifying reflections. If by prudence and moderation on every ſide, the extinguiſhment of all the cauſes of external diſcord, which have heretofore menaced our tranquillity, on terms compatible with our national rights and honour, ſhall be the happy reſult; how firm and how precious a foundation will have been laid for accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, maturing and eſtabliſhing the proſperity of our country.</p>
                  <p>Contemplating the internal ſituation, as well as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal relations of the United States, we diſcover equal cauſe for contentment and ſatisfaction. While many of the nations of Europe, with their American dependencies, have been involved in a conteſt unuſually bloody, exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and calamitous; in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by domeſtic convulſion and inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in which many of the arts moſt uſeful to ſociety have been expoſed to diſcouragement and decay; in which ſcarcity of ſubſiſtence has embittered other ſufferings; while even the anticipations of a return of the bleſſings of peace and repoſe, are alloyed by the ſenſe of heavy and accumulating burthens, which preſs upon all the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of induſtry, and threaten to clog the future ſprings of government;—our favoured country, happy in a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contraſt, has enjoyed general tranquillity; a tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the more ſatisfactory, becauſe maintained at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of no duty. Faithful to ourſelves, we have violated no obligation to others. Our agriculture, commerce and manufactures proſper beyond former example; the moleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of our trade (to prevent a continuance of which, however, very pointed remonſtrances have been made) being overbalanced by the aggregate benefits which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from a neutral poſition. Our population advances with a celerity which, exceeding the moſt ſanguine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, proportionally augments our ſtrength and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, and guarantees our future ſecurity. Every part of the Union diſplays indications of rapid and various im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and with burthens ſo light as ſcarcely to be
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031402_0046_0FEF920BEE03EC28"/>
perceived; with reſources fully adequate to our preſent exigencies; with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty, and with mild and wholeſome laws;—is it too much to ſay, that our country exhibits a ſpectacle of national happineſs never ſurpaſſed, if ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore equalled?</p>
                  <p>Placed in a ſituation every way ſo auſpicious, motives of commanding force impel us, with ſincere acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgment to Heaven, and pure love to our country, to unite our efforts to preſerve, prolong and improve, our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe advantages. To co-operate with you in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable work, is a fervent and favourite wiſh of my heart.</p>
                  <p>It is a valuable ingredient, in the general eſtimate of our welfare, that the part of our country, which was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſcene of diſorder and inſurrection, now enjoy the bleſſings of quiet and order. The miſled have abandoned their errors, and pay the reſpect to our conſtitution and laws which is due from good citizens to the public au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of the ſociety. Theſe circumſtances have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to pardon, generally, the offenders here refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to; and to extend forgiveneſs to thoſe who had been adjudged to capital puniſhment. For though I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways think it a ſacred duty, to exerciſe with firmneſs and energy the conſtitutional powers with which I am veſted; yet it appears to me no leſs conſiſtent with the public good, than it is with my perſonal feelings, to mingle in the operations of government every degree of moderation and tenderneſs which the national juſtice, dignity and ſafety may permit.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
                  <p>Among the objects which will claim your attention in the courſe of the ſeſſion, a review of our military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not the leaſt important. It is called for by the events which have changed, and may be expected ſtill further to change the relative ſituation of our frontiers. In this review, you will doubtleſs allow due weight to the conſiderations, that the queſtions between us and certain foreign powers, are not yet finally adjuſted; that the war in Europe is not yet terminated; and that our Weſtern
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031402_0046_0FEF920BEE03EC28"/>
Poſts, when recovered, will demand proviſion for garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and ſecuring them. A ſtatement of our preſent military force will be laid before you by the department of war.</p>
                  <p>With the review of our army eſtabliſment is naturally connected that of the militia. It will merit inquiry, what imperfections in the exiſting plan, further experience may have unfolded. The ſubject is of ſo much moment in my eſtimation, as to excite a conſtant ſolicitude, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of it may be renewed, till the greateſt attainable perfection ſhall be accompliſhed. Time is wearing away ſome advantages for forwarding the object, while none better deſerves the perſevering attention of the public councils.</p>
                  <p>While we indulge the ſatisfaction, which the actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Weſtern borders ſo well authorizes, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we ſhould not loſe ſight of an important truth, which continually receives new confirmations, namely, that the proviſions heretofore made with a view to the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Indians from the violences of the lawleſs part of our frontier inhabitants are inſufficient. It is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that theſe violences can now be perpetrated with impunity; and it can need no argument to prove, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the murdering of Indians can be reſtrained by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the murderers to condign puniſhment, all the exertions of the government to prevent deſtructive retaliations by the Indians, will prove fruitleſs, and all our preſent agreeable proſpects illuſory. The frequent deſtruction of innocent women and children, who are chiefly the victims of retal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iation, muſt continue to ſhock humanity; and an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous expenſe, to drain the treaſury of the Union.</p>
                  <p>To enforce upon the Indians the obſervance of juſtice, it is indiſpenſable that there ſhall be competent means of rendering juſtice to them. If theſe means can be deviſed by the wiſdom of Congreſs; and eſpecially if there can be added an adequate proviſion for ſupplying the neceſſities of the Indians, on reaſonable terms, (a meaſure, the mention of which I the more readily repeat, as in all the conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with them, they urge it with ſolicitude) I ſhould not heſitate to entertain a ſtrong hope of rendering our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity permanent. I add, with pleaſure, that the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:031402_0047_0FEF9224CDABD508"/>
even of their civilization, is not diminiſhed by the experiments which have been thus far made, under the auſpices of government. The accompliſhment of this work, if practicable, will reflect undecaying luſtre on our nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al character, and adminiſter the moſt grateful conſolations that virtuous minds can know.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>THE ſtate of our revenue, with the ſums which have been borrowed and re-imburſed, purſuant to different acts of Congreſs, will be ſubmitted from the proper departments; together with an eſtimate of the appropriations neceſſary to be made for the ſervice of the enſuing year.</p>
                  <p>Whether meaſures may not be adviſeable to reinforce the proviſion for the redemption of the public debt, will naturally engage your examination. Congreſs have dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſtrated their ſenſe to be, and it were ſuperfluous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat mine, that whatſoever will tend to accelerate the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable extinction of our public debt, accords as much with the true intereſt of our country as with the general ſenſe of our conſtituents.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE, AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
                  <p>THE ſtatements which will be laid before you relative to the mint, will ſhew the ſituation of that inſtitution; and the neceſſity of ſome further legiſlative proviſions, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the buſineſs of it more completely into effect, and for checking abuſes which appear to be ariſing in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar quarters.</p>
                  <p>The progreſs in providing materials for the frigates, and in building them; the ſtate of the fortifications of our harbours; the meaſures which have been purſued for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining proper ſcites for arſenals, and for repleniſhing our magazines with military ſtores; and the ſteps which have been taken towards the execution of the law for opening a trade with the Indians, will likewiſe be preſented for the information of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="unknown:031402_0047_0FEF9224CDABD508"/>Temperate diſcuſſion of the important ſubjects which may ariſe in the courſe of the ſeſſion; and mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance where there is a difference of opinion, are too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and neceſſary for the peace, happineſs and welfare of our country, to need any recommendation of mine.</p>

                  <p>IT is with peculiar ſatisfaction that we are informed by your Speech to the two Houſes of Congreſs, that the long and expenſive war, in which we have been engaged with the Indians northweſt of the Ohio, is in a ſituation to be finally terminated; and though we view with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the danger of an interruption of the peace ſo recently confirmed with the Creeks, we indulge the hope, that the meaſure you have adopted to prevent the ſame, if followed by thoſe legiſlative proviſions that juſtice and humanity equally demand, will ſucceed in laying the foundation of a laſting peace with the Indian tribes, on the Southern as well as on the Weſtern frontiers.</p>
                  <p>The confirmation of our treaty with Morocco, and the adjuſtment of a treaty of peace with Algiers, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which our captive fellow-citizens ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from ſlavery, are events that will prove no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to the public humanity, than they will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant in extending and ſecuring the navigation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of our country.</p>
                  <p>As a juſt and equitable concluſion of our depending negociations with Spain will eſſentially advance the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of both nations, and thereby cheriſh and confirm the good underſtanding and friendſhip which we have at all times deſired to maintain, it will afford us real pleaſure to receive an early confirmation of our expectations on this ſubject.</p>

                  <p>A final and formal termination of the diſtreſſing war which has ravaged our northweſtern frontier, will be an event which muſt afford a ſatisfaction proportioned to the anxiety with which it has long been ſought; and in the adjuſtment of the terms, we perceive the true policy of making them ſatisfactory to the Indians, as well as to the United States, as the beſt baſis of a durable tranquillity. The diſpoſition of ſuch of the ſouthern tribes, as had alſo heretofore annoyed our frontier, is another proſpect in our ſituation ſo important to the intereſt and happineſs of the United States, that it is much to be lamented that any clouds ſhould be thrown over it, more eſpecially by exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the part of our own citizens.</p>

                  <salute>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WITH the utmoſt attention I have conſidered your reſolution of the 24th inſt. requeſting me to lay before your Houſe a copy of the inſtructions to the miniſter of the United States, who negociated the treaty with the king of Great Britain, together with the correſpondence and other documents relative to that treaty, excepting ſuch of the ſaid papers as any exiſting negociation may render im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to be diſcloſed.</p>
               <p>In deliberating on this ſubject, it was impoſſible for me to loſe ſight of the principle which ſome have avowed in its diſcuſſion, or to avoid extending my views to the conſequences which muſt flow from the admiſſion of that principle.</p>
               <p>I truſt that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a diſpoſition to withhold any information which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution has enjoined upon the Preſident as a duty to give, or which could be required of him by either Houſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs as a right; and with truth I affirm, that it has been, as it will continue to be while I have the honour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the government, my conſtant endeavour to harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize with the other branches thereof, ſo far as the truſt delegated to me by the people of the United States, and my ſenſe of the obligation it impoſes to "preſerve, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, and defend the Conſtitution," will permit.</p>
               <p>The nature of foreign negociations requires caution; and their ſucceſs muſt often depend on ſecrecy, and even when brought to a concluſion, a full diſcloſure of all the meaſures, demands or eventual conceſſions which may
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031402_0050_0FEF9234580BA3C0"/>
have been propoſed or contemplated, would be extremely impolitic; for this might have a pernicious influence on future negociations, or produce immediate inconveniences; perhaps danger and miſchief, in relation to other powers. The neceſſity of ſuch caution and ſecrecy was one cogent reaſon for veſting the power of making treaties in the Preſident, with the advice and conſent of the Senate; the principle on which that body was formed, confining it to a ſmall number of members. To admit, then, a right in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, to demand, and to have, as a matter of courſe, all the papers reſpecting a negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a foreign power, would be to eſtabliſh a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous precedent.</p>
               <p>It does not occur, that the inſpection of the papers aſked for, can be relative to any purpoſe under the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ance of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, except that of an impeachment, which the reſolution has not expreſſed. I repeat, that I have no diſpoſition to withhold any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which the duty of my ſtation will permit, or the public good ſhall require, to be diſcloſed; and, in fact, all the papers affecting the negociation with Great Britain, were laid before the Senate, when the treaty itſelf was communicated for their conſideration and advice.</p>
               <p>The courſe which the debate has taken on the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Houſe, leads to ſome obſervations on the mode of making treaties under the Conſtitution of the United States.</p>
               <p>Having been a member of the General Convention, and knowing the principles on which the Conſtitution was formed, I have ever entertained but one opinion on this ſubject; and from the firſt eſtabliſhment of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment to this moment, my conduct has exemplified that opinion, that the power of making treaties is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively veſted in the Preſident, by and with the advice of the Senate, provided two-thirds of the Senators preſent concur; and that every treaty ſo made and promulgated, thenceforward became the law of the land. It is thus that the treaty making power has been underſtood by foreign nations; and in all treaties made with them, we have declared, and they have believed, that when ratified
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031402_0051_0FEF8EF58F8E0E40"/>
by the Preſident, with the advice and conſent of the Senate, they became obligatory. In this conſtruction of the Conſtitution, every Houſe of Repreſentatives has heretofore acquieſced; and until the preſent time, not a doubt or ſuſpicion has appeared to my knowledge, that this conſtruction was not the true one. Nay, they have more than acquieſced; for until now, without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the obligation of ſuch treaties, they have made all the requiſite proviſions for carrying them into effect.</p>
               <p>There is alſo reaſon to believe that this conſtruction agrees with the opinions entertained by the State Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, when they were deliberating on the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; eſpecially by thoſe who objected to it, becauſe there was not required in <hi>commercial treaties</hi> the conſent of two-thirds of the whole Senate, inſtead of two-thirds of the Senators preſent; and becauſe in treaties reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing territorial and certain other rights and claims, the concurrence of three-fourths of the whole number of the members of both Houſes reſpectively was not made neceſſary.</p>
               <p>It is a fact declared by the General Convention, and univerſally underſtood, that the Conſtitution of the United States was the reſult of a ſpirit of amity and mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. And it is well known that under this influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the ſmaller States were admitted to an equal rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation in Senate, with the larger States; and that this branch of the government was inveſted with great powers; for on the equal participation of thoſe powers the ſovereignty and political ſafety of the ſmaller States were deemed eſſentially to depend.</p>
               <p>If other proofs than theſe, and the plain letter of the Conſtitution itſelf be neceſſary to aſcertain the point under conſideration, they may be found in the journals of the General Convention, which I have depoſited in the office of the department of ſtate. In thoſe journals it will appear that a propoſition was made, "that no treaty ſhould be binding on the United States which was not ratified by a law;" and that the propoſition was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly rejected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:031402_0051_0FEF8EF58F8E0E40"/>As, therefore, it is perfectly clear to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the aſſent of the Houſe of Repreſentatives is not neceſſary to the validity of a treaty; as the treaty with <hi>Great Britain</hi> exhibits, in itſelf, all the objects requiring legiſlative proviſion, and on which theſe papers called for can throw no light; and as it is eſſential to the due adminiſtration of the government, that the boundaries fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Conſtitution, between the different departments ſhould be preſerved—a juſt regard to the Conſtitution, and to the duty of my office, under all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this caſe, forbid a compliance with your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WE feel the honour you have this day conferred on the town of Baltimore, by favouring it with your preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, infinitely heightened and enhanced by the deſirable event which has produced it. Happy to behold your el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evation permit us to re-aſſure you of our pureſt love and affection.</p>
               <p>In conſidering the occaſion that has once more drawn you from the ſcenes of domeſtic eaſe and private tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, our thoughts naturally turn on the ſituation of our country, previous to the expedient of the late General Convention. When you became a member of that body which framed our new and excellent Conſtitution, you diſſipated the fears of good men, who dreaded the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of the States, and the loſs of our liberties in the death of our enfeebled and expiring Confederation: and now, Sir, by accepting the high authorities of Preſident of the United States of America, you teach us to expect every bleſſing that can reſult from the wiſeſt recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Congreſs, and the moſt prudent and judicious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of thoſe authorities; thus relieving us, in the one inſtance, from the moſt gloomy apprehenſions, as when, in a different capacity, you re-croſſed the Delaware; and in the other, opening to our view the moſt animating proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, as when you captured Cornwallis.</p>
               <p>But it is from the tenor of your own life, and your uniform and upright political principles and conduct, that we derive the fulleſt aſſurance that our hopes will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized. Believing that a faithful performance of public engagements is eſſential to the proſperity of a people, and their implicit reliance on the promiſes of government, to
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031402_0052_0FEF8EF2F69874A8"/>
its ſtability, we recollect with pleaſure your well known ſentiments on this ſubject, and have no doubt but the other branches of Congreſs will concur with you in placing public credit on the moſt ſolid foundation. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo every reaſon to conclude, that under the adminiſtration of a WASHINGTON, the uſeful and ingenious arts of peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the agriculture, commerce, and manufactures of the United States, will be duly favoured and improved, as being far more certain ſources of national wealth than the richeſt mines; and ſurer means to promote the felicity of a people, than the moſt ſucceſsful wars. Thus, Sir, we behold a new era ſpringing out of our independence, and a field diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, where your talents for governing will not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the ſplendour of the greateſt military exploits. We behold too, an extraordinary thing in the annals of mankind, a free and enlightened people, chooſing, by a free election, without one diſſenting voice, the late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of their armies, to watch over and guard their civil rights and privileges.</p>
               <p>We ſincerely pray that you may long enjoy your preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent health, and the citizens of the United States have frequent opportunities to teſtify their veneration of your virtues, by continuing you through many ſucceſſive elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the firſt ſtation of human honour and dignity. In theſe expreſſions of our affections and attachment, we are ſenſible we do not ſpeak the wiſhes of a town only, but the united feelings of a whole people.</p>
               <p>In behalf of the citizens of Baltimore, we have the honour to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THE tokens of regard and affection which I have often received from the citizens of this town, were always acceptable becauſe I believed them always ſincere. Be pleaſed to receive my beſt acknowledgments for the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of them on the preſent occaſion.</p>
               <p>If the affectionate partiality of my fellow-citizens has prompted them to aſcribe greater effects to my conduct and character than were juſtly due, I truſt the indulgent ſentiment on their part, will not produce any preſumption on mine.</p>
               <p>I cannot now, gentlemen, reſiſt my feelings ſo much as to withhold the communication of my ideas reſpecting the actual ſituation of our national affairs. It appears to me that little more than common ſenſe and common honeſty in the tranſactions of the community at large, would be neceſſary to make us a happy nation. For if the general government, lately adopted, ſhall be arranged and admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtered in ſuch a manner as to acquire the full confidence of the American people, I ſincerely believe they will have greater advantages from their natural, moral and political circumſtances, for public felicity, than any other people ever poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>In the contemplation of thoſe advantages, now ſoon to be realized, I have reconciled myſelf to the ſacrifice of my fondeſt wiſhes, ſo far as to enter again upon the ſtage of public life. I know the delicate nature of the duties incident to the part which I am called to perform, and I feel my incompetence, without the ſingular aſſiſtance of Providence, to diſcharge them in a ſatisfactory manner.

               <p>In reflecting upon the viciſſitudes of the late war—in tracing its difficulties, and in contemplating its ſucceſs, we are uniformly impreſſed with the extent and magnitude of the ſervices which you have rendered to your country; and by that impreſſion, we are taught to expect that the exerciſe of the ſame virtues and abilities which have been thus happily employed in obtaining the prize of liberty and independence, muſt be effectually inſtrumental in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to your fellow-citizens and their poſterity, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent bleſſings of a free and efficient government. And although the hiſtory of the revolution will furniſh the beſt evidence of the invariable attachment of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to the intereſts and honour of the Union, yet we cannot reſiſt this favourable opportunity of perſonally aſſuring you, that in every meaſure which tends to advance the national character, you may rely on the zealous co-operation of the executive authority of Pennſylvania.</p>
               <p>In diſcharging the duties of your preſent important ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it muſt, Sir, be a never-failing ſource of conſolation and ſupport, that the unbounded love and confidence of the people, will produce a favourable conſtruction of all your actions, and will contribute to the harmony and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of your adminiſtration.

               <p>Feeling how greatly I ſhall ſtand in need of the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic aſſiſtance of every good citizen of America, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence they continue to expreſs in the rectitude of my diſpoſitions will always be, as it ever has been, an unfailing ſource of conſolation to me, in every hour of difficulty or diſtreſs. While the whole courſe of my part conduct will be a better ſecurity for my future tranſactions than any verbal aſſurances I can give, I will only ſay, that I ſhould find myſelf ſingularly happy in contributing to realize the glorious work, which your partiality for me has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent enough to anticipate, of eſtabliſhing juſtice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring tranquillity, promoting the general welfare, and enſuring the bleſſings of liberty and independence to the good people of our native country, and their lateſt poſterity.</p>

               <p>PERMIT, Sir, the Univerſity of the State of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania to join in the general joy, occaſioned by your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the firſt office in the FEDERAL EMPIRE. It is by this honour (the higheſt that America can beſtow) that a grateful people expreſs the affection which your eminent ſervices have excited in their boſoms. It is this that has given them but ONE VOICE in their, delegation of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truſt, and that unites the homage of the heart with the duty of the citizen. To be the firſt magiſtrate of a great empire, is a ſtation that many have attained: but to acquire it by the UNANIMOUS VOICE of a free people, is an event in the hiſtory of the world, as rare as thoſe illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious virtues, of which it is the juſt reward. We rejoice in an event ſo auſpicious to our country; and we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hope, that your endeavours to extend the bleſſings of good government will be crowned with a ſucceſs as brilliant as that which diſtinguiſhed your exertions in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our freedom.</p>
               <p>As guardians of this Univerſity, (which boaſts the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of enrolling the name of your Excellency among thoſe of her ſons) we anticipate the encouragement which ſuch inſtitutions will receive under your adminiſtration. The influence of ſound learning on religion and manners— on government, liberty and laws, will make it a favourite object in every civilized ſociety: and the ſciences having experienced your protection amidſt the convulſions of war, reaſonably expect a diſtinguiſhed patronage in the calm of peace.</p>
               <p>We devoutly pray the Almighty Ruler of the Univerſe, that you may long enjoy the felicity of that country which

               <p>Nor could I remain inſenſible to the honour that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon me by this freſh and diſtinguiſhed proof of its approbation.

               <p>I am not a little flattered by being conſidered by the patrons of literature as one of their number. Fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of the influence which ſound learning has on religion and manners, on government, liberty and laws, I ſhall only lament my want of ability to make it ſtill more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, I conceive hopes, however, that we are at the eve of a very enlightened era.

               <p>When I contemplate the interpoſition of Providence, as it was viſibly manifeſted, in guiding us through the Revolution, in preparing us for the reception of a general government, and in conciliating the good will of the people of America towards one another after its adoption; I feel myſelf oppreſſed, and almoſt overwhelmed with a ſenſe of the divine munificence. I feel that nothing is due to my perſonal agency in all theſe complicated and wonderful events, except what can ſimply be attributed to the exertions of an honeſt zeal for the good of my country.</p>
               <p>If I have diſtreſſing apprehenſions, that I ſhall not be able to juſtify the too exalted expectations of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I am ſupported under the preſſure of ſuch uneaſy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections by a confidence, that the moſt gracious Being, who hath hitherto watched over the intereſts and averted the perils of the United States, will never ſuffer ſo fair an inheritance to become a prey to anarchy, deſpotiſm, or any other ſpecies of oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>I thank you ſincerely for your kind wiſhes, that my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration may be honourable and happy to myſelf and country.</p>
               <p>I pray you, Gentlemen, will accept, on your own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, as well as on that of the citizens you repreſent, my heart-felt acknowledgments for the polite welcome I have

               <p>Unelated by your too favourable appreciation of my paſt ſervices, I can only pour forth the effuſions of a grateful heart to Heaven, if I have been made in any degree an inſtrument of good to my country.

               <p>In this place I cannot avoid expreſſing an anxious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that the partiality of my countrymen in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour has induced them to expect too much from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of an individual. It is from their co-operation alone, I derive all my expectations of ſucceſs. Indeed, the

unanimity which has prevailed in ſome inſtances, is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py preſage that our national government will be firmly eſtabliſhed in the hearts of the people, and receive their united and zealous ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I feel a juſt ſenſe of your ſervent wiſhes for my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal happineſs and the ſucceſs of my adminiſtration. I pray you, Gentlemen, to accept in return, my cordial thanks for theſe demonſtrations of your affection, as well as for the aſſurances you have given of the attachment of our fellow-citizens.</p>

               <p>THE General Aſſembly of the Preſbyterian Church, in the United States of America, embrace the earlieſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in their power, to teſtify the lively and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigned pleaſure which they, with the reſt of their fellow-citizens, feel on your appointment to the firſt office in the nation.</p>
               <p>We adore Almighty God, the author of every perfect gift, who hath endued you with ſuch a rare and happy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage of talents, as hath rendered you equally neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to your country in war and in peace.</p>
               <p>Your military achievements enſured ſafety and glory to America, in the late arduous conflict for freedom;
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031402_0066_0FEF92664A7B2AA0"/>
while your diſintereſted conduct, and uniformly juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of the public intereſt, gained you the entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the people. And in the preſent intereſting period of public affairs, the influence of your perſonal character moderates the diviſions of political parties, and promiſes a permanent eſtabliſhment of the civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
               <p>From a retirement more glorious to you than thrones and ſceptres, you have been called to your preſent ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſtation, by the voice of a great and free people; and with an unanimity of ſuffrage that has few if any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in hiſtory. A man more ambitious of fame, or leſs devoted to his country, would have refuſed an office in which his honours could not be augmented, and where they might poſſibly be ſubject to a reverſe.</p>
               <p>We are happy that God hath inclined your heart to give yourſelf once more to the public. And we derive a favourable preſage of the event from the zeal of all claſſes of the people, and their confidence in your virtues; as well as from the knowledge and dignity with which the federal councils are filled. But we derive a preſage even more flattering from the piety of your character. Public virtue is the moſt certain mean of public felicity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the ſureſt baſis of virtue. We therefore eſteem it a peculiar happineſs to behold in our Chief Magiſtrate a ſteady, uniform, avowed friend of the Chriſtian religion; who has commenced his adminiſtration in rational and exalted ſentiments of piety, and who, in his private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, adorns the doctrines of the goſpel of Chriſt; and on the moſt public and ſolemn occaſions devoutly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the government of Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>The example of diſtinguiſhed characters will ever poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a powerful and extenſive influence on the public mind; and when we ſee, in ſuch a conſpicuous ſtation, the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of piety to God, of benevolence to men, and of a pure and virtuous patriotiſm, we naturally hope that it will diffuſe its influence, and that eventually the moſt happy conſequences will reſult from it. To the force of imitation we will endeavour to add the wholeſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of religion. We ſhall conſider ourſelves as
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031402_0066_0FEF92664A7B2AA0"/>
doing an acceptable ſervice to God in our profeſſion, when we contribute to render men ſober, honeſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious citizens, and the obedient ſubjects of a lawful gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. In theſe pious labours, we hope to imitate the moſt worthy of our brethren of other Chriſtian denominations, and to be imitated by them; aſſured, that if we can, by mutual and generous emulation, promote truth and virtue, we ſhall render eſſential ſervice to the Republic; we ſhall receive encouragement from every wiſe and good citizen, and above all, meet the approbation of our Divine Maſter.</p>
               <p>We pray Almighty God to have you always in his holy keeping. May he prolong your valuable life, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and a bleſſing to your country; and at laſt beſtow on you the glorious reward of a faithful ſervant.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031402_0067_0FEF926B324DC6F0"/>
I have felt upon finding that my compliance with the call of my country, and my dependence on the aſſiſtance of Heaven to ſupport me in my arduous undertakings, have, ſo far as I can learn, met the univerſal approbation of my countrymen.</p>
               <p>While I reiterate the profeſſions of my dependence upon Heaven as the ſource of all public and private bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; I will obſerve that the general prevalence of piety, philanthropy, honeſty, induſtry and economy ſeems, in the ordinary courſe of human affairs, particularly neceſſary for advancing and confirming the happineſs of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. While all men within our territories are protected in worſhipping the Deity according to the dictates of their conſciences; it is rationally to be expected from them in return, that they will all be emulous of evincing the ſincerity of their profeſſions, by the innocence of their lives and the beneficence of their actions. For no man who is profligate in his morals, or a bad member of the civil community, can poſſibly be a true Chriſtian or a cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it to his own religious ſociety.</p>

               <p>AMIDST the congratulations which ſurround you from all quarters, we, the Governor and Council of the State of North Carolina, beg leave to offer ours, with equal ſincerity and fervency with any which can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to you. Though this State be not yet a member of the Union under the new form of government, we look forward with the pleaſing hope of its ſhortly becoming ſuch; and in the mean time conſider ourſelves bound in a
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031402_0070_0FEF9273B2219E40"/>
common intereſt and affection with the other States, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only for the happy event of ſuch alterations being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as will remove the apprehenſions of many of the good citizens of this State, for thoſe liberties for which they have fought and ſuffered in common with others. This happy event, we doubt not, will be accelerated by your Excellency's appointment to the firſt office in the Union, ſince we are well aſſured the ſame greatneſs of mind, which in all ſcenes has ſo eminently characterized your Excellency, will induce you to adviſe every meaſure calculated to compoſe party diviſions, and to abate any animoſity that may be excited by a mere difference in opinion. Your Excellency will conſider (however others may forget) how extremely difficult it is to unite all the people of a great country in one common ſentiment upon almoſt any political ſubject, much leſs upon a new form of government materially different from one they have been accuſtomed to, and will therefore rather be diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice that ſo much has been effected, than regret that more could not all at once be accompliſhed. We ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve America is the only country in the world where ſuch a deliberate change of government could take place under any circumſtances whatever.</p>
               <p>We hope your Excellency will pardon the liberty we take in writing ſo particularly on this ſubject; but this State, however it may differ in any political opinions with the other States, cordially joins with them in ſentiments of the utmoſt gratitude and veneration for thoſe diſtinguiſhed talents and that illuſtrious virtue, which we feel a pride in ſaying we believe, under God, have been the principal means of preſerving the liberty and procuring the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of our country. We cannot help conſidering you, Sir, in ſome meaſure, as the father of it, and hope to experience the good effects of that confidence you ſo juſtly have acquired, in an abatement of the party ſpirit which ſo much endangers a union on which the ſafety and happineſs of America can alone be founded. May that union, at a ſhort diſtance of time, be as perfect and more ſafe than ever! And in the mean while, may the State of North Carolina be conſidered, as it truly deſerves
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031402_0071_0FEF927549C2FA48"/>
to be, attached with equal warmth with any State in the Union, to the true intereſt, proſperity and glory of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, differing only in ſome particulars in opinion as to the means of promoting them.</p>

               <p>IT was ſcarcely poſſible for any Addreſs to have given me greater pleaſure than that which I have juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you; becauſe I conſider it not only demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative of your approbation of my conduct in accepting the firſt office in the Union, but alſo indicative of the good diſpoſitions of the citizens of your State towards their ſiſter States, and of the probability of their ſpeedily acceding to the new General Government.</p>

               <p>Gratified by the favourable ſentiments which are evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in your Addreſs to me, and impreſſed with an idea that the citizens of your State are ſincerely attached to the intereſt, the proſperity, and the glory of America, I moſt earneſtly implore the divine benediction and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the councils which are ſhortly to be taken by their delegates on a ſubject of the moſt momentous conſequence; I mean the political relation which is to ſubſiſt hereafter, between the State of North Carolina, and the States now in union under the new General Government.</p>

to expreſs our cordial joy on your election to the Chief Magiſtracy of the United States.</p>
               <p>When we contemplate the ſhort but eventful hiſtory of our nation—when we recollect the ſeries of eſſential ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices performed by you in the courſe of the revolution, the temperate, yet efficient exertion of the mighty powers with which the nature of the conteſt made it neceſſary to inveſt you—and eſpecially when we remember the voluntary and magnanimous relinquiſhment of thoſe high authorities at the moment of peace—we anticipate the happineſs of our country under your future adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>But it was not alone from a ſucceſsful and virtuous uſe of thoſe extraordinary powers that you were called from your honourable retirement, to the firſt dignities, of out government. An affectionate admiration of your private character, the impartiality, the perſevering fortitude, and the energy with which your public duties have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably performed, and the paternal ſolicitude for the happineſs of the American people, together with the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and conſummate knowledge of our affairs, manifeſted in your laſt military communication, have directed to your name the <hi>univerſal wiſh,</hi> and have produced, for the firſt time in the hiſtory of mankind, an example of <hi>unanimous conſent</hi> in the appointment of the governor of a free and enlightened nation.</p>
               <p>To theſe conſiderations, inſpiring us with the moſt pleaſing expectations, as private citizens, permit us to add, that as the repreſentatives of a numerous and extended church, we moſt thankfully rejoice in the election of a civil ruler deſervedly beloved, and eminently diſtinguiſhed among the friends of genuine religion, who has happily united a tender regard for other churches with an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attachment to his own.</p>
               <p>With unfeigned ſatisfaction we congratulate you on the eſtabliſhment of the new Conſtitution of government for the United States, the mild, yet efficient operations of which, we confidently truſt, will remove every remaining apprehenſion of thoſe, with whoſe opinions it may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely coincide, and will confirm the hopes of its numerous friends. Nor do theſe expectations appear too ſanguine,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031402_0072_0FEF927B0E42E8D0"/>
when the moderation, patriotiſm, and wiſdom of the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable members of the federal legiſlature are duly conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered.</p>
               <p>From a body thus eminently qualified, harmoniouſly co-operating with the executive authority in conſtitutional concert, we confidently hope for the reſtoration of order and our ancient virtues; the extenſion of genuine religion, and the conſequent advancement of our reſpectability a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and of our ſubſtantial happineſs at home.</p>
               <p>We devoutly implore the Supreme Ruler of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to preſerve you long in health and proſperity an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating example of all public and private virtues—the friend and guardian of a free, enlightened, and grateful people; and that you may finally receive the reward which will be given to thoſe, whoſe lives have been ſpent in promoting the happineſs of mankind.</p>

               <p>THE Repreſentatives of a free people cannot comply with their duty to their conſtituents more to their ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, than by paying a juſt tribute to the merits of one, whoſe important exertions, unexampled perſeverance, and diſtinguiſhed military talents, have eminently contributed to the eſtabliſhment of their liberties. Impreſſed with the moſt lively ſenſe of your love for your country, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably evidenced in the courſe of your paſt ſervices, and of which you have given a new proof, by ſacrificing your predilection for private life to the deſires of your fellow-citizens, and again appearing on the public ſtage, we moſt ſincerely congratulate you on your elevation to the high ſtation you now fill.</p>
               <p>The citizens of this State, having been among the firſt to adopt the ſyſtem of federal government on which they ſo much depend for their portion of the national proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, cannot but be highly gratified by the progreſs which has been made towards its complete organization; and they have a pleaſing addition to their ſatisfaction, by your having been ſo unanimouſly placed at the head of it. We are confident that we declare the ſenſe of the people of Pennſylvania, when we aſſure you of the firm and conſtant ſupport of this State in all meaſures, in which its aid ſhall be neceſſary, for rendering your adminiſtration eaſy to yourſelf, and beneficial to your country.</p>
               <p>We deem it a circumſtance which ſtrongly marks the good ſenſe and virtue of our countrymen, that they peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and deliberately concurred in a frame of general gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, which, we firmly truſt, will, in its operation,

dignify our character, entitle us to reſpect among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and enſure happineſs and ſafety to us and our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. With hearts expanded beyond the limits of our own country, we moſt ardently hope that the influence of this <hi>novel</hi> but <hi>bright example,</hi> may be extended, till free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, under governments of <hi>laws,</hi> not of <hi>men,</hi> ſhall bleſs the oppreſſed of every climate and country. The <hi>old</hi> will then be experimentally taught by the <hi>new world,</hi> that reaſon, virtue, union, moderation and patriotiſm, can, under the ſmiles of Heaven, without the ſword, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the happineſs of nations by pacific revolutions in their political ſyſtems, whenſoever they require them.</p>
               <p>With the warmeſt wiſhes for your perſonal happineſs, we fervently beſeech the great Author and Supporter of our exiſtence, that he will, by granting you a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of health, long preſerve a life ſo dear to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and exemplary to mankind.</p>

               <p>The virtue, moderation and patriotiſm which have marked the ſteps of the American people, in framing, adopting, and thus far carrying into effect our preſent ſyſtem of government, has excited the admiration of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and it now only remains for us to act up to thoſe principles which ſhould characterize a free and enlightened people, that we may gain reſpect abroad, and enſure hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to ourſelves and to our poſterity.

To obtain this deſirable end, and to eſtabliſh the government of laws, the union of theſe States is abſolutely neceſſary; therefore, in every proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this great, this important object ſhould ever be kept in view; ſo long as our meaſures tend to this, and are marked with the wiſdom of a well-informed, enlightened people, we may reaſonably hope, under the ſmiles of Heaven, to convince the world, that the happineſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can be accompliſhed by pacific revolutions in their political ſyſtems, without the deſtructive intervention of the ſword.</p>
               <p>Your wiſhes for my perſonal happineſs, and fervent prayers for the preſervation of my exiſtence, have made a grateful impreſſion upon me; and I ſhall not fail to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Divine Author of the Univerſe to beſtow thoſe bleſſings upon you and your conſtituents that can make a people happy.</p>

               <p>BEING met in this our annual Aſſembly, for the well ordering the affairs of our religious ſociety, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of univerſal righteouſneſs, our minds have been drawn to conſider, that the Almighty, who ruleth in Heaven and in the kingdoms of men, having permitted a great revolution to take place in the government of this country; we are fervently concerned that the Rulers of the people may be favoured with the counſel of God, the only ſure means of enabling them to fulfil the important truſt committed to their charge; and in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that divine wiſdom and grace, vouchſafed from above, may qualify thee to fill up the duties of the exalted ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which thou art appointed.</p>
               <p>We are ſenſible thou haſt obtained great place in the eſteem and affections of people of all denominations over whom thou preſideſt; and many eminent talents being committed to thy truſt, we much deſire they may be fully devoted to the Lord's honour and ſervice—that thus thou mayeſt be an happy inſtrument in his hand, for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of vice, infidelity and irreligion, and every ſpecies of oppreſſion on the perſons or conſciences of men, ſo that righteouſneſs and peace which truly exalteth a nation, may prevail throughout the land, as the only ſolid foundation that can be laid for the proſperity and happineſs of this or any country.</p>
               <p>The free toleration which the citizens of theſe States enjoy in the public worſhip of the Almighty, agreeable to the dictates of their conſciences, we eſteem among the

               <p>We wiſh not improperly to intrude on thy time or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, nor is it our practice to offer adulation to any; but as we are a people whoſe principles and conduct have been miſrepreſented and traduced, we take the liberty to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee, that we feel our hearts affectionately drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee and thoſe in authority over us, with prayers that thy Preſidency may, under the bleſſing of Heaven, be happy to thyſelf and to the people; that through the increaſe of morality and true religion, divine Providence may condeſcend to look down upon our land with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious eye, and bleſs the inhabitants with the continuance of peace, the dew of Heaven, and the fatneſs of the earth; and enable us gratefully to acknowledge his manifold mercies; and it is our earneſt concern, that he may be pleaſed to grant thee every neceſſary qualification to fill thy weighty and important ſtation to his glory, and that finally, when all terreſtrial honours ſhall fail and paſs away, thou and thy reſpectable conſort may be found worthy to

               <p>We cannot forbear expreſſing our gratitude to God for preſerving your valuable life amidſt ſo many dangers till this time; for inſpiring you with a large portion of the martial ſpirit, and forming you alſo for the milder and more agreeable arts of government and peace; for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing you with great virtues, and calling them into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe by great events; for diſtinguiſhing you with honours, and giving you remarkable prudence and mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration;
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:031402_0081_0FEF9290E74D7278"/>
and for making your extraordinary talents the more conſpicuous, uſeful and durable, by ſuperinducing the noble ornament of humility. Your country has, with one voice, atteſted your excellence by inviting you again to public life, and you have confirmed its judgment by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to freſh ſcenes and toils after you had retired to the ſhade from the burden and heat of a long day.</p>
               <p>Among the many ſignal interpoſitions of Divine Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence, we remark the late important change in the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Government; a change neither effected by accident, nor impoſed by force; but adopted in the boſom of peace, after a free and mature deliberation; and in which a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple widely extended, and various in their habits, are united beyond the moſt raiſed expectations. In theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the United States of America ſtand ſingle among all the nations of the earth. Other revolutions may have been more diverſified and ſplendid, but none more honourable to human nature, and none ſo likely to produce ſuch happy effects. This government being now completely organiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all its departments filled, we truſt that, God will give wiſdom to its councils, and juſtice to its adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that we ſhall at length realize thoſe bleſſings which animated our hopes through a difficult and ruinous war.</p>
               <p>To our conſtant prayers for the welfare of our country, and of the whole human race, we ſhall eſteem it our duty and happineſs, to unite our earneſt endeavours to promote the pure and undefiled religion of Chriſt; for as this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures eternal felicity to men in a future ſtate, ſo we are perſuaded that good Chriſtians will always be good citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and that where righteouſneſs prevails among indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, the nation will be great and happy. Thus while juſt government protects all in their religious rights, true religion affords to government its ſureſt ſupport.</p>
               <p>We implore the Lord God to be your ſun and ſhield, May your adminiſtration be proſperous. May the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of millions come upon you, and your name be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all poſterity. Above all, may you finiſh your courſe

               <p>A PROVIDENCE, that overrules the affairs of men and of nations, has made in every age of the world ſome extraordinary diſplay of power and goodneſs in favour of the human race. Greater events have been aſſigned for the eighteenth century, than ever before took place in the annals of time. Among theſe events, the revolution of our day in North America may be recorded as the moſt important. The diſcovery of the new world was made by a ſpirit of enterpriſe and perſeverance; the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it in people, in arts, and in wealth, was effected
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031402_0086_0FEF92A3E6D07A48"/>
by prudence, economy and induſtry:—But a revolution from a ſtate of oppreſſion to that of freedom and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; and a political reſurrection from a ſtate without harmony, diſpatch and power, to that of order, vigour and glory, have been the achievements of all the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned virtues, which can adorn the ſtateſman and the hero. Through theſe moſt intereſting ſcenes the eyes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were turned to you, and in you they confided. Guarded and directed by the auſpices of our Divine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, you have juſtly merited thoſe ſublime and endearing epithets—the Saviour of your Country, and the Founder of a new Empire.</p>
               <p>Influenced by thoſe ideas, and impreſſed with a ſenſe of that duty and gratitude which are claimed by ſervices for humanity, and arts unrivalled in the annals of fame, we embrace the firſt opportunity, as a Corporation, to expreſs thoſe feelings of obligation, which can never be eraſed through the devaſtations of time. We beg, Sir, of you to accept our ſincere deſire, that the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may protract your life and health to a remote period of time, before you are invited to angelic joys and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limer triumphs.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is with ſingular pleaſure that we, the Preſident and Fellows of Harvard Univerſity in Cambridge, embrace the
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:031402_0089_0FEF92ACAEF7F4D0"/>
opportunity, which your moſt acceptable viſit to this part of the country gives us, of paying our reſpects to the Firſt Magiſtrate of the United States.</p>
               <p>It afforded us the higheſt ſatisfaction, to find this large and reſpectable nation unanimous, in placing at the head of the new government, the firm and diſintereſted Patriot —the illuſtrious and intrepid Soldier, who, during her ſtruggles in the cauſe of liberty, braving every difficulty and danger in the field, under the ſmiles of a kind Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, led her armies to victory and triumph, and finally eſtabliſhed her freedom and independence. Nor were we leſs gratified, when we found, that the perſon whoſe mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſkill and exertions had been ſo happily ſucceeded, actuated by the ſame ſpirit of patriotiſm, did not decline the arduous and toilſome office; but, liſtening to the voice of his country, left the tranquil ſcenes of private life, to ſecure thoſe national bleſſings we were in the utmoſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loſing. We were fully perſuaded, that the Man, who during ſo great a length of time, and in the moſt try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances, had been accepted by the multitude of his brethren, would, in this new ſtation, enjoy their entire confidence, and enſure their higheſt eſteem; nor have we been diſappointed.</p>
               <p>Permit us, Sir, to congratulate you on the happy eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of the Government of the Union, on the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm and wiſdom, which have marked its public tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and the very general approbation, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have given to its meaſures.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, Sir, being fully ſenſible that you are ſtrongly impreſſed with the neceſſity of religion, virtue and ſolid learning, for ſupporting freedom and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fixing the happineſs of the people upon a firm and permanent baſis, we beg leave to recommend to your favourable notice, the Univerſity entruſted to our care, which was early founded for promoting theſe important ends.</p>
               <p>When you took the command of the troops of your country, you ſaw the Univerſity in a ſtate of depreſſion— its members diſperſed—its literary treaſures removed—and the Muſes fled from the din of arms, then heard within its
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031402_0090_0FEF92B0CECADD80"/>
walls. Happily reſtored, in the courſe of a few months, by your glorious ſucceſſes, to its former privileges, and to a ſtate of tranquillity, it received its returning members; and our youth have ſince purſued, without interruption, their literary courſes, and fitted themſelves for uſefulneſs in Church and State. The public rooms, which you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaw empty, are now repleniſhed with the neceſſary means of improving the human mind in literature and ſcience; and every thing within the walls wears the aſpect of peace, ſo neceſſary to the cultivation of the liberal arts.</p>
               <p>While we exert ourſelves, in our corporate capacity, to promote the great objects of this inſtitution, we reſt aſſured of your protection and patronage.</p>
               <p>We wiſh you, Sir, the aid and ſupport of Heaven, while you are diſcharging the duties of your moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtation. May your ſucceſs, in promoting the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the nation, be equal to your higheſt wiſhes! And after you ſhall have long rejoiced in the proſperity and glory of your country, may you receive the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Him, who ruleth among the nations!</p>

               </opener>
               <p>WE beg leave to expreſs our happineſs in the honour you confer upon us by your viſit to this capital.</p>
               <p>We are happy in the opportunity of again making our perſonal acknowledgments to a character, to which, on every principle, we are ſo deeply indebted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="unknown:031402_0091_0FEF8ED5F8DBADE8"/>Every motive of eſteem, duty and affection have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to form in our minds the ſtrongeſt attachment that the freeſt people can feel to the moſt deſerving citizen.</p>
               <p>As men, we have long ſince conſidered you, under God, as the great and glorious Avenger of the violated rights of humanity—as citizens, we have obſerved with peculiar ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction, that you have unvariably reſpected thoſe liberties, which you have ſo ſucceſsfully defended—and as inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of a great commercial town, we attribute the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we enjoy to the ſingular merit and ſucceſs of thoſe meaſures, in the progreſs of the war, which you had the honour to conduct.</p>
               <p>It cannot but afford you the higheſt pleaſure, when you compare our preſent ſituation with the ſignal diſtreſſes to which we were expoſed during the period in which this town was in the poſſeſſion of an exaſperated enemy. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignant at the multiplied reſtraints of hoſtile domination, we ſought an aſylum among our friends and connections in the country, and cheerfully abandoned our property and poſſeſſions in the common cauſe of America—that we were ſo ſoon happily reinſtated, may be juſtly imputed to the wiſdom of thoſe arrangements which compelled our invaders, in their retreat, to adopt a leſs deſtructive policy than that, which on other occaſions, they ſo wantonly practiſed.</p>
               <p>In every trying viciſſitude, we have remarked the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and unaffected piety of your heart, and the wiſdom and moderation of your counſels.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen you relinquiſh the eaſe and independence of private fortune to lead in the untried dangers of a war, at the riſque of your life and reputation. With pleaſure we have viewed you retiring in victory, and exhibiting a new example of patriotic virtue to an admiring world; and we now feel a ſtill higher ſatisfaction at your having once more ſacrificed the ſweets of domeſtic retirement in obedience to the united voice of your countrymen.</p>
               <p>Theſe, Sir, are the ſentiments and reflections which nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally occur on an attentive conſideration of your paſt conduct. To the future we look for thoſe virtues which adorn the Man, and mark the wiſe and accompliſhed

Legiſlator. We anticipate from your diſcernment the happy union of liberty and law, lenity and vigour, mercy and juſtice: the enlightened policy of a mind calm amidſt the influence, of power, and uncorrupted by the faſcinating allurements of avarice or ambition.</p>
               <p>With theſe impreſſions, the preſervation of your life through the varied ſcenes in which you have been enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, demands our grateful acknowledgments to the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Diſpoſer of human events.</p>
               <p>It is one of the firſt wiſhes of our hearts, that you may be as happy in your preſent elevated ſtation, as you have been diſtinguiſhed in your military character; and it is our fervent prayer to the Almighty Ruler of the Univerſe, that the inviſible hand which led the citizens of America through the dangers and calamities of war, may ſtill guard and protect you as an ornament to human nature, and a bleſſing to your country.</p>

honour done them on this occaſion. The too viſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and poverty of this town muſt be their excuſe, that they have not offered to the illuſtrious Character who now viſits them, a reception more anſwerable to his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and more expreſſive of their own veneration.</p>
               <p>The bleſſings of Independence and a Republican Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment muſt ever excite our gratitude and affection to ſo eminent a Supporter of the Public Liberty, whoſe wiſdom and valor have ſo ſucceſsfully defended the rights of his country.

In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the conteſt with Great Britain, this town were early in their exertions in the common cauſe; and were not diſcouraged, when they foreſaw that reverſe of their ſituation, which the war has neceſſarily produced. The return of peace did not reſtore to us the former ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the fiſhery, which hath remained under pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar diſcouragements: and we have yet patiently to expect that attention of the General Government, which may remedy theſe evils, and which the ſubject may deſerve, from its extenſive importance to the commerce of the United States.</p>
               <p>The preſent Government of the United States com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our ready ſubmiſſion and inviolable attachment; and we deem it a peculiar felicity, that the higheſt dignity of that government is ſo properly veſted in you; in whom all America repoſe the moſt entire confidence; in whoſe adminiſtration, the world will admire the example of a Patriot Ruler.</p>

While we view it as an high honour done us, a moſt obliging mark of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and regard ſhewn us, in making us this viſit; moſt readily would we manifeſt the ſatisfaction we feel in being gratified with an opportunity of ſeeing the man, whoſe deeds have been ſo illuſtrious; and of paying our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſpects to the character, which not only the people of America, but all the world are agreed to admire and cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebrate. How great ſoever, Sir, we had conceived our obligations to be, and how ſtrong ſoever the motives of attachments we were under to you, for thoſe military ſervices and achievements, from which ſuch eſſential ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efits have been derived,—an addition to thoſe obligations we are ſenſible is now made; and ſtill further reaſons of

attachment are preſented, from your acceptance of that important truſt in our newly inſtituted government, which was ſo earneſtly and univerſally deſired. That remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit of patriotiſm, of benevolence towards this people, which has been ſo conſpicuous in your paſt conduct, we doubt not has determined you to this arduous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. Whatever therefore may contribute to the eaſe and happineſs of your adminiſtration, whatever returns of reſpect and dutiful ſubmiſſion it becomes a grateful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make, we wiſh you to receive and enjoy.</p>
               <p>Long may you be continued, diffuſing thoſe bleſſings of freedom and good government, by which our proſperity ſhall be further promoted. Long may you be indulged a ſeries of the beſt ſatisfactions, which the honours and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this world can afford.

               <p>WHEN, by the unanimous ſuffrages of your country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you were called to preſide over their public councils, the citizens of the town of Newbury-Port participated in the general joy, that aroſe from anticipating an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conducted by the man, to whoſe wiſdom and valor they owed their liberties.</p>
               <p>Pleaſing were their reflections, that he, who, by the bleſſing of Heaven, had given them their independence, would again relinquiſh the felicities of domeſtic retirement, to teach them its juſt value.</p>
               <p>They have ſeen you, victorious, leave the field, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the applauſes of a grateful country; and they now ſee you entwining the olive with the laurel, and, in peace, giving ſecurity and happineſs to a people, whom, in war, you covered with glory.</p>

               <p>They cannot hope, Sir, to exhibit any peculiar marks of attachment to your perſon; for, could they expreſs their feelings of the moſt ardent and ſincere gratitude, they would only repeat the ſentiments, which are deeply impreſſed upon the hearts of all their fellow-citizens: but in juſtice to themſelves, they beg leave to aſſure you, that, in no part of the United States are thoſe ſentiments of gratitude and affection more cordial and animated, than in the town, which at this time is honoured with your preſence.</p>

               <p>We attempt not to recount the number, variety and merit, of your ſervices to our common country; theſe are already written in indelible characters on the heart of every true American, which the faithful page of hiſtory will tranſmit to generations unborn: but to expreſs our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to him, who with a magnanimity peculiar to himſelf, under the ſmiles of Heaven, defended the rights, and gave birth to the empire of America. Permit us to add the grateful ſenſe we entertain of our high obligations to you, Sir, as a town, for our ſecurity from that devaſtation which was the fate of many other ſea-port towns in the Union, and would probably have been our's, had not the enemy, by your wiſe and ſpirited exertions, been driven

               <p>We felicitate you, and theſe States, on your ſpeedy recovery from your late ſickneſs, and ardently wiſh your life may be continued a bleſſing to yourſelf, and your country, and that at ſome far diſtant period, full of years, and the moſt benevolent and glorious achievements, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed with the tears of grateful millions, you may be called to inherit an incorruptible crown in the realms of glory.</p>

               <p>New Jerſey having been the central theatre of the late war, and the ſcene of ſome of the moſt important mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary operations, which diſtinguiſhed the American ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and added new honours to their illuſtrious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, we are particularly induced to commemorate thoſe brilliant exploits, which, while they immortalized your name, afforded peace and ſecurity to the inhabitants of the State.</p>
               <p>Adulation, Sir, we are as much indiſpoſed to offer, as you can be diſinclined to receive; but while we add our voice to that of the world, in celebrating your military achievements, we cannot refrain from acknowledging the attention, which you have always paid to the laws of the State, and your inflexible perſeverance, amidſt all the dire neceſſities of war, in preferring the rights of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen to the convenience of the ſoldier; thus, while equal to the moſt renowned warriors as a hero, you have proved yourſelf ſuperior to them as a citizen.</p>
               <p>As New Jerſey was early and unanimous in adopting the Conſtitution, under which you rule—as every voice called you forth to the office of Chief Magiſtrate, and every perſon looks up to it and you for protection, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and good government,—we may, we truſt, aſſure you,

               <p>The opportunities which were afforded me, in the trying viciſſitudes of our arduous ſtruggle, to remark the generous ſpirit, which animated the exertions of your cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens, have impreſſed a remembrance of their worth, which no length of time, or change of circumſtances, can efface.</p>
               <p>To the gallantry and firmneſs of their efforts in the Field, they have added the wiſdom and liberality of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed patriotiſm in Council. Appreciating, with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious diſcernment, the bleſſings of that independence, which their efforts contributed to eſtabliſh, they were unanimouſly agreed to ſecure and perpetuate them, by adopting a Conſtitution, which promiſed equal and efficient protection to the privileges of Confederated America.</p>
               <p>The aſſurance now given by your honorable body, to ſupport the federal ſyſtem, is a renewed proof of the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in which it is held, and a happy indication of the beneficial effects already experienced, and hereafter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to flow from its operations. As ſuch it is to me peculiarly grateful, and muſt be ſo to every citizen of the Union, whoſe wiſh is private proſperity and public honour.</p>
               <p>Allow me, Gentlemen, to aſſure you of every endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our on my part, to promote theſe deſirable objects.</p>
               <p>In making my acknowledgments for the favourable opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions you expreſs of my military conduct, as it reſpected the obſervance of civil rights, it is juſtice to aſſign great merit to the temper of thoſe citizens, whoſe eſtates were more immediately the ſcene of warfare. Their perſonal ſervices were rendered without conſtraint, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of their affairs ſubmitted to without diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction. It was the triumph of patriotiſm over perſonal conſideration, and our preſent enjoyment of peace and freedom reward the ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Imploring a continuance of theſe enjoyments to our country, and individual happineſs to the citizens who procured them, I offer up a ſincere prayer for you, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and your conſtituents.</p>

               <p>POSSESSED of every feeling that can act on grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearts, the Society of the Cincinnati eſtabliſhed in the State of South Carolina, beg leave to congratulate you on the happy occaſion which has once again placed you in a ſituation of rendering general good to their country.</p>
               <p>Retired from the buſy ſcenes of life, to reap the rewards of your virtuous acts, and to enjoy the glory you had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obtained, your fellow-citizens received you with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting happineſs; they ſaw in you the patriot-hero, the friend and ſaviour of their country; and with hearts-filled with gratitude and affection, they invoked the Allwiſe Diſpoſer of human events to render that retirement happy.</p>
               <p>The period, however, arrived when the abilities of the virtuous patriot were again to be called forth to aſſume a public character. A general political government was formed, by which the happineſs of the country for whoſe liberty you had fought, was now to be eſtabliſhed. To preſide at the head of this new government, to eſtabliſh it with permanency, the people ſought, in the Great WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, the virtues on which they could rely with ſafety, and from which they might expect to receive every bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit without alloy. They had experienced his abilities, they had experienced his integrity, and his inviolable love for his country. Nor did they ſeek in vain. The ſame noble ſpirit which actuated you at the beginning of our late conteſt with Great Britain, now operated. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and obeyed the ſummons; and although you ſhould make a ſacrifice, yet you nobly determined, it was the voice of your country, in whoſe ſervice every inferior con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of caſe and retirement muſt give place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:031402_0100_0FEF92CA910EBAD0"/>As citizens, we congratulate you, Sir, on this addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al proof of your country's confidence. As ſoldiers who partook with you in many of the dangers and hardſhips which attended the general army under your command, we beg leave to expreſs our warmeſt attachment to your perſon, and ſincereſt wiſh for your happineſs and honour; and that we may, under your rule, ſupported by your amiable virtues, happily experience and long enjoy the fruits of a government which has for its baſis the good of the people of America.</p>

               <p>FROM a conviction that the diſpoſitions of the Society of the Cincinnati eſtabliſhed in the State of South Carolina are peculiarly friendly to me, I cannot receive their congratulations on the occaſion which gave birth to their Addreſs, without emotions of peculiar ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The intereſt that my fellow-citizens ſo kindly took in the happineſs which they ſaw me enjoy in my retirement after the war, is rather to be attributed to their great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in my favour, than to any ſingular title I had to their gratitude and affection.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding I was conſcious that my abilities had been too highly appreciated; yet I felt, that, whatever they were, my country had a juſt claim upon me, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the exerciſe of them ſhould be deemed conducive to its welfare. With ſuch feelings, I could not refuſe to obey that voice which I had always been accuſtomed to reſpect, nor heſitate to forego a reſolution which I had
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:031402_0100_0FEF92CA910EBAD0"/>
formed of paſſing the remainder of my days in retirement. And ſo far am I from having reaſon to repent of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided meaſure I took, in the criſis of organizing a new general government, that I ought rather, perhaps, to felicitate myſelf upon having met the wiſhes, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the aſſiſtance of a patriotic and enlightened people, in my arduous undertaking.</p>
               <p>Always ſatisfied that I ſhould be ſupported in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of my office, by the friends of good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general, I counted upon the favourable ſentiment and conduct of the officers of the late army in particular. Nor has my expectation been deceived. As they were formerly diſtinguiſhed by their eminent fortitude and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm in their military ſervice, during the moſt trying occaſions, ſo are the ſame men now, mingled in the maſs of citizens, conſpicuous for a diſintereſted love of order, and a jealous attention to the preſervation of the rights of mankind. Nor is it conceivable that any members of the community ſhould be more worthy of the enjoyment of liberty, or more zealous to perpetuate its duration, than thoſe who have ſo nobly and ſo ſucceſsfully defended its ſtandard in the new world.</p>
               <p>I ſincerely thank you, Gentlemen, for your expreſſion of attachment to my perſon, and wiſh for my happineſs and honour. On my part, I only dare to engage, it ſhall be my inceſſant ſtudy, that you may happily experience and long enjoy the fruits of a government, which has for its baſis the good of the American people.</p>

               <p>WE have been long impatient to teſtify our joy and unbounded confidence on your being called, by an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vote, to the firſt ſtation of a country, in which that unanimity could not have been obtained without the previous merit of unexampled ſervices, of eminent wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and unblemiſhed virtue. Our congratulations have not reached you ſooner, becauſe our ſcattered ſituation prevented the communication and the collecting of thoſe ſentiments, which warmed every breaſt. But the delay has furniſhed us with the opportunity, not merely of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaging the happineſs to be expected under your adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, but of bearing teſtimony to that which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience already. It is your peculiar talent, in war and in peace, to afford ſecurity to thoſe, who commit their protection into your hands. In war, you ſhield them from the ravages of armed hoſtility: in peace, you eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh public tranquility, by the juſtice and moderation, not leſs than by the vigour of your government. By example as well as by vigilance, you extend the influence of laws on the manners of our fellow-citizens. You encourage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for religion, and inculcate by words and actions, that principle on which the welfare of nations ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, that a ſuperintending Providence governs the events of the world, and watches over the conduct of men. Your exalted maxims, and unwearied attention to the moral and phyſical improvement of our country have produced already the happieſt effects. Under your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, America is animated with zeal for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and encouragement of uſeful literature; ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves her agriculture, extends her commerce, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:031402_0101_0FEF932FC16C8C38"/>
with foreign nations a dignity unknown to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. From theſe happy events, in which none can feel a warmer intereſt than ourſelves, we derive additional pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure by recollecting that you, Sir, have been the principal inſtrument to effect ſo rapid a change in our political ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. This proſpect of national proſperity is peculiarly pleaſing to us on another account; becauſe whilſt our country preſerves her freedom and independence, we ſhall have a well-founded title to claim from her juſtice the equal rights of citizenſhip, as the price of our blood ſpilt under your eyes, and of our common exertions for her defence, under your auſpicious conduct; rights rendered more dear to us by the remembrance of former hardſhips. When we pray for the preſervation of them, where they have been granted; and expect the full extenſion of them from the juſtice of thoſe States which ſtill reſtrict them; when we ſolicit the protection of Heaven over our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon country, we neither omit, or can omit recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your preſervation to the ſingular care of Divine Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence; becauſe we conceive that no human means are ſo available to promote the welfare of the United States, as the prolongation of your health and life, in which are included the energy of your example, the wiſdom of your counſels, and the perſuaſive eloquence of your virtues.</p>

               <p>WHILE I now receive with much ſatisfaction your congratulations on my being called, by an unanimous vote, to the firſt ſtation in my country,—I cannot but duly, notice your politeneſs in offering an apology for the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable delay. As that delay has given you an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of realizing, inſtead of anticipating the benefits of the general government, you will do me the juſtice to believe, that your teſtimony of the increaſe of the public proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, enhances the pleaſure which I ſhould otherwiſe have experienced from your affectionate Addreſs.</p>
               <p>I feel that my conduct in war and in peace, has met with more general approbation than could reaſonably have been expected; and I find myſelf diſpoſed to conſider that fortunate circumſtance in a great degree reſulting from the able ſupport and extraordinary candour of my fellow-citizens of all denominations.</p>
               <p>The proſpect of national proſperity now before us is truly animating, and ought to excite the exertions of all good men to eſtabliſh and ſecure the happineſs of their country, in the permanent duration of its freedom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence. America, under the ſmiles of a Divine Providence, the protection of a good government, and the cultivation of manners, morals, and piety, cannot fail of attaining an uncommon degree of eminence, in litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, commerce, agriculture, improvements at home and reſpectability abroad.</p>
               <p>As mankind become more liberal they will be more apt to allow, that all thoſe who conduct themſelves as worthy members of the community are equally entitled to the protection of civil government. I hope ever to ſee America among the foremoſt nations in examples of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:031402_0102_0FEF92CF21BAB848"/>
and liberality. And I preſume that your fellow-citizens will not forget the patriotic part which you took in the accompliſhment of their revolution, and the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of their government: or, the important aſſiſtance which they received from a nation in which the Roman Catholic faith is profeſſed.</p>
               <p>I thank you, Gentlemen, for your kind concern for me. While my life and my health ſhall continue, in whatever ſituation I may be, it ſhall be my conſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to juſtify the favourable ſentiments which you are pleaſed to expreſs of my conduct. And may the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of your ſociety in America, animated alone by the pure ſpirit of Chriſtianity, and ſtill conducting themſelves as the faithful ſubjects of our free government, enjoy every temporal and ſpiritual felicity.</p>

               <p>THE Federal Conſtitution being adopted, it became the wiſh of the people of this State that you ſhould be elevated to the Preſidency of the Union; and the two branches of the Legiſlature take the firſt occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to your acceptance their congratulations on the unanimity of your election.</p>
               <p>In the great concerns of mankind, ſucceſs has not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been attendant on the performance of duty; and where it has, the ſanction of public approbation has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been withheld; but it was reſerved for you, in the midſt of the moſt arduous difficulties, not only to
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:031402_0103_0FEF92D0E58F66F8"/>
be ſucceſsful, but to have been ſo with univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>
               <p>Raiſed by your virtues and ſervices to the head of a government, pervading ſo many independent States, the general confidence is in favour of your juſtice; and, while the hiſtory of nations informs that the errors of rulers have often proceeded from the want of information, we ſhall not heſitate to lay before you ſuch facts and opinions reſpecting this State, as may appear to us to be incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent or neceſſary. In doing this, it ſhall be our aim to unite plainneſs with reſpect, and integrity with truth.</p>
               <p>Sir, in the courſe of the war which eſtabliſhed our independence, our citizens made proportionate exertions with thoſe of any part of the whole, and, in point of property, they ſuffered the moſt. The peace found the country a waſte. With many natural advantages, we flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ourſelves with a ſpeedy recovery, when we were attacked by the Indians.</p>
               <p>On this ſubject we wiſh to be delicate. Much has been already ſaid—we have aſſerted, and it has been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. Removed at a diſtance from the centre, our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been liable to miſrepreſentation; but we truſt that by this time, they are better explained; in the mean while, our population has been checked, and our agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diminiſhed—the blood of our citizens has been ſpill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our public reſources greatly exhauſted; and our fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers ſtill open to freſh ravages. The failure of the late negociation for a peace with the Creek Indians, and the circumſtances which attended the ſame, are the beſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the neceſſity of our meaſures, and a proof of the late hoſtile diſpoſition of theſe people; but under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the government and power of the Union, it is to be hoped and expected that a different conduct will on their part prevail: on our part, nothing ſhall be wanting to promote ſo deſirable an eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>Another circumſtance of additional calamity attendant on our being the ſouth frontier of the Union, is, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of our black people croſſing the Spaniſh line, from whence we have never been able to reclaim them. This has already been productive of much injury to private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:031402_0103_0FEF92D0E58F66F8"/>
and if not ſpeedily reſtrained, may grow into an evil of national magnitude.</p>
               <p>We take this occaſion of bringing this buſineſs into view, with a perfect reliance, that you will cauſe ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions to be made, as ſhall be neceſſary to bring about a remedy.</p>
               <p>We requeſt you will accept our cordial wiſhes for your health and happineſs, and that you may long continue to enjoy that confidence which has been ſo eminently placed in you by the people of the United States.</p>

               <p>From the obſervation, that, in the great concerns of mankind, ſucceſs has not always been attendant on the performance of duty, and that, where it has, the ſanction of public approbation has frequently been withheld; I am naturally led to reflect on the unlimited gratitude which we owe, as a nation, to the Supreme Arbiter of human events for his interpoſition in our favour, as well as on the ſingular obligations which are due from me, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:031402_0104_0FEF92D4ED51DE20"/>
for the indulgent ſentiments which my fellow-citizens have always had the goodneſs to entertain of my conduct.</p>
               <p>Raiſed, as I am, to the head of a government pervad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo vaſt a territory—and poſſeſſing, (as I flatter myſelf I do) the confidence of the people in regard to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,—I aſſure you, Gentlemen, that nothing could be more conſonant to my wiſhes, than to be favoured with ſuch facts and opinions reſpecting the condition of the States as may appear proper and neceſſary. For I am duly ſenſible that many errors which would reſult from want of information, may be obviated by timely and juſt repreſentations.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant how much the local ſituation of your State expoſed its inhabitants to ſuffer the diſtreſſes of the late war in a ſevere manner; nor how manfully they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted themſelves in defence of the common cauſe, during the ſtruggle which eſtabliſhed our independence. Waſted as your country was at the return of peace, and expoſed as your frontiers have ſince been to the ravages of the Indians, I cannot but flatter myſelf that you will ere long realize the bleſſings which were to be expected from your natural reſources, and find a compenſation for your ſufferings in the benefits of an efficient General Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
               <p>It will not be expected, I preſume, on this occaſion, that I ſhould enter into the merits of the delicate ſubject to which you allude. It may be ſufficient to ſay, that while I regret extremely the failure of the late negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for peace with the Creek Indians, I am ſatisfied that the explanations which have been obtained through au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic channels will be of eminent ſervice. I am alſo convinced that nothing will be wanting on your part to concur in the accompliſhment of a pacification; and I ſtill hope, that under the influence of the General Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment that deſirable object may be effected. With reſpect to this ſubject in general, as well as to the other calamity which you mentioned as reſulting from your being the ſouth frontier of the Union, I requeſt you will he perſuaded that I ſhall make ſuch uſe of the powers

               <p>WE, the Delegates of the State Societies of the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnati, aſſembled at our triennial General Meeting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate you on being unanimouſly elected the Head of our riſing Republic.</p>
               <p>As a part of the Community, we felicitate our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on this happy event; and we embrace the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of expreſſing our ſentiments, with no leſs zeal than ſincerity.</p>
               <p>When we ſay we love and revere you as a Father, we not only ſpeak the language of our own hearts, but we ſpeak the language of all who have fought, ſuffered, and conquered under your command. Were poverty and conſciouſneſs of duty our only recompenſe, ſtill ſhould we glory in the part we have acted. For our motives, as they regarded our country, will afford us ſatisfaction, as well through the viciſſitudes of life, as in the moment of diſſolution.

that the conduct of the Officers and Soldiers of the late American armies has not been leſs patriotic in peace than it was glorious in war.</p>
               <p>A good Conſtitution was the object for which we riſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our lives, and experienced unparalleled difficulties.

               <p>We need not enumerate your titles to the gratitude of your country; or echo, in the ſuffrages of our particular Conſtituents, the public ſentiment. But we may ſay, that we ſee with exultation our countrymen beginning to reap the fruits of Independence under the auſpices of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was more inſtrumental than any other in its eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment.

               <p>ALTHOUGH it is eaſier for you to conceive, than for me to explain the pleaſing ſenſations which have been excited in my breaſt, by your congratulations on my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment

to the head of this riſing republic: yet I muſt take the liberty to thank you ſincerely for the polite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which you felicitate our countrymen, and teſtify your regard to me, on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>In addition to that reward for your ſufferings and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which ariſes from the conſciouſneſs of having done your duty, you have erected monuments more expreſſive of your merits than even the univerſal applauſe of your country, in the eſtabliſhment of its independence and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty. Nor ſhould any poſſible circumſtances of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or adverſity compel you to give up that ſweet ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the part you have acted, which ought to attend you as well through the viciſſitudes of life as in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſſolution.</p>
               <p>The candour of your fellow-citizens acknowledges the patriotiſm of your conduct in peace, as their gratitude has declared their obligations for your fortitude and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in war: a knowledge that they now do juſtice to the purity of your intentions ought to be your higheſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as the fact is demonſtrative of your greateſt glory.</p>

A government, promiſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and proſperity to the people of the United States, is eſtabliſhed; and its operations hitherto have been ſuch as to juſtify the moſt ſanguine expectations of further ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. It was naturally to be expected, that lives which had long ſince been devoted on the altar of Freedom, could never be offered at the ſhrines of Anarchy or Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm; and the offer which you make of the reſidue of thoſe lives to ſupport the adminiſtration of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not leſs a proof of its excellence, than an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thoſe concerned in its execution to uſe their beſt endeavours to make it a ſource of extenſive and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent bleſſings to their country.</p>
               <p>Whatever titles my military ſervices may have given me to the regard of my country, they are principally corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the firm ſupport of my brave and faithful aſſociates in the field.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WE, the people of the State of South Carolina, now met and ſitting in Convention, beg leave to addreſs you, and to embrace this firſt opportunity which has been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us of congratulating you on the high and important ſtation of Preſident of the United States. Such, Sir, has been the impreſſion made upon the public mind by a due ſenſe of your eminent ſervices, and ſuch the affection of a nation, whoſe deareſt rights you have defended, that one wiſh pervaded the whole continent, of placing you at the head of the Federal Republic, and of enjoying under your protection, as our Firſt Magiſtrate, the bleſſings of that free government, for the attainment of which we are ſo much indebted to your exertions as our General. The promiſes of your earlier life, Sir, had prepared your fellow-citizens for your acceptance of the military command in 1775, when dangers and difficulties ſurrounded us on all ſides, and the proſpect was dark and gloomy; but they muſt ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member with gratitude and admiration the wiſdom and energy of that ſyſtem, which could induce men accuſtomed to the moſt perfect equality to ſubmit to the rigorous duties of a camp, and thus convert the tumultuary array of an undiſciplined yeomanry into a permanent force,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:031402_0106_0FEF92D82C0ACF90"/>
capable of making head againſt the veteran army of our enemies. With ſimilar ſentiments do they call to mind the efforts of that heroic fortitude, which deſpaired not in the worſt of times, but roſe ſuperior to every misfortune, infuſing new ſpirit into the boſoms of an unfortunate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and animating them by the force of example to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the ſevereſt toil with alacrity, and to endure with perſeverance the moſt accumulated diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>It was the will of an Allwiſe Providence, that the great objects we were contending for ſhould not be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ſome difficulty, and that we ſhould be taught to obſerve and to value the virtues which ſpring up in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; but the time of our ſevere trial was at length ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated—the cloud which had hovered over us ſo long was at length diſpelled, and the ſun of American glory ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in its full ſplendour. To have borne this change of fortune with equanimity, to have employed the laſt hours of command in reconciling our gallant ſoldiers to a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment which their long ſuffering during the war had but ill prepared them for; and having checked the rage of civil diſcord in its infancy, to have reſigned all power, and cheerfully deſcended into the walks of private life,— are circumſtances that muſt forever illumine the page of hiſtory, and which, as they can never be effaced from our remembrance, ſo we truſt they will be deeply engraven upon the minds of our poſterity.</p>
               <p>To tranſmit to that poſterity the ſpirit of a free Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in its native purity is the hope which animates us all; we hope alſo, that they will learn from us to cheriſh every grateful ſentiment towards you, Sir, and that they will be proud, as we are, to participate individually in the honour which America may ſo juſtly claim to herſelf, of having produced a citizen, whoſe love of glory was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of ambition, whoſe view embraced no objects but the freedom and the happineſs of his countrymen; whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity was equal to their moſt unbounded confidence, and who, combining the prudence of retreat with all the active valor of attack, was at once the ſhield and the ſword of his native country. The tranquillity of retirement, after the dangers of war and the fatigues of public life, is one
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:031402_0107_0FEF92D9BA5190C0"/>
of thoſe rewards which exalted merit ſeems ever entitled to, but which your fellow-citizens were conſtrained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you. Independence had been eſtabliſhed, but the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous taſk of internal legiſlation ſtill remained, and the United States were yet to eſtabliſh upon the firmeſt baſis that ſtation amongſt the nations of the earth, which they had of right aſſumed. Called upon for this ſacred purpoſe, you have liſtened, Sir, to the voice of your country—you have given a further proof of your never-failing attachment to her intereſts; and we can only hope, in the warmeſt wiſhes which we form for the good of the public weal, that your adminiſtration in the office of Preſident of the United States may be as proſperous as your acceptance of it has been honourable and patriotic.</p>
               <p>We will not, Sir, by thus giving way to the effuſions of our hearts, any longer intrude upon that time which is devoted to the general good, but conclude with offering up our prayers to the great Father of the Univerſe, that he may be pleaſed to ſhed his influence over all your councils, and that having ſaved your country and given an awful leſſon to all mankind, you may finally, in the fulneſs of your years, cloſe the long glories of an illuſtrious life, not only with the conſciouſneſs of having deſerved, but with the comfort and ſatisfaction of having received every proof of reſpect and eſteem from the heart-felt gratitude of your fellow-citizens.</p>

               <p>THE congratulatory Addreſs of the People of the State of South Carolina on my election to the office of Preſident of the United States, expreſſed in ſuch forcible and endearing terms, affects me with the livelieſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſatisfaction, and induces me to requeſt their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of my ſincereſt acknowledgments.</p>
               <p>Flattering as it muſt have been to me to find the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary unanimity of the people of the United States, in placing me at the head of their federal republic, I am ſtill more pleaſed with the recollection of the manly conduct on their part, which, in the iſſue of an arduous ſtruggle, put them in a condition to enjoy the bleſſings of a free government. It was owing to their ſteady and ſtrenuous ſupport, with the ſmiles of a gracious Providence, that I did not ſink under the oppreſſion I felt from a diffidence in my abilities to conduct their military operations. It was a diſtreſſing conſideration, that ſo good a cauſe might be endangered by a ſingle falſe ſtep on the part of their General. But in ſuch a cauſe, although ſurrounded with difficulties and dangers on every ſide and in the midſt of dark and gloomy proſpects, it would have argued the moſt infamous puſillanimity to have deſpaired of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Seconded by ſuch a body of yeomanry as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the ſtandard of liberty, fighting in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive land—fighting for all that freemen hold dear, and whoſe docility ſoon ſupplied the place of diſcipline—it was ſcarcely in human nature, under its worſt character, to have abandoned them in their misfortunes; nor is it for me to claim any ſingular title to merit, for having ſhared in a common danger, and triumphed with them, after a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the ſevereſt toil and moſt accumulated diſtreſs, over a formidable foe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="unknown:031402_0108_0FEF92DE3425F5D8"/>The value of liberty was thus enhanced in our eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by the difficulty of its attainment; and the worth of characters appreciated by the trial of adverſity. The tempeſt of war having at length been ſucceeded by the ſunſhine of peace, our citizen-ſoldiers impreſſed an uſeful leſſon of patriotiſm on mankind, by nobly returning, with impaired conſtitutions and unſatisfied claims, after ſuch long ſufferings and ſevere diſappointments, to their former occupations. Poſterity, as well as the preſent age, will doubtleſs regard with admiration and gratitude the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, perſeverance and valor which achieved our revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; they will cheriſh the remembrance of virtues which had but few parallels in former times, and which will add new luſtre to the moſt ſplendid page of hiſtory.</p>
               <p>If there be for me any peculiarly juſt ſubject of exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with honeſt pride I avow the fact, it is in being the citizen of a country, whoſe inhabitants were ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and diſintereſted, as to ſacrifice local prejudices and temporary ſyſtems, for the ſake of rendering ſecure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent that Independency, which had been the price of ſo much treaſure and blood. Animated with a hope of tranſmitting to poſterity the ſpirit of a free Conſtitution in its native purity, they have, ſince the concluſion of the war, evinced the rectitude of their principles, as well as proved themſelves, by their practice, worthy of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</p>
               <p>For myſelf, notwithſtanding my former intentions and declarations, I could not heſitate to return to public life, when, from all the circumſtances within my knowledge, I had collected it to be my duty, becauſe it was apparently the wiſh of a whole nation; nor ſhall I regret the loſs of that tranquillity in retirement, which my time of life and ſtate of health ſeemed in ſome meaſure to authorize and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, if I may ſtill be an inſtrument of any good to that country, which has continued to aſſiſt my adminiſtration with ſuch generous and unlimited confidence.</p>
               <p>I pray you to be perſuaded, that while I receive with great ſenſibility, ſuch repeated proofs of the partiality of my fellow-citizens in my favour, I feel increaſing obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to devote my labours unremittingly to the public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;

The unbiaſſed voice of a great nation, which unanimouſly called you to that important truſt, is an event, of which the annals of hiſtory afford no example; nor will future time ſee it followed, unleſs the moſt tranſcendant merit and the cleareſt ſame ſhould be united in the ſame perſon.</p>

               <p>From our moſt excellent Conſtitution, and the benign influence of thoſe virtues which characterize your admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration, we entertain the moſt pleaſing hopes of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of commerce, the encouragement of agriculture

               <p>Deprived as we heretofore have been of the invaluable rights of free citizens, we now (with a deep ſenſe of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Almighty Diſpoſer of all events) behold a gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment erected by the Majeſty of the People—a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which to bigotry gives no ſanction—to perſecution no aſſiſtance: but generouſly affording to all, liberty of conſcience, and immunities of citizenſhip: deeming every one, of whatever nation, tongue or language, equal parts of the great governmental machine. This ſo ample and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Federal Union, whoſe baſe is philanthropy, mutual confidence, and public virtue, we cannot but acknowledge to be the work of the Great God, who ruleth in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, doing whatſoever ſeemeth to him good.</p>

The reflection on the days of difficulty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which are paſt, is rendered the more ſweet from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs that they are ſucceeded by days of uncommon proſperity and ſecurity.</p>
               <p>If we have wiſdom to make the beſt uſe of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages with which we are now favoured, we cannot fail, under the juſt adminiſtration of a good government, to become a great and a happy people.</p>
               <p>The citizens of the United States of America, have a right to applaud themſelves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of imitation. All poſſeſs a like liberty of conſcience, and immunities of citizenſhip. It is now no more that tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration is ſpoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one claſs of people that another enjoyed the exerciſe of their inherent natural rights. For happily the government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no ſanction, to perſecution no aſſiſtance, requires only that they who live under its protection ſhould demean themſelves as good citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, in giving it on all occaſions their effectual ſupport.</p>
               <p>It would be inconſiſtent with the frankneſs of my char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, not to avow that I am pleaſed with your favourable opinion of my adminiſtration and fervent wiſhes for my felicity.

               <p>IN every act of my adminiſtration, I have ſought the happineſs of my fellow-citizens. My ſyſtem for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of this object has uniformly been, to overlook all perſonal, local, and partial conſiderations; to contemplate the United States as one great whole; to conſider that ſudden impreſſions, when erroneous, would yield to candid reflection; and to conſult only the ſubſtantial and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent intereſts of our country.</p>
               <p>Nor have I departed from this line of conduct, on the occaſion which has produced the Reſolutions contained in your letter of the 13th inſtant.</p>
               <p>Without a predilection to my own judgment, I have weighed with attention every argument which has at any time been brought into view. But the Conſtitution is the guide which I never can abandon. It has aſſigned to the Preſident the power of making treaties, with the advice and conſent of the Senate. It was doubtleſs ſuppoſed, that theſe two branches of government would combine, without paſſion, and with the beſt means of information, thoſe facts and principles, upon which the ſucceſs of our foreign relations will always depend: that they ought not to ſubſtitute for their own conviction, the opinions of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:031402_0127_0FEF93133B2FDEE8"/>
or to ſeek truth through any channel but that of a temperate and well-informed inveſtigation.</p>
               <p>Under this perſuaſion, I have reſolved on the manner of executing the duty now before me. To the high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſibility, attached to it, I freely ſubmit; and you, Gentlemen, are at liberty to make theſe ſentiments known, as the grounds of my procedure. While I feel the moſt lively gratitude for the many inſtances of approbation from my country, I can no otherwiſe deſerve it, than by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dictates of my conſcience.</p>

               <p>THAT, confiding in the wiſdom, integrity and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm of the conſtituted authorities, we have forborne to offer our opinions on the merits of the Treaty, pending between Great Britain and the United States; though, as merchants and traders, our intereſts are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerned, than thoſe of any other claſs of men amongſt us; as well on account of the indemnity therein ſtipulated for paſt loſſes, as for the ſecurity we apprehend it will give to the immenſe property employed by the merchants of the United States, in their foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing that other citizens have expreſſed their opinions upon this important ſubject, and fearing leſt our ſilence ſhould be conſtrued into an acquieſcence in thoſe opinions, we deem it our duty explicitly and publickly to avow our approbation of the conduct of the Senate of the United States, believing that a different conduct reſpecting the Treaty would have ſubjected us to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent hazard of war, with all its concomitant evils, and, more eſpecially, as proviſion is made for the eſtabliſhment of public and private credit, a continuance of peace, with all the advantages under which our commerce flouriſhes, and the further improvement of our country now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing in a degree, elſewhere, without example.</p>
               <p>Theſe are advantages and bleſſings, which, in our opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, greatly outweigh all the objections to the Treaty generally; and, as further negociations are recommended for obtaining a leſs limited intercourſe with the Britiſh Weſt India iſlands, we hope that it will be rendered ſtill more beneficial to this country.</p>

               <p>I COME to acquit myſelf of a duty very dear to my heart. I come to depoſite, in your hands and in the midſt of a people juſtly renowned for their courage, and their love of liberty, the ſymbol of the triumph and of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſement of my nation.</p>
               <p>When ſhe broke her chains; when ſhe proclaimed the impreſcriptable rights of man; when, in a terrible war, ſhe ſealed with her blood the covenant made with liberty,—her own happineſs was not alone the object of her glorious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; her views extended alſo to all free people; ſhe ſaw their intereſts blended with her own, and doubly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in her victories, which in aſſuring to her the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:031402_0130_0FEF931AD69FEA78"/>
of her rights, became to them new guarantees of their independence.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſentiments, which animated the French nation, from the dawn of their revolution, have acquired new ſtrength ſince the foundation of the Republic. France, at that time, by the form of its government aſſimilated to, or rather indentified with free people, ſaw in them only friends and brothers. Long accuſtomed to regard the American people as their moſt faithful allies, ſhe has ſought to draw cloſer the ties already formed in the fields of America, under the auſpices of victory over the ruins of tyranny.</p>
               <p>The National Convention, the organs of the will of the French nation, have more than once expreſſed their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the American people; but above all, theſe burſt forth on that auguſt day, when the miniſters of the United States preſented to the National Repreſentation, the Colours of his country, deſiring never to loſe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections as dear to Frenchmen as they muſt be to Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans. The Convention ordered that theſe colours ſhould be placed in the hall of their ſittings. They had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſenſations too agreeable not to cauſe them to be partaken of by their allies, and decreed that to them the National Colours ſhould be preſented.</p>
               <p>Mr. Preſident, I do not doubt their expectations will be fulfilled; and I am convinced, that every citizen will receive, with a pleaſing emotion, this Flag, elſewhere the terror of the enemies of liberty, here the certain pledge of faithful friendſhip; eſpecially when they recollect that it guides to combat, men who have ſhared their toils, and who were prepared for liberty, by aiding them to acquire their own.</p>

But above all, the events of the French Revolution have produced the deepeſt ſolicitude, as well as the higheſt admiration. To call your nation brave, were to pronounce but common praiſe. Wonderful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! ages to come will read with aſtoniſhment the hiſtory of your brilliant exploits! I rejoice that the period of your toils and of your immenſe ſacrifices is approaching. I rejoice that the intereſting revolutionary movements of ſo many years have iſſued in the formation of a Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſigned to give permanency to the great object for which you have contended. I rejoice that liberty, which you have ſo long embraced with enthuſiaſm—liberty, of which you have been the invincible defenders, now finds an aſylum in the boſom of a regularly organized govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;—a government, which, being formed to ſecure the happineſs of the French people, correſponds with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wiſhes of my heart, while it gratifies the pride of every citizen of the United States, by its reſemblance of their own. On theſe glorious events, accept, Sir, my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere congratulations.</p>

I expreſs not my own feelings only, but thoſe of my fellow-citizens, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the commencement, the progreſs, and the iſſue of the French Revolution; and they will cordially join with me in pureſt wiſhes to the Supreme Being, that the citizens of our ſiſter Republic, our magnanimous allies, may ſoon enjoy in peace, that liberty, which they have

               <p>I receive, Sir, with lively ſenſibility, the ſymbol of the triumphs and of the enfranchiſements of your nation, the Colours of France, which you have now preſented to the United States. The tranſaction will be announced to Congreſs; and the colours will be depoſited with thoſe archives of the United States, which are at once the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and the memorials of their freedom and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

               </opener>
               <p>THE great object for which I had the honour to hold an appointment in the ſervice of my country, being accompliſhed, I am now preparing to reſign it into the hands of Congreſs, and return to that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic retirement, which, it is well known, I left with the greateſt reluctance; a retirement for which I have never ceaſed to ſigh through a long and painful abſence, in which (remote from the noiſe and trouble of the world) I meditate to paſs the remainder of life in a ſtate of undiſturbed repoſe: but, before I carry this reſolution into effect, I think it a duty incumbent on me to make this my laſt official communication, to congratulate you on the glorious events which Heaven has been pleaſed to produce in our favour, to offer my ſentiments reſpecting ſome important ſubjects, which appear to me to be intimately connected with the tranquillity of the United States, to take my leave of your Excellency as a public character, and to give my final bleſſing to that country in whoſe ſervice I have ſpent the prime of my life; for whoſe ſake I have conſumed ſo many anxious days and watchful nights; and whoſe happineſs, being extremely dear to me, will always conſtitute no inconſiderable part of my own.</p>
               <p>Impreſſed with the livelieſt ſenſibility on this pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion, I will claim the indulgence of dilating
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:031402_0133_0FEF9328A0645BC0"/>
the more copiouſly on the ſubject of our mutual ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation. When we conſider the magnitude of the prize we contended for, the doubtful nature of the conteſt, and the favourable manner in which it has terminated; we ſhall find the greateſt poſſible reaſon for gratitude and rejoicing: this is a theme that will afford infinite delight to every benevolent and liberal mind, whether the event in contemplation be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as a ſource of preſent enjoyment, or the parent of future happineſs; and we ſhall have equal occaſion to felicitate ourſelves on the lot which Providence has aſſigned us, whether we view it in a natural, a political, or moral point of view.</p>
               <p>The citizens of America, placed in the moſt envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition, as the ſole lords and proprietors of a vaſt tract of continent, comprehending all the various ſoils and climates of the world, and abounding with all the neceſſaries and conveniences of life, are now, by the late ſatisfactory pacification, acknowledged to be poſſeſſed of abſolute freedom and independency; they are from this period to be conſidered as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors on a moſt conſpicuous theatre, which ſeems to be peculiarly deſigned by Providence for the diſplay of human greatneſs and felicity: here they are not only ſurrounded with every thing that can contribute to the completion of private and domeſtic enjoyment, but Heaven has crowned all its other bleſſings, by giving a ſurer opportunity for political happineſs than any other nation has ever been favoured with. Nothing can illuſtrate theſe obſervations more forcibly than the recollection of the happy conjuncture of times and circumſtances, under which our Republic aſſumed its rank among the nations. The foundation of our empire was not laid in a gloomy age of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuperſtition, but at an epocha when the rights of mankind were better underſtood and more clearly defined, than at any former period: reſearches of the human mind after ſocial happineſs have been carried to a great extent: the treaſures of knowledge acquired by the labours of philoſophers, ſages, and
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:031402_0133_0FEF9328A0645BC0"/>
legiſlators, through a long ſucceſſion of years, are laid open for uſe, and their collected wiſdom may be happily applied in the eſtabliſhment of our forms of government: the free cultivation of letters, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded extenſion of commerce, the progreſſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of manners, the growing liberality of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, above all, the pure and benign light of revelation, have had a meliorating influence on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and increaſed the bleſſings of ſociety. At this auſpicious period the United States came into exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as a nation, and if their citizens ſhould not be completely free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.</p>
               <p>Such is our ſituation, and ſuch are our proſpects; but notwithſtanding the cup of bleſſing is thus reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to us—notwithſtanding happineſs is ours, if we have a diſpoſition to ſeize the occaſion, and make it our own; yet it appears to me, there is an option ſtill left to the United States of America, whether they will be reſpectable and proſperous, or contemptible and miſerable as a nation. This is the time of their political probation; this is the moment, when the eyes of the whole world are turned upon them; this is the time to eſtabliſh or ruin their national character forever; this is the favourable moment to give ſuch a tone to the Federal Government, as will enable it to anſwer the ends of its inſtitution; or this may be the ill-fated moment for relaxing the powers of the Union, annihilating the cement of the Confederation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing us to become the ſport of European politics, which may play one State againſt another, to prevent their growing importance, and to ſerve their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted purpoſes. For, according to the ſyſtem of policy the States ſhall adopt at this moment, they will ſtand or fall; and, by their confirmation or lapſe, it is yet to be decided, whether the revolution muſt ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately be conſidered as a bleſſing or a curſe; a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or a curſe, not to the preſent age alone, for with our fate will the deſtiny of unborn millions be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="unknown:031402_0134_0FEF932A2E585970"/>With this conviction of the importance of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent criſis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſilence in me would be a crime. I will therefore ſpeak to your Excellency the language of freedom and ſincerity, without diſguiſe. I am aware, however, thoſe who differ from me in political ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may perhaps remark, I am ſtepping out of the proper line of my duty; and they may poſſibly aſcribe to arrogance or oſtentation, what I know is alone the reſult of the pureſt intention; but the rectitude of my own heart, which diſdains ſuch unworthy motives— the part I have hitherto acted in life—the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have formed of not taking any ſhare in public buſineſs hereafter—the ardent deſire I feel and ſhall continue to manifeſt, of quietly enjoying in private life, after all the toils of war, the benefits of a wiſe and liberal government,—will, I flatter myſelf, ſooner or later, convince my countrymen, that I could have no ſiniſter views in delivering, with ſo little reſerve, the opinions contained in this Addreſs.</p>
               <p>There are four things which I humbly conceive are eſſential to the well-being, I may even venture to ſay, to the exiſtence of the United States, as an independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. An indiſſoluble union of the States under one federal head.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. A ſacred regard to public juſtice.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. The adoption of a proper peace eſtabliſhment, And,</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. The prevalence of that pacific and friendly diſpoſition among the people of the United States, which will induce them to forget their local prejudices and policies, to make thoſe mutual conceſſions which are requiſite to the general proſperity, and, in ſome inſtances, to ſacrifice their individual advantages to the intereſt of the community.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the pillars on which the glorious fabric of our independency and national character muſt be ſupported. Liberty is the baſis, and whoever would dare to ſap the foundation, or overturn the ſtructure,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:031402_0134_0FEF932A2E585970"/>
under whatever ſpecious pretext he may attempt it, will merit the bittereſt execration and the ſevereſt puniſhment which can be inflicted by his injured country.</p>
               <p>On the three firſt articles I will make a few obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, leaving the laſt to the good ſenſe and ſerious conſideration of thoſe immediately concerned.</p>
               <p>Under the firſt head, although it may not be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or proper for me in this place to enter into a particular diſquiſition of the principles of the Union, and to take up the great queſtion which has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently agitated, whether it be expedient and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the States to delegate a large proportion of power to Congreſs, or not; yet it will be a part of my duty, and that of every true patriot, to aſſert, without reſerve, and to inſiſt upon the following poſitions. That unleſs the States will ſuffer Congreſs to exerciſe thoſe prerogatives they are undoubtedly inveſted with by the conſtitution, every thing muſt very rapidly tend to anarchy and confuſion.—That it is indiſpenſable to the happineſs of the individual States, that there ſhould be lodged, ſomewhere, a ſupreme power, to regulate and govern the general concerns of the confederated republic, without which the Union cannot be of long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.—That there muſt be a faithful and pointed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance on the part of every State with the late propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and demands of Congreſs, or the moſt fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences will enſue.—That whatever meaſures have a tendency to diſſolve the union, or contribute to violate or leſſen the ſovereign authority, ought to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as hoſtile to the liberty and independency of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and the authors of them treated accordingly.—And laſtly, that unleſs we can be enabled by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the States to participate of the fruits of the revolution, and enjoy the eſſential benefits of civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, under a form of government ſo free and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, ſo happily guarded againſt the danger of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as has been deviſed and adopted by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of confederation, it will be a ſubject of regret,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:031402_0135_0FEF932E32565658"/>
that ſo much blood and treaſure have been laviſhed for no purpoſe; that ſo many ſufferings have been encountered without a compenſation, and that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſacrifices have been made in vain. Many other conſiderations might here be adduced to prove, that without an entire conformity to the ſpirit of the Union, we cannot exiſt as an independent power. It will be ſufficient for my purpoſe to mention but one or two, which ſeem to me of the greateſt importance. It is only in our united character, as an empire, that our independence is acknowledged, that our power can be regarded, or our credit ſupported among foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The treaties of the European powers with the United States of America, will have no validity on the diſſolution of the Union. We ſhall be left nearly in a ſtate of nature; or we may find, by our own unhappy experience, that there is a natural and neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of tyranny; and that arbitrary power is moſt eaſily eſtabliſhed on the ruins of liberty abuſed to licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond article, which reſpects the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of public juſtice, Congreſs have, in their late Addreſs to the United States, almoſt exhauſted the ſubject; they have explained their ideas ſo fully, and have enforced the obligations the States are under to render complete juſtice to all the public creditors, with ſo much dignity and energy, that in my opinion, no real friend to the honour and independency of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica can heſitate a ſingle moment reſpecting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of complying with the juſt and honourable meaſures propoſed. If their arguments do not produce conviction, I know of nothing that will have greater influence, eſpecially when we reflect that the ſyſtem referred to, being the reſult of the collected wiſdom of the continent, muſt be eſteemed, if not perfect, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the leaſt objectionable of any that could be deviſed; and that, if it ſhould not be carried into immediate execution, a national bankruptcy, with all
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:031402_0135_0FEF932E32565658"/>
its deplorable conſequences, will take place, before any different plan can poſſibly be propoſed or adopted; ſo preſſing are the preſent circumſtances, and ſuch is the alternative now offered to the States.</p>
               <p>The ability of the country to diſcharge the debts which have been incurred in its defence, is not to be doubted. An inclination, I flatter myſelf, will not be wanting; the path of our duty is plain before us; honeſty will be found, on every experiment, to be the beſt and only true policy. Let us then, as a nation, be juſt; let us fulfil the public contracts which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs had undoubtedly a right to make for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of carrying on the war, with the ſame good faith we ſuppoſe ourſelves bound to perform our private en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. In the mean time let an attention to the cheerful performance of their proper buſineſs, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and as members of ſociety, be earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated on the citizens of America; then will they ſtrengthen the bands of government, and be happy under its protection. Every one will reap the fruit of his labours; every one will enjoy his own acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without moleſtation and without danger.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of abſolute freedom and perfect ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who will grudge to yield a very little of his prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to ſupport the common intereſts of ſociety, and enſure the protection of government? Who does not remember the frequent declarations at the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the war, that we ſhould be completely ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if at the expenſe of one half, we could defend the remainder of our poſſeſſions? Where is the man to be found, who wiſhes to remain indebted for the defence of his own perſon and property to the exertions, the bravery, and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to pay the debt of honour and of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? In what part of the continent ſhall we find any man, or body of men, who would not bluſh to ſtand up, and propoſe meaſures purpoſely calculated to rob the ſoldier of his ſtipend, and the public creditor of his due? And were it poſſible that ſuch a flagrant inſtance of injuſtice could ever happen, would it not excite the
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:031402_0136_0FEF8ED7D83BD798"/>
general indignation, and tend to bring down, upon the authors of ſuch meaſures, the aggravated ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Heaven? If, after all, a ſpirit of diſunion, or a temper of obſtinacy and perverſeneſs ſhould manifeſt itſelf in any of the States; if ſuch an ungracious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſhould attempt to fruſtrate all the happy effects that might be expected to flow from the Union; if there ſhould be a refuſal to comply with the requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for funds to diſcharge the annual intereſt of the public debts, and if that refuſal ſhould revive all thoſe jealouſies, and produce all thoſe evils which are now happily removed—Congreſs, who have in all their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions ſhewn a great degree of magnanimity and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, will ſtand juſtified in the ſight of God and man! And that State alone, which puts itſelf in oppoſition to the aggregate wiſdom of the continent, and follows ſuch miſtaken and pernicious councils, will be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for all the conſequences.</p>
               <p>For my own part, conſcious of having acted while a ſervant of the public, in the manner I conceived beſt ſuited to promote the real intereſts of my country; having, in conſequence of my fixed belief, in ſome meaſure, pledged myſelf to the army, that their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would finally do them complete and ample juſtice, and not willing to conceal any inſtance of my official conduct from the eyes of the world, I have thought proper to tranſmit to your Excellency the incloſed collection of papers, relative to the half-pay and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation granted by Congreſs to the officers of the army: from theſe communications, my decided ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent will be clearly comprehended, together with the concluſive reaſons, which induced me at an early period, to recommend the adoption of this meaſure in the moſt earneſt and ſerious manner. As the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Congreſs, the army, and myſelf, are open to all, and contain, in my opinion, ſufficient informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to remove the prejudice and errors which may have been entertained by any, I think it unneceſſary to ſay any thing more, than juſt to obſerve, that the reſolutions of Congreſs, now alluded to, are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:031402_0136_0FEF8ED7D83BD798"/>
and abſolutely binding upon the United States, as the moſt ſolemn acts of confederation or legiſlation.</p>
               <p>As to the idea, which I am informed, has in ſome inſtances prevailed, that the half-pay and commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a penſion, it ought to be exploded forever: that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ſhould be viewed, as it really was, a reaſonable compenſation offered by Congreſs, at a time when they had nothing elſe to give to officers of the army, for ſervices then to be performed: it was the only means to prevent a total derilection of the ſervice; it was a part of their hire. I may be allowed to ſay, it was the price of their blood, and of your independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; it is therefore more than a common debt, it is a debt of honour; it can never be conſidered as a penſion or gratuity, nor cancelled until it is fairly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
               <p>With regard to the diſtinction between officers and ſoldiers, it is ſufficient that the uniform experience of every nation of the world, combined with our own, proves the utility and propriety of the diſcrimination. Rewards, in proportion to the aid the public draws from them, are unqueſtionably due to all its ſervants. In ſome lines, the ſoldiers have perhaps generally had as ample compenſation for their ſervices, by the large bounties which have been paid them, as their officers will receive in the propoſed commutation; in others, if beſides the donation of land, the payment of arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of cloathing and wages (in which articles all the component parts of the army muſt be put upon the ſame footing) we take into the eſtimate, the bounties many of the ſoldiers have received, and the gratuity of one year's full pay, which is promiſed to all, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly their ſituation (every circumſtance being duly conſidered) will not be deemed leſs eligible than that of the officers. Should a farther reward, however, be judged equitable, I will venture to aſſert, no man will enjoy greater ſatisfaction than myſelf, in an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from taxes for a limited time (which has been
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:031402_0137_0FEF933650AD39E0"/>
petitioned for in ſome inſtances) or any other adequate immunity or compenſation granted to the brave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of their country's cauſe: but neither the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or rejection of this propoſition will, in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner affect, much leſs militate againſt the act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, by which they have offered five years full pay, in lieu of the half-pay for life, which had been before promiſed to the officers of the army.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude the ſubject on public juſtice, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit to mention the obligations this country is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that meritorious claſs of veterans, the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commiſſioned officers and privates, who have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged for inability, in conſequence of the reſolution of Congreſs, of the 23d of April, 1782, on an annual penſion for life. Their peculiar ſufferings, their ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar merits and claims to that proviſion need only to be known, to intereſt the feelings of humanity in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. Nothing but a punctual payment of their annual allowance can reſcue them from the moſt complicated miſery; and nothing could be a more melancholy and diſtreſſing ſight, than to behold thoſe who have ſhed their blood, or loſt their limbs in the ſervice of their country, without a ſhelter, without a friend, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means of obtaining any of the comforts or neceſſaries of life, compelled to beg their daily bread from door to door. Suffer me to recommend thoſe of this deſcription, belonging to your State, to the warmeſt patronage of your Excellency and your Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to ſay but a few words on the third topic which was propoſed, and which regards particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the defence of the republic. As there can be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doubt but Congreſs will recommend a proper peace eſtabliſhment for the United States, in which a due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention will be paid to the importance of placing the militia of the Union upon a regular and reſpectable footing; if this ſhould be the caſe, I ſhould beg leave to urge the great advantage of it in the ſtrongeſt terms.</p>
               <p>The militia of this country muſt be conſidered as the palladium of our ſecurity, and the firſt effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:031402_0137_0FEF933650AD39E0"/>
in caſe of hoſtility: it is eſſential, therefore, that the ſame ſyſtem ſhould pervade the whole that the formation and diſcipline of the militia of the continent ſhould be abſolutely uniform; and that the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of arms, accoutrements, and military apparatus, ſhould be introduced in every part of the United States. No one, who has not learned it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, expenſe, and confuſion which reſult from a contrary ſyſtem, or the vague arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have hitherto prevailed.</p>
               <p>If, in treating of political points, a greater latitude than uſual has been taken in the courſe of the Addreſs, the importance of the criſis, and the magnitude of the objects in diſcuſſion, muſt be my apology: it is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, neither my wiſh nor expectation, that the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obſervations ſhould claim any regard, except ſo far as they ſhall appear to be dictated by a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; conſonant to the immutable rules of juſtice; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to produce a liberal ſyſtem of policy, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on whatever experience may have been acquired by a long and cloſe attention to public buſineſs. Here I might ſpeak with more confidence, from my actual obſervations; and if it would not ſwell this letter (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too prolix) beyond the bounds I had preſcribed myſelf, I could demonſtrate to every mind, open to conviction, that in leſs time, and with much leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe than has been incurred, the war might have been brought to the ſame happy concluſion, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of the continent could have been properly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth; that the diſtreſſes and diſappointments which have very often occurred, have, in too many inſtances, reſulted more from a want of energy in the continental government, than a deficiency of means in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar States: that the inefficacy of the meaſures, ariſing from the want of an adequate authority in the ſupreme power, from a partial compliance with the requiſitions of Congreſs in ſome of the States, and from a failure of punctuality in others, while they tended to damp the zeal of thoſe who were more willing to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſerved alſo to accumulate the expenſes of the
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:031402_0138_0FEF9337ED3AD798"/>
war, and to fruſtrate the beſt concerted plans; and that the diſcouragement occaſioned by the complicated difficulties and embarraſſments, in which our affairs were by this means involved, would have long age produced the diſſolution of any army, leſs patient, leſs virtuous, and leſs perſevering than that which I have had the honour to command. But while I mention thoſe things, which are notorious facts, as the defects of our Federal Conſtitution, particularly in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of a war, I beg it may be underſtood, that as I have ever taken a pleaſure in gratefully acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aſſiſtance and ſupport I have derived from every claſs of citizens; ſo ſhall I always be happy to do juſtice to the unparalleled exertions of the individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual States, on many intereſting occaſions.</p>
               <p>I have thus freely diſcloſed what I wiſhed to make known before I ſurrendered up my public truſt to thoſe who committed it to me: the taſk is now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. I now bid adieu to your Excellency, as the Chief Magiſtrate of your State; at the ſame time I bid a laſt farewell to the cares of office, and all the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of public life.</p>
               <p>It remains, then, to be my final and only requeſt, that your Excellency will communicate theſe ſentiments to your legiſlature, at their next meeting; and that they may be conſidered as the legacy of one who has ardently wiſhed, on all occaſions, to be uſeful to his country, and who, even in the ſhade of retirement, will not fail to implore the divine benediction upon it.</p>
               <p>I now make it my earneſt prayer, that God would have you, and the State over which you preſide, in his holy protection; that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a ſpirit of ſubordination and obedience to government; to entertain a brotherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and love for one another, for their fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States at large; and particularly for their brethren who have ſerved in the field; and finally, that he would moſt graciouſly be pleaſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us all to do juſtice, to love mercy, and to demean ourſelves with that charity, humility, and pacific tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:031402_0138_0FEF9337ED3AD798"/>
of the mind, which were the characteriſtics of the divine Author of our bleſſed religion; without an humble imitation of whoſe example, in theſe things, we can never hope to be a happy nation.</p>
               <p>I have the honour to be, with much eſteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, Sir, your Excellency's moſt obedient, and moſt humble ſervant,</p>

               <p>THE United States in Congreſs aſſembled, after giving the moſt honourable teſtimony to the merits of the federal armies, and preſenting them with the thanks of their country, for their long, eminent and faithful ſervice, having thought proper, by their proclamation bearing date the 18th of October laſt, to diſcharge ſuch part of the troops as were engaged for the war, and to permit the officers on furlough to retire from ſervice, from and after to-morrow, which proclamation having been communicated in the public papers for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and government of all concerned; it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for the Commander in Chief to addreſs himſelf once more, and that for the laſt time, to the armies of the United States, (however widely diſperſed individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als who compoſe them may be) and to bid them an affectionate, a long farewell.</p>
               <p>But before the Commander in Chief takes his final leave of thoſe he holds moſt dear, he wiſhes to indulge himſelf a few moments in calling to mind a ſlight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the paſt:—he will then take the liberty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring,
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:031402_0139_0FEF93398543E298"/>
with his military friends, their future proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; of adviſing the general line of conduct which in his opinion ought to be purſued; and he will conclude the Addreſs, by expreſſing the obligations he feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under for the ſpirited and able aſſiſtance he has experienced from them, in the performance of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous office.</p>
               <p>A contemplation of the complete attainment (at a period earlier than could have been expected) of the object for which we contended againſt ſo formidable a power, cannot but inſpire us with aſtoniſhment and gratitude. The diſadvantageous circumſtances on our part, under which the war was undertaken, can never be forgotten. The ſingular interpoſitions of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our feeble condition, were ſuch as could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcape the attention of the moſt unobſerving—while the unparalleled perſeverance of the armies of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, through almoſt every poſſible ſuffering and diſcouragement, for the ſpace of eight long years, was little ſhort of a ſtanding miracle.</p>
               <p>It is not the meaning, nor within the compaſs of this Addreſs, to detail the hardſhips peculiarly inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our ſervice, or to deſcribe the diſtreſſes which in ſeveral inſtances have reſulted from the extremes of hunger and nakedneſs, combined with the rigours of an inclement ſeaſon; nor is it neceſſary to dwell on the dark ſide of our paſt affairs. Every American officer and ſoldier muſt now conſole himſelf for any unpleaſant circumſtances which may have occurred, by a recollection of the uncommon ſcenes in which he has been called to act no inglorious part, and the aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing events of which he has been a witneſs; events which have ſeldom, if ever before, taken place on the ſtage of human action, nor can they probably ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen again. For who has before ſeen a diſciplined ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my formed at once from ſuch raw materials? Who that was not a witneſs could imagine that the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent local prejudices would ceaſe ſo ſoon, and that men who came from the different parts of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, ſtrongly diſpoſed by the habits of education to

deſpiſe and quarrel with each other, would inſtantly become but one patriotic band of brothers? Or who that was not on the ſpot, can trace the ſteps by which ſuch a wonderful revolution has been effected, and ſuch a glorious period put to all our warlike toils?</p>
               <p>It is univerſally acknowledged, that the enlarged proſpects of happineſs, opened by the confirmation of our independence and ſovereignty, almoſt exceed the power of deſcription: and ſhall not the brave men who have contributed ſo eſſentially to theſe ineſtimable acquiſitions, retiring victorious from the field of war to the field of agriculture, participate in all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which have been obtained? In ſuch a republic, who will exclude them from the rights of citizens, and the fruits of their labours? In ſuch a country, ſo happily circumſtanced, the purſuits of commerce, and the cultivation of the ſoil, will unfold to induſtry the certain road to competence. To thoſe hardy ſoldiers who are actuated by the ſpirit of adventure, the fiſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will afford ample and profitable employment: and the extenſive and fertile regions of the Weſt will yield a moſt happy aſylum to thoſe who, fond of domeſtic enjoyment, are ſeeking perſonal independence. Nor is it poſſible to conceive that any one of the United States will prefer a national bankruptcy, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Union, to a compliance with the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Congreſs, and the payment of its juſt debts; ſo that the officers and ſoldiers may expect conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſiſtance, in re-commencing their civil occupations, from the ſums due to them from the public, which muſt and will moſt inevitably be paid.</p>
               <p>In order to effect this deſirable purpoſe, and to remove the prejudices which may have taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the minds of any of the good people of the States, it is earneſtly recommended to all the troops, that, with ſtrong attachments to the Union, they ſhould carry with them into civil ſociety the moſt conciliating diſpoſitions; and that they ſhould prove themſelves not leſs virtuous and uſeful as citizens, than they have
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:031402_0140_0FEF933F89B20A58"/>
been perſevering and victorious as ſoldiers. What though there ſhould be ſome envious individuals, who are unwilling to pay the debt the public has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or to yield the tribute due to merit; yet let ſuch unworthy treatment produce no invective, or any inſtance of intemperate conduct; let it be remembered, that the unbiaſſed voice of the free citizens of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States has promiſed the juſt reward, and given the merited applauſe; let it be known and remembered, that the reputation of the federal armies is eſtabliſhed beyond the reach of malevolence; and let a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their achievements, and fame, ſtill excite the men who compoſed them to honourable actions, under the perſuaſion, that the private virtues of economy, prudence, and induſtry, will not be leſs amiable in civil life, than the more ſplendid qualities of valor, perſeverance, and enterprize were in the field. Every one may reſt aſſured that much, very much of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs of the officers and men will depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wiſe and manly conduct which ſhall be adopted by them, when they are mingled with the great body of the community. And although the General has ſo frequently given it as his opinion, in the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and explicit manner, that unleſs the principles of the Federal Government were properly ſupported, and the powers of the Union increaſed, the honour, dignity, and juſtice of the nation, would be loſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; yet he cannot help repeating on this occaſion ſo intereſting a ſentiment, and leaving it as his laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to every officer and every ſoldier who may view the ſubject in the ſame ſerious point of light, to add his beſt endeavours to thoſe of his worthy fellow-citizens, towards effecting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe great and valuable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, on which our very exiſtence as a nation ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially depends.</p>
               <p>The Commander in Chief conceives little is now wanting to enable the ſoldier to change the military character into that of a citizen, but that ſteady and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent tenor of behaviour, which has generally diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:031402_0140_0FEF933F89B20A58"/>
not only the army under his immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but the different detachments and ſeparate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, through the courſe of the war. From their good ſenſe and prudence he anticipated the happieſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences: and while he congratulates them on the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious occaſion which renders their ſervices in the field no longer neceſſary, he wiſhes to expreſs the ſtrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations he feels himſelf under for the aſſiſtance he has received from every claſs, and in every inſtance. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents his thanks, in the moſt ſerious and affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to the general officers, as well for their counſel on many intereſting occaſions, as for their ardour in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the ſucceſs of the plans he had adopted; to the commandants of regiments and corps, and to the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers for their zeal and attention in carrying his orders promptly into execution; to the ſtaff, for their alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and exactneſs in performing the duties of their ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral departments; and to the non-commiſſioned offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and private ſoldiers, for their extraordinary pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in ſuffering, as well as their invincible fortitude in action. To various branches of the army the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral takes this laſt and ſolemn opportunity of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his inviolable attachment and friendſhip: He wiſhes more than bare profeſſions were in his power, that he was really able to be uſeful to them all in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life. He flatters himſelf, however, they will do him the juſtice to believe, that whatever could with propriety be attempted by him, has been done. And being now to conclude theſe his laſt public orders, to take his ultimate leave, in a ſhort time, of the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry character, and to bid a final adieu to the armies he has ſo long had the honour to command, he can only again offer, in their behalf, his recommendations to their grateful country, and his prayers to the God of armies. May ample juſtice be done them here, and may the choiceſt of Heaven's favours, both here and hereafter, attend thoſe who, under the divine, auſpices, have ſecured innumerable bleſſings for others! With theſe wiſhes, and this benediction, the Commander in

               <head>The Anſwer. To his Excellency <hi>GENERAL WASHINGTON,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of the <hi>ARMIES</hi> of the <hi>UNITED STATES</hi> of <hi>AMERICA.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE, the officers of the part of the army remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the banks of the Hudſon, have received your Excellency's ſerious and farewell Addreſs to the armies of the United States. We beg you to accept our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned thanks for the communication, and your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate aſſurances of inviolable attachment and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. If your attempts to enſure to the armies the juſt, the promiſed rewards, of their long, ſevere, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſervices, have failed of ſucceſs, we believe it has ariſen from cauſes not in your Excellency's power to control. With extreme regret do we reflect on the occaſion which called for ſuch endeavours. But while we thank your Excellency for theſe exertions in favour of the troops you have ſo ſucceſsfully commanded, we pray it may be believed, that in this ſentiment our own particular intereſts have but a ſecondary place; and that even the ultimate ingratitude of the people (were that poſſible) could not ſhake the patriotiſm of thoſe who ſuffer by it. Still with pleaſing wonder and with grateful joy ſhall we contemplate the glorious conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our labours. To that merit in the revolution which, under the auſpices of Heaven, the armies have diſplayed, poſterity will do juſtice; and the ſons will bluſh whoſe fathers were their foes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="unknown:031402_0141_0FEF93439D8311A8"/>Moſt gladly would we caſt a veil on every act which fullies the reputation of our country—never ſhould the page of hiſtory be ſtained with its diſhonour—even from our memories ſhould the idea be eraſed. We lament the oppoſition to thoſe ſalutary meaſures which the wiſdom of the Union has planted; meaſures which alone can recover and fix on a permanent baſis the credit of the States; meaſures which are eſſential to the juſtice, the honour, and intereſt of the nation. While ſhe was giving the nobleſt proofs of magnanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, with conſcious pride we ſaw her growing fame; and, regardleſs of preſent ſufferings, we looked forward to the end of our toils and dangers, to brighter ſcenes in proſpect. There we beheld the genius of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try dignified by ſovereignty and independence, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by juſtice, and adorned with every liberal vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. There we ſaw patient Huſbandry fearleſs extend her cultured fields, and animated Commerce ſpread her ſails to every wind. There we beheld fair Science lift her head, with all the Arts attending in her train. There, bleſt with freedom, we ſaw the human mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand; and, throwing aſide the reſtraints which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined it to the narrow bounds of country, it embraced the world. Such were our fond hopes, and with ſuch delightful proſpects did they preſent us. Nor are we diſappointed. Thoſe animating proſpects are now changed and changing to realities; and actively to have contributed to their production is our pride, our glory. But juſtice alone can give them ſtability. In that juſtice we ſtill believe. Still we hope that the prej<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udices of the miſinformed will be removed, and the arts of falſe and ſelfiſh popularity, addreſſed to the feelings of avarice, defeated: or, in the worſt event, the world, we hope, will make the juſt diſtinction: we truſt the diſingenuouſneſs of a few will not ſully the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the honour, and dignity, of the great and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table majority of the States.</p>
               <p>We are happy in the opportunity juſt preſented of congratulating your Excellency on the certain conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the definitive treaty of peace. Relieved at length
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:031402_0142_0FEF934540D91250"/>
from long ſuſpenſe, our warmeſt wiſh is to return to the boſom of our country, to reſume the character of citizens; and it will be our higheſt ambition to become uſeful ones. To your Excellency this great event muſt be peculiarly pleaſing: for while at the head of her armies, urged by patriot virtues and magnanimity, you perſevered, under the preſſure of every poſſible difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diſcouragement, in the purſuit of the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the war—the freedom and ſafety of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;—your heart panted for the tranquil enjoyments of peace. We cordially rejoice with you that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of indulging them has arrived ſo ſoon. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the bleſſings of liberty and independence, the rich prize of eight years hardy adventure, paſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings will be forgotten; or if remembered, the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection will ſerve to heighten the reliſh of preſent happineſs. We ſincerely pray God this happineſs may long be your's; and that when you quit the ſtage of human life, you may receive from the unerring Judge, the rewards of valor exerted to ſave the oppreſſed, of patriotiſm, and diſintereſted virtue.</p>
