            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>AVID cloſed the ſcene of life, with that propriety of conduct, and that compoſure of mind, which at once diſplayed the beauty of religion, and the dignity of human nature. When the time of his departure drew nigh, he had nothing to do to prepare for death, but only, like other pious and illuſtrious Patriarchs, to converſe with his friends, and to give them his laſt and beſt advice. And, as he had, ſome time before, committed to Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the care of his Family and government of his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020344_0004_0FAEFDE7E35EDAF8"/>
Kingdom; ſo he felt a ſtrong and ardent deſire, that this beloved Son, in whom he had repoſed ſuch important truſts, ſhould appear with dignity, and act a noble and worthy part upon the ſtage of life. Accordingly he called him into his preſence, and with equal ſolemnity and affection, addreſſed him in theſe memorable words, "I go the way of all the earth: be thou ſtrong therefore, and ſhew thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a man." This appellation ſometimes ſignifies the dignity, and ſometimes the meanneſs of our nature. Job makes uſe of it to expreſs our mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and turpitude in the ſight of God. "How can man be juſtified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? Behold, even to the moon and it ſhineth not, yea the ſtars are not pure in his ſight. How much leſs man that is a worm, and the Son of Man which is a worm." But Iſaiah employs this ſame appellative to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the dignity of human nature, when he calls upon ſtupid idolaters to "remember this, and ſhew themſelves men." So here, David in his dying addreſs to Solomon, "ſhew thyſelf a man," evidently means to uſe the term in the beſt ſenſe, and to urge him to act up to the dignity of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the end of his being.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:020344_0005_0FAEFDE868161D90"/>AGREEABLY therefore to the ſpirit and intention of the text, the ſubject which now properly lies before us, is the dignity of man. And, I hope, the obſervations which ſhall be made upon this ſubject, will do honour to our nature in one view, and pour contempt upon it in another, and ſo lead us all into a clear and juſt apprehenſion of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which is the moſt uſeful, as well as the moſt rare and high attainment in knowledge.</p>
            <p>THE dignity of man appears from his bearing the <hi>image</hi> of his Maker. After God had created the heavens and the earth, and furniſhed the world with a rich profuſion of vegetive and ſenſitive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he was pleaſed to form a more noble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Creature, to bear his image, and to be the lord of this lower creation. "And God ſaid, Let us make man in our image, after our likeneſs. And the Lord God formed man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life; and man became a living ſoul." This allows us to ſay, that man is the offspring of God, a ray from the fountain of light, a drop from the ocean of intelligence. Though, man, ſince the fall, comes into the world deſtitute of the <hi>moral</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:020344_0006_0FAEFDE9301F4A48"/>
image of God, yet, in the very frame and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his nature, he ſtill bears the <hi>natural</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his Maker. His ſoul is a tranſcript of the <hi>natural</hi> perfections of the Deity. God is a ſpirit, and ſo is the ſoul of man; God is intelligence and activity, and ſo is the ſoul of man. In a word, man is the living image of the living God, in whom is diſplayed more of the divine nature and glory, than in all the works and creatures of God upon earth. Agreeably therefore to the dignity of his nature, God hath placed him at the head of the world, and given him the <hi>dominion</hi> over all his works. Hence ſays the Pſalmiſt, "Thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels, and haſt crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madeſt him to have <hi>dominion</hi> over the works of thy hands; thou haſt put all things under his feet: all ſheep and oxen, yea the beaſts of the field; the fowls of the air; and the fiſh of the ſea." How wide is the kingdom of man! how numerous his ſubjects! how great his dignity!</p>
            <p>GOD has, beſides, inſtamped a dignity upon man by giving him not only a rational, but an immortal exiſtence. The ſoul, which is properly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020344_0007_0FAEFDE9B1125508"/>
the man, ſhall ſurvive the body and live forever. This might be argued from the nature, the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the deſires of the human mind, and from the authority of the wiſer Heathens, who have gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally ſuppoſed the ſoul to be a ſpiritual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal principle in man. But, ſince the Heathen Moraliſts might derive their opinion from a higher ſource than the light of nature, and ſince every created object neceſſarily and ſolely depends, for continued exiſtence, upon the will of the Creator; we chooſe to reſt the evidence of this point upon the authority of the ſacred Oracles. Here indeed we find the immortality of the ſoul ſufficiently eſtabliſhed. Solomon ſaith, "Who knoweth the ſpirit of man that goeth upward, and the ſpirit of the beaſt that goeth downward to the earth?" And, in another place, after deſcribing the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and mortality of the body, he adds, "Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit ſhall return unto God who gave it." A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to this, our Lord declares that men are able to kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul. And God has told us that he will, at the laſt day, ſeparate the righteous from the wicked, and fix the latter in a miſerable, but the former
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020344_0008_0FAEFDEA5B7D4EC8"/>
in a bleſſed immortality. Hence immortality ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the common property and dignity of the human kind.</p>
            <p>THE creatures and objects, with which we are now ſurrounded, have but a ſhort and momentary being. One ſpecies of inſects, we are told, begin and end their exiſtence in twenty-four hours. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers live and flutter a few hours longer, and then drop into their primitive duſt. The larger ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which people the air, the earth, and the ſea do, day after day, in a thick and conſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, die and diſſolve in their own elements. And even the whole material ſyſtem will, after a few ages, either by the immediate hand of God, or by the gradual operation of the laws of nature, be rolled together as a ſcroll, and tumbled into one vaſt and promiſcuous ruin. But <hi>we</hi> ſhall ſurvive all theſe ruins and ravages of time, and live the conſtant ſpectators of the ſucceſſive ſcenes of Eternity. And this renders us infinitely ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, in point of dignity and importance, to all the objects and creatures, whoſe exiſtence expires with time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:020344_0009_0FAEFDEB2E5E4510"/>THE dignity of man alſo appears, from the great attention and regard, which God hath paid to him. God indeed takes care of all his creatures, and his tender mercies are over all his works: But man has always been the favorite child of Providence. God, before he brought him into being, provided a large and beautiful world for his habitation; and ever ſince the day of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he has commanded all nature to contribute to his ſupport and happineſs. For his good, he has appointed the Sun to rule the day, and the Moon to rule the night. Into his boſom, he has ordered the Earth and the Sea to pour all their rich and copious bleſſings. And for his uſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, he has given the fowls of the mountains, the beaſts of the foreſts, and the cattle upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hills. He has alſo given his Angels charge over him, to keep him in all his ways. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they have appeared from time to time, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him in duty, to deliver him from danger, to bring him good tidings, to attend his diſſolution, and to convey his departing ſpirit to the manſions of reſt. But, the moſt diſtinguiſhing and moſt aſtoniſhing diſplay of the divine mercy, is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Death of the Son of God for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020344_0010_0FAEFDEBE7765F08"/>
of man. By the Incarnation of Chriſt, our nature was united with the divine, and the dignity of man with the dignity of Chriſt. Hence all the ſufferings, which Chriſt hath endured on earth, and all the honours, which he hath received in heaven, have diſplayed the dignity of man. And for the ſame reaſon, the dignity of man will be eternally riſing, with the riſing honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>BUT, we muſt furthermore obſerve, that the large and noble capacities of the human mind, ſet the dignity of our nature in the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt light. Let us therefore conſider, in this place, ſeveral of theſe with particular attention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> MAN hath a capacity for conſtant and perpetual progreſſion in knowledge. Animals, indeed, appear to have ſome ſmall degree of knowledge. "The ox knoweth his owner, and the aſs his maſter's crib." But, as all the lower ſpecies are deſtitute of the power of reaſoning, or the faculty of arranging and comparing their ideas; ſo they are totally incapable of enlarging their views, by intellectual improvements. The bee
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020344_0011_0FAEFDEC9893BF80"/>
cannot improve her ſkill, nor the ant her prudence, by obſervation or ſtudy. All their knowledge is the mere gift of God, which he beſtows upon them without any application or exertion of theirs.</p>
            <p>BUT, man is capable of improving in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as long as he enjoys the means or materials of improvement. Indeed he has power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſmalleſt ſtock forever. The faculty of Reaſon, with which he is endowed, enables him to proceed from one degree of knowledge to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in a conſtant and endleſs progreſſion. The grounds of this are obvious. As a certain chain, or connection runs through all branches of knowledge; ſo the acquiſition of one degree of knowledge facilitates the acquiſition of another, and the more a man knows, the more he is capable of knowing. And, as all the powers and faculties of the mind brighten and expand by exerciſe; ſo a man's capacity for improvement increaſes, as the means and thirſt for improvements increaſe. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the path of knowledge, has reſembled the path of the Juſt, which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day. One generation have been improving upon another, from age to age. And
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020344_0012_0FAEFDED5A203B80"/>
the improvements and diſcoveries of the laſt and preſent Century are truly ſurprizing, and juſtify this grand and bold deſcription,</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Earth's diſembowell'd, meaſured are the ſkies,</l>
               <l>"Stars are detected in their deep receſs,</l>
               <l>"Creation widens, vanquiſh'd nature yields,</l>

               <l>"What monuments of genius, ſpirit, pow'r!"</l>
            </q>
            <p>BUT to ſhow that reality in this caſe ſurpaſſes deſcription, let me here mention Solomon, that great man, who is addreſſed in our text, and whoſe aſtoniſhing improvements in knowledge are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by the pen of Inſpiration, for the encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, as well as the inſtruction of all future ages. "And Solomon's wiſdom excelled the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Eaſt country, and all the wiſdom of Egypt. For he was wiſer than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the ſons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. And he ſpake three thouſand prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erbs, and his ſongs were a thouſand and five. And he ſpake of trees, from the cedar-tree that is in Lebanon, even unto the hyſſop that ſpringeth out of the wall: he ſpake alſo of beaſts, and of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020344_0013_0FAEFDEE6D62F520"/>
fowls, and of creeping things, and of fiſhes." The children of the Eaſt country were the Chaldeans, who, after the flood, made the firſt advances in Aſtronomy, Philoſophy and other abſtruſe ſciences. Next to them the Egyptians turned their attention to Learning, and ſoon outrivalled all other nations in literary fame. Solomon therefore ſurpaſſed all the Prieſts and Poets, all the Phyſicians and Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians, and all the Naturaliſts, Philoſophers, and Aſtronomers of the two moſt antient, and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined nations in the world. What an exalted idea does this exhibit of his wiſdom and learning! And, as we muſt ſuppoſe that he made theſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by reading, by obſervation, and ſtudy; ſo he ſtands a laſting ornament of human nature, and a perpetual monument of man's capacity for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and endleſs advances in knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> MAN hath a capacity for holineſs as well as knowledge. The horſe and mule which have no underſtanding, and indeed all the lower animals, are utterly incapable of holineſs; and even Omnipotence himſelf, to ſpeak with rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, cannot make them holy, without eſſentially altering the frame and conſtitution of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020344_0014_0FAEFDEF03D56A30"/>
But man is capable of holineſs. His ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and moral faculties both capacitate and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige him to be holy. His perception and voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in connection with his reaſon and conſcience, enable him to diſcern and feel the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> of actions, and the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>deformity</hi> of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This renders him capable of doing juſtly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God. In a word, this renders him capable of every holy and virtuous affection. And, as he is capable of growing in knowledge, ſo he is capable of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in grace, in a conſtant and endleſs progreſſion. What a dignity does this give to man, and how near does it place him to principalities and powers above! This leads me to obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THAT man hath a capacity for happineſs, equal to his capacity for holineſs and knowledge. Knowledge and holineſs are the grand pillars which ſupport all true and ſubſtantial happineſs; which invariably riſes or falls, accordingly as theſe are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtronger or weaker. Knowledge and holineſs in the Deity are the ſource of all his happineſs. Angels riſe in felicity as they riſe in holineſs and knowledge. And ſaints here below grow in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020344_0015_0FAEFDF50DC160A8"/>
as they grow in grace, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of holy and divine objects. Of this, we have a beautiful and ſtriking inſtance in Solomon. View him at the Dedication of the Temple, when he fell upon his knees, and lifted up his hands and his heart to God, and poured into the ear of the divine Majeſty the voice of prayer and ſupplication, the voice of joy, of gratitude and praiſe. How near did he approach to God! how high did he riſe in felicity! how much did he anticipate the joys of the bleſſed! And, if we now follow him to the Temple above, where his views, his affections, and his joys are inceſſantly enlarging; we may form ſome faint conception of that amazing height, to which man is capable of riſing in pure and divine enjoyments. What a veſſel of honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will man appear, when all his capacities for knowledge, for holineſs, and for happineſs, ſhall be completely filled! And to all this we muſt add,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> THAT man hath a capacity for great and noble actions. Of this, we might find numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous monuments, if we had time to ſurvey the land of Shinar, where Babel, Babylon, and Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah ſtood; or the land of Egypt, where ſo many
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020344_0016_0FAEFDF68D9599A0"/>
grand and coſtly Pyramids, Tombs, and Temples were erected; or the famous cities of Greece and of Rome, where the nobler efforts of human power and genius, have been ſtill more amply diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played. But, the bounds of this diſcourſe will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us only to mention a few Individuals of our race, who, by their great and noble exertions, have done honour to human nature. Noah, the ſecond Father of mankind, ſaved the world from total extinction. Joſeph preſerved two nations from temporal ruin. Moſes delivered the People of God from the houſe of bondage, and led them through hoſts of enemies and ſeas of blood to the land of promiſe. David ſettled the kingdom of Iſrael in peace; and Solomon raiſed it to the ſummit of national glory. Paul, in ſpite of Pagan ſuperſtition, laws and learning, eſtabliſhed Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity in the Heathen world. Luther, by the tongue and pen of controverſy, brought about a great and glorious revolution in the chriſtian Church. Newton, by his diſcoveries in the <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> and Locke, by his diſcoveries in the <hi>intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> world, have enlarged the boundaries of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knowledge, and of human happineſs. And, to name no more, Franklin in the Cabinet, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020344_0017_0FAEFDF71D3CAA38"/>
Waſhington in the Field, have given Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Peace to America. But greater things than theſe remain to be done. The kingdom of Antichriſt is to be deſtroyed, the Mahomedans are to be ſubdued, the Jews are to be reſtored, the Barbarous nations are to be civilized, the Goſpel is to be preached to all nations, and the whole face of things in this world, is to be beautifully and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly changed. Theſe things are to be done by the inſtrumentality of man. And by theſe, his capacity for great and noble actions, will be ſtill more illuſtriouſly diſplayed. Thus the image, which man bears of his Maker, the immortal ſpirit which reſides within him, the diſtinguiſhing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which he has received from the Father of mercies, and all his noble powers and faculties, unite to ſtamp a dignity upon his nature, and raiſe him high in the ſcale of Being.</p>
            <p>IT now remains to make a few Deductions from the ſubject, and to apply it to the happy occaſion of our preſent meeting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> WE may juſtly infer from the nature and dignity of man, that we are under indiſpenſible
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020344_0018_0FAEFDF7F10B38B8"/>
obligations to Religion. Our <hi>moral</hi> obligations to religion are interwoven with the firſt principles of our nature. Our minds are ſo framed, that we are capable of knowing, of loving, and of ſerving our Creator; and this lays us under <hi>moral</hi> obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to worſhip and obey him. Nor is there one of our race, who is incapable of feeling his <hi>moral</hi> obligations to religion. Only draw the character of the Supreme Being, and deſcribe his power, wiſdom, goodneſs, juſtice, and mercy, before the moſt ignorant and uncultivated Savage; and, as ſoon as he underſtands the character of God, he will feel that he <hi>ought,</hi> that he is <hi>morally obliged</hi> to love and obey the great Parent of all. He will feel himſelf under the ſame <hi>moral</hi> obligation to pay <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious homage</hi> to God, as to ſpeak the truth, or to do juſtice to man. Every man in the world is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſeeing that the worſhip of God is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice. Religion therefore takes its riſe and obligation not from the laws of Politicians, nor from the ignorance and ſuperſtition of Prieſts; but from the immutable laws of nature, and the frame and conſtitution of the human mind. Hence it is utterly impoſſible for men wholly to eradicate from their minds all ſenſe of <hi>moral</hi> obligation to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020344_0019_0FAEFDF898985F18"/>
religion, ſo long as they remain moral agents, and are poſſeſſed of common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>AND, as man is formed for religion, ſo religion is the ornament and perfection of his nature. The man of religion is, in every ſuppoſable ſituation, the man of dignity. Pain, poverty, misfortune, ſickneſs and death, may indeed <hi>veil,</hi> but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſtroy his dignity, which ſometimes ſhines with more reſplendent glory, under all theſe ills and clouds of life. While the ſoul is in health and proſperity; while the mind is warmed with holy and religious affections, the man appears with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whether he is in pain, or in ſickneſs, or even in the agonies of death. But, Atheiſm and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, with their evil offspring, ſerve more than all other cauſes put together, to defile the nature, and ſink, the dignity of man. This appears from the black deſcription, which the great Apoſtle Paul has drawn of thoſe nations, who <hi>liked not to retain God in their knowledge.</hi> "They changed the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptibl<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>eping things. They changed the truth of God into a lie, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020344_0020_0FAEFDF960954348"/>
and ſerved the creature more than the Creator. They <hi>diſhonoured</hi> their own bodies by the moſt mean and infamous vices. And they became of a <hi>reprobate mind,</hi> being filled with all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fornication, covetouſneſs, maliciouſneſs; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perers, backbiters, haters of God, deſpiteful, proud, boaſters, inventors of evil things, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to parents, without underſtanding, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breakers, without natural affection, impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, unmerciful." Theſe are things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the nature, and degrade the dignity of man.</p>
            <p>AND theſe too are prejudicial to all learning and mental improvements. Theſe debilitate the mind, cloud the imagination, and cramp all the noble powers and faculties of the ſoul. Theſe degraded the Alexanders, the Pompeys, and the Caeſars of the world, below the human kind. Had they been influenced by truly virtuous and religious motives, their great exertions would have done honour to human nature, but now they have ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the glory of all fleſh. Nay, even a <hi>declenſion</hi> in religion hath left indelible ſtains upon the brighteſt Characters recorded in ſacred ſtory; I
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020344_0021_0FAEFDFA23D8A6A8"/>
mean Noah, David, and Solomon. Solomon was at the height of his glory, when at the height of religion; but when he declined into vice and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, he fell into ſhame and diſgrace, and loſt that dignity, which had filled the world with his fame.</p>
            <p>NOW there is nothing that can wipe off from human nature theſe blemiſhes, and reſtore the dignity of man, but true religion. That charity which ſeeketh not her own, that love which is the fulfilling of the law, is the eſſence of religion and the bond of perfection. This cures the mind of Atheiſm, Infidelity and Vice. This fills the ſoul with noble views and ſentiments, and directs all its powers and faculties to their proper uſe and end. This exalts the dignity of human nature, and ſpreads the greateſt glory around any human character. This rendered Noah ſuperior to Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, Moſes ſuperior to Pharaoh, David ſuperior to Saul, Solomon ſuperior to Socrates, Daniel ſuperior to the wiſe men of Babylon, and Paul ſuperior to Plato, and all the Sages of the Pagan world. "Happy is the man who findeth <hi>religion:</hi> For the merchandiſe of it is better than the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of ſilver, and the gain thereof than fine

gold. She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canſt deſire, are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to her. Length of days are in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is the man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth her." Let us all then put on this rich and beautiful ornament, and ſhew ourſelves men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> THIS ſubject may help us to aſcertain the only proper and immutable boundaries of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knowledge. I mean ſuch boundaries of our knowledge, as ariſe from the frame and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nature, and not from any particular ſtate or ſtage of our exiſtence. Our rational powers, it is often ſaid, are limited, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all our intellectual purſuits and improvements muſt be equally limited. This is doubtleſs true in a certain ſenſe, but not in the ſenſe in which it is generally underſtood. It appears from what has been obſerved in this diſcourſe, concerning the powers and faculties of the human mind, that men are capable of making conſtant and eternal progreſſion in knowledge. The only bounds
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020344_0023_0FAEFDFCE6C9DEE0"/>
therefore that can be ſet to their intellectual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, muſt be ſuch as have reſpect to the <hi>kinds,</hi> and not to the <hi>degrees</hi> of their knowledge. There are, indeed, certain <hi>kinds</hi> of knowledge, which men are totally incapable of underſtanding; but theſe are only ſuch <hi>kinds</hi> of knowledge, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more than <hi>created</hi> faculties to underſtand. For, whatever <hi>kinds</hi> of knowledge any <hi>created</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are capable of underſtanding, <hi>men</hi> are alſo capable of underſtanding, though with more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and leſs rapidity. As Newton knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which any man is now incapable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a certain time, and under certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; ſo there is nothing, which any intelligent creatures now know, that men are incapable of knowing, in a given time, and under proper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. The truth is, rationality is the ſame in all intelligent beings. Reaſon is the ſame thing in God, in Angels, and in Men. As men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bear the <hi>image</hi> of God, in point of Rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; ſo they poſſeſs all the <hi>rational</hi> powers and faculties, which bear any analogy to the divine intelligence; or, which can be communicated to <hi>created</hi> beings. Accordingly Angels are ſuperior to men in the ſame ſenſe, and perhaps nearly in
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020344_0024_0FAEFDFD27B50230"/>
the ſame degree, that Newton was ſuperior to moſt of his own ſpecies. As Newton had no <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> power or faculty peculiar to himſelf; ſo Angels have no rational powers or faculties which are not common to all intelligent creatures. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man therefore is capable of learning all that any man, or any intelligent creature has learned, or can learn. Hence the only natural and neceſſary diſtinction between Angels and men, and between one man and another is this; that Angels are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of acquiring knowledge more eaſily, and more ſwiftly than men; and ſome men are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of acquiring knowledge more eaſily, and more ſwiftly than others. And this difference between Angels and men, and between man and man, to whatever cauſe it may be owing, will probably continue forever; and forever keep up a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their knowledge and improvements for the time being.</p>
            <p>NOW this being a ſettled point, we may eaſily, perhaps, fix the proper boundaries of human knowledge, or determine the proper ſubjects of human enquiry. It is a caveat given to men, but eſpecially to inquiſitive men, not to pry into
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020344_0025_0FAEFDFDEBD48138"/>
things above their meaſure. This caveat, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, in ſome caſes, may be very proper and neceſſary; but generally, I imagine, it is not only needleſs but abſurd. For, unleſs men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to pry into things which ſurpaſs <hi>created</hi> powers and faculties, I do not know that they tranſgreſs the boundaries of human knowledge. There are ſome things, which, in a moment, we know cannot be underſtood by <hi>creatures.</hi> And there may be many others, which, by a little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, we may perceive come under the ſame predicament. All therefore that Divines and Metaphyſicians, as well as Philoſophers have to do, in order to know where to <hi>begin,</hi> and, where to <hi>end</hi> their reſearches, is only to determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not, the propoſed ſubjects require more than <hi>created</hi> abilities to inveſtigate them. If they do require more than <hi>created</hi> abilities, it is vain and abſurd to proceed: but if they do not, we have the ſame grounds to proceed, that men have ever had, to attempt new diſcoveries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THIS ſubject gives us reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that men, in the preſent ſtate, may carry their reſearches into the works of nature, much
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020344_0026_0FAEFDFE9ABC8B20"/>
further than they have ever yet carried them. The fields of Science, though they have been long traverſed by ſtrong and inquiſitive minds, are ſo ſpacious, that many parts remain yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered. There may be therefore room left in Divinity and Metaphyſics, as well as in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and other ſciences, to make large im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements. The large and growing capacities of men, and the great diſcoveries and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the laſt and preſent Century, give us grounds to hope, that human learning and knowledge will increaſe from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, through all the remaining periods of time. Men have the ſame encouragements now, that Bacon, Newton and Franklin had, to puſh their reſearches further and further into the works of nature. It is, therefore, as groundleſs, as it is a diſcouraging ſentiment, which has been often flung out, that all the ſubjects of Divinity, all of human inquiry, are nearly exhauſted, and that no great diſcoveries or improvements, at this time of day, are either to be expected or attempted. The preſent Generation have ſuperior advantages, which, with capacities no more than equal to their Fathers, may enable them to ſurpaſs all who
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020344_0027_0FAEFDFFF0313C08"/>
have gone before them in the paths of Science. Let this thought rouſe their attention, and awaken their exertions, to ſhew themſelves men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> THE obſervations, which have been made upon the noble powers and capacities of the human mind, may embolden the Sons of Science to aim to be Originals. They are ſtrong enough to go alone, if they only have ſufficient courage and reſolution. They have the ſame capacities and the ſame original ſources of knowledge, that the Antients enjoyed. All men are as capable of thinking, of reaſoning, and of judging for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in matters of Learning, as in the common affairs and concerns of life. And would men of Letters enjoy the pleaſures of knowledge, and render themſelves the moſt ſerviceable to the world, let them determine to think and judge for themſelves. Their progreſs may perhaps, in this way, not be ſo rapid; yet it will be much more entertaining and uſeful. When I ſay their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs may not be ſo rapid, I mean with reſpect to thoſe only, who poſſeſs moderate abilities; for as to thoſe of ſuperior powers, they will make much ſwifter progreſs by going alone out of the common,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020344_0028_0FAEFE0019FD2708"/>
beaten track. The way to outſtrip thoſe who have gone before us, is not to tread in their ſteps, but to take a nearer courſe. What Philoſopher can expect to overtake Newton, by going over all the ground, which he travelled? What Divine can expect to come up with Mede, Baxter, or Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, while he purſues their path? Or, what Poet can hope to tranſcend Homer and Milton, ſo long as he ſets up theſe men as the ſtandards of perfection? If the Moderns would only employ Nature's powers, and converſe freely and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with Nature's objects, they might riſe above the Antients, and bear away the Palm from all who have gone before them in the walks of Science.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> WHAT has been ſaid concerning the nature and dignity of man, ſhows us, that we are under indiſpenſable obligations to cultivate and improve our minds in all the branches of human knowledge. All our natural powers are ſo many talents, which, in their own nature, lay us under <hi>moral</hi> obligation to improve them to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Being men, we are obliged to act like men, and not like the horſe or the mule which
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:020344_0029_0FAEFE00CC07A2B8"/>
have no underſtanding. Beſides, knowledge, next to religion, is the brighteſt ornament of human nature. Knowledge ſtrengthens, enlarges, and ſoftens the human ſoul, and ſets its beauty and dignity in the faireſt light. Learning hath made aſtoniſhing diſtinctions among the different nations of the earth. Thoſe nations, who have lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the warm and enlightening beams of ſcience, have appeared like a ſuperior order of beings, in compariſon with thoſe, who have dragged out their lives under the cold and dark ſhades of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. The Chaldeans and Egyptians, as well as the Greeks and Romans, while they cultivated the arts and ſciences, far ſurpaſſed, in dignity and glory, all their ignorant and barbarous neighbours. Europe, ſince the reſurrection of Letters in the ſixteenth Century, appears to be peopled with a ſuperior ſpecies. And the preſent Inhabitants of North-America owe all their ſuperiority to the Aboriginals, in point of dignity, to the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their minds in the civil and polite arts. Learning has alſo preſerved the Names, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and mighty Deeds of all antient nations from total oblivion. A few learned men in each nation, have done more to ſpread their national
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020344_0030_0FAEFE040AE352B0"/>
fame, than all their Kings and Heroes. The boaſted glory of Britain is more to be aſcribed to her Newtons, her Lockes, and her Addiſons, than to all her Kings, and Fleets, and Conquerors.</p>
            <p>BUT the cultivation and improvement of the mind is more neceſſary for uſe, than for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We were made for uſefulneſs and not for amuſement. We were made to be the ſervants of God, and of each other. We were made to live an active, diligent, and uſeful life. As men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot reach the end of our being, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cultivating all our mental powers, in order to furniſh ourſelves for the moſt extenſive ſervice in our day and generation. Knowledge and learning are uſeful in every ſtation; and in the higher and more important departments of life, they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and indiſpenſibly neceſſary.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me now, therefore, My Hearers, to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſeveral things, which may ſerve to excite you to improve your minds in every branch of uſeful knowledge which, either your callings, or your circumſtances require.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:020344_0031_0FAEFE05B32A05C0"/>I AM happy to congratulate you, my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that we live in an age, which is favourable to mental and literary improvements. In the preſent age, our Country is in a medium between Barbarity and Refinement. In ſuch an age, the minds of men are ſtrong and vigorous, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enfeebled by luxury, nor ſhackled by author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. At ſuch an happy period, we have come upon the ſtage, with the fields of ſcience before us opened but not explored. This ſhould rouſe our dormant faculties, and call up all our latent powers in the vigorous purſuit of knowledge. Thoſe, who have gone before us in theſe purſuits, have only ſet us an example, and facilitated our progreſs, without damping our hopes, or forbidding our ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, we live under that Form of government, which has always been the friend of the Muſes, and parent and nurſe of Arts. It was while Greece and Rome were free, republican States, that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there ſprang up, flouriſhed, and roſe to its height; and enrolled their Names in the annals of Fame. Liberty, which is the birth-right of man, and congenial with his nature, ennobles and exalts the mind; inſpires it with great and ſublime ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:020344_0032_0FAEFE0705D6D3C8"/>
and, at the ſame time invites and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages its higheſt exertions, with hopes of ſucceſs and the promiſes of reward. For, in free Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, where liberty is equally enjoyed, every man has weight and influence in proportion to his abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, and a fair opportunity of riſing, by the dint of merit, to the firſt offices and honours of the State.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER motive to improvement, you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to ſay, may be taken from your paſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and laudable efforts to cultivate and diffuſe uſeful knowledge in this place. It is now more than Thirty years, ſince this ſingle and then ſmall Congregation collected a very conſiderable Pariſh-Library, in order to improve their minds in uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and divine knowledge. This was ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to promote mental improvements as, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine, cannot be eaſily found in this Country. The benefit of this Library you have all perhaps more or leſs experienced; and, to its happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence owe, in a meaſure, your general Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a Religious and Intelligent People. May this conſideration have all its weight upon you, ſince our Lord hath ſaid in the Parable of the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, "Whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:020344_0033_0FAEFE07993D2E80"/>IN this reſpect, how wonderful the ſmiles of Providence upon you! Whoſe heart doth not glow with gratitude for the auſpicious occaſion which hath now brought us together! How great our obligations to God for the unmerited and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Favour of a rich Collection of Books now received, as a mark of Reſpect of the firſt literary Character in America, his Excellency Preſident FRANKLIN! This well choſen and very valuable Library, while it ſets the divine kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a high and engaging light, lays you under the ſtrongeſt ties of gratitude to improve the means of cultivating your minds for the ſervice of God and of your fellow-men. Should you ſecond the views of that great Man, and build upon the broad foundation which he has gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly laid, you may enjoy ample advantages, in point of Books, to improve your mental powers, and furniſh yourſelves for uſefulneſs in all your various ſtations and employments of life. Nor can you neglect or abuſe ſuch advantages, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing upon yourſelves the reproach of the world, and which is infinitely more, the reproach of your own conſciences. Be entreated then to improve to the beſt advantage, every price put into your hands to get wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:020344_0034_0FAEFE08588A1AC0"/>THERE are three grand ſources of knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, Nature, Men, and Books. Attentively read each of theſe great Volumes.</p>
            <p>READ Nature, which is truly an original au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. King David, ſtudying this large and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive volume, which filled his mind with the nobleſt views and ſentiments, broke forth in a rapture of praiſe, "The heavens declare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God; and the firmament ſheweth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge."</p>
            <p>READ Men. "For as in water face anſwereth to face, ſo the heart of man to man." This vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume David peruſed and digeſted in the Court and Camp of Saul, where human nature, with, and without a veil, was very viſible to his critical and diſcerning eye.</p>
            <p>BUT the deſign of this diſcourſe more directly leads me to urge the reading of Books in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Theſe are a grand magazine of knowledge, and contain the Learning and Wiſdom of ages. But, you muſt know, that Books are a peculiar fountain, from whence may be drawn either <hi>ſweet</hi> waters or <hi>bitter,</hi> the waters of <hi>life,</hi> or the waters of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:020344_0035_0FAEFE0930A62D88"/>
               <hi>death.</hi> For this reaſon, you will allow me here to adviſe you, to take heed <hi>how</hi> you read.</p>
            <p>AND, in the firſt place, read with Caution. A perſon may be undone by a ſingle volume. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contains ſuch ſecret and fatal poiſon as Books. Though they profeſs a kind and friendly intention, yet they often bite like a ſerpent and ſting like an adder. Be careful what books you read. There are many, which the young and inexperienced at leaſt, ſhould totally avoid. In this particular, if you are wiſe, and faithful to yourſelves, you will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obtain and follow good advice.</p>
            <p>READ with Judgment. This is, in every view, indiſpenſibly neceſſary, in order to read to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. This will enable you to diſcover and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the main object of your Author, which will be a key to all he ſays in the various parts and branches of his ſubject. This will help you to diſtinguiſh truth from error, good ſentiments from bad, and ſound reaſoning and ſtrict demonſtration, from mere conjectures and bold aſſertions. But if you read without judgment, you will be in danger of imbibing error as well as truth, of always believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt Author you read, and of never having any fixed and ſettled ſentiments of your own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:020344_0036_0FAEFE09DB0363D8"/>READ for Uſe and not for Amuſement. The time is worſe than thrown away, which is ſpent in reading for amuſement, without any particular end or object in view. We ſhould be careful how we take up a Book, eſpecially, if it be an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining one, with which we have no particular concern; for it will require a conſiderable effort of the mind to throw it aſide, and if we do not throw it aſide it will ſteal away our time, and prevent our being better employed. Almoſt any book, if read for uſe, may be of advantage. We may read amuſing, and, even corrupting books to advantage, if we read them in order to make a good uſe of them. The bee can ſuck honey from the ſame flowers, from which other inſects ſuck poiſon. But we may read all our lives to very little purpoſe, if we read every book which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to fall in our way for amuſement and not for uſe. We ſhould always read with reference, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our own particular profeſſion, or to the particular ſtate and ſituation of our own minds. When we read with either of theſe objects in view, we ſhall be apt both to underſtand and digeſt what we read. There is great and ſingular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in reading proper books at a proper time, when we really ſtand in need of them. This is
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:020344_0037_0FAEFE0AB8C5C870"/>
of the ſame happy tendency, as eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the proper ſeaſons, when it ſerves to nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and ſtrengthen, inſtead of clogging and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the body.</p>
            <p>READ with Patience. Many Authors are both prolix and obſcure in conveying their ideas; and after-all, have much more chaff than wheat in their writings. In reading ſuch, we muſt go over a great deal of ground in order to reap a ſmall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of ideas. It is difficult, however, for any man to treat any ſubject in a method entirely new. We muſt expect therefore to find many common and familiar thoughts in every Author, which we muſt patiently read, if we would <hi>properly</hi> come at thoſe which are more new, entertaining and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. And for this reaſon it is generally beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if Authors are of any tolerable ſize, to read them through, with patience and attention. This is but juſtice to them, and prudence to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>READ with Confidence. In our firſt eſſays af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge, we are obliged, by the laws of our nature, to depend upon the aſſiſtance and inſtruction of others, and in conſequence of this, we are apt to feel, through life, too great a ſenſe of our own weakneſs and imbecility, and to deſpair of going a
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:020344_0038_0FAEFE0B55AE3390"/>
ſtep further than we are led. This, however is very unfriendly to all improvement by reading. We ought therefore to feel that we are men, and place a proper degree of confidence in our own ſtrength and judgment. We ought to fix it in our minds that we are capable of improvement. Such a confidence in ourſelves as this, will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden us to read with a view not only of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but of improving upon the Authors we read. Very few Authors have exhauſted the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects upon which they have treated, and therefore have generally left us ample room to improve upon what they have written. And by reading with this view, if we fail of improving upon thoſe we read, we ſhall, however, more clearly and fully underſtand <hi>their</hi> meaning, and more thoroughly make <hi>their</hi> ideas and ſentiments our own.</p>
            <p>YET, at the ſame time, every one ſhould read with Humility. Reading, more than any other method of improvement, is apt to puff up the mind with pride and ſelf-conceit. For, perſons of reading are very prone to eſtimate their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge more according to the number of books which they have read, than according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ideas which they have collected and digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020344_0039_0FAEFE0C2227C640"/>
And ſo are ready to imagine, that they have engroſſed to themſelves all knowledge; though, in reality, they have not read enough, to learn their own ignorance. This ſhould teach us to take the Poet's advice.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"A little learning is a dangerous thing:</l>
               <l>"Drink deep, or taſte not the Pierian ſpring.</l>
               <l>"There ſhallow draughts intoxicate the brain;</l>
               <l>"And drinking largely ſobers us again."</l>
            </q>
            <p>NOR is pedantry peculiar to thoſe only, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to read and ſtudy late in life; for it is too often found among thoſe, who have enjoyed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and liberal education. Do not Phyſicians and Attorneys, by reading a few books in Divin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, ſometimes fancy themſelves maſters of that ſacred and ſublime ſcience? And, on the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, do not Divines, by reading a few books in Law and Phyſic, ſometimes fancy themſelves maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of thoſe two learned profeſſions? But this is rank pedantry. It is an eaſy matter to gain a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial acquaintance with the general objects of ſcience; but it is a laborious taſk to acquire a deep and thorough acquaintance with any ſingle branch of knowledge. It is eaſy to know <hi>ſomething</hi> about <hi>every thing</hi>; but it is difficult to know <hi>every thing</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:020344_0040_0FAEFE0CD5612CD0"/>
about <hi>any thing.</hi> If men of reading would collect the whole ſtock of their knowledge, and the whole force of their genius more to a point, and aim to be complete maſters of their own profeſſions; they would become at once, much leſs pedantic, and much more uſeful to the world. Many men of real abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and learning, have defeated their own uſefulneſs, by attempting to know, and to do too much.</p>
            <p>IN the laſt place, read <hi>prayerfully.</hi> "If any of you lack wiſdom, ſays the Apoſtle, let him aſk of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not; and it ſhall be given him." This Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon found to be true, by happy experience. "In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God ſaid, Aſk what I ſhall give thee. And Solomon ſaid, Thou haſt ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſervant David my father great mercy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteouſneſs, and in uprightneſs of heart with thee; and thou haſt kept for him this great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that thou haſt given him a ſon to ſit on his throne, as it is this day. And now, O Lord my God, thou haſt made thy ſervant king inſtead of David my father; <hi>and I am but a child; I know not how to go out or come in.</hi> And thy ſervant is in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020344_0041_0FAEFE0E4613D4F8"/>
the midſt of thy people which thou haſt choſen, a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. <hi>Give therefore thy ſervant an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding heart</hi>; to judge thy people, that I may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy ſo great a people? <hi>And the ſpeech pleaſed the Lord, that Solomon had aſked this thing.</hi> And God ſaid unto him, Becauſe thou haſt aſked this thing, and haſt not aſked for thyſelf long life; neither haſt aſked riches for thyſelf, nor haſt aſked the life of thine enemies, but haſt aſked for thyſelf <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> to diſcern judgment; behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee <hi>a wiſe and underſtanding heart."</hi> It was Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge, I think, who never uſed to take up a new book to read, without an ejaculatory prayer for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence and direction. This example is worthy of univerſal imitation. Let us therefore always accompany our eſſays after knowledge with a humble and prayerful ſpirit; and then we may hope to read and ſtudy with ſafety and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>TO all theſe directions, I might now add, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Perſeverance, which always have had, and always will have, a mighty influence, in all the great things done by mankind. But I ſhall only
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:020344_0042_0FAEFE0F998BEEA8"/>
add a few words to thoſe, who are very immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and deeply intereſted in the things which have been ſaid in this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>THIS ſubject calls upon Parents in particular, to ſhew themſelves men. You are, my reſpectable Hearers, men in years, be men alſo in virtue, in religion, and in underſtanding. Let the dignity of man appear in all your conduct, and eſpecially in your conduct towards your children. Let them ſee the dignity of human nature exemplified before their young and attentive minds. They are every day, and every hour, watching your conduct, and looking up to you for example and inſtruction. Take heed, that none of your words, none of your actions, none of your purſuits, be unworthy of men. But, let all your converſation and behaviour be ſuch as your children may follow with propriety, with ſafety, and dignity. And while you are teaching them by example, teach them alſo by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Give them good inſtruction; and for this purpoſe, provide them good inſtructors. Theſe are of great importance to your children, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in knowledge, will generally bear a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act proportion to the abilities and fidelity of their Teachers. The education of children has always
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020344_0043_0FAEFE102CC2A9F8"/>
been an object of great attention among all wiſe nations, and eſpecially among all wiſe and good Parents. Let this then be the object of your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Conſider the dignity of man. Conſider the worth of the ſoul. Conſider the rich and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable treaſure put into your hands. Conſider how much the dignity and happineſs of your children both in time and in Eternity, depend upon your care and fidelity. And let the ties of nature, the authority of God, and your own ſolemn vows, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you to bring them up in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord, and to cultivate and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh their opening minds in every branch of uſeful and ornamental knowledge. Admit not the thought, that ſuch little, ſuch weak, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſuch uſeleſs creatures, are of ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; but remember that they are men in miniature, and may, one day, ſurprize the world with their dignity. When a young Prince is born, all the Kingdom feel the importance of his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are anxiouſly concerned to have the ableſt inſtructors employed, to form him for great and noble actions. But you have more than Princes, even young Immortals, committed to your care, whoſe powers and capacities, whoſe dignity and importance, will aſtoniſh you, at the great Day, if
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:020344_0044_0FAEFE1385C89F10"/>
not before. How happy will that parent be, who ſhall then be found to have been faithful to his children! "He will then join, as a celebrated Writer obſerves, his virtuous offspring in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of the juſt, and there ſee them riſe up and call him bleſſed. But if a parent neglects his duty to his children; if he ſets before them an example of irreligion, and ſuffers them to grow up looſe and unprincipled, he may expect that their blood will be required at his hands, and he ſhould tremble to think of that period of retribution, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they will curſe him for that negligence which has ruined them."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> LET this ſubject awaken the attention of the Youth, to the dignity of their nature and the end of their being. My dear young Friends, you will ſoon be called to act your various parts upon the ſtage of life. You are now the Hope of your Parents, of your Paſtors, and of your Country. The eyes of the world are upon you. Be entreated then to cultivate all your noble powers, and to ſhew yourſelves men, in whatever departments of life, divine Providence ſhall place you. Piety and Knowledge will prepare you for a uſeful and honourable life, and for a peaceful
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020344_0045_0FAEFE139F6B1B28"/>
and triumphant death. Let theſe then be the ſupreme objects of your purſuit. Early conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate all your time and all your talents to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and of your fellow-men. Seek for knowledge, as for ſilver, and ſearch for it, as for hid treaſures; and ſacrifice every object which obſtructs your purſuit of it. "Through deſire a man having <hi>ſeparated himſelf,</hi> ſays Solomon, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and intermeddleth with all wiſdom." If you would make progreſs in learning, and riſe to any diſtinguiſhing degrees of knowledge, you muſt ſeparate yourſelves from the vanities of youth, and devote thoſe vacant hours to mental improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, too many of your age trifle away in folly and vice. In particular, flee youthful luſts, which war againſt both the body and the mind. Shun that all-devouring monſter, Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, by which ſo many <hi>ſtrong minds</hi> have been caſt down and deſtroyed. Avoid bad company and unmanly diverſions, which are an inlet to every vice. Hold in ſteady contempt, <hi>Beaus</hi> and <hi>Fops,</hi> thoſe butterflies which live upon the filth and dregs of the earth. Diogenes walking the ſtreets of Athens at noon-day with a lanthorn in his hand; and being aſked, as he intended to be, what he was ſearching after, tartly replied, "I am
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:020344_0046_0FAEFE15A8E30E68"/>
looking for Men." A ſevere ſatire upon the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury and effeminacy of that once manly and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous People. The dignity of man appears in the ornaments of the mind, and not in thoſe of the body. Seek therefore to adorn and embelliſh your minds both by reading and obſervation, and your gifts and abilities will make room for you, and bring you before great men. You have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar advantages and encouragements to animate you to great and noble exertions. <hi>Therefore ſet your Mark of intellectual attainments as high as you pleaſe, and, according to the common courſe of events, you will, by uniformity, diligence, and perſeverance, infallibly reach it.</hi> Your generous Benefactor hath ſet you an example, as well as given you the means of intellectual improvements. That Great Man, in the morning of life, was ſurrounded with uncommon difficulties and embarraſſments, but by the mere dint of genius and of application, he ſurmounted every obſtacle thrown in his way, and by his rapid and aſtoniſhing progreſs in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he hath riſen, ſtep by ſtep, to the firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and honours of his Country, hath appeared with dignity in the Courts of Britain and of France, and now fills more than half the globe with his Fame. Keep this illuſtrious example in your eye, and ſhew yourſelves men.</p>
