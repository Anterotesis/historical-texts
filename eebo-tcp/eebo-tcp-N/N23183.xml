            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE deſign of the Author in publiſhing the following pages, being not merely to amuſe gentlemen of the faculty, but for the general benefit of all ſuch as may be prompted by motives of intereſt or curioſity to peruſe them; he has endeavored for that reaſon to render his ſhort treatiſe as intelligible as poſſible, by carefully avoiding the unneceſſary uſe of technical and abſtruſe phraſes and confining himſelf to as plain and familiar terms as the nature of the ſubject would admit.</p>
            <p>But having neceſſarily made uſe in certain inſtances in the phraſeology of the late Dr. Brown, of the terms Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability—excitability redundant and excitability ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, has thought proper to tender the following defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the ſenſe in which he wiſhes theſe expreſſions to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>By excitability is meant that principle of ſuſceptibility inherent in all animated nature, but more obvious in the animal world, that capacity of being acted upon by the application of certain external agents or powers deſigned by the wiſe author of nature for the ſupport and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuence of our animal exiſtence; among which agents or powers are included meat, drink, exerciſe, air, mental paſſions, &amp;c. In ſhort every thing which ſerves to excite or quicken the wheels of action in the ſyſtem. And theſe agents or exciting powers are denominated ſtimulants.</p>
            <p>By <hi>excitability redundant,</hi> is to be underſtood that irritable week and infeebled ſtate of the body, induced by a privation or withholding the agency or aid of the ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating powers.</p>
            <p>By <hi>excitability exhauſted</hi> or waſted is meant that ſtate of the body conſequent to a too free, too ſtrong, or a long continued application in certain caſes, of the ſtimulating agents whereby the ſuſceptability is overpowered and finally extinguiſhed.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>VIEWING the ravages the Conſumption has made, and is ſtill making among mankind, and that not with an eye of indifference, and obſerving, that, benefit derived from medical aid in ſuch caſes, fell much ſhort of what is common in moſt other complaints incident to the human frame, I was led to conſider attentively the theory on which the common mode of practice was founded; to become very inquiſitive about the nature of this diſeaſe; to ſearch the writing both ancient and modern of all the authors I could obtain on the ſubject, and carefully to examine its progreſs and operation on ſuch as were affected with it, whenever opportunity preſented. In the courſe of theſe reſearches I diſcovered a new mode of practice, (firſt adopted by Dr. May, and after him followed by ſeveral other gentlemen of the faculty,) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with very flattering ſucceſs. This mode, is by the doctor ſupported by reaſonings, warranted by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment and juſtified by facts, which clearly evince, that the inflammation heat, &amp;c. in the conſumption originate from a ſource, directly the reverſe of what had hitherto been the prevailing opinion, and point out in a very ſtriking manner the propriety of his new mode of practice. This diſcovery afforded me not a little conſolation, and I was encouraged to hope, that the grating ſounds `<hi>If you have got the conſumption lay aſide your phyſician, he will do you more harm than good,</hi>' ſo often pronounced by the friends of the ſick, might in proceſs of time be forever baniſhed from my ears; but my exultation was very much eclipſed, when I found that ſome, be the cauſe what it might, were ſtill engaged in oppoſition to what I ſuppoſed might be juſtly ſtiled, a new and valuable diſcovery; while others leſs callous to conviction, aſſented to the facts related; but at the ſame time, either from a wiſh to reconcile all parties, or out of reſpect to the eminency
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030645_0004_0FE7EE3F4BB0E3B0"/>of the ſounders of the former theory, were laboring to eſtabliſh a variety of the diſeaſe, notwithſtanding the identity of effect produced thereby on the human frame, ſo incontrovertibly proves the identity of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>Under theſe circumſtances, ſolicitous for the good of my countrymen and the honor of the profeſſion (whoſe merit depends on their uſefulneſs) and perſuaded that every honeſt attempt to correct error to arreſt the progreſs of diſeaſe, prevent its ravages and ameliorate the condition of mankind would meet with a candid and favorable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. I have ventured to write and offer the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſheets to the peruſal of the public, in which I have endeavored to inveſtigate the nature of the diſeaſe, by carefully attending to its prediſpoſing and proximate cauſes, and by plain and ſimple reaſoning ſhew the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the new mode. In the ſame method, I have endeavored to obviate ſuch objections as occurred, by ſhewing the miſtaken ground of the former theory and the impropriety of conceiving a variety or diverſity of the diſeaſe. In proſecuting this buſineſs I found myſelf compelled, on account of the recency, plauſibility and authority, of the writings of Dr. Ruſh, to make ſeveral ſtrictures on his arguments, as he, notwithſtanding his great diſcernment, appears ſtill to be entangled with the old doctrine, and has offered many things in its favor; not doubting, that inſtead of taking umbrage at the freedom, his benevolent mind, will place him among the firſt to patronize this feeble effort in queſt of uſeful philoſophy, more eſpecially when he reflects, that ſuch is the condition of mortality, that no genius how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever exalted is equal to every thing, that the greateſt in their attempts for uſeful diſcovery have often been foiled, while others, whoſe abilities would poorly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, improving on their hints, have compaſſed that knowledge which their wiſer preceptors had in vain labored to obtain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:030645_0005_0FE7EE453AA10C68"/>Before I diſmiſs this ſubject, it is with pleaſure I acknowledge my indebtedneſs to this great and valuable man for his aſſiduous attention to all the phenomena of the ſick, both in the diſeaſe treated of and every other that comes within his inſpection. The fulleſt confidence in the accuracy and candour with which his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made has induced me to ſelect ſuch of them as ſuited my purpoſe in preference to my own and to make uſe of them as the baſis of the following work.</p>
            <p>The author conſidering that the greatneſs or obſcurity of a character by which a ſyſtem in any of the ſciences is uſhered to the world may operate to the prejudice of further inveſtigation, either by being too implicitly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the one caſe, or too inconſiderately rejected on the other, has choſen to withhold his name from the public and leave the fate of his performance to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by its value in the opinion of the candid reader, to whoſe juſt ſtrictures it is reſpectfully ſubmitted, by one who ardently wiſhes to alleviate human miſery and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the happineſs of man.</p>

            <head>A New Treatiſe, &amp;c.</head>
            <p n="1">I. BY the term CONSUMPTION, or PHTHISIS PULMONALIS is generally underſtood that ſtate of indiſpoſition of the human ſyſtem, wherein the patient is attended with a conſtant cough, accompanied with expectoration of purulent matter from the lungs, hectic fever, colliquative night ſweats, general waſting of the body, and laſtly a colliquative diarrhoea accompanied with oedematus ſwellings of the lower limbs; after which laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance life ſoon cloſes its ſcene. This is a general diſcription of this fatal malady. Some variations however may be obſerved perhaps in viewing a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of caſes; yet there will always be a ſufficient number of theſe leading traits to determine its ſpecies.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In the following pages I have attempted to inveſtigate its nature in order to deviſe ſome rational plan to obviate its baneful effects on the human ſpecies. It will therefore be neceſſary for me, <hi>Firſtly,</hi> To enquire, what or whence its origin? Whether it is generated by a variety of cauſes, or proceeds from a ſimple ſource. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is the nature of the diſeaſe or ſtate of the body producing the phenomena peculiar to it? Whether this ſtate is different in different ſubjects, or in other words, are there more ſpecies of the diſeaſe than one?</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> If there is a variety, how many, and their cauſes and nature?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. In purſuing my firſt enquiry it appears to me to lead to ſources or powers whoſe operations
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:030645_0007_0FE7EE4CEF366918"/>either directly or indirectly conſpire to debilitate our whole ſyſtem; and far from being that local diſeaſe which has been imagined by many. Yet I think we have juſt reaſon to conclude from its effects on the lungs, that the agency of the powers <hi>inducing debility</hi> produces a greater diatheſis on the lungs, than on any other given part of the ſyſtem. This propoſition, that it is a general diſeaſe, originating from debility has been ſo ingeniouſly treated, and clearly evinced by the celebrated Dr. Ruſh, in his 2 vol. medical enquiries, that I have choſen to quote his view verbatim, as his obſervations on this part of the ſubject ſo fully coincide with my own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, except his ſtrict analogy with the diſeaſe in queſtion, and pneumoniac inflammation: in this I muſt beg leave to differ. He begins by ſaying, (page 86.)</p>
            <p n="5">V.
<q>That the Pulmonary Conſumption is a diſeaſe of debility.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI.
<q>This I infer, 1ſt, from the remote and exciting cauſes which produce it. The remote cauſes, are pneumony, catarrh, haemoptyſis, rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm, gout, aſthma, ſcrophula, nervous and intermitting fevers, meaſles, repelled humors from the ſurface of the body, the veneral diſeaſe, obſtructed menſes, ſudden growth about the age of puberty, grief, and all other debilitating paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the mind; hypochondriaſis, improper lactation, exceſſive evacuation of all kinds, more eſpecially by ſtool,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <q>Sir George Baker relates in the ſecond volume of the medical tranſactions, that Dr. Blanchard had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that he had ſeen the conſumption brought on ten perſons out of ninety, by exceſſive purging uſed to prepare the body for the ſmall-pox. I have ſeen a caſe of conſumption in a youth of 17, from the ſpitting produced by the intemperate uſe of ſegars.</q>
                     </p>
                  </note> cold and damp air, external

                     <p>
                        <q>Dr. Lind ſays that out of 360 patients whom he attended between July 1ſt, 1758, and July 1ſt, 1760, in conſumptions, the diſorder was brought on <hi>one fourth</hi> of them by falls, bruiſes, and ſtrains received a year or two before the diſeaſe made its appearance.</q>
                     </p>
                  </note> and finally every thing that tends directly or indirectly to impair the vigor of the ſyſtem.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII.
<q>The moſt frequent exciting cauſe of conſumption is the alternate application of heat and cold to the whole external ſurface of the body, but all the remote cauſes which have been enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, operate as exciting cauſes of conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when they act on previous debility. Original injuries of the lungs ſeldom induce this diſorder except they firſt induce a debility of the whole ſyſtem by a troubleſome and obſtinate cough.</q>

<q>2. From the occupations and habits of perſons who are moſt liable to this diſorder. Theſe are ſtudious men, and mechanics who lead ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary lives in confined places; alſo women, and all perſons of irritable habits, whether of body or mind.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX.
<q>3. From the period in which perſons are moſt liable to be affected by this diſorder. This is generally between the 18th and 36th year of life, a period in which the ſyſtem is liable in a peculiar manner to moſt diſeaſes which induce the diſorder, and in which indirect debility is oftener produced than in any other ſtage of life, by the exceſſive exerciſes of the body and mind in the purſuits of buſineſs or pleaſure.</q>
            </p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:030645_0009_0FE7EEF51BF9C9F8"/>X.
<q>I have conformed to authors, in fixing the period of conſumptions between the 18th and 36th year of life, but it is well known that it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appears in children, and frequently in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beyond the 40th or even 50th year of life.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="11">XI.
<q>II. The pulmonary conſumption is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary diſeaſe of the whole ſyſtem. This I infer,</q>

            <p n="12">XII
<q>1. From the cauſes which produce it, acting upon the whole ſyſtem.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="13">XIII
<q>2. From the ſymptoms of general debility which always precede the affection of the lungs. Theſe ſymptoms are a quick pulſe, eſpecially towards evening; a heat and burning in the palms of the hands; faintneſs, head-ach, ſickneſs at ſtomach, and an occaſional diarrhoea. I have frequently obſerved each of theſe ſymptoms for ſeveral months before I have heard of a ſingle complaint in the breaſt.</q>

<q>The rheumatiſm. I have ſeen many caſes in which this diſeaſe and the conſumption have alternately, in different ſeaſons or years, affected the ſyſtem. In the winter of 1792, three clinical patients in the Pennſylvania hoſpital exemplified by their complaints the truth of this obſervation. They were relieved ſeveral times of a cough by pains in their limbs, and as often, the pains in their limbs ſeemed for a while to promiſe a cure to their pulmonic complaints.</q>

<q>The gout has often been obſerved to alternate with the pulmonary conſumption eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in perſons in the decline of life. Dr. Sydenham deſcribes a ſhort cough continuing through the whole winter, as a ſymptom of gouty habits. A gentleman from Virginia died under my care in the ſpring of 1788, in the 45th year of his age, with all the ſymptoms of pulmonary conſumption, which had frequently alternated with pains and a ſwelling in his feet.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="17">XVII.
<q>The pulmonary conſumption has been obſerved to alternate with madneſs. Of this I have ſeen two inſtances, in both of which, the cough, and expectoration were wholly ſuſpended during the continuance of the derangement of the mind. Dr. Mead mentions a melancholy caſe of the ſame kind in a young lady; and ſimilar caſes are to be met with in other authors. In all of them the diſeaſe proved fatal. In one of the caſes which came under my notice, the ſymptoms of conſumption returned before the death of the patient.</q>

<q>I have likewiſe witneſſed two caſes in which the return of reaſon after madneſs, was ſuddenly ſucceeded by a fatal pulmonary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Perhaps the falſe hopes, and even the cheerfulneſs which ſo univerſally occur in this diſorder, may be reſolved into a morbid ſtate of the mind, produced by a general derangement of the whole ſyſtem. So univerſal are the deluſion and hopes of patients with reſpect to the nature and iſſue of this diſorder, that I have never met with but one man, who, upon being aſked what was the matter with him, anſwered unequivocally, 'that he was in a conſumption!'</q>

<q>4. I infer that the pulmonary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is a diſeaſe of the whole ſyſtem from its
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030645_0012_0FE7EF045E7B19C0"/>analogy with ſeveral other diſeaſes which, though accompanied by local affections, are obviouſly produced by a morbid ſtate of the whole ſyſtem.</q>

<q>The rheumatiſm, the gout, the meaſles, ſmall-pox, the different ſpecies of cynanche; all furniſh examples of the connections of local affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a general diſeaſe; but the apoplexy, and the pneumony furniſh the moſt ſtriking analogies of local affection, ſucceeding a general diſorder of the ſyſtem in the pulmonary conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="26">XXVI.
<q>The moſt frequent cauſe of apoplexy is a general debility of the ſyſtem, produced by intemperance in eating and drinking. The phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of the diſeaſe are produced by an effuſion of blood or ſerum, in conſequence of a morbid diſtention, or of a rupture of the veſſels of the brain. The pulmonary conſumption begins and ends in the ſame way, allowing only for the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſituation and ſtructure of the brain and lungs. After the production of prediſpoſing debility from the action of the remote cauſes formerly enumerated, the fluids are determined to the weakeſt part of the body. Hence effuſions of ſerum or blood take place in the lungs. When ſerum is effuſed, a pituitous or purulent expora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone takes place; when blood is diſcharged, a diſeaſe is produced which has been called hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moptyſis. An effuſion of blood in the brain, brought on by the operation of general debility, has been called by Dr. Hoffman, with equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, haermorrhage of the brain. The effuſion of blood in the lungs in conſequence of the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a blood veſſel is leſs fatal than the ſame accident when it occurs in the brain, only becauſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030645_0013_0FE7EF06076A21E0"/>the blood in the former caſe is more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the ſyſtem. Where no rupture of a blood veſſel is produced, death is nearly as ſpeedy and certain in the one caſe as in the other.<note n="*" place="bottom">

From this great analogy between the remote and proximate cauſes of the two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which have been deſcribed, I have taken the liberty to call them both by the name of apoplexy. The only ſymptom which does not accord with the derivation of the term, is, that in the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy of the lungs, the patient does not fall down as if by an external ſtroke which is moſt frequently the caſe in the apoplexy of the brain.</q>

<q>The hiſtory of the remote and proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſes of pneumony will furniſh us with a ſtill more remarkable analogy of the connection between a local affection, and a general diſeaſe of the ſyſtem. The pneumony is produced by remote exciting cauſes, which act on the whole ſyſtem. The whole arterial ſyſtem is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently agitated by a fever in this diſorder before a pain is perceived in the breaſt or ſides, and this ſever generally conſtitutes the ſtrength and danger of the diſeaſe. The expectoration which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the diſorder in health, is always the effect of effuſions produced by a general diſeaſe, and even the vomicas, which ſometimes ſucceed a deficiency of bleeding in this diſorder, always depend upon the ſame general cauſe. From this view of the analogy between pneumony and pulmonary conſumption, it would ſeem that the two diſeaſes differed from each other only by the ſhorter or
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030645_0014_0FE7EF0AD3EE18B8"/>longer operation of the cauſes which induce them, and by the greater or leſs violence and duration of their ſymptoms. The pneumony appears to be an <hi>acute</hi> conſumption, and the conſumption a <hi>chronic</hi> pneumony. From the analogy of the pulmonary conſumption, with the diminutive term of certain fevers, I have taken the liberty of calling it a pneumonicula.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII.
<q>5. I infer that the pulmonary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is a diſeaſe of the whole ſyſtem, from its exiſtence without ulcers in the lungs. Of this there are many caſes recorded in books of medicine.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="29">XXIX.
<q>Dr. Leigh informs us in his natural hiſtory of Lancaſhire, that the conſumption was a very common diſeaſe on the ſea coaſt of that country; but that it was not accompanied either by previous inflammation or ulcers in the lungs. It was generally attended, he ſays, by an unuſual peeviſhneſs of temper.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="30">XXX.
<q>6. And laſtly, I infer, that the pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſumption is a diſeaſe of the whole ſyſtem, from its being relieved, or cured, only by reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which act upon the whole ſyſtem. This will appear, I hope, hereafter, when we come to treat of the cure of this diſorder.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="31">XXXI.
<q>Let us now inquire how far the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples I have laid down will apply to the ſuppoſed proximate cauſes of conſumption. Theſe cauſes have been ſaid to be; an abſceſs in the lungs, haemoptyſis, tubercles, catarrh, hereditary dathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, contagion, and the matter of cutaneous erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or ſores repelled, and thrown upon the lungs. I ſhall make a few obſervations upon each of them.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="32">

<q>1. An abſceſs in the lungs is generally the conſequence of a neglected, or half cured pneumony. It is ſeldom fatal, where it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with a prediſpoſition to conſumption from general debility, or where general debility is not previouſly induced by the want of appetite, ſleep and exerciſe, which ſometimes accompanies that diſorder of the lungs. This explination of the production of conſumption by an abſceſs in the lungs, will receive further ſupport from attending to the effects of wounds in the lungs. How ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are they followed by pulmonary conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this only becauſe they are as ſeldom accompanied by prediſpoſing general debility. I do not recollect a ſingle inſtance of this diſorder having followed a wound in the lungs, either by the bayonet, or a bullet, during the late war. The recoveries which have ſucceeded ſuch wounds, and frequently under the moſt unfavorable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſhew how very improbable it is that a much ſlighter affection of the lungs ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the cauſe of a pulmonary conſumption.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII.
<q>A Britiſh officer, whom I met in the Britiſh camp, a few days after the battle of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dywine in September, 1777, informed me that the ſurgeon general of the royal army had aſſured him, that out of twenty-four ſoldiers who had been admitted into the hoſpitals, during the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign of 1776, with wounds in their lungs, twenty-three of them had recovered. Even pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary diſeaſes of the lungs often exiſt with peculiar violence, or continue for many years without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a conſumption. I have never known but one inſtance of the hooping cough ending in conſumption, and all our books of medicine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain records of the aſthma continuing for 20 and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030645_0016_0FE7EF12C3DB3690"/>30 years without terminating in that diſorder. The reaſon in both caſes, muſt be aſcribed to thoſe two original diſorders of the lungs not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by general debility. One fact more will ſerve to throw ſtill further light upon the ſubject. Millers are much afflicted with a cough from floating particles of flour conſtantly irritating their lungs and yet they are not more ſubject to conſumption than other laboring people. Hence `a miller's cough,' is proverbial in ſome places, to denote a cough of long continuance without danger.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV.
<q>2. The haemoptyſis is either a local diſeaſe, or it is the effect of general debility of the whole ſyſtem. When it is local, or when it is the effect of cauſes which induce a <hi>temporary</hi> or <hi>acute</hi> debility only in the ſyſtem, it is ſeldom followed by conſumption. The accidental diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of blood from the lungs, from injuries, and from an obſtruction of the menſes in women, is of this kind. Many perſons are affected by this ſpecies of haemorrhage once or twice in their lives, without ſuffering any inconvenience from it afterwards. I have met with ſeveral caſes in which it has occurred for many years every time the body was expoſed to any of the cauſes which induce <hi>ſudden,</hi> direct, or indirect debility, and yet no conſumption has followed it. The late king of Pruſſia informed Dr. Zimmerman that he had been frequently attacked by it during his ſeven years war, and yet he lived notwithſtandng above twenty years afterwards without any pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary complaints. It is only in perſons who labor under <hi>chronic</hi> debility, that an haemoptyſis is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followed by conſumption.</q>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:030645_0017_0FE7EF152D186F00"/>XXXV.
<q>3. I yield to the popular mode of expreſſion when I ſpeak of a conſumption being produced by tubercles. But I maintain that they are the <hi>effects</hi> of general debility communicated to the bronchial veſſels which cauſe them to effuſe a preternatural quantity of mucus. This mucus is ſometimes poured into the trachea from whence it is diſcharged by hawking, more eſpecially in the morning; for it is effuſed more copiouſly during the languid hours of ſleep than in the day time. But this mucus is frequently effuſed into the ſubſtance of the lungs, where it produces thoſe tumours we call tubercles. When this occurs, there is either no cough<note n="*" place="bottom">See Med. Com. vol. 2.</note> or a very dry one. That tubercles are formed in this way, I infer from the diſſections and experiments of Dr. Stark<note n="†" place="bottom">Clinical and Anatomical Obſervations, p. 26, 27. See alſo Morgagni, letter xxii. 21.</note> who tells us that he found them to conſiſt of inorganic matter that he was unable to diſcover any connection between them and the pulmonary veſſels, by means of the microſcope or injections, and that they firſt opened into the trachea through the bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial veſſels. It is remarkable that the color and conſiſtence of the matter of which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is nearly the ſame as the matter which is diſcharged from the trachea, in the moiſt cough which occurs from a relaxation of the bronchial veſſels.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="36">XXXVI.
<q>I am aware that theſe tumours in the lungs have been aſcribed to ſcropula. But the frequent occurrence of conſumptions in perſons in whom no ſcrophulous taint exiſted, is ſufficient to refuſe this opinion. I have frequently directed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030645_0018_0FE7EF1C85E32FD8"/>my enquiries after this diſorder in conſumptive patients, and have met with very few caſes which were produced by it. It is probable that it may frequently be a prediſpoſing cauſe of conſumption in Great Britain, but I am ſure it is not in the United States of America.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="37">XXXVII.
<q>4. The catarrh is of two kind; acute and chronic, both of which are connected with general debility, but this debility is moſt obvious in the chronic catarrh: hence we find it encreaſed by every thing which acts upon the whole ſyſtem, ſuch as cold and damp weather, fatigue, and above all by old age, and relieved or cured by exerciſe, and every thing elſe which invigorates the whole ſyſtem. This ſpecies of catarrh often continues for twenty or thirty years without indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing pulmonary conſumption, in perſons who purſue active occupations.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="39">XXXIX
<q>5. In the hereditary conſumption there is either an hereditary debility of the whole ſyſtem, or an hereditary mal-conformation of the breaſt. In the latter caſe, the conſumption is the effect of weakneſs communicated to the whole ſyſtem, by the long continuance of difficult reſpiration, or of ſuch injuries being done to the lungs as are incompatible with health and life. It is remarkable, that the conſumptive diatheſis is more frequently derived from paternal than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal anceſtors.<note place="bottom">[The reader will notice that the obſervations under figure 6 are here omitted—the ſubject of them was wholly on contagion, the particular quality or power of which can be known only by analogy of effects, and of courſe no poſſitive inference could be drawn from it— the author has therefore paſſed them over as being of no uſe in his primary deſign which is to eſtabliſh his theory upon known facts.]</note>

<q>7. I grant that cutaneous humors, and the matter of old ſores, when repelled, or ſuddenly healed, have in ſome caſes fallen upon the lungs and produced conſumption. But I believe, in every caſe where this has happened, the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was preceded by general debility, or that it was not induced, until the whole ſyſtem had been previouſly debilitated by a tedious and diſtreſſing cough.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="41">XLI. Since my firſt queſtion is ſo fully anſwered by Dr. Ruſh, in the preceding paragraphs, I ſhall paſs to the next in order; viz. What is the nature of the diſeaſe or ſtate of body producing the phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena peculiar to it, &amp;c?</p>
            <p n="42">XLII. Our ſureſt guide to this diſcovery is, to take a view of the prediſpoſing cauſes and their effects on the human frame. As they all clearly appear from Dr. Ruſh's obſervations, to be powers inducing debility in the ſyſtem either by their direct or indirect operation, the inference is plain and eaſy; viz. That the derangements we experience in the conſumption, by which our bodies are waſted and finally deſtroyed is the reſult of defect of power or want of energy in the ſeveral functions of the ſyſtem. The anſwer to the remaining part of the queſtion is ſo fully involved in what has been ſaid, that no further notice need be taken of it: for <hi>debil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi> is nothing more, nor leſs, nor aſide of <hi>debility</hi> from whatever ſource it is produced; whither by powers abſtracting from, or adding too much ſtimulus to the ſyſtem.<note n="*" place="bottom">While this is the caſe no diverſity of ſpecies can be rationally conceived of.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt query, viz. How many ſpecies and their different cauſes and natures, alſo naturally looſes
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030645_0020_0FE8448A44771CB8"/>its exiſtence. So that it would now ſeem that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remained but to deviſe a proper method to reſtore the energy of the ſeveral functions, by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracting the prediſpoſing cauſes, or in other words, a proper method of cure.</p>
            <p n="43">XLIII. But alas! ſuch is the power of tradition, ſuch the veneration for the opinions of men of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fame, that a tonic or ſthenic<note n="*" place="bottom">Active—oppoſed to weak and indolent.</note> inflammatory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, is ſtill warmly contended for. Even the great Dr. Ruſh, (whoſe ideas in other reſpects are worthy the exalted character he ſuſtains) is upon the liſt of its ſupporters. As this opinion has ſtill ſo many advocates, ſome of whom are men of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, humanity impels me to attempt its refutation. I ſhall therefore proceed to examine the ſeveral phenomena, &amp;c. on which they found their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and by a careful and candid inveſtigation endeavour to ſhew, that by the laws of animal nature there is no foundation in any of them for ſuch a concluſion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt take notice of an argument made uſe of to ſupport the doctrine of inflammatory or tonic conſumption; viz. That debility even tho' it be chronic and habitual prediſpoſes to inflammatory diatheſis. See Dr. Ruſh's medical inquiries, vol. 2, page 116, where ſpeaking of blood letting in the conſumption, he ſays,
<q>It may ſeem ſtrange to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this debilitating remedy in a diſeaſe brought on by debility. Were it proper in this place I could prove that there is no diſeaſe in which bleeding is preſcribed, which is not induced by prediſpoſing debility in common with pulmona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſumption. I ſhall only remark here, that in conſequence of the exciting cauſe acting on the
<pb n="16"
                      facs="unknown:030645_0021_0FE8448ED105ECE8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>ſyſtem (rendered extremely excitable by debility) ſuch a morbid and exceſſive excitement is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the arteries, as to render a diminution of the ſtimulus of the blood abſolutely neceſſary to reduce it.</q>
This is followed by two caſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the doctrine, in one of which he bled fifteen times in ſix weeks, and the other eight times in two weeks: in the laſt it is added with happy effects. But he does not give us any particular ſtatement of theſe caſes;; ſo that we may at leaſt conjecture that the Doctor might be miſtaken in giving thoſe caſes the appellation of conſumption or phthiſis pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalis. After reading this paragraph, I turned back to paragraph VII, to ſee what this `exciting cauſe' ſhould be? But on an attentive peruſal I could find nothing in that nor in the prediſpoſing or remote cauſes. See par. VI, (which the Dr. ſays may operate as exciting) which could not produce ſuch an exceſſive excitement in the arterial ſyſtem; nor in fact <hi>any</hi> (which operate by a direct agency) except the alternation of heat and cold<note n="*" place="margin">It muſt be always confeſſed that when the excitability is accumulated by cold, the ſtimulus of heat acts with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed force on our ſyſtem.</note>. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many of them there enumerated; viz.
<q>Grief and other debilitating paſſions of the mind, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriaſis, improper lactation, exceſſive evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all kinds, eſpecially by ſtool, cold damp air, &amp;c.</q>
would lead the mind to a very different concluſion. But waving this ſeeming impropriety by ſuppoſing we may miſtake the Doctor's meaning (which is very poſſible) and admit that he does not mean to confine our attention to the paragraphs alluded to, but to <hi>any</hi> ſtrong ſtimulus or exciting power: yet even in this view another difficulty will ariſe of equal magnitude, ſince we may not heſitate to declare that every exciting cauſe or power invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030645_0022_0FE8449054CD1A90"/>counteracts debility, and of courſe is juſtly adapted (when properly bounded) to prevent the progreſs of that chronic<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>That the debility is of this kind, which brings on or produces the derangements peculiar to the conſumption and is that kind our author means to refer us to in the paſſage quoted from the 116th page of his 2d vol.

<q>ſays the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in this ſtage of the diſorder are ſimple and certain, they conſiſt in a deſertion of all the remote and exciting cauſes of the diſorder, particularly ſedentary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, damp or cold ſituations and whatever tends to weaken the ſyſtem,—when the diſeaſe has not yielded to this deſertion of its remote and exciting cauſes, I have recommended the cold bath ſteel and bark with great advantage—however improper or even dangerous theſe remedies may be after the diſeaſe aſſumes an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or hectic type.</q>
                  </p>
               </note> debility by which the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is uſhured on, and after commenced to retard its progreſs. And indeed our authors remark in the 115th page, affords not a little ſupport to this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: where after ſaying that
<q>There are caſes in which patients in a conſumption are ſuddenly ſnatched away by an attack of pneumony,</q>
he ſays,
<q>I met with one caſe only in which, contrary to my <hi>expectation,</hi> the patient <hi>mended</hi> after an attack of acute inflammation of the lungs, ſo as to live two years.</q>
Another fact muſt equally ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm my propoſition, mentioned by Dr. Ruſh, and alſo by Dr. Cullin. The latter ſays, vol. 2, page 415.
<q>The pregnancy of women has often retarded the progreſs or a phthiſis; but commonly it is only until after delivery when the ſymptoms of phthiſis return with violence and ſoon prove fatal.</q>
By
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030645_0023_0FE844962D9B75F8"/>comparing theſe ſtates together; viz. Before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delivery, the reſult muſt be, that the more ſthenic powers there are excited in the ſyſtem, the more thoſe derangements in conſequence of debility, are obviated. For we obſerve in pregnancy, that the ſubject, after recovering from thoſe complaints pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the firſt months, to grow fleſhy, and in many inſtances ſo ſthenic as to require repeated blood let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: but directly after delivery their caſes in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral are reverſed; firſt by lochial evacuation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by lactation.</p>
            <p n="44">XLIV. `Again, our author (Dr. Ruſh) page 112, when ſpeaking of the analogy between the pneumonia and conſumption, ſays,
<q>The cough in the conſumption in like manner is firſt dry, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a diſcharge of blood from the lungs which is more copious than in a pneumany <hi>only becauſe</hi> the lungs are more relaxed in the former, than in the latter diſorder.</q>
This <hi>relaxed ſtate of the lungs,</hi> (which according to the Doctor's general propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſee paragraphs V &amp; XI, is in common with the reſt of the ſyſtem, (tho' the diatheſis in the lungs is ſomewhat the greateſt and fully accords with his theory of prediſpoſition,) is an indiſpoſition, which to remove, reaſon ſuggeſts, that the agency of thoſe very powers (properly regulated) which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generate pneumoniac inflammation is abſolutely neceſſary; and this is notably confirmed by the two facts laſt related in par. XLIII, eſpecially the firſt, to which may be added the great benefit patients of this deſcription derive from the uſe of ſtimulant and tonic remedies. This ſuggeſtion is further ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the utility experienced in that relaxation in the genitals, occaſioned by long continued gonorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heas, by adding cantharides to the medicines uſually employed; which, when given in any conſiderable
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030645_0024_0FE84497B2AB5810"/>quantities do in fact excite inflammation in thoſe particular parts.</p>
            <p n="45">XLV. Beſides, we have great reaſon to doubt, whether an inflammation of any conſiderable duration, can exiſt in ſuch a ſtate of chronic debility; on account of the weak unſtable ſtate of the ſyſtem in all ſuch caſes: much leſs to conceive of one of <hi>ſix,</hi> or even of <hi>two</hi> weeks ſtanding. And this doubt is increaſed by the Dr. himſelf in what he ſays in the volume alluded to, ſee page 185, where ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of dropſies he ſays,
<q>It is probable that the ſame difference ſhould be obſerved, between the treatment of dropſies, in warm and cold climates, that is obſerved in the treatment of inflammatory fevers.</q>
He then obſerves,
<q>The tonic action probably exiſts in the ſyſtem in both climates; in the former it reſembles the tides which are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly produced by a ſhower of rain, and as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly diſappear; whereas in the latter, it may be compared to thoſe tides which are produced by the ſlow and gradual addition of water from nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſtreams, which continue for days and weeks together to exhibit marks of violence, in every part of their courſe.</q>
Here a query natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuggeſts itſelf, whether there is, or can be any difference between a habit debilited by the powers enumerated in the former part of this work, or one induced by living in or near the torrid Zone? Whether they will not alike ſubject the ſyſtem to thoſe ſudden changes on the application or abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtimuli which form ſuch a diſparity between the latter, and the more permanent habits of the nothern latitudes?</p>
            <p n="46">XLVI. But what could be the complaint for which the Dr. continued to bleed for ſix weeks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030645_0025_0FE8449EDABDC788"/>he had bled fifteen times? And of the one for which he bled eight times in two weeks? The latter he ſpeaks of as being `attended with the happieſt effects.' To this I anſwer. It is highly probable, it was a ſthenic catarrh, and not different from a peripneumony only in degree and duration: <hi>both</hi> the conſequence of ſthenic powers on a ſthenic habit. I will not contend with the Doctor for ſaying they are always `induced by ſome prediſpoſing debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,' if he means by it, nothing more than what he calls <hi>acute</hi> in paragraph XXXIV, or the ſudden ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of ſtimuli in a permanent or ſthenic habit, by cold or cold damp, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">We often hear patients of this deſcription date the origin of their complaints to ſome ſuch expoſure.</note> as any ſthenic or ſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulating power, ſucceeding ſuch an abſtraction, acts with much more energy than if it had not taken place: the abſtraction allowing the excitability to accumulate. And altho' patients aſcribe the origin of their complaints to ſuch expoſure to cold, &amp;c. yet in the narration they give us, they do not inform us of any ſymptoms of any conſequent diſeaſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til after they are in a more comfortable ſituation, or in other words, until <hi>after</hi> the application of ſtimuli; ſome being taken by the fire ſide, others in a warm room, others in a warm bed; and moſt generally after taking ſome refreſhment as they call it. And when the ſtimulus or ſthenic power is ſudden and conſiderable, on ſuch permanent or ſthenic habit it is eaſy to foreſee that an inflammatory pyrexoe, peripneumony, &amp;c. will be the conſequence. But if ſuch ſtimulus or ſthenic power be applied more moderately, by its leſs violent operation on ſuch permanent habit it may continue a conſiderable time (ſay ſix weeks) producing <hi>catarrh's,</hi> &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inducing indirect debility; and repeated bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030645_0026_0FE844A1935328A8"/>in ſuch caſe be of great utility. On the other hand, reaſon, experience and the remarks of the Doctor himſelf in the paſſage laſt quoted all conſpire, to determine what would be the ſituation of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenic<note n="†" place="bottom">Defect of, or want of energy.</note> infirm, or chronic debilitated ſubject, under ſuch alternate expoſures.</p>
            <p n="47">XLVII. Having finiſhed the diſagreeable taſk of animadverting on the arguments of ſo learned and reſpectable a writer as Dr. Ruſh, I ſhall now proceed to examine ſome of the principal phenom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena, on which the contenders for a tonic inflammatory conſumption found their arguments. Theſe are,</p>
            <p n="48">XLVIII. 1ſt. That copious bleedings, in caſes of hoemoptoe's<note n="*" place="bottom">An effuſion of blood from the lungs.</note> are leſs frequently followed by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac complaints than the leſs profuſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. The occurrence of a hard pulſe in the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. The expectoration of purulent matter in the diſorder, ſomewhat ſimilar to that which is raiſed in the breaking of an ulcer or abſceſs in the lungs.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. The ſuppoſed benefit of blood letting, and frequent relief produced by it.</p>
            <p n="49">XLIX. In reply to the firſt; viz. `That copious bleedings, &amp;c. I ſhall advert in the firſt place to the hiſtory of thoſe profuſe bleedings at the lungs which take place previous to any pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac complaints. Here we ſhall find they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, if not always happen in conſequence of ſome accident which has befallen the patient otherwiſe in health. Dr. Boarhaave, if I rightly remember, lays
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030645_0027_0FE844A7B4A1D0E0"/>much, if not his whole ſtreſs on the caſe of a man who bled profuſely on being violently thrown out of a carriage; who, being much neglected as to any kind of ſtimulants, recovered without any pulmoniac complaints. On the other hand thoſe ſmaller blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings we find which are followed by pulmoniac complaints, <hi>generally</hi> if not <hi>always</hi> attend people la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring under chronic debility.</p>
            <p n="50">L. By attending to theſe remarks, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with Dr. Ruſh's obſervations, ſee para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph XXXIV, we ſhall be led to conclude that in the caſes of the firſt deſcription, it was the previous vigor and health of the ſubject which preſerved the patient from future evil conſequences, and that the <hi>wound</hi> made of ſo much conſequence in either caſe could not be worthy our attention; this is fully evinced, not only from what is there ſaid, but by adverting to the frequent bleedings at the noſe and fauces which take place without being followed with the ſlighteſt traces of inflammation.</p>
            <p n="51">LI. Hence the attentive enquirer would be ready to wonder if haemorrhages under ſuch circumſtances are ſo ſafe, from whence came the idle whim of following them with repeated bleedings, which would land the patient in a chronic debility, a ſtate wherein (to uſe the Doctors own words,)
<q>haemoptyſis is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followed by a conſumption,</q>
he would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be equally ſurpriſed to hear ſuch phaenomina made uſe of as an argument to ſupport the idea of an inflammatory or ſthenic conſumption. Nay he would be naturally led to conſider the latter bleedings (the ſmall or leſs profuſe) as ſymptoms of the weak patulus, and irritable ſtate of the veſſels, rather than a diſeaſe or its origin; and be confirmed in the opinion when he reflected on the material
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030645_0028_0FE844A93957AC18"/>benefits experienced from the uſe of the bark and other tonic remedies to remove it.</p>
            <p n="52">LII. I ſhall cloſe my diſſertation on this head by noticing a clauſe in Dr. Barry's treatiſe on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, publiſhed in the year 1727, page 226, where he gives it as his decided opinion, that the ſlow ſmall bleedings proceed from the bronchial arteries. Admitting this to be the caſe, which from the peculiar weakneſs experienced at the breaſt immediately after ſuch bleedings we are diſpoſed to believe, we ſhall readily conjecture why ſuch patients ſhould be liable to pulmoniac complaints, on account of the debilitating effects, the loſs of blood from this artery muſt have on the lungs: as it is pretty evident that from theſe arteries the lungs derive their entire ſupport, the pulmonary arteries being deſtined for another purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="53">LIII. The next ſubject under conſideration is the occurrence of a hard pulſe in conſumptive diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>It muſt always appear a paradox in nature to ſuppoſe a tonic, or ſthenic ſtate of the arteries, while the reſt of the ſyſtem is waſteing away thro' debility or want of energy: but that a hard pulſe which has been generally conſidered as a pathog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomonic ſign of ſthenic or tonic energy, does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occur in the conſumption we muſt believe, unleſs we diſpute the veracity of Dr. Ruſh, even when the principles of life and animation have nearly ceaſed. He ſays in page 111,
<q>I have ſeen two caſes in which a hard pulſe, and other ſymptoms of inflammatory action appeared in the laſt hours of life.</q>
We may eaſily ſurmount this difficulty, by attending to the effects of irritating
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030645_0029_0FE844B15FAC0070"/>powers on debilitated habits, which exhibit that falſe appearance of ſtrength and vigor through the ſyſtem ſo conſpicuouſly obſervable on the acceſſion of ſpaſms, or ſudden derangements of the mental functions. I think I may venture to aſſert, that I have myſelf experienced ſeveral inſtances where the phenomena appeared in the arterial ſyſtem, in debilitated ſubjects labouring under ſpaſms or other ſtrong irritations, even to ſuch a degree as to beget a doubt, whether I had not miſtaken the cauſe: but on the application of <hi>ſtimulants,</hi> the perterbation ſubſided and the pulſe ſoftened. In this way only I can account for an expreſſion in the new Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh Diſpenſatory, where ſpeaking of the effects of opium<note n="*" place="bottom">Opium is now generally allowed to rank among the higheſt ſtimulants.</note>, it is ſaid
<q>the action of the arterial ſyſtem is diminiſhed, the pulſe for the moſt part <hi>ſofter,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
Coincident with the above, I would beg leave to inſert an extract from a paper publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the New-London Medical Journal for 1792, page 33, communicated by Mr. Stringer, Surgeon, Riegate in Surry; which is as follows.</p>
            <p>`RIEGATE, <hi>November</hi> 31ſt, 1791.</p>
            <p n="54">LIV.
<q>The term inflammation appears to me to admit of a greater extent and diviſion than is generally allowed. In particular that ſufficient ſtreſs is not laid between the inflammatory diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the ſyſtem, and local inflammation ariſing from irritability occaſioning ſpaſms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That inflammation is found to exiſt in relaxed debilitated habits, excited and kept up by irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome peculiar acrimony, totally contrary and independent of any inflammatory diatheſis,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030645_0030_0FE844B45EF9F650"/>as in ſcrophula, veneria, &amp;c. will not be denied: and that pleuritic and peripneumoniac ſymptoms frequently ariſe in debilitated habits from irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſpaſms independent of any general inflammation, ſeems to me evident, from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar obſervations and the ſucceſs of a contrary mode of treatment to that generally adopted in the cure of thoſe diſeaſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="55">LV.
<q>In a general inflammatory affection, the pathognomoniac ſymptoms do not always imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately occur, for in ſome inſtances the action of the arterial ſyſtem is retarded; giving a week, ſoft, and ſometimes a trembling and intermitting pulſe. In this caſe, upon opening the vein, the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is raiſed, the pulſe becomes full and hard, the blood ſizy, and all ſymptoms of true and active inflammation appear. This is frequently the caſe on the firſt attack of an inflammatory fever, ariſing from the violence of the action exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a compreſſion upon the arterial ſyſtem, this compreſſion being removed either by natural, or atificial means the ſymptoms of encreaſed arterial action become evident.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="56">LVI.
<q>On the contrary, the action of the heart and arteries, from ſome tempory exciting cauſe, is frequently increaſed under circumſtances of general debility in the habit. Pleuritic peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, and other inflammatory ſymptoms, often taken place under theſe circumſtances, where profuſe evacuations, if they do not occaſion imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate miſchief, commonly lay a foundation for future evils. I am afraid there is reaſon to doubt that the phthiſis pulmonalis has been frequently brought on by to free a uſe of the lancet, and other evacuants. If the lungs <hi>eſcape,</hi> a terrible train of nervous afflictions is the conſequence.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="57">
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:030645_0031_0FE844BBA545DAD8"/>LVII.
<q>Veneſection is too ſtrenuouſly inſiſted on and too frequently repeated at a time when opiates with or without other antiſpaſmodics, by allaying the irritation, and ſpaſms (which is often the only remaining cauſe of inflammatory ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, even after frequent bleedings have been had recourſe to) would more ſpeedily relieve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſymptoms, prevent the ill conſequences of too great a deprivation of the vital fluid, and give room for further obſervation on the ſubſequent treatment of the diſeaſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="58">LVIII.
<q>I have had frequent occaſions to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the good tendency of this practice, and with difference to ſuperior judgement, cannot help wiſhing to lay peculiar ſtreſs on the efficacy of anodynes and antiſpaſmodics, in many caſes of thoracic inflammation, a proof that irritation and ſpaſms are frequently the exciting cauſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in debilitated habits; even in plethoric habits, ſpaſms may be only remaining cauſe of the ſymptoms ſtill exiſting as ſtrong as ever, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the moſt liberal uſe of the lancet, as ſeems to be evinced by the following</q>
            </p>
            <div type="case">
               <head>CASE.</head>
               <p n="59">LIX.
<q>I was deſired to ſee a man who had hung himſelf with a handkerchief, and was a ſhort time after cut down. He appeared to be middle aged, healthy, muſcular and ſtrong. His eyes were fixed, his teeth faſt ſhut, and he foamed at the mouth like a perſon dying, from compreſſion, or concuſſion of the brain, his pulſe hard, ſtrong, and full.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="60">LX.
<q>I heſitated not, but for expedition ſake, cut off his coat and pierced a vein in each arm
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030645_0032_0FE844BD2B0A18D0"/>from which his pulſe not flagging in the leaſt, about two pounds of blood were drawn, as nearly as could be aſcertained from the confuſion in the place.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="61">LXI.
<q>He did not appear to be the leaſt reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the contrary the ſpaſms became general and it required the ſtrength of ſeveral perſons to hold him; the blood flowed from the orifices in the arms at every contraction of the muſcles with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence that could only be equalled by the punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a large antery and could not be reſtrained either by preſſure, bandage, or compreſs; I began to think that either ſome of the veſſels in the head had been burſt by the compreſion of the handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief on the neck, or that conſiderable injury had been done to the head from the fall in cutting down, tho' there was no external appearance of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="62">LXII.
<q>The man appearing to be ſtill getting worſe, and no proſpect of benefit ariſing from further bleeding, I was induced to try whether ſpaſms alone might not be the preſent cauſe of derangement in the cenſorium, for which purpoſe he was forced to ſwallow fifty drops of tincture of opium. This ſpeedily had the deſired effect of leſſening the diſturbance in the whole ſyſtem; he grew quiet and doſed an hour or two, when the convulſions threatening to return, the opiate was repeated with the ſame good effects as before, till he took near two hundred drops in the ſpace of fourteen hours, which in the end threw him into a ſound ſleep, and he awoke perfectly in his ſenſes, tho a ſlight mania attacked him a few days afterwards, which left him by the uſe of proper evacuations.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="63">
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:030645_0033_0FE844C2EB0C5320"/>LXIII. The expectoration of purulent matter in the diſorder, comes next to be diſcuſſed.</p>
               <p>This appears to be an argument made uſe of in favor of a ſthenic, inflammatory conſumption, from a ſuppoſition that it ariſes from the ſame origin as a vomica, and is conſidered as an open ulcer of the lungs: hence the idea of inflammatory and ſupura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtages of the conſumption; conceiving mean time of no other inflammation but a ſthenic or tonic one, and frequent bleedings have been urged to prevent the ſecond or ſupurative ſtage.</p>
               <p n="64">LXIV. That this is not the caſe muſt appear evident, not only by conſidering that all the prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing cauſes are ſuch as indicate atonia in the ſyſtem; but by reflecting that this is frequently, if not always preceded by an expectoration of vicid mucus from the glands, or veſſels of the lungs, and ſometimes in conſiderable quantities, plainly indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that thoſe veſſels, inſtead of being in a ſtate of tonic inflammation, are become weak and patulus.</p>
               <p n="65">LXV. The laſt argument I ſhall notice, which is uſed to ſupport the idea of an inflammatory tonic conſumption, is `the ſuppoſed benefit of blood letting, &amp;c.'</p>
               <p>Suppoſed I call it, for I cannot conceive any foundation for it in nature: for in caſes of pluiriſy, peripneumony, &amp;c. where reaſon and long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence evince the great utility of blood letting; we find that purging, ſweating, and indeed every evac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation which ſerves in a meaſure to empty the veſſels, operate in common with bleeding, to render the pulſe ſlower, abate the thirſt, cool the body, and not only caſe the diſtreſs, but make the patient feel
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030645_0034_0FE844C46EF4CC38"/>more vigorous, and approach nearer health. Is this the caſe in the conſumption? Does not ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, purging and every other natural evacuation, ultimately quicken the pulſe, increaſe the thirſt and fever? And although they may for the preſent abate ſome diſtreſſing ſymptom, yet the debility (which appears in fact to be the diſeaſe) is felt by the patient to increaſe; and inſtead of returning health, the marks of diſſolution are more ſtrikingly painted. That this is the caſe I believe every experienced practitioner will admit. The queſtion then muſt be, if every other evacuation, which empties the veſſels and debilitates the ſyſtem, ſo uſeful in truly tonic and ſthenic caſes, is ſo injurious in the conſumption, why not bleeding alſo? This idea is further corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated by reverting to the effects of pregnancy, (ſee paragraph XLIII) where we ſee that even a natural ſuppreſſion or ceſſation of the cuſtomary evacuation of the blood<note n="*" place="bottom">It may be ſaid that the blood taken up to nouriſh the foetus fully compenſates for the retention of the blood, &amp;c. but if ſo, why the ſo frequent neceſſity of bleeding in thoſe caſes?</note> has retarded the progreſs of the diſeaſe. I will readily admit that bleeding frequently affords relief from the ſpaſms, &amp;c. about the breaſt; and ſo will a diarrhoea or pain in the bowels, (ſee paragraph XXII.) I have myſelf been lately a witneſs of the fatal effects of even a moderate attack of a dyſſentery in the diſorder; which did indeed greatly relieve the breaſt of my patient, but increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſeaſe even to a ſpeedy diſſolution. That ſpaſms and the pain and uneaſineſs reſulting from them may give way to any thing that effects any conſiderable revolution or diverſion in the ſyſtem, is too evident to need other teſtimony than experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But as a fact, with ſome obſervations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the foregoing, now lies before me, I ſhall take the liberty to inſert it. The author ſpeaks as
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030645_0035_0FE844CBCB540258"/>follows.
<q>A certain gentleman in his deſk, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the method of curing apilepſy or the falling ſickneſs, and recommending among other evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and otherwiſe debilitating means, ſmall but frequently repeated bleedings, unguardedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf in his very next ſentence.
<q>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</q>
ſays he,
<q>we regular practitioners are liable to be too cautious and even timid ſometimes. For I have known a bold practitioner in the country, who cured an epilepſy by very profuſe bleeding. A few months after the patient died of a univerſal dropſy, but the epilepſy never returned.</q>
I would aſk this gentleman, what ſort of a cure that was, which, converted a diſeaſe, which may come and go for many years, nay even for a long life time into one that in a very ſhort time proved fatal? What reaſon would a podagric have to thank any one, who ſhould convert the gout in him upon any violent attack, into a fatal dropſy? That ſort of treatment is not curing a diſeaſe but encreaſing it, and even that to death.

               <p n="66">LXVI. In making theſe remarks on bleeding in the conſumption, I would not wiſh to have them applied to every caſe of prediſpoſition, ſince it is evident it is ſometimes uſhered on by indirect debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating powers. In this caſe, in the early ſtage of the prediſpoſition bleeding may be of ſervice by leſſening in a degree the morbid exceſſive excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this ought to be before that degree of debility is induced which conſtitutes the diſeaſe; and is never to be performed after that degree of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030645_0036_0FE844CD4F0CE7C0"/>weakneſs is induced wherein the excitability does not readily accumulate upon ſuch abſtraction, and the patient, inſtead of being thereby weakened, ſhall feel more vigorous.</p>
               <p n="67">LXVII. From the foregoing obſervations, I think it muſt appear, that the theoretical reaſonings made uſe of to reconcile the idea, that chronic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is or may be the prediſpoſing proximate or exciting cauſe of a tonic inflammatory diatheſis; and the inferences drawn from the various phenom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena therein mentioned, are all the product of a miſguided imagination and have no real foundation in nature. And we are after all left to conclude that thoſe powers which induce debility, produce thoſe derangements, conſequent, or reſulting from debility. Hence a rational mode of cure immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſtrikes the mind; viz. The application of ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and tonic remedies (properly regulated) in order to counteract the prediſpoſing cauſes, and reſtore the loſt vigor and energy to the ſyſtem. The juſtneſs of this idea is abundantly proved by facts recorded in medical hiſtory, within theſe few years paſt, eſpecially ſince the ingenious Dr. May has preſumed to doubt the rationality of the former theory of the diſeaſe, ſtep aſide from the old track of preſcriptions and adopt the above method of cure, (ſee his papers publiſhed in the London Medical Journal, vol. IX, page 286) the ſucceſs of his practice has emboldened him and others to perſevere in the ſame ſyſtem, and, with the happieſt effects. See a paper from Dr. Percival of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter (England) publiſhed in Memoirs of London Medical Society, vol. II. A ſecond paper from Dr. May, publiſhed in London Medical Journal, vol. XI, page 255. One alſo from Edmond Pitts Gapper, Surgeon at Mere in Wiltſhire, publiſhed

But as I have neither leiſure to collect, nor room to inſert them in the narrow limits I have preſcribed to myſelf, I muſt neceſſarily paſs them over and proceed from this general indication, to a more particular method of cure.</p>
               <p n="68">LXVIII. As has been before obſerved, this diſeaſe, or more properly ſtate of the ſyſtem may be induced by two very oppoſite powers; viz. <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>indirect</hi> debilitating; and altho' they both ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in the reduction of the ſyſtem to ſuch degree of imbecility as to produce all the phenomena which conſtitute or characteriſe a conſumption; ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of application may however be neceſſary, in order to obviate the agency of thoſe powers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the ſyſtem. I ſhall therefore divide this part of my ſubject into two diſtinct heads, beginning firſt with the mode neceſſary to be obſerved when the diſeaſe is produced by powers directly debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p n="69">LXIX. Before I proceed I would beg leave for the illuſtration of what is now before us, to point the reader to an evident law of nature which may be daily obſerved, in which both ſpecies of debility are ſtrikingly laid open to our view; and which may not only ſerve as a clue to the more juſt application of remedies, but likewiſe throw ſome further light on the preceding part of this work.</p>

Although the analogy of childhood weakneſs will not ſtrictly apply to chronic debility induced by withholding the ordinary ſtimulus in perſons who have once acquired a degree of firmneſs, as in the former, no derangement of the functions takes place: yet the ſimularity is notably conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the following reſpects, viz. That they are alike liable to indirect debility from a too great applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtimuli, and ſo vice verſe. And tho' they each may have their excitability daily kept reduced to a healthy ſtandard by ſtimuli, it is alſo evident that by this very means the excitability is conſtantly acquiring additional vigor or permanency, requiring ſtronger and ſtronger ſtimuli to reduce it, until a certain degree of firmneſs is eſtabliſhed which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes

               <p n="73">LXXIII. The utility of exerciſe is made notably evident from facts recorded in medical hiſtory, not only in perſons who have voluntarily engaged in it, but in many who have been compelled of neceſſity vigorouſly to uſe it for a length of time, both in conſumptive complaints, and other derangements from debility. And not only facts, but the laws of animal nature inſtruct us that exerciſe not only gives excitement to the whole frame, and encreaſes the appetite; but likewiſe promotes aſſimilation and digeſtion in every part of the ſyſtem deſtined to perform thoſe functions; it increaſes the action and power of the veſſels in the remote parts of the body, whereby more exerementitious matter is thrown off through the external and remote veſſels<note n="*" place="bottom">The utility of this effect receives confirmation from paragraph XL.</note>, and of courſe the veſſels of the lungs are leſs bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened.</p>

But this like all other ſtimulating agents, ought to be as exactly adapted to the ſtate of debility in the patient as poſſible. It ought to be vigorous enough on the one hand to produce a ſufficient degree of excitement thro' the ſyſtem; to reduce the excitability to a healthy point or ſtandard; to be encreaſed as ſtrength and permanency encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for reaſons mentioned in paragraph LXXI. And on the other hand, it ought always to be ſo carefully bounded that the patient may endure it moſt of his waking hours without endangering indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect debility. The mode of it ought to be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived as to produce leſs excitement on the lungs, than in any other given part of the ſyſtem; for as in this diſeaſe the diatheſis is greater in them, than in the reſt of the body, it is evident they may more eaſily be overcome, or thrown into a ſtate of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect debility, (hence the impropriety of walking, eſpecially up hill or up ſtairs, and ſpeaking long ſentences with a raiſed tone of voice,) before ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient excitement is given to the reſt of the ſyſtem. Beſides, the cough (tho' induced by direct debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting powers) is every day more <hi>exerciſe</hi> than is any way neceſſary for the lungs and naturally tends to increaſe the diatheſis, by adding indirect to direct debility.</p>

               <p n="75">LXXV. Various articles of diet have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended as ſalutary in conſumptive caſes, ſuch as milk from various animals, (which has been extolled almoſt as a ſpecific) ripe fruits, ſuch as grapes, oranges,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Before we haſtily determine on the ſpecific quality of any article of diet in any particular complaint, we ought not only to conſider the ſtate of the excitability, (of which hereafter in the text) but the place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſex, age, ſeaſon of the year when made uſe of, habit, and inclination or taſte of the ſubject on whom the ſalutary effects are experienced.</p>
                     <p>Dr. More, in a letter to a friend, publiſhed in his travels relates two caſes, who mended much on the uſe of ripe grapes. The one on whom the faireſt trial was made, being confined to them and bread only for diet, (the other made uſe of meat occaſionally) was a young woman who reſided in Switſerland. From her age, ſex, and place of abode, (if I miſtake not, but little fleſh is eaton in that country, in compariſon to America) we may ſafely conjecture ſhe had not been accuſtomed or habituated to a ſtrong ſtimulating diet—the time of her uſing this diet was mid ſummer—add to this ſhe had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar fondneſs for this kind of fruit—all which taken col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, would ſtrike the mind very differently, when applyed to an American male in the winter ſeaſon: with a total diſreliſh for ſuch food, we ſhould at once conclude he muſt famiſh for want of ſupport, and not only ſo, have his calamity increaſed by the chilling acceſency of the fruit—whereas in the former we may conceive of ſufficient ſupport not only from what we may conclude was her habit of dieting, from the cuſtom of the country, but from her age, ſex, and peculiar inclination or taſte, (which laſt would induce her to eat freely and add the agreeable ſtimulus of diſtenſion, to the other ſalutary effects) and not only ſo, the moderate acceſency, at that ſeaſon of the year would ſerve to counteract the over ſtimulus of heat, and preſerve a due equilibrium of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement in, and thro' the ſyſtem.

               <p n="76">LXXVI. By taking a retroſpective view of the preceding paragraphs, and turning our attention to the laws by which animal nature is governed, it will require no great diſcernment to diſcover when and how each of theſe ſeeming contradictory modes of dieting, may be ſalutary in caſes of debility. Milk, and rich ſubacid ſacharine fruits when equal to produce that reduction of the redundant excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, to an eaſy comfortable point; and where any thing ſtronger would endanger indirect debility, are no doubt the moſt proper diet: but, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they act as antiphlogiſties (as was the antient term) and oppoſe that propenſity in the ſyſtem to ſthenic or tonic inflammation or inflammatory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. This is evident, <hi>not only</hi> from what has
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030645_0042_0FE844E7723FC118"/>been already adduced to prove that the danger in this diſeaſe is from the reverſe of ſuch a ſtate, and that every thing which proves ſalutary muſt do it by <hi>invigorating,</hi> not <hi>debilitating, but alſo,</hi> from the great benefit derived from the uſe of the ſtrongeſt and moſt durable ſtimulating diet, ſuch as beef ſteaks, &amp;c. in thoſe caſes where it can be diſpenſed with, without producing indirect, debility. And indeed it ought always to be kept in memory, that where our only expectation of removing the derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the ſyſtem, is to reſtore the energy of the functions; that as in exerciſe, ſo in diet and drinks, they ought to be as ſtimulating and durable as can be, conſiſtant with the accumulated ſtate of the excitability, and increaſed as the power of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them increaſes. And here I would juſt obſerve that exerciſe, beſides other valuable purpoſes, helps us much in the diſpenſing with, and improving by ſuch a regimen; and likewiſe ſuch regimen increaſes our ability for exerciſe. This ſhows the advantage of uniting every ſtimulant to recover a debilitated
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030645_0043_0FE844ED2B9A3F28"/>habit. Before I cloſe this article I think it my duty to remark the utility of raw eggs, which by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience I have found to afford much durable nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be eaſily diſpenſed with even in a very accumulated ſtate of the excitability. They may be broken into a glaſs of wine, or any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient vehicle, or beat to pieces with ſugar and a little ſpirit and water added, as beſt ſuits.</p>

But opium, altho' of the greateſt utility in this diſeaſe, is ſo liable to abuſe in unſkilful hands I feel myſelf conſtrained to make ſome obſervations on the uſe of it. This noble drug appears to take the lead of every other ſtimulant, and by its uniform operation over the whole ſyſtem, ſerves by the ſuddenneſs of its effects to reduce in a very ſhort time the moſt confuſed derangements (when ſuch derangements are the effect of debility) to a ſtate of ſteadineſs, tranquility and eaſe. In the conſumption, it mitigates the cough, relieves oppreſſion, abates ſpaſms, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes expectoration of any redundancy. But ſuch
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030645_0046_0FE844F731D48BC8"/>is the energy of its ſtimulus that much damage has been done in caſes of chronic debility by over doſing and thereby inducing indirect debility. As our ſole object in this caſe is to effect that degree of reduction of excitability wherein we perform our functions with ſteadineſs, eaſe and tranquility, and that the ſmalleſt quantity beyond, muſt prove inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by inducing indirect debility; I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to every attending Phyſician, when this ſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulant is neceſſary, by careful <hi>attendance</hi> to learn what is the ſmalleſt doſe requiſite, and how often repetition may be neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="81">LXXXI. Having thus far taken a brief view of the principal remedies for the diſeaſe when genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by direct debilitating powers; I ſhall now beſtow a few thoughts on it as induced by the reverſe, viz. powers indirectly debilitating.</p>
               <p n="82">LXXXII. Chronic indirect debility which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens at the ſeaſon of life in which conſumptions prevail, differs from that which attends old people in this reſpect, in the latter, by long and gradual application of a variety, or in other words of every ſtimulant ſubſervient to life and health, the excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in every part and every organ is ſo worn down and decayed, that it looſes the power of any dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excitement, ſo that no proſpect of a reſtoration can exiſt: whereas the former is commonly induced by one kind of ſtimulus alone, and altho' the exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability is over powered, and the ſyſtem debilitated by the continued application of one powerful ſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulant, yet it is commonly if not always the caſe, that in the mean time, leſs of every other ſtimulant is applied than in ordinary healthy caſes. Hence we may conceive inſtead of a waſted, a rather
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030645_0047_0FE844FD2119F408"/>accumulated excitability, ſo far as it reſpects every exciting power except the one which by its over action has induced the debility. Conſequently by gradually withholding the particular hurtful ſtimuli, and a proper application of ſuch ſtimulants as have had no ſhare in cauſing the debility, we may expect the derangements to be removed, and health and vigor again rekindled.</p>
               <p n="83">LXXXIII. The caution given in caſes of direct debility not to carry the effects of ſtimulants beyond a juſt degree of excitement, that is, ſuch a degree as beſt ſuits the natural, eaſy performance of the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ought ſtrictly to be attended to in the preſent caſe; and the more diffuſable neceſſary ſtimulants ought carefully to be leſſened, as the more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ones (ſuch as nearer accord with a ſtate of health) may with ſafety be introduced.</p>
               <p n="84">LXXXIV. The notion of curing chronic indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect debility, by direct debilitating powers, however proper it may be in its approach, yet when actually induced has no foundation in nature; for as before obſerved, <hi>debility is debility</hi> let the ſource of it be what it may, and cannot be removed otherwiſe than by a proper application of ſtimulants. To this, facts abundantly teſtify.</p>
               <p n="85">LXXXV. I ſhall here finiſh my remarks for the preſent by relating in a conciſe manner, only a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle caſe recorded in the New London Medical Journal, to evince my laſt propoſition.

Not ſo much as dreaming that medicine (evacuents excepted) are poſſeſſed of no power or quality different from the common agents or powers by which life is conſtantly upheld and ſupported, excepting in degree of efficacy; nor again ſuſpecting that moſt of the derangements we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience originate from the too ſtrong or want of due application of thoſe common agents; of courſe the moſt important part of the cure, viz. a due regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of regimen, exerciſe, paſſions, &amp;c. &amp;c. is intirely overlooked and treated with what may be juſtly eſteemed a criminal neglect by the patient, eſpecially in diſeaſes which are uſhered on by ſlow and gradual ſteps; mean while he will immediately grow uneaſy with his phyſician, unleſs he is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly craming him with ſome powerful <hi>drug</hi>: the natural conſequence of which, is, in the firſt place, the patient is forecloſed from all the benefit which might be derived from a due regulation of thoſe very <hi>powers</hi> or <hi>agents</hi> which by their undue appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation produced the derangements or diſeaſe; and of improving their energy in reſtoring the ſeveral functions of the body to a vigorous performance of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030645_0050_0FE845073AF05D18"/>all their offices; the efficacy of which cannot be doubted, but that it muſt be <hi>great</hi> by any man of obſervation, when he reflects how ſoon the functions of our bodies become weakened and deranged by withholding, even in a ſmall degree, the aid of any of thoſe ordinary powers,<note n="*" place="bottom">The effects of exchanging warm, dry and ſerene air for cold, damp and fowl—the effects of exchanging an eaſy pleaſing train of ideas and good company for melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly apprehenſions and irkſome companions—the effects of laying aſide a generous regimen and uſing one too low and ſparing, and the effects of exchanging a proper degree of exerciſe for a ſedentary life, are too conſpicuous to eſcape the notice of every man of obſervation.</note> nor can it be much doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that their efficacy is equal to all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in moſt caſes of the diſeaſe in queſtion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the more chronical kind, for the ſlowneſs of the progreſs of the derangements clearly indicate the hurtful powers not to be great or powerful, deſtroying only by continuence.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, by daily gorging the patient with powerful drugs, he muſt be conſtantly <hi>expoſed,</hi> even if thoſe made uſe of be of the claſs of powers indicated, yet by their over acting beyond what is requiſite to counteract the hurtful powers, (which muſt ever be the caſe where a due attention to the non naturals or common agents is ſufficient) the ſyſtem is ſuddenly hurried into the oppoſite extreme, and neither the debility nor derangements are any how got the better of, but the reverſe. This being ſo generally the caſe, it highly behoves the faculty who are called to preſcribe for patients in the diſeaſe in queſtion, as they would be tender of the lives and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their patients and their own reputation; in the firſt place, to endeavor to baniſh thoſe falſe notions not
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030645_0051_0FE8450D2FAE0A18"/>only from their patients, but from their attending friends, and by explaining <hi>natures own ſyſtem</hi> to them more clearly, incourage them in a rigid perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in the uſe of ſuch exerciſe, regimen, change of air, &amp;c. &amp;c. as ſhall be beſt adapted to their ſituation; <hi>rigid</hi> I ſay: as experience teaches us that in all caſes of long continued debility, not only that, but the conſequent derangements (which derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as occur particularly in this diſeaſe, as frequent coughing, profuſe expectoration, large night ſweats, &amp;c. ſerves to augment the debility) become habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and as it were conſtitutional, and of courſe muſt require ſtrict attention in avoiding on the one hand, thoſe hurtful powers by which the debility was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and on the other, a careful attention to the uſe of all thoſe powers calculated by their conſtant and gradually increaſed application to reſtore the permanency of the <hi>excitability,</hi> and recal the ſeveral deranged functions to their ſeveral offices, and continued in for a <hi>length</hi> of <hi>time</hi> ſufficient to eſtabliſh a conſiderable ſhare of ſtrength and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as it muſt be rationally ſuppoſed, that the patient will much more readily <hi>relaps</hi> into all thoſe <hi>derangements,</hi> peculiar to the diſeaſe, by any neglect of proper ſupport, than if he had never been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to them.</p>
            <p>I have dwelt longer, and been more explicit on this particular ſubject, on account of the embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>well</hi> adopted plans are ſubjected to through the miſtaken notions of the ſick; ſay exerciſe for an example; how ſeldom is it put in practice by the patient to any purpoſe? Riding on horſe back for inſtance, when it bids fair to be of utility if attended to a ſuitable time every day; the patient perhaps
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030645_0052_0FE8450EB476D4F8"/>will attend to it two or three times a week, when conveniency ſerves; and that in general, in ſuch a manner as rather to expoſe him, than be of any ſervice.</p>
            <p>I wiſh not to be underſtood by any thing ſaid, to any how ſeclude the uſe of medicine, even in caſes of the moſt chronical debility; where the natural agents which cheriſh and ſupport, life and vigor fail of being adequate (as before ſuggeſted); in ſuch caſes their aid is indiſpenſably neceſſary, and frequently it may be found of utility not only to make uſe of medicional ſtimulants and tonics, but bliſtering the parts of the breaſt, where, by the pain, &amp;c. we have reaſon to ſuſpect a more than equal degree of the diatheſis; occaſional puking, the patient may be alſo indicated and other collateral preſcriptions which do not fall immediately under the general indication of cure. In this place I cannot forbear the recommending to the faculty; the trial (at leaſt) of the ſhavings of Jamaica mahogany wood in decoction in caſes of diarrhoea, which frequently occur in this diſeaſe; as from ſome experience I have had of its uſe, it appears to me, to be poſſeſſed of a ſtimulant and tonic power or quality peculiarly adapted to the excitability of the inteſtinal canal, and bids fair to be of utility; the way I uſed it, was to put 1 oz. of the ſhavings into a quart of water and boil down to a pint; the doſe, 1 oz. of the decoction three or four times a day.</p>
            <p>Again, I would here further obſerve, that as has been before remarked, `that the <hi>ſlowneſs</hi> of the progreſs of the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> indicates <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the hurtful powers;' ſo <hi>vice verſe,</hi> in proportion to its rapidity of progreſs, the <hi>ſtrength</hi> or increaſed power
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030645_0053_0FE7EE2F5152E7F0"/>of thoſe agents; is indicated, ſo in like gradations our attention ought to be arouſed to the auxiliary aid of medicine; hence more medicine and that in larger potions may be requiſite in the more quick conſumptions, than the more ſlow.</p>
