            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O teach the Art of War, is not the Office of the Miniſters of the PRINCE OF PEACE: The Goſpel breathes the moſt extenſive Benevolence to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and has the higheſt Tendency to unite all Nations of the Earth, in inviolable Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>IT is our Departure from God, that renders us Enemies to one another: The extravagant Luſts of Men enkindle thoſe Fires of Contention, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Beauty of this lower Creation, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Globe we inhabit into <hi>a Valley of Tears.</hi>— Did the Spirit of <hi>Jeſus</hi> univerſally prevail, it would ſubdue that Ambition and Avarice, which are the Source of ſo many Miſeries to a guilty World.—It would inſpire the Breaſts of Princes with that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted Goodneſs, which would ſoon diffuſe Order
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007749_0005_102D72E7690CED28"/>
and Harmony, among the different Cantons of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.—Then the Arts of Peace would triumph over the Policies of War; the Fields of Death, ſmile in all the unrifled Charms of Nature; and this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Earth, become a <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of Beauty and Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>BUT ſince the happy Day is not yet come, when <hi>the Nations ſhall beat their Swords into Plow-ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks.</hi>— Since, in the Diſpenſations of Providence, we hear <hi>the Sound of the Trumpet, and the Alarm of War;</hi> and are call'd to <hi>gird on the Sword, and prepare the Inſtruments of Battle.</hi>— It is becoming the Character of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, to ſhew what Direction, Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Aſſiſtance, the <hi>Book of God</hi> affords us, on theſe melancholy Occaſions.</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded, none of my preſent Audience will queſtion, whether the Profeſſion of a Soldier is conſiſtent with the Character of a Chriſtian: We know, that many of the Military Order, have, in all Ages, appear'd the ſhining Ornaments of the Church of Chriſt, as well as the ſtrongeſt Bulwarks of civil Society: <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>MANY of the firſt Fathers of <hi>New-England,</hi> juſtly deſerved this Character;—they were noble Inſtances of ſublime Piety, and martial Accompliſhments. —they were equally qualified to adorn the Church by their exemplary Vertue, and defend it by their Valour.</p>
                  <p>PERHAPS the preſent Age has not produc'd a more truly Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Hero, than the late Col. GARDINER, who maintain'd uninterrupted Communion with Heaven, amidſt the Tumults and Diſorders of a Camp—and after a Life ſpent in perpetual Toils and Dangers, in the Service of his Country, —died in the Bed of Honor, fighting againſt the Enemies, of the civil and religious Liberties of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>—I wiſh the Life of this devout Warrior, wrote by the late celebrated Dr. <hi>Doddridge,</hi> was in the Hands of all the Gentlemen of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Character. I am perſwaded, it would afford them an agreable Entertainment, and the beſt Inſtruction.</p>
               </note> They have merited the public
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007749_0006_102DA82361599900"/>
Eſteem, as much by the Charms of their Vertue, as by the Splendor of their Conqueſts.</p>
            <p>THE Great God, condeſcends to wear the Title of a MAN OF WAR; and Princes, His Vicegerents here below, are commanded, not to bear the Sword in vain.—When the Faith of Treaties is violated, the Rights of a Community invaded, all Propoſals of Accommodation obſtinately rejected,—it becomes the immediate Duty of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, to have Recourſe to Arms; that he may eſtabliſh Peace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect Innocence, humble the Proud Oppreſſors of the Earth, and put a Stop to the Progreſs of Tyranny and Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>THE only Queſtion is,— How we ſhall behave, when call'd to War, ſo as not to violate the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Chriſtian Profeſſion, or injure the Rights of our fellow Creatures,—but maintain the Character of <hi>good Soldiers of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſucceſsful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Common-wealth?—In this the Word of God is <hi>profitable to direct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle cauſes the illuſtrious Heroes of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, to paſs in Review before us; and propoſes their noble Example, for the Imitation of the People of God in all Ages. By Faith, they paſſed thro' the ſevereſt Trials, ſurmounted the moſt terrifying Dangers, <hi>waxed valiant in Fight, put to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle, in this Chapter, ſpeaks of <hi>Faith</hi> in the moſt extenſive Signification of the Word.—He intends that divine Principle, which inclines us to adore the Perfections of the infinite Deity, to reſign ourſelves to the Government of His Providence, to believe the Revelations of His Word, to depend on the Promiſes of his Grace, to obey his ſovereign Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,—in Times of the greateſt Difficulty and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,—notwithſtanding the Terrors and Allurements of this <hi>preſent evil World.</hi>—This is that Faith which
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007749_0007_102DA824E63DB410"/>
animated theſe ancient Worthies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enabled them to perform theſe mighty Exploits, which were the Glory of the paſt, and will be the Admiration of future Ages. The ſame Faith ſhould animate the Breaſts of the military Gentlemen of the preſent Day, if they would receive the Honors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enjoy the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their illuſtrious Predeceſſors. To ſhow</p>
            <p>HOW admirably this Faith is calculated to produce this happy Effect, is the Deſign of my preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Faith teaches us to engage in War upon the nobleſt Principles,—it inclines us to proſecute it with intrepid Valour,—It ſecures us the moſt powerful Aſſiſtance,—It promiſes us the moſt glorious Reward. —This is the Plan of my Diſcourſe, the Subject of your ſerious Attention.—</p>
            <p>FIRST, Faith teaches us, to engage in War upon the nobleſt Principles.</p>
            <p>WHAT was the Spirit, that animated <hi>the Pompey</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>and Caeſar</hi>'s, and other celebrated Warriors of the Heathen World?— What is the Spirit, that animates many of our Modern Heroes?—Their Characters are ſurrounded with a falſe Blaze of Glory; their Names are traſmitted to Poſterity, in flattering Titles of Honor; they are profanely ſtiled invincible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, Arbiters of Peace and War, Diſpoſers of the Fate of Kingdoms.—Thus the Truth is diſguiſed by their ſervile Dependants; and their ſecret Deſigns conceal'd, by all the Refinements of Art and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.—But if we examine their Conduct, with an unprejudiced Mind, we ſhall immediately find, the fatal Influence of inſatiable Avarice,—inſolent Pride, —unbounded Ambition.</p>
            <p>FAITH inſpires its Heroes with nobler Motives, agreable to the Dignity of human Nature, and the Sanctity of our Chriſtian Profeſſion.—A ſupreme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Glory of God, a ſincere Deſire to eſtabliſh Peace among Mankind, a diſintereſted Zeal for the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007749_0008_102DA826948BEB10"/>
publick Welfare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> influence their Conduct.—The Call of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brings them into the Field of Battle.—The Enemies they oppoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are Pride, Perfidy, and Violence:—Theſe they fight againſt without Revenge, conquer without Haughtineſs, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over without Inſolence.—Undiſſembled Love reigns in their Breaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when engaged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Acts of publick Vengeance: Their Bowels melt, with the tendereſt Compaſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when their Hands are ſtained with Blood: They devoutly adore the Creator, when obliged by ſad Neceſſity to deſtroy His Creatures.</p>
            <p>THE Religion of JESUS teaches its faithful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to do no Violence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to advance their private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to commit no Injury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to increaſe the Luſtre of their Reputation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſhed not a Drop of Blood, but what may be ſerviceable to the Cauſe of Truth and Juſtice — It requires us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to endeavour to ſubdue our Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without deſtroying them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to reſiſt their hoſtile Attempts without violating the ſacred Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to reduce them to Reaſon, by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods the leaſt ſevere and angry —This is to act <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> OF JESUS CHRIST<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to obey the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Precepts of the GREAT CAPTAIN OF OUR SALVATION. When we engage in War, in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Mind.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith enables us to proſecute it with intrepid Valor.</p>
            <p>TRUE Valor. My Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not an indiſcreet Impetuoſity, which hurries us into the greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, without Tho't; and ventures upon immediate Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without any Proſpect of Advantage.— But a noble Greatneſs of Mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which inclines a Perſon to obey the Voice of God and His People, tho' it calls him to the moſt dangerous Enterprizes: Its Ardor is increaſed at the View of an Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It riſes ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to every Difficulty, that is found in the Path of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007749_0009_102DA829B99D9688"/>
Duty; and is ready to ſacrifice Life itſelf, rather than endanger the publick Safety.</p>
            <p>THIS generous Fortitude never reſides in the Breaſts of the Wicked; the accuſtomed Practice of Vice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Health of the Body, relaxes the Vigor of the Mind, makes Men capable only of mean and mercenary Deſigns.</p>
            <p>OF this, we have numberleſs Examples, in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern Hiſtory. While the <hi>Romans</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued uncorrupted, their Empire <hi>was ſtrong as Iron,</hi> according to the ſignificant Repreſentation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel.</hi>— The Severity of their Manners was the great Occaſion of the Rapidity of their Conqueſts— The Grandeur of their Common-wealth was the Reward of their national Juſtice and Temperence. But when their ancient Diſcipline was weakned; and the Vices of the conquered, corrupted the Hearts of the Conquerors—<hi>their Iron became,</hi> immediately min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled <hi>with Clay</hi>—the Foundations of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were ſoon overthrown, and their once victorious Legions, were eaſily put to Flight, by Troops of undiſciplin'd Barbarians.</p>
            <p>NOW, the Principles of the Chriſtian Faith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from thoſe Vices, which deprave the ſound Conſtitution both of Body and Mind; and transform valiant Heroes, into effeminate Cowards.— It eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes that ſtrict Government of the Paſſions, <hi>which is Health to the Navel, and Marrow to the Bones;</hi> and naturally forms us to every great and good Deſign.</p>
            <p>UNDER the Influence of this Faith, the Chriſtian Soldier begins his Days with Prayer—exerciſes his Authority to ſuppreſs the Prevalence of Vice—em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys his Power to protect the Liberties of Mankind. He invocates in every Danger the God of Armies; and ſanctifies the Violence of War, by the Purity of his Intentions, and the Deſire to procure an happy Peace.</p>

               <hi>my Heart ſhall not fear: Tho' War ſhould riſe againſt me, in this will I be confident.</hi> This brings to ſay,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Faith ſecures us the moſt powerful Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>IT is the Wiſdom of all Nations, to form a potent Alliance when engaging in War. Well cemented Confederacies, have a natural Influence to ſecure Succeſs to our Enterprizes. When different Nations join in Concert for their mutual Defence, and act with united Vigor; it makes the proud Oppreſſors of the Earth to tremble, and their royal Diadems totter on their Heads.</p>
            <p>BUT after all, it muſt be acknowleded the Events of War are uncertain: the moſt wiſe and valiant
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007749_0011_102DA82DCDF034F0"/>
Captains are not always crown'd with Victory, nor the moſt numerous and beſt diſciplin'd Troops fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with Succeſs. <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong. No King is ſaved by the Multitude of an Hoſt, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> it a mighty Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by much Strength.</hi> The ſupreme Monarch of the Univerſe, directs the Fate of War according to His ſovereign and irreſiſtable Pleaſure.—It is equally eaſy with Him, to ſave by many or by few.</p>
            <p>IT is, therefore, the higheſt Wiſdom to engage the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> on our Side, and the Extremity of Folly to provoke Him to undertake the Cauſe of our Enemies. Now nothing is more acceptable to Him, than a firm Dependance on his Power—Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence— and Grace.— This is the Practice of the Chriſtian Warrior, and the ſure Way to Proſperity.</p>
            <p>THE Wicked bid Defiance to Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even when they ſtand in the greateſt Need of its Aſſiſtance — they affront the <hi>God of Battles</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when ſurrounded with the dreadful <hi>Artillery</hi> of His Wrath.—They depend on the Number of their Forces, the Valor of their Troops, the Depth of their Stratagems<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſecure them the Fortune of the Day.— If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, it is aſcrib'd to their ſuperior Strength and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They erect Altars to their own Glory, and burn Incenſe to their Ambition and Vanity.</p>
            <p>BUT, Faith teaches the Followers of Chriſt to renounce all Self-dependance: to fix their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the ſupreme Diſpoſer of all Things, and to give the Glory of all their Succeſs to Him, to whom it juſtly belongs.—If they march, they look to God their Director and Guide.— If they encamp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they know except God be their Protector, the <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wake in vain.</hi>— If they fight, they are ſenſible from whence they derive all their military Strength. If they Conquer, they acknowledge that divine Hand, which alone crowns them with Victory and Triumph.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:007749_0012_102DA8306429A8F0"/>IN this devout Diſpoſition, we may form great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and hope to execute them with happy Succeſs.

            <p>TO this End, he ſoon collected a formidable Force, deſign'd not only to recover his Loſs, but ſcatter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thro' the Coaſts of NORTH-AMERICA. We all remember, how greatly we were ſurpriſed when we heard their Fleet had actually ſail'd to execute this fatal Scheme— No wonder every Face gathered Paleneſs, every Heart was ſeiz'd with Terror. We had every Thing to fear, which the Bigotry of <hi>Rome</hi>— the Tyranny of <hi>France,</hi>— the Rage of provoked Enemies, could contrive or inflict. Had they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, we had nothing to expect, but to ſee our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Flames— our Habitations demoliſhed— our Virgins defloured—our Street delug'd with Blood,— and the Temples of our God proſtituted to Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatry.</p>
            <p>BUT, though deſtitute of human Aſſiſtance, our <hi>Help was in the Name of the Lord, who made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth.</hi>—God ſent a contagious Sickneſs among them, which diſpirited their Generals, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly diminiſh'd the Number of their Forces: —Unwilling to return, without executing ſome Part of their intended Miſchief, they ſummon'd all their Strength, and determined to make a reſolute Attack on ſome of our <hi>Eaſtern Settlements,</hi>—God ſent forth his Commiſſion to the Winds, they heard his Voice,

            <p>THUS, in the Day of our Extremity, <hi>the Name of the Lord alone was exalted. His right Hand</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd for us an eaſy Victory over our Enemies.

            <p>MANY of the Pagan Heroes fir'd with a Love of Fame, perform'd aſtoniſhing Exploits, for the Glory and Greatneſs of their Country. It is to be fear'd, that many of the moſt ſucceſsful Captains in modern Times, have been influenc'd by no higher Motives in their military Atchievements.—When this is the Caſe, we erect Monuments to perpetuate the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their Victories, but cannot enroll them among the Favourites of Heaven. While we cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate their martial Honours, we ſhed Tears to think, that thoſe who have ſo nobly ſerv'd the Purpoſes of divine Providence, muſt remain the eternal Objects of His Juſtice.—</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:007749_0015_102DA836B8A53C68"/>WHAT is this Fame! ſo ardently deſired, ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently purſued,—amidſt a Thouſand Deaths —thro' ten Thouſand Dangers!— An airy Dream—A gilded Phantom—deſtitute of Truth and Reality.</p>
            <p>BUT the Chriſtian Soldier, animated with the Spirit of Faith and Charity, fights not for a Crown of fading Lawrels, but uncorruptible Glory; He receives the Applauſes, not of falſe and flattering Mortals, but of God the true Fountain of Honor.</p>
            <p>ASCEND, O Chriſtian! above theſe Objects of Senſe which ſurround you; fix your Thoughts on the ETERNAL DIVINITY: Behold him ſeated on a <hi>Throne of Light,</hi> encircled with Angels, Arch-Angels, and the whole HIERARCHY OF HEAVEN—Hark,— how loud do their Triumphant Voices ſound!— with what tranſports of Joy do they aſcribe.<note place="margin">
