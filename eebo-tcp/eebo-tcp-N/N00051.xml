         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To open the words briefly. The <hi>Patient,</hi> Here you finde, 1. An [<hi>Out-cast</hi>] It doth immediately look to the good Figs that were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and they were in a manner voluntary Exiles, they yielded themselves to go: and such an Out-cast is here meant, as is not onely cast out of the Country, but out of the hearts and affections of others. Several Comparisons there are, that set forth this <hi>Out-cast;</hi> as, that of a menstruous woman, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But not onely is <hi>Sion</hi> an Out-cast, but an Out-cast [<hi>Wounded</hi>] and it is <hi>Laesio ad mortem,</hi> a deadly wound; and an incurable wound, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er.</hi> 30.12. <hi>i.e.</hi> according to man: And not a green Wound, but an Ulcer, a festered Wound and Sore; and no wonder then she is also sick. And if we look to the Extrinsecal Adjuncts which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this Patient, there is that which relates unto</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Beholders: They say [<hi>This is Sion, whom no man seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after.</hi>] They did reproach her, and there was no denial of it; <hi>Is not this</hi> Sion! 'tis spoken in way of derision: the sarcasm of an Enemy. <hi>Sion</hi> was a word of honour, but they here relate to the Notation of the Hebrew word, from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Siccitas,</hi> as being a dry, withered, sapless thing; a barren, and forsaken, and undesirable place and society. And further [<hi>Whom no man seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after</hi>] Neither this sort of men, nor that sort of men; none hath any care of her welfare.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A second kinde of Extrinsecal Adjuncts relate unto the Physician; [<hi>Therefore I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee.</hi>] Now God will apply a sanative Cataplasm, an healing Plaister: This is Repentance, and Restitution, <hi>

                  </gap>er.</hi> 31.9. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and their Return, make up the sanative Plaister. In respect of her self, there was need of Repentance; in respect of the adversary, there was need of Reduction. And the Cause of it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> [<hi>Because they called thee an Out-cast</hi>] as who should say, I am sensible of all thy case, and the opprobrie thou hast suffered, therefore will I restore thee. But shall not this fail?
<pb facs="unknown:000090_0008_0FA014496A87D910"/>
No, Jehovah's word is engaged for it, <hi>Thus saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Doct. When Sion for its sin is become an Out-cast (a subject of contempt) God takes occasion from her Calamity to give her Repentance, that so he may bring upon her the Blessing of his own People.</q>
            <p>I will not more then intimate to you the Paradoxes that the Text doth abound with. <hi>Sion,</hi> and acknowledged, and yet no man careth for her. A People, none neglected like them; a People, none beloved like them: Neglected, if you look at men; beloved, if you look at God. A People, whose very adversaries are instrumental to their prosperity. These are such Riddles, as we may truely say Gods grace onely makes. A strange occasion may that seem to be, which God takes for the healing of his People in <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.17,18. <hi>I have seen his wayes</hi> (<hi>i. e</hi> his froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and covetousness) <hi>and will heal him.</hi> Ezek. 11. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Thy brethren, even thy brethren, &amp;c. they say, Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> ye farre from the Lord, unto us is the land given in possession: Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord, although I have cast them farre off, &amp;c. though I have scattered them, &amp;c. yet will I be a little Sanctuary unto them—I will gather you, &amp;c.</hi> Zech.3.2. <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem: Is not this a brand pluckt out of the fire?</hi> They had been in the Furnace long enough. As the Lord dealeth thus with his people, so <hi>David</hi> maketh use of the like in his personal case, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 12. <hi>It may be the Lord will look upon mine affliction, and requite me good, &amp;c. bless me, because of his cursing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reasons of the point, are:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. From the Sympathy that there is between the Head and the Members. Christ is sensible of the sufferings of his Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast. It is true, that the Out-cast doth suffer; it is a greater truth, that the God of the Out-cast suffereth. Isa. 63. 9. <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all their affliction, he was afflicted:</hi> it relateth to Israel in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Zech. 2.8. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his Eye:</hi> it relateth to the good Figs in exile. It is no little ease that our sorrows
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000090_0009_0FA0144A0D8E1BA8"/>
touch Christ, according to <hi>Hel.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>We have not an high Priest that cannot be touched, &amp;c.</hi> What though the Out-cast suffereth for sin, yet he hath a sufferer with him: and in this respect what <hi>Paul</hi> said to his Corinthians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. that doth Christ say to his Out-cast, <hi>If I make you sorry, who is he that maketh me glad, but the same that are made sorry by me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because that Gods Name suffereth, while his Out-casts do thus suffer. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.12. if God should destroy Israel, the Egyptians will say, <hi>For mischief hath he brought them, &amp;c.</hi> Deut.32.27. <hi>Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.</hi> You remember the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Ioshua</hi> useth, Chap.7,8,9. <hi>When Israel falleth before the enemy, what wilt thou do to thy great Name?</hi> The destruction of Israel would raise a scandal to Religion, and the God of Israel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. To capacitate the Out-cast to receive the benediction of a Father, the actual blessing of his People. To be Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is one thing; but to be made meet to receive the blessing of his people, is another thing. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>The Lord, even the Lord that hath chosen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Ier. 24. 5,6,7. <hi>I will set mine eyes upon them for good, I will bring them again, I will build them, I will give them an heart to know me, &amp;c.</hi> Ier.30.22. &amp; 31.33. <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my people:</hi> and vers.9. <hi>Ye shall come with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and supplications, &amp;c. [Ye shall come]</hi> there is their Return; [<hi>with weeping and supplications</hi>] there is their Repentance: and the Lord hath undertaken for it; <hi>I am a father to</hi> Israel, <hi>and</hi> Ephraim (as bad as he is) <hi>is my first-born.</hi> The cause of their being his people, a penitent people, a blessed people, is his fatherly relation to them, Ier.32.38,39. Ier.30.7. <hi>Alas, it is the time of</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>acobs <hi>trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>vse</hi> 1. <hi>Instruction</hi> 1. Hence learn, that <hi>Sion</hi> is subject to sad Apostacy, or defections. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.5,13,21. <hi>I planted thee a noble vine.</hi> We must acknowledge, God planted us, I may say, a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vine, and, if so, a noble vine: but you see a generous vine
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000090_0010_0FA0144AEC5EAC50"/>
subject to be a degenerate vine. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 7, 8. <hi>They turned aside quickly.</hi> But as the Oratour solemnizing a sad funeral, desired to have learned Mortality from another Instance, rather then that of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aliger;</hi> so I would God would learn us this truth from some other instances, rather then from these Churches. I may men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion notwithstanding, the Polititians observation concerning the stage of action usually changed in thirty years; because the persons that make the <hi>major</hi> vote, are usually changed, and gone by that time. Something about that time, hath our time been in this land, now perhaps the <hi>major</hi> vote is changed; you may say in such and such a case many a time, and had such been alive, these actions, and those, in Church or Court, would not have been so carried on. But I will not dwell here. I wish we might learn such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances from some other example, and not from our selves.</p>

'Tis a truth, that Israel embraceth not God, til God first embrace Israel: 'tis also a truth, that God forsaketh not Israel, till Israel first for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake him. <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>If good things be withheld from us, Iniquity is the cause. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Look upon it in it-self, and it seems incurable, look't at in the Physician, and it cannot but be cured. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> looking at his sufferings, he will speak no more; but looking at Gods promise, and it is as fire in his bones, he cannot but speak. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 8. 10. there is a quaerie put to the Prophet, whether <hi>Benhadad shall live;</hi> the prophet answers, <hi>He may certainly recover, howbeit, the Lord hath shewed me, he shall surely dye, i. e.</hi> the disease was not such but the might have recovered: so may I by allusion invert and say, <hi>Sions</hi> disease is incurable, but yet she shall certainly recover. Look at <hi>Sion</hi> in the glass of Providence, and she is as a woman forsaken, and grieved in spirit, <hi>Isai.</hi> 54. 5,6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 66. 4. hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandless, as to reproach; and yet at the same time <hi>thy Maker is thy husband:</hi> if we look <hi>at Sion</hi> in the glass of the Promise, this Out-cast is both <hi>Marah,</hi> and <hi>Hephzibah,</hi> both a <hi>Widow,</hi> and <hi>Beulah.</hi> Look at the Out-casts tears, as an effect of mans not caring for her, but as an occasion, and demonstration of Gods care for her, <hi>Psal.</hi> 126. 5,6. that <hi>Sion</hi> sheddeth tears, denominateth her <hi>Marah;</hi> that <hi>Sions</hi> tears are seed, denominateth her <hi>Hephzibah.

Gods touching an impenitent Out-cast with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is a signal of Gods having mercy thereon. <hi>Sions</hi> recovery by repentance from her backsliding, is an effect of grace, and a fore-runner of the set time of <hi>Sions</hi> mercy <hi>Sions</hi> impenitency, is

God proposeth to us Remedy, or Calamity: we have our option, whether that of the plaister, or of the sore; make we our choice. If we accept the plaister, the time of mercy, even the set time is come; if you do not accept it, you may look at it as the beginning of sorrow. That we are Out-casts, this doth speak us sick; but our not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remedy, speaks our sickness incurable. To be Out-casts, this argues that we are cast off by men; but our not accepting the remedy, speaketh us cast off by God: the condition of an Out-cast supposeth us sinners; but the rejection of the remedy doth say that we are castawayes: for an Out-cast to need a medicine, is common to good and bad; to accept it, is proper to the good.</p>
            <p>Let us then accept the Lords Plaister. As an Ingredient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, I shall propose this Direction; <abbr>

There is a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Discretive, which belongeth to every Believer; there is a judgement Authoritative, that belongs unto the Church, and is set therein by God; and also there is a judgement Decisive, which belongs unto the Council: Onely remember, that the <hi>Supreme Judge</hi> is either 1.

This Question concerning a Ministerial Judge in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is that which hath greatly exercised the Christian world; insomuch that both Protestants and Papists agree, That the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this Controversie is of so great moment, as that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon depends the Resolution of all Controversies.

The <hi>major</hi> part may erre; so saith the Delinquent standing before the Church, and must that evacuate all Church-power? 2.

But distinguish we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Councils.

            <head>THE BELIEVERS CONSOLATION, In the Remembrance of his Heavenly Mansion prepared for him by CHRIST. BEING THE SECOND SERMON: AND Preached on the LORDS-DAY, MARCH XXIX. 1663.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>John 14. 3.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to my self, that where I am, there you may be also.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Verse, and the former, holds forth a double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, to support the Disciples against the suffering which they were to conflict with, either <hi>In the way of Truth,</hi> or <hi>For the way of Truth.</hi> This Verse holds forth the second Argument of Consolation; the former you have in the second Verse: it is taken from the <hi>Place</hi> they were to be taken to after Death. And this Argument in this Verse is taken from the <hi>Company</hi> they shall have in that place; and that is his Personal Presence, his full and clear Presence: <hi>Where I am, there you shall be also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Argument of Consolation is described, 1. From the <hi>Scope</hi> of Christ in preparing such a place for them; and it was, that he and they might be there together: <hi>I go to prepare a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000090_0022_0FA01458438EB4A0"/>
place for you, that where I am, there you may be also.</hi> 2. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from the <hi>Time</hi> when they must expect their being taken to Christ; and that is, when he comes again: <hi>I will come again, and receive you to my self.</hi> 3. It is declared from the <hi>Efficient</hi> of it, the Undertaker of this; and that is Himself: <hi>I will come again, and receive you to my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To open the words thus resolved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Touching the Presence of Christ and Believers together [<hi>That where I am, there you may be also</hi>] you must understand this (of his Presence emphatically so called) of his Presence in the place of Blessedness: <hi>In thy Presence is fulness of joy,</hi> Psal. 16. 11. There is a double Presence of Christ, but he means here his Presence in Glory, where <hi>we shall see him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 2. I said, this Argument of their Consolation was declared from the <hi>Scope</hi> of it; <hi>I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am, there you may be also:</hi> it was one great end of his being a Fore-runner. Secondly, he should fail of his Fidelity and Ability, if there should be a disappointment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Time</hi> [<hi>When I come again</hi>] Christs coming is either his last Coming or his coming by Death. Of his last coming you reade 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 18. Of his coming by Death, you reade <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43. <hi>To day thou shalt be with me in Paradice.</hi> Now the Soul goes to Christ, when He comes to us by Death: at his last coming both Soul and Body shall be together with him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Argument of Consolation is described by the <hi>Efficient</hi> of it, or Undertaker, [<hi>I will receive you to my self</hi>] We may doubt how our Souls, when we dye, shall come to Heaven: why, saith Christ, <hi>I will come, and receive you to my self.</hi> They therefore say properly, when they dye, that say, <hi>Into thy hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> Psal. 31. 5. it is a proper saying so to speak, because Christ he doth receive them. And <hi>Steven</hi> (again) he speaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 59. <hi>Lord Jesus receive my Spirit.</hi> It is a blessed thing to commit our Souls by Faith to Christ, when they go out of the Body. He comes by the ministry of his Angels, or otherwise as he please: <hi>I will come again, and receive you to my self.</hi> You may remember the words of <hi>Steven,</hi> he dying, <hi>called upon God, and said, Lord
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000090_0023_0FA01458FB618DA8"/>
Jesus receive my Spirit:</hi> we receive Christ, and we receive the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ; <hi>Now to as many as received him, to them gave he power, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 1. 12. Christ receives our Spirits (then:) If we receive his Spirit now, he will receive our Spirits then; <hi>I will receive you to my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Doct. That the effectual Remembrance, that at Death Christ will receive our Souls unto Himself, is a Soveraign Preservative to quiet our Souls throughout all the Sufferings we meet with, either In the way of Truth, and For the way of Truth, during this life.</q>
            <p>You shall finde in <hi>Iob</hi> 19. 25. saith he, <hi>I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth:</hi> He might say, I know my Estate is gone, and I see that my Friends are gone, and my Children be gone, and my Health and Strength is gone, and the Grave is ready for me; but what stayes <hi>

                  </gap>obs</hi> heart now? <hi>I know that my Redeemer lives.</hi> This is a living truth for a dying man; <hi>I know that my Redeemer lives, and that he shall stand in the latter day upon the earth, and I shall see him, &amp;c.</hi> This was now <hi>In the way of Truth,</hi> for you cannot say that <hi>Iob</hi> was persecuted <hi>For the way of Truth.</hi> But you shall finde in a way of suffering for the way of Truth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ:</hi> Having passed through many troubles, I would be out of the body and freed from the body of death; <hi>I desire to depart, and to be with Christ.</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 8. <hi>We are confident, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.</hi> You must either be absent from the body, or absent from the Lord; it is an hard thing to be absent from the body, but not comparatively: <hi>We desire rather to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the body, and present with the Lord: We shall meet the Lord, and shall ever be with the Lord.</hi> What is the use of this, 1 <hi>Thess,</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Comfort one another with these words:</hi> what are these Comforts? They are nothing but Promises; Promises rightly applied, these are the Comforts of the holy Ghost: they hold forth more good, then the affliction doth evil. If you would comfort one another, bring out the Promise, that is comfortable and seasonable. <hi>Comfort
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000090_0024_0FA01459BAEECEA8"/>
one another:</hi> with what? <hi>with these words;</hi> for in them the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter doth come and apply comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because hereby we are made fit for this rest, fit to be with Christ; that is, by our trouble, &amp; by this remembrance. Mixing this remembrance with our trouble, doth fit us for this place. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>He that worketh us to the self-same thing, is God.</hi> For what thing? for our heavenly house, our <hi>house not made with hands:</hi> he that fits us for these things, is God. And thus doth he fit us by trouble, by these matters of groaning that do pass over us from day to day. This should be a great incouragement; <hi>There is a place prepared for you,</hi> but remember you must be fit for your place: you are not fit for your place, in that you are meerly Regenerate, but you must pass through such a measure of Obedience both active and passive that is appointed for you, that by this means <hi>you may be meet for the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> The place is fit for us already, but we are not fit for it as soon as we are Regenerate. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. he doth there instance in the troubles of the body, the grief of the outward man: we are burthened with our body, but all this while a fitting for our place. If you belong to God, he is working you <hi>to the self-same thing;</hi> be your trouble this or that (the Cholick, Palsie, Stone, or whatever) he is working us <hi>for the self-same thing:</hi> This is a great matter in our troubles, to consider that God by them is fitting us for our place in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. From the Quality of the Undertaker, that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the reception of our Souls to himself; <hi>I will come, and receive you to my self.</hi> If it be so, let us <hi>that suffer according to the will of God</hi> (1 Pet. 4. 19.) <hi>commit the keeping of our Souls to him:</hi> you may boldly do it, he sends a fiery Chariot for <hi>Elijah;</hi> likely it was an Angel, <hi>He makes his Angels spirits, his Ministers a flame of fire,</hi> Heb. 1. 7. Christ hath his way to carry your Souls to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: you do not believe what a condition your Souls will be in, as soon as ever they are out of the body: do but think what a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here is; but we believe not these things. As Christ, when he sent to his Disciples to comfort them, (<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 11.) they thought they were <hi>idle tales:</hi> so when we hear of these things, we look at them but as <hi>idle tales;</hi> but, saith Christ, <hi>I will come, and receive you to my self.</hi>

               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Taken from the Person we shall be with, namely, Christ. Phil. 1. 23. <hi>You shall be with Christ, which is best of all,</hi> or <hi>which is farre better:</hi> There is no better House then this Mansion, there is no better Presence then his Presence; therefore will might he say, <hi>I. is best of all,</hi> or <hi>farre better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Instruction</hi> 1. Learn from hence, that the most and the greatest Communion that we have with Christ in this life, still leaves us in a condition of absence from Christ, compared with that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we shall have with him after death: So saith the Apostle, 2. Cor. 5. 8. <hi>We are willing to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord;</hi> ver. 6. <hi>for while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</hi> It is a place of absence form the Lord, that is, compared with what we shall have after death. If you think of <hi>Paul,</hi> Who did enjoy Christ more then <hi>Paul</hi> did? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> enjoy Church-communion? Yes; but notwithstanding this was a place of <hi>absence from the Lord,</hi> compared with the society that by death he should be in. Was not <hi>Paul</hi> acquainted with any godly men? you know what he saith of <hi>Timothy;</hi> but yet (saith he) <hi>I am absent from mine own people.</hi> The word that is here translated [<hi>Absent</hi>] signifies <hi>Absence from his own people:</hi> he loved <hi>Timothy</hi> well, but he thinks <hi>the Spirits of just men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> exceed the Spirit of <hi>Timothy:</hi> Here is no Companion that is like the Company there; here is no Communion will satisfie here. Where most of Christ is, it is best, but yet it is <hi>absence</hi> compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; <hi>We are absent from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Instr.</hi> 2. The New man (the Believer) is never at rest till he is with Christ in his Mansion-house. If you never finde any such thing in you, but that, if you might have your desire, you would be here alwayes, believe it you have not this New man in you: this New man never is at rest, till it comes to Christ. It is true, there is weakness in the best, and unbelief may prevail too-too much, but I speak of this new Nature that is in these, and reigns in these that are Regenerate. You know how it is with those that love one another: after that <hi>Jacob</hi> knew what was become of <hi>Joseph,</hi> there was no staying of <hi>Jacob; Let me go and see him before I dye,</hi> Gen. 45,28. What was the reason of it? there was
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000090_0026_0FA014614687FB58"/>
an intire love one unto another. You know how it is with those that do indeed love one another, that have been long absent one from another, they cannot rest until they meet: Was there any did ever love another, as the New man loves Christ? The New man loves him with a divine love, <hi>the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame,</hi> Cant 8. 6. There are some on earth that do long after Christ; there are those on earth that do desire after Heaven: and do any love another, as Jesus Christ loves the New man? There must be a meeting between these two Lovers; <hi>I will come, and receive you to my self.</hi> Mark how <hi>John</hi> concludes the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Chap. 22. ver. 21. <hi>Behold I come,</hi> saith Christ: <hi>He that testifieth of these things, saith, I come; Amen, even so come Lord I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sus.</hi> Here is a longing to be with Christ. In any of your quaeries concerning Christ, you are never at rest till you come to Heaven: it is the proper Being of the Sun to be in motion; this New man is a divine man, and his motion is still unto, and after Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Instruction</hi> 3. The death of the Believer, it is a reception of the Soul by Christ Jesus. Christ receiving of our Soules at Death, is an incouragement to strengthen us against the fear of Death. Are you affraid of going to your Mansion house? are you affraid of going to Christ? Mark what the Apostle saith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>I desire to depart, and to be with Christ.</hi> The Greek word is a Marriners Phrase, and signifies as much as to set sayle from the shore: I desire my time were come to be loosed that I might go to my Mansion. There are three Cords or Bonds that do Intangle us, the loosing from which doth sweeten Death to us: 1. The Bond of the Cross; I desire to be dissolved, and loosed from the afflictions and miseries of this present life: This is in it's place a lawful thing to desire in Gods time. 2. There is a Bond of Corruption, the body of Death; this I desire to be loosed from: <hi>O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               </gap>s in the Best; But if you have the new man in you, you cannot bear them: There is Vain-glory there, and there is impatience there, and there is Envy there, and Unspiritualness, which the Believer cannot
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000090_0027_0FA0146201547C10"/>
bear; I desire therefore to be loosed from the Body. It is said of one, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mezentius.</hi>
               </note> that he would bind a dead Corpse to a living man, and so he would torture them. This new man is bound to a dead Corps: there is no part of the Understanding, Will, or Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions, throughout the whole man, but this dead Corpse is there. 3. There is the Cord of our absence from Christ: that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth, as if it did in an especial manner move with him to be <hi>with Christ, which is the best of all. Simeon</hi> speaking of death, <hi>Lord, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace, Luk.</hi> 2. 29. as if he should say, Give me my dismission (as we use to speak, from one Church to another: so here) from a Society Militant, to a Society Triumphant: So you see here he calls it but a dismission; <hi>it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up, Luk,</hi> 9. 51. relating to his death: if you did but think that this were the great business when you dye, namely, the receiving of your Soules, you would not be troubled: you cannot give up your Soules into better hands. <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Look at death as in the Curse, and what more terrible? But look at it in the Promise, and it hath another kind of aspect. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 43. you see there it is compared to sowing; <hi>it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</hi> This is now with relation to the body, it is but sowing of it, it shall rise again, and that with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: you are not affraid of sowing your seed, that will bring a glad harvest. It is a going from those that are not our own people, to those that are our own people, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6,8. it may be you have a friend here, but it is not an ordinary thing to meet with a <hi>Jonathan</hi> here. It is but a going from them who are not our people, whom we cannot so fully close with; nay you cannot close with your own souls fully, while here; but you are going from those <hi>who are not your people,</hi> to those <hi>who are your people,</hi> where you shall find perfect closing with this new man; you are come to <hi>the spirits of just men ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

mantle. What a thing was it for <hi>Elijah</hi> to let his mantle fall, he gets him up into his Chariot and lets go his mantle: I speak this, that you may see what expressions the Scripture gives concerning death: <hi>O let my last end be like his!</hi> I tell you it is a lovely thing, <hi>Let me dye the death of the Righteous, let my last end be like his:</hi> I tell you there is another good in their last end, that the unbeleiver is not aware of.

They sleep, and they sleep in Jesus: <hi>They also that sleep in Jesus shall God bring with him:</hi> you see two bodies lye by the wall, and they look both alike, but (believe it) they are not both alike in the Promise; if one be a Believer, and the other an Unbeliever, one is gone to this Mansion place, the other not.</p>

            <p n="1">1. We shall see him: 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>We shall see him as he is.</hi>

He is such an Object, as nothing without him will satisfie our Souls: may be they may be pleased, as children with a Rattle, for a while here, but nor satisfied without him; therefore know it, there Souls of ours are more worth then we are apt to think of, prize them how you will.</p>
            <p>Unto the <hi>seeing of God</hi> (to speak plainly) there are three things that are required:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is required <hi>an Object.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. There is required <hi>the Purifying and Perfecting of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is required <hi>the Light of Glory, which may enable the Soul to see that Object.</hi> Now</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Object is God, we shall see him: <hi>I shall see God,</hi> Job 19. 26. not onely <hi>see his Redeemer,</hi> but <hi>I shall see God:</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might be the meaning of <hi>Iob,</hi> yet <hi>we shall see him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 2. <hi>We shall see him face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12.

It is abundantly to incourage every Christian to constancy in the profession of the truth, notwithstanding all the suffering we may meet with, either <hi>in the way of truth,</hi> or <hi>for the way of truth.</hi> This is that which <hi>John</hi> makes use of, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 2. <hi>We shall see him as he is;</hi> and, <hi>He that hath this hope to see God, purifieth himself, even as he is part, ver.</hi> 3.

            <p n="2">2. Consider what you must expect while you are in your way; you must expect such troubles, as nothing will quiet you, but the exercise of Faith in Christ Jesus.

            <p n="3">3. Your troubles here, while you carry it with a Christian Spirit, they shall fit you for this blessed estate; as it is said 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 5. [<hi>He that worketh us to the self-same thing.</hi>] You may think God means evil to you, when you meet with affliction and trouble; but, provided you are <hi>in the way of Truth,</hi> or be it <hi>For the way of Truth,</hi> that which God ayms at, is to fit you for your Mansion-place. Christ would fit us to be in the body, and he would fit us to go out of the body; <hi>He works us to the self-same thing.</hi> If you have a strong body, he would fit you for that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to walk with him in that body. Saith <hi>Caleb,</hi> Josh. 14. 11. <hi>I have as strong a body, as in the day that Moses sent me.</hi> Now as it is a great matter to have such a body, so it is a great matter to walk with God in such a body: if you have an healthful body, he would fit you to walk with him in that body, that <hi>you may know how to possess your vessel in Sanctification and honour:</hi> not that your body should be the slave of filthy lusts. Suppose you have a sickly body, 2 Cor. 4. 16. <hi>Our outward man decayes, but our inward man is renewed day by day:</hi> and he <hi>worketh us to the self-same thing,</hi> by fitting us to go out of the body; <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 24. <hi>that I may finish my course with joy, and the Ministry that I have received.</hi>

out of the body, or to be in the body, close with him, as the Patient closeth with the Physician; interpret the Changes that are upon you, of one nature or of another, interpret them as dispensations whereby God works to fit you to be with him in the body, or to go to him when you go out of the body. Let us work together with him; <hi>I did it to humble them, Deut.</hi> 8. 16. then close with him, and say, This is his end; and for that end joyn with him. You shall finde more trouble then rest, while you are <hi>In the way;</hi> you shall finde more rest then trouble, when you are at the <hi>end of your way.</hi> You that are lovers of truth, more then of the pleasures of Sin, you shall finde more trouble then rest while you are in the way; but when you are out of the body, you shall have full rest without any trouble: you shall have Truth enough, and Peace enough. That which is hard to gain now, is Union in the Truth; but then you shall have Union enough, and Truth enough: you shall finde Christ making good that truth to you, that <hi>He will come, and receive you to himself.</hi> When <hi>Noah</hi> put forth his hand, and received the Dove into the Ark, it was a welcome ease: so will it be to your Souls when they have been wearied with so many troubles, and Christ Jesus shall come, <hi>and receive you to himself,</hi> when your Souls go out of the body; for otherwise the Devil will be ready to receive them, and to carry them to Hell. Whither went <hi>Dives</hi> Soul when it went out of his body? you that are now in Pleasures, whither went <hi>Dives</hi> Soul? it is not said he was an Adulterer, or a Drunkard; but he was a man of Pleasures, [<hi>In thy life time then hadst thy good things,</hi> Luke 16. 25.] But what became of his Soul when it went out of the body? <hi>And being in Hell, he lift up his eyes in torments, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 23. <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. when <hi>Joseph</hi> received <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his Brethren, after so long an absence, judge what a contentment there was: <hi>Jacob</hi> fell upon <hi>Josephs</hi> neck, and <hi>Joseph</hi> fell upon <hi>Jacobs</hi> neck: but their embraces are not to be mentioned with the embraces of Christ and the Soul. <hi>Do good, that when you dye, the good you have done may receive you into everlasting habitations.

                  <hi>Who serve unto the Example and shadow of Heavenly things; as</hi> Moses <hi>was admonished of God, when he was about to make the Tabernacle: for see (saith he) that thou make all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the patern shewed to thee in the Mount.</hi>

            <p>THis Verse illustrates the Argument mentioned in the foregoing words, from an adjunct, or accident ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the Legal Priest-hood: The Argument there used to prove that the Priest-hood of Christ excelled that priest-hood which was after the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> was, because they which were of that Priesthood ministred on Earth, but Christ ministreth in Heaven: He was a Minister of the true Tabernacle while he was on Earth, and he still officiates in his Priestly Office now he is in Heaven; the Tabernacle which they ministred in, was upon the Earth, and was made of earthly things, and it was a figure or shadow of heavenly things: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that that Tabernacle was a worldly Tabernacle or Sanctuary,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000090_0035_0FA0146C4DE98DD0"/>
1. From the quality of it; it was onely <hi>a shadow,</hi> or example <hi>of heavenly things,</hi> and it was a type; but Christ was a Minister of the true Tabernacle. 2. It is declared from the certainty of it, for He saith this: But how doth that appear? It appears from a Divine Testimony; <hi>For see (saith he) that thou make all things according to the Patern shewed to thee in the Mount.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the opening of the words. First, we are to consider what these heavenly things are: They are called in Chap. 9. 11. <hi>Good things to come.</hi> In a word, it means Christ, with all his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; these are the <hi>Heavenly things,</hi> that the other were but <hi>Shadows of.</hi> Therefore it is truely said, that the Ceremonial Law holds forth Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> it makes known the Gospel (being rightly understood) but after a Legal dispensation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it was <hi>a shadow of good things,</hi> i. e. it was a patern that did shadow out <hi>Heavenly things.</hi> God shewed <hi>Moses</hi> a Patern, or Type, in a Vision, according to which the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was to be farmed, and <hi>Moses</hi> acts accordingly. The word translated [<hi>Patern</hi>] intends as much as a likeness, or example, or a figure. As for the Divine Testimony, you may see it in <hi>Exodus</hi> 25. 9. <hi>According to all that I shew thee, after the patern of the Tabernacle, and the patern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.</hi> And in Chap. 39. this testimony is often given, that <hi>All things were done as the Lord had commanded Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> But Christ was the Minister of another Tabernacle, <hi>i. e.</hi> of his Body, the true Tabernacle.</p>
            <q>Doct. Great care must be had in matters of Divine Worship, (or Divine Administrations) that all things proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prescript Word of God. Or, That all things be exactly corresponding to the Prescript of Gods Word, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews 7. 14.</q>
            <p>For it is evident, that our Lord sprang out of <hi>Iudah,</hi> of which Tribe <hi>Moses</hi> spake nothing concerning the Priesthood. The Apostle thinks he argueth well, and conclusively, That Christ was not of the Levitical Order, because nothing was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning it of that Tribe. This is a good Argument in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000090_0036_0FA0146D8AFE1A28"/>
Divinity to say, That there is nothing in Gods Word why you should act such or such a thing: it is not enough to say that there is nothing expresly against it; the truth is, there is enough against it, if there be nothing for it. The Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> must not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the matters of the Priesthood: Why so? because <hi>Moses</hi> spake nothing of them in that respect: and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 9. <hi>Moses</hi> himself was to act nothing that he found not in the Patern. <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 30. <hi>And thou shalt rear up the Tabernacle according to the fashion thereof, which was shewed thee in the Mount:</hi> He must act nothing that he doth not finde in the Patern. It is true, <hi>David</hi> (for some just cause) made some alteration in the Worship of God; for the state of <hi>Temple-worship,</hi> compared with <hi>Tabernacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship,</hi> did call for a change. But how did <hi>David</hi> proceed in it? 1 Chron. 28. 19. <hi>All this</hi> (saith <hi>David) the Lord made me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand in writing, by his hand upon me, even all the works of this patern:</hi> He made no alteration in Gods Worship, but it was also by a Patern given to him by God. And for <hi>Solomon,</hi> you finde that <hi>David</hi> gave him the Patern, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. to build the Temple according thereunto. And relating to Gospel-times, the time of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, you have an eminent text in <hi>Ezek</hi> 43. 10,11. <hi>Thou Son of man, shew the house to the House of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities, and let them measure the patern; and if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because it is the acknowledgement of the Prerogative of Jesus Christ; I mean that he alone hath the honour to institute Divine Worship: He in truth was the Author of the Tabernacle, &amp; of the Temple and yet he was the Tabernacle, and the Temple, <hi>i. e.</hi> the true Tabernacle and Temple. The power of the Keyes, <hi>i. e.</hi> the instituted Worship under the Gospel, you shall finde Christ is the maker and disposer of those Keyes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. It is not for man to make a Key to open Heaven, he will never be able to pick that lock. <hi>Ye shall reverence my Sanctuary</hi> (saith God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 2.) and why so? <hi>I am the Lord:</hi> (make a pause here) <hi>i. e.</hi> it's no less then the Attribute of his Lordship that is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000090_0037_0FA0146F758435E8"/>
in the matters of his Worship: as for instance, <hi>Korah</hi> was very near unto the Priesthood, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 1. and yet inferiour to the Priesthood, (and it may be that was some tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him to be so near it, and yet inferiour to it) but he must not offer Incense, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 40. but the Priests, which are the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> may: Why may not <hi>Korah?</hi> the reason is, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> I will have this act to be matter of Divine Worship, and not another, and I will have this man to act, and not another; <hi>I am the Lord.</hi> Might not any man take a little perfume, and sprinkle it on the coals? No, God will institute what acts, and what persons he pleaseth. I have heard (I think) some say, that any man may adminster Baptism, or the Lords Supper; and I say it may be a Childe is able to do it: what then? But we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what God saith, <hi>I am the Lord;</hi> and he will be owned in his Institutions. <hi>Uzzah</hi> was a good man, yet he may not touch the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; why not? <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. It is one of the holy Institutions of God, <hi>Ye shall all reverence my Sanctuary.</hi> Hence it is, that to the holy things of God, reverence is a great part of duty: and if this or that be Gods Worship, remember Gods Lordship is in his own Institutions, and he will make a difference as he pleaseth: not that <hi>Aaron</hi> or <hi>Moses</hi> are better then others in themselves, they may be worse, but God will have his Lordship appear in these his holy things. Therefore it is that we must be conscientious in our reverence of the holy things of God, even in regard of bodily reverence by comely gestures, for <hi>our bodyes are the Lords,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. Hence [<hi>Sitting</hi>] is not a Prayer-gesture; it is true, if there be great weakness or infirmity of body, &amp;c. that may give an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for <hi>the Lord will have mercy,</hi> in case <hi>rather then Sacrifice.</hi> And therefore also it is that Christ stood up when he read the word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 16. and in <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>they stood up at the hearing of the Wordread.</hi> We should shew reverence at the holy things of God, because they are his Institutions, and <hi>he is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because in Divine Worship we acknowledge God to be our Soveraign Lord, and that we owe unto him absolute Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Obedience, and we acknowledge our selves to be his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Subjects. The act of Worship is an acknowledgement both
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000090_0038_0FA0146F805BC430"/>
of his Soveraignty, and of our meanness: <hi>Who am I, that am but dust and ashes, that I should take upon me to speak unto the Lord?</hi> Gen. 18. In acts of Worship we must exalt Christ, and depress man. Many in these dayes are against Forms, but in the mean time let us not forget Worship. For Israel to wait upon a Rock, was a despicable thing to the Nations; to see so many thousands come and stand about the Rock was strange, but that Rock was Christ: this is nothing else but the acknowledgement of God, who will be known in his own way. And this let me say, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that was not onely Man but God, attended the Ordinances while he was here on earth, and so did his Apostles: this is to shew the disevangelical spirit of those that do object against ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Worship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because Divine external Worship is a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring heavenly things. The Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven open or shut Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Naaman</hi> must know (if he be cured) whence the Cure comes; he must acknowledge the Waters of <hi>lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> and he must acknowledge the Prophet: God could have cured him without either, but he was not pleased so to do. You feed your Hens and Chickens, but you throw their meat upon the ground, and make them take it from thence: so God feeds us with heavenly food but we must receive it in a lowly manner. You can have no Faith to expect Gods blessing in any way but his own; any Institutions, so farre as they are Humane, you cannot have Faith for Gods blessing to go with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Instructions.</hi> 1. The Ceremonial Law understood, teacheth Christ; the truths of Christ are laid up under the types of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law. When you reade the Ceremonial Law, if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it, you would see Christ through it; as for instance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. the Tabernacle was a figure of Christs Body, and so was the Vail: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 20. when they went into the first Court, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the Incarnation of the Messias, and so when they looked on the Vail, &amp;c. they who looked on these types, whose eyes were opened, they saw Christ. Reade <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 15. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. 26. As Christ shed his blood, and so entred into Heaven, so the High-priest slew the Sacrifice, and then entred into the holy of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000090_0039_0FA0147057BE0890"/>
holies. And the efficacy of the Merit of Christ, was figured in the incense: this is to let us see, how clearly we are taught the same truths above what they of old were, comparing our times with theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Instr.</hi> 2. It is the part of those who are Conscientious, to keep themselves unto Scripture-bounds in holy, or Church-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. the Apostle would have them walk by a line (it relates to the Graecian exercises, to which the Apostle doth delight to allude:) it comes to one with that which the Apostle doth elsewhere say, (<abbr>

This was <hi>Moses</hi> his charge; <hi>See thou make all things according to the patern;</hi> and do you think there is not as much Conscience to be made of it now under the Gospel, to make all things according to the patern, as in the dayes of the Legal dispensation? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. <hi>Let all things be done according to Order:</hi> the case may be so, that though a thing be done, that is for the matter of it good, there may yet be more hurt in the disorder of it, then there is good in the doing of it. If we exercise our own Notions and Apprehensions in matters of Worship, this is Will-worship. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>In vain do they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship me, teaching for Doctrines the traditions of men.</hi> Mark the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position [<hi>Me,</hi>] and [<hi>Men</hi>]: can mens traditions be an act of Divine Worship?

If the Polity be according to the Gospel, Jesus Christ is there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Lord, and there is never a Member but is a Subject: there must be an Order, and according to that Order there must be subjection: do you think it an easy thing to be subject to Order?
