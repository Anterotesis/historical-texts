            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>ISAIAH LVII. 2.</bibl>
                  <p>He ſhall enter into peace: they ſhall reſt in their beds, each one walking in his uprightneſs.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives an account of the degeneracy and ſtupidity of the Times wherein he lived. <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart</hi>—They did not duly conſider the operation of God's Hand in taking away the Righteous by Death, nor were they ſuitably affected with it. They
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001927_0003_0FBA1CFF26D479B8"/>did nor diſcern the ſigns of the Times, nor would they obſerve the warning which God gave them of approaching Calamities, in the removal of ſuch as were Upright before God in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: <hi>None conſidering that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is taken away from the evil to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Second Verſe wherein is our Text, the Prophet comforts the People of God from the conſideration of the Peaceful End of the Upright, and of the Reſt which they enjoy after Death. <hi>He ſhall enter into peace:</hi> or, he ſhall go in peace; or as ſome read the Words, Peace ſhall come; <hi>to wit,</hi> to him. They go in peace when they leave this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome World; and their departed Spirits are refreſh'd and comforted in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſhall reſt in their beds.</hi> As their Souls are taken to a place of perfect Peace; ſo their Bodies are laid in the Grave where they ſhall reſt 'till the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="7 letters">
                  <desc>〈7 letters〉</desc>
               </gap>ction, when the ſhadows of Death
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001927_0004_0FBA1D0095AD02E0"/>ſhall be turn'd into the light of the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Here's a ſudden change of the number, which is not unuſual in the Prophets. <hi>Each one walking in his upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> or, that walketh uprightly, or in ſtraightneſs, making ſtraight paths in the way of God's Commandments, without declining to the right hand, or to the left. <hi>Before Him:</hi> So <hi>Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus,</hi> and others read the Word: i. e. before <hi>God;</hi> as in His ſight, and ſeeing Him who is Inviſible.</p>
            <p>In the Words we may obſerve, 1. The Character and Deſcription of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God: They walk in Uprightneſs. While they live they walk with God in Sincerity, ordering their ſteps according to the rules laid down in His Word. 2. We have the Privilege and Bleſſedneſs of ſuch aſſerted and deſcribed: <hi>He ſhall enter into peace: They ſhall reſt in their beds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Words there is contained this <hi>Doctrine,</hi>

               <q>The People of God, who walk in their Uprightneſs while they Live, ſhall enter into Peace, and reſt in their Graves, as in Beds, when they Die.</q>

               <p>PROP. II. <hi>It is their Happineſs, that they ſhall enter into Peace, and reſt in their Graves, as in Beds, when they Die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PROP. I. <hi>It is the Character of the Children of God that they walk in their Uprightneſs.</hi> Every true Believer, who is a Child of God by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, is a perfect and upright Man. Under this Propoſition, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhow what is implied in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Uprightneſs, and ſo explain and illuſtrate this Character.</p>

Here we may obſerve, that this Word as uſed in the Scriptures, is of much the ſame import with Perfection. Sincerity, Integrity. As it is here uſed, it can't intend <hi>Sinleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> We read, Eccl. 7.29. <hi>God hath made man upright; but they have ſought out many inventions.</hi> The Word for Man is <hi>Adam.</hi> God made our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <hi>right</hi> in ſinleſs Perfection: But <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd, and we in him. And ſince the Fall all are conceiv'd in ſin, and go aſtray from the Womb. And there is no Man but hath the remains of this Original Corruption abiding in him. The Law which is the rule of Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, and an Eternal rule of Righteouſneſs demands perfect Obedience, and threatens the Curſe upon the leaſt defect. Gal. 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> And therefore the Pſalmiſt deprecates <hi>God's being ſtrict to mark ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001927_0007_0FBA28AFF87E72B8"/>Pſal. 143.2. The holieſt Men that ever lived had Sin remaining in them. <hi>Noah</hi> was a juſt Man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot in his Generations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. And yet he was overtaken with the Sin of Drunkenneſs. <hi>Job</hi> was perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: And yet he makes that confeſſion, Job 9.20. <hi>If I juſtify my ſelf, mine own mouth ſhall condemn me: if I ſay I am perfect, it ſhall alſo prove me perverſe.</hi> How paſſionately doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> There was never any Man ſince the Fall, excepting the Man CHRIST JESUS, (who is GOD as well as Man) perſectly free from Sin. Indeed God is ſaid to ſee no iniquity in <hi>Jacob,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt covers all the Sins of His People; God beholds no iniquity in them ſo as to impute it. However, all want of conformity to, or tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, is Sin, under the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001927_0008_0FBA28B1496E42C8"/>Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> as well as under the Covenant of <hi>Works:</hi> But here is the difference; the Sins of Believers do not expoſe them to the condemnation of the Law, and to the Sword of Vindictive Juſtice; becauſe their Surety hath born their iniquities, &amp; made Reconciliation for them. The Children of God know but in part, and are ſanctified but in part. Eccl. 7.20. <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth that doeth good and ſinneth not.</hi> While they live in this World they ſin daily, and therefore they live a life of Repentance and Godly Sorrow, and muſt daily go to that <hi>Fountain which is ſet open to the houſe of David,—for ſin and for uncleanneſs.</hi> The beſt Men upon Earth come ſhort in every duty: None are able perfectly to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. Their houſes of Clay muſt be pulled down, before the leproſy of Sin will be wholly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and their Souls muſt be ſeparated from their Bodies by Death, before they
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001927_0009_0FBA28B2E4020098"/>can attain the ſpotleſs purity of <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt Men made perfect.</hi> The brighteſt Lights that ever ſhone in the Church Militant have had their ſpots.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak Poſitively.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Walking in uprightneſs preſuppoſeth this, that the Dominion of ſin is deſtroyed in God's People, and the image of God, in all the Graces of the Spirit, is created in them.</hi> Every Child of God is renew'd in the whole Man, after His Image. All the Divine Laws muſt be written on our hearts by the Finger of God, and we muſt be ſet right with God, or our ways can't be upright before Him. Every Man is by nature under the dominion of luſt, and the way of ſin is the way of his own heart. And therefore unleſs God <hi>create in us a clean heart, and renew within us a right ſpirit;</hi> it is as much impoſſible for us to walk in uprightneſs, as it is for the Dead to ariſe and walk. The motion of natural Bodies is according to their principle, and the laws impreſs'd
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001927_0010_0FBA28B4DCF1F920"/>upon them. And thus the motions of the Soul in moral actions are according to the biaſs that is upon it. While our inclinations are <hi>corrupt,</hi> our ways will be <hi>unclean.</hi> While we are governed by the law in our members, we can't walk in uprightneſs. This doth therefore neceſſarily ſuppoſe that the People of God <hi>are renewed in the ſpirit of their minds;</hi> being deliver'd from the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin. Their Underſtandings are ſavingly enlightened to ſee the path of Life; their Wills renew'd, ſo that they chuſe the ways of God's Teſtimonies: their Affections ſanctified, and by them their Souls are forwarded in the way of God's Commandments. Thus every Power is reſcued from the bondage of <hi>Corruption;</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> takes poſſeſſion of every faculty. The image of God is engraven on the hearts of His Children in every line of it. There is an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and perfection of parts in the new Man: For of Chriſt's fulneſs they receive
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001927_0011_0FBA28B6EBCF1A68"/>and Grace for Grace; tho' it be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as to degrees. And tho' every luſt remains in ſome degree, yet there is no luſt but what is caſt down from it's u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped Throne. Every Child of God is born of the Spirit, and is denominated from his better part, a <hi>perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Man.</hi> All old things are paſs'd away, and all things are become new.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Walking in uprightneſs intends that we make the Word of God our Rule in our way, &amp; have a reſpect to all His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The Upright endeavour that their obedience may be extended in ſome good meaſure, in proportion to the breadth of God's Law; and none of God's Commands are grievous to them. They delight in the <hi>whole</hi> Law, and are obedient to every Precept in it; they make Conſcience not only of obeying thoſe Commands which immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect God, but alſo of thoſe which reſpect their Neighbour. They neither ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Tables of the Law, nor daſh them
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001927_0012_0FBA28BB71A5DAA8"/>in pieces one againſt another. They do not pick &amp; chuſe, and ſay, Theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands we will do, thoſe we will leave undone; but earneſtly deſire that their hearts may be directed to keep all God's Commandments. They allow not themſelves in the omiſſion of any known duty. Secret as well as open duties bear the ſtamp of the Divine Authority, and therefore are impartially regarded by them. The Children of God take His Word for a <hi>light to their feet, and a lamp to their path.</hi> In the Law of God our duty is marked out to us, and the way to Bleſſedneſs laid out before us; and therefore the Upright do take care to walk in the Law of the Lord, and dare not allow themſelves in paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe lines and bounds which their Lawgiver hath ſet and deſcribed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. They make it their buſineſs to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Converſation according to this Law of Liberty. They take the Word of God for their directory, and worſhip
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001927_0013_0FBA28BC89818860"/>Him according to His own Inſtitutions and Appointments. They labour to underſtand the Orders and Ordinances of God's Houſe as revealed in His Word, and keep cloſe to them. In a Word, the <hi>Grace</hi> of God which hath appeared to them in the Goſpel, teaches them to live ſoberly righteouſly and godly in this preſent evil World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Walking in uprightneſs intends that we hate every falſe way.</hi> The upright do not allow themſelves to walk in any forbidden path, or to turn aſide to the crooked ways of ſin. There is no way of wickedneſs, tho' it ſeem to be never ſo pleaſant and gainful; but what they heartily deſire to forſake. They lay aſide the ſin that doth <hi>moſt eaſily beſet them,</hi> and thro' the Spirit they mortify the deeds of the Fleſh, even thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved luſts, which their Conſtitution, Employment, or Coverſation might moſt incline them to. Pſal. 18.23. <hi>I was alſo upright before him: and I kept my ſelf</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001927_0014_0FBA28BE85EED450"/>
                  <hi>from mine iniquity.</hi> They are cleans'd from <hi>ſecret faults,</hi> and kept back from <hi>preſumptuous ſins,</hi> ſo that they have not dominion over them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Walking in uprightneſs intends that Believers do walk as being ſenſible that God's Eye is upon them, and as ſeeing Him who is Inviſible.</hi> We have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that ſome tranſlate the Word, <hi>before Him.</hi> They order their Life and Converſation under a realizing view of the Preſence of God. They believe that truth, Prov. 15.3. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good.</hi> And they act as of ſincerity in the ſight of God. The <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is ready to ſay in his heart, <hi>Doth God know, can he judge through the dark cloud.</hi> But the Upright Man makes that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Faith, Pſal. 139.3. <hi>Thou compaſseſt my path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</hi> And this belief of the Omniſcience and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence of GOD governs him in his
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001927_0015_0FBA28C0A9456630"/>walk, and makes him take care to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himſelf to God, by having his Converſation <hi>in ſimplicity &amp; godly ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> The Children of God do live in Obedience to that command, Gen. 17.1. <hi>I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and he thou perject.</hi> They live and act under this apprehenſion, that they are continually in the preſence of that God who is their Judge and Rewarder: And therefore they deſire <hi>truth in the inward parts,</hi> and ſee to it that the inward tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and frame of their minds be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their outward profeſſion. By Faith they ſee Him who is Inviſible to ſenſe. They are ſenſible that He ſees all their tho'ts afar off, and therefore walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly. They behold God in His Providential Diſpenſations, wherein He paſſeth before them; and they labour to keep their eyes fixed upon Him in all their ways, and to act as in His ſight. This is to walk in Uprightneſs; and ſuch may appeal to God and ſay with
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001927_0016_0FBA28C51A84C1E0"/>
                  <hi>Hezekiah, Lord thou knoweſt that I have walked with an upright heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Walking in uprightneſs implies that we have upright Aims and Intentions in our Lives and Actions.</hi> Believers do make the Glory of God their chief and ultimate end. As far as we are ſincere and upright we have a ſingle eye and pure aims; and labour to move in a direct and ſtraight line to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that glorious End, the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's Honour. In this reſpect, <hi>Their eyes look right on, and their eye-lids look ſtraight before them,</hi> as Prov. 4.25. The Upright ſeek to promote God's Glory in all their ways: <hi>Whether they eat or drink, or whatever they do, they do all to the Glory of God.</hi> And endeavour to ſubordinate their inferiour intereſts to this grand Deſign.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>It intends that they act thus in the whole courſe of their Lives.</hi> A Man's way is that which he accuſtoms himſelf to. Agreably, to walk in uprightneſs,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001927_0017_0FBA28C64F276118"/>is to be upright at all times, and under all circumſtances. Integrity and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs do preſerve God's People in all company, in all conditions of life, and in every affair they engage in. This is the way and manner of their life. They are upright in a conſtant and continued courſe of actions. In the frame and tenour of their lives they are upright, exerciſing themſelves in this, to <hi>keep a Conſcience void of offence both towards God and towards Men.</hi> Indeed the Upright Man may fall once and again. They do ſometimes go out of the way of God's Commandments; but then they do not <hi>walk</hi> in the counſel of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor <hi>ſtand</hi> in the way of ſinners. Tho' they fall ſeven times, yet they riſe again by Repentance, and return unto the Lord. The Upright are ſteady and conſtant in walking in the path of God's Commandments; they perſevere in their duty till they finiſh their courſe, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the end of their Faith. Pſal. 119.33.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001927_0018_0FBA28C7C96EEAC0"/>
                  <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy ſtatutes, and I ſhall keep it unto the end.</hi> Thus we have briefly conſidered a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, to illuſtrate the Character which is here given of the Righteous, when it is ſaid, That <hi>each one of them walketh in his uprightneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PROP. II. <hi>It is their Happineſs that they ſhall enter into Peace, and reſt in their Graves, as in Beds.</hi> We proceed now to conſider the Privilege &amp; Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Upright.</p>
               <p>In this World God's Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Righteous and Wicked is very promiſcuous, ſo that no man knoweth love or hatred by all that is before them. Eccl. 9.2. <hi>All things come alike to all.</hi> There is one event to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and to the wicked— Job 9.22. <hi>He deſtroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</hi> The Upright muſt die as well as the Sinner, and to an eye of ſenſe, the Righteous periſheth; But then, <hi>Precious
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001927_0019_0FBA28CD1C3826D0"/>in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi> When they go the way of all the Earth, they go in Peace. Every Upright Man is a Son of Peace. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed Peace for His People, and that in the moſt comprehenſive ſenſe of the word, and He will beſtow it upon them. Pſal. 84.11. <hi>For the Lord God is a ſun and ſhield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> When our SAVIOUR was about to leave this World He bequeath'd Peace to His Diſciples as a rich Legacy. Joh. 14.27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,</hi>— The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is our Peace-maker. Col. 1.20.—<hi>Having made peace thro' the blood of his Croſs—The chaſtiſements of our Peace were upon Him.</hi> He who is the Fathers only begotten Son, in whom He is ever well pleaſed; was bruiſed and wounded for the tranſgreſſions of His People, that God might with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001927_0020_0FBA28CF92088420"/>to all His Attributes, receive them into favour, and embrace them in the Arms of His Everlaſting Love. God hid His Face from Him for a time, when He uttered that ſtrong and vehement Cry, <hi>My God! My God! Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Now, this was that His People might enjoy the manifeſtations of His Love, and walk up and down in the light of His Countenance.</p>
               <p>And as our Lord Died to purchaſe this great and comprehenſive Good for His People; ſo He ever Lives to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to them. Now He is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, He doth not leave them Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; but comes unto them in the holy Influences and Conſolations of His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who is the Comforter. All Divine Peace is laid up in Him, He is the <hi>proton decticon,</hi> the firſt Recipient; God hath anointed Him with the Oyl of gladneſs <hi>above his fellows,</hi> and from Him who is the Head this flows down to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of His Myſtical Body, as the Oyl
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001927_0021_0FBA28D0CEE5B498"/>that anointed the Head of <hi>Aaron</hi> ran down to the skirts of his Garments. In His light they ſee light. <hi>Being juſtify'd by Faith they have Peace with God.</hi> Being deliver'd from the guilt and bondage of Sin, they have peace of Conſcience and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; And thro' Chriſt become Heirs to the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. Thus I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhow the ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Peace which the Righteous do and ſhall enjoy. I proceed to ſpeak more directly to the Propoſition before us, in a few Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes God gives unto the Upright abundance of peace, and more than ordinary tranquillity of mind towards the end of their lives; ſo that they finiſh their courſe with Joy.</hi> God reſerves the beſt Wine 'till laſt, and gives the Upright ſtrong and refreſhing Cordials when they lie upon a Death-Bed, and ſtand in moſt need of them. Thus it is ſometimes, and it may be many times, when thro' their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001927_0022_0FBA28D251D58D40"/>others can't obſerve, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with their Joy. As they draw nigh to the borders of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> God ſometimes takes them up into the Mount, and gives them ſuch taviſhing views of that better Country, as make them even deſire to paſs over <hi>Jordan,</hi> that they may poſſeſs it. Phil. 1.23. <hi>Having a deſire to depart</hi>— It may be they have walked in darkneſs; but <hi>at evening there is light.</hi> They are ſometimes enabled to ſay with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Tho' I walk thro' the valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaff they comfort me,</hi> Pſal. 23, 4. Thus God lets His Servants depart in Peace, and they finiſh their courſe with joy.</p>
               <p>To be ſure, The Upright Die in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of favour and friendſhip with God thro' Jeſus Chriſt. Suppoſe God ſhould hide His Face in the hour of Death; yet ſtill He is their God; <hi>they die in the Lord,</hi> and therefore there Death is ſafe. There's
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001927_0023_0FBA28D8D4C32F80"/>not one drop of vindictive Wrath in this bitter cup. Their Saviour hath <hi>taſted death for them, and thro' death hath deſtroyed him, which had the power of death, that is the Devil;</hi> and therefore Death can't do them any real harm. They go in Peace when they leave the World, whatever doubts and fears may cloud their minds in the hour of Death; and even theſe ſhall all vaniſh away as the morning Cloud, when their Souls are ſeparated from their Bodies. Which leads me to the Second thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>After Death the departed Spirits of the Upright do enter into Peace, and enjoy undiſturbed Reſt in the Paradiſe of God.</hi> The troubles of good Men and their lives end together. Death is a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Peace unto them, and brings them the joyful news, <hi>that there Warfare is accompliſhed.</hi> When an Upright Man Dies, God diſmiſseth Him to Reſt, and ſpeaks to him in the voice of His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 12.13.—
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001927_0024_0FBA28DA8A5395D0"/>
                  <hi>Go thou thy way till the end be: for thou ſhalt reſt</hi>—. The faithful Servants of God who have born the heat and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the day, and have been worn out almoſt with hard labours and bitter ſufferings, find eaſe and refreſhment at Death. Not as if the Souls of Believers were then laid aſleep in a ſtato of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity; or did wholly ceaſe from buſineſs; No! No! They live and act, in a ſeparate ſtate. They go to God, and joyn an <hi>innumerable company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the general Aſſembly and Church of the firſt born,</hi> in praiſing and glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in his Temple above. As the Four Animals, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>They reſt not day and night, ſaying, Holy, Holy Holy, Lord God Almighty</hi>—: But then they enter into Peace, inaſmuch as they are delivered from all thoſe hardſhips and difficulties which attend the ſervice of God in this Life; in that they are deliver'd from all the calamities of this preſent evil World, and receiv'd to a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001927_0025_0FBA28DC22894B18"/>place of inconceivable Delight and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment; to the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where the <hi>Prince of Peace</hi> reigns, and they enjoy <hi>Viſions of Peace.</hi> The Souls of Men don't periſh with their Bodies; Death can't kill the Soul. The Man dies, the vital Union between the Soul and Body being diſſolved; and then the Body <hi>is ſown in Corruption.</hi> But the Soul is an indiviſible, immaterial, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Subſtance. Indeed the Souls of Men depend on God for their continuance; in Him they live and move and have their Being. God alone hath <hi>Immortality</hi> independently. But then they have no principles of Corruption in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; no created power can deſtroy them. Mat. 10.28. <hi>And fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul.</hi> This Truth, that the Souls of Believers do live, act and enjoy, in a ſeparate ſtate; is written as with a Sun-beam in the Holy Scriptures. 2 Cor. 5.8. <hi>We are confident, I ſay, and willing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001927_0026_0FBA28DE05E42DC0"/>rather to be abſent from the body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord.</hi> Luk. 23.43. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Verily, I ſay unto thee, To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> Heb. 12.22, 23. <hi>But ye are come unto Mount Sion,—and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt Men, made perfect.</hi> Phil. 1.23.—<hi>Having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt; which is far better.</hi> There is a double compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the Original, word for word, <hi>by much more better.</hi> Theſe and many other Texts of Scripture do plainly declare that the Spirits of the Saints do exiſt in a ſeparate ſtate.</p>
               <p>Under this Second Particular, I ſhall mention a few things briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>When the Upright die they enter into Peace, all their painful Labours being at an end.</hi> At Death they accompliſh as an hireling their day, and go to reap the precious fruits, and receive the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious rewards of their Labours. They are then releas'd from the burden of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001927_0027_0FBA28E02CF36688"/>their <hi>Secular Employments:</hi> There is much toil and fatigue in our particular Callings. God ſaid unto <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, Gen. 3.19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat Bread,</hi>—But now at Death Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are call'd off to higher Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein they exerciſe themſelves, being altogether free from care, and pain, and wearineſs. Again, The People of God meet with many difficulties, and great oppoſition <hi>in working out their Salvation. Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leads unto life,</hi>—Mat. 7.14. It is a perplexed, afflicted, perſecuted Way. We muſt <hi>Agonize,</hi> as the word us'd, Luk. 13.24. ſignifieth. We muſt wreſtle, ſight, endure hardneſs—. But at Death the Saints reſt from theſe toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Labours. Rev. 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord,—that they may reſt from their labours; and their works do follow them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>At Death the Upright enter into Peace, being perfectly deliver'd from the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001927_0028_0FBA28E48F9165B8"/>body of death.</hi> In this life they have the remains of <hi>ſin</hi> in them, as we have heard. They ſee a <hi>law in their members, warring againſt the law of their mind</hi>—; They ſigh and groan to be wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from <hi>the bondage of Corruption.</hi> The Sins of Believers do many times diſturb their peace. Sometimes they provoke God by their iniquities to bide His Face from them, and to write bitter things againſt them. Pſal. 38.3. <hi>There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh becauſe of thine anger: neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin.</hi> ver. 8. <hi>I have roared by reaſon of the diſquietneſs of my heart.</hi> But after Death they will no more complain that their Sins interpoſe as a thick cloud, and hide the light of God's Countenance from them. No more ſhall they be bowed down heavily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of their Sins; but their Spirits being made perfect in Holineſs, they <hi>ſhall be preſented faultleſs before the preſence of God's glory with exceeding joy.</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001927_0029_0FBA28E5D30FBAF0"/>While they are in this World, there are two contrary Principles in them, ſtriving for the maſtery. Gal. 5.17. <hi>For the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh</hi>—. It is impoſſible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they ſhould enjoy perfect <hi>peace,</hi> while their Souls are the ſeat of <hi>war.</hi> But at Death the Graces of the Spirit obtain a compleat victory over Sin, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in Glory. Now they complain that <hi>when they would do good, evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;</hi> but in Heaven they will ſerve God continually without the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation from this enemy. And as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors</hi> they ſhall ſit down with Chriſt on His Throne, as he Overcame and ſat down with His Father on His Throne.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>At Death the Upright enter into Peace, being deliver'd from Satan, and wicked Men.</hi> The Devil is the <hi>Tempter</hi> and <hi>Accuſer</hi> of the Brethren. He hates the Children of God, envies them their Happineſs, and doth his utmoſt to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſturb them in their way to it.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001927_0030_0FBA28E74682F248"/>Indeed this roaring Lion who goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeeking whom he may devour, ſhall never be able to deſtroy ſo much as one of theſe little Ones, who put their truſt in Chriſt. However while they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, he buſſets them with his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſhoots his fiery darts at them, and when permitted, raiſeth Storms of Perſecution againſt them. But now at Death God ſends His Holy Angels to convoy the departed Spirits of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thro' the darkneſs of this World; and theſe Spiritual wickedneſſes in high places, ſhall not be able to annoy them in their paſſage. To be ſure, this foul Serpent can't enter the Heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, to tempt God's People. Their Adverſary the Devil ſhall never be able to ſhoot an arrow into the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above. At Death, the God of Peace doth in an eminent manner bruiſe Satan under their feet. Again, The Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right are at Death delivered from wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ungodly Men. Theſe are the rod
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001927_0031_0FBA28EBBACD2D48"/>of God's Anger whereby He oftentimes chaftiſeth His own Children. They ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times have reaſon to complain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as the Pſalmiſt did, Pſal. 120.5,—7. <hi>Wo is me that I ſojourn in Meſech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar. My ſoul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. There is enmity between the ſeed of the Woman and the ſeed of the Serpent.</hi> Wicked Men who are ſet on Fire of Hell, do perſecute God's People; tear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Lambs of Chriſt's Flock. But their power extends no further then this life. At Death <hi>the wicked ceaſe from troubling;</hi> And the Upright ſhall have dominion over them <hi>in the Morning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>After Death the Upright enter into Peace, being joyn'd with the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect in the Buſineſs and Enjoyments of Heaven.</hi> When they Die they are carried by Angels into <hi>Abraham's</hi> boſom, where they are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. They ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in their Father's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001927_0032_0FBA28ECB64301A8"/>When they remove from this World, where they are Strangers and Pilgrims, they go to dwell in that City of the Living God, where they enjoy a <hi>peaceable Habitation, ſure Dwellings, and quiet Reſting Places;</hi> in that City which hath no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it; for the Glory of God doth enlighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. There they are before the Throne, and ſerve him in His Temple: And He that ſitteth on the Throne dwells among them. The Lamb who is in the midſt of the Thorne ſeeds them, and leads them unto living Waters; and God wipes away all tears from their Eyes. Thus they wait in a certain hope, and joyful Expectation for the redemption of their Bodies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Bodies of the Upright de Reſt in their Graves, as in Beds, when they die.</hi> Sleep is the image of Death; and Death is in Scripture frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard'd to Sleep. Deut. 31.16. <hi>And the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001927_0033_0FBA28F00F5B6968"/>Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Behold, thou ſhalt ſleep with thy Fathers</hi>— Joh. 11.11. Our friend Lazarus <hi>ſleepeth</hi>— ver. 13.— Jeſus ſpake of his <hi>death</hi>—. When the Children of God leave this World, they enter into their Chambers. Their Souls return to the Lord, and enjoy Peace in the preſence of God, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy heard; And their Bodies do reſt in the Grave, which is <hi>the Houſe appointed for all living.</hi> Job 17.13. <hi>If I wait, the grave is mine houſe; I have made my bed in the darkneſs.</hi> ver. 16. —<hi>When our reſt together is in the duſt.</hi> While they are in this World, they ſometimes complain with Job, 7.4. <hi>When I lye down, I ſay, when ſhall I ariſe? — and I am full of toſſings to and fro to the dawning of the day.</hi> But after Death, their Bodies are at reſt, free from pain and all uneaſineſs. At Death the bodily Organs ceaſe to diſcharge their reſpective offices. The <hi>Eyes</hi> ſee not, the <hi>Ears</hi> hear not, the <hi>Hands</hi> handle not, the <hi>Feet</hi> move not.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001927_0034_0FBA28F11BB4E540"/>There is no work in the Grave. At Death the Night comes wherein no Man can work, and the People of God go to reſt; they are put to Bed in the ſilent Grave, free from the noiſe and hurry of this preſent Life: There they lie ſtill and are quiet; they ſleep and are at reſt. And in the Morning of the Reſurrection they ſhall awake, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe with freſh vigour. We lie down in our beds at Night, that our exhauſted ſpirits may be recruited, and that we may with renewed ſtrength engage in the buſineſs of the Day. Agreably, When the Bodies of God's Children are laid in their Graves, it is in order to their ariſing recruited and refreſhed at the laſt Day. The bars of the Pit ſhall not be about them forever. No, No. At the time appointed in God's Unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Decree, He will call, and they ſhall anſwer, He will have a deſire to the work of his Hands. Then the Upright <hi>who ſleep in the duſt of the Earth
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001927_0035_0FBA28F378892118"/>ſhall awake to Everlaſting Life.</hi> The Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe. The dead Bodies of the Saints ſhall <hi>ariſe and ſhine, with the Glory of the Lord ariſen upon them,</hi> ſtrengthned to the Work and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the Heavenly World. Then their glorious change ſhall come. For <hi>their vile bodies ſhall be chang'd, and faſhioned like to Chriſt's Glorious Body.</hi> And then ſhall they behold God's Face in righteouſneſs: they ſhall be ſatisfied, when they awake, with His likeneſs. Their Bodies will then be redeem'd from the power of the Grave. Their <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> ſhall put on <hi>Incorruption,</hi> their Mortal Immortality, and Death ſhall be ſwallowed up in Victory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>After the Reſurrection the Upright, their whole Man, Soul and Body, being glorified, ſhall enter into perfect Peace, and enjoy Everlaſting Reſt in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly World.</hi> At Death their departed Spirits enter into the joy of their Lord. At the Day of Judgment, their Souls
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001927_0036_0FBA28F4CDD1A0D0"/>and Bodies being reunited; they ſhall be openly acknowledged and acquitted; And when the Buſineſs of the Great Day is finiſhed, they ſhall aſcend with their Glorious Redeemer, and ever be with the Lord. Then God will open the Gates of the Heavenly Jeruſalem, and the Righteous ſhall have an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and triumphant Entrance into that high and holy Place, where they ſhall be kept in perfect Peace for ever and ever. <hi>There is a Reſt which remains for the People of God</hi> in Heaven, an Eternal and uninterrupted Sabbatiſm. There are <hi>Manſions of Glory</hi> prepared for them, and when they are ſix'd and ſettled in them, they will dwell at eaſe, and move no more. There God's Countenance will be hold the Upright with the greateſt complacency, and they ſhall rejoyce in the Lord with an exceeding great Joy. There they ſhall have the full Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the God of Peace, and in His Preſence obtain <hi>Fulneſs of Joy, and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001927_0037_0FBA28FBEAE88710"/>Pleaſures for ever more.</hi> God the Father will embrace them in the Arms of His Everlaſting Love; God the Son will dwell with them, and they ſhall behold His Glory; God the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Glory, ſhall reſt upon them, and fill them with Grace and Comfort. The Kingdom of God in <hi>this World</hi> is Righteouſneſs and Peace; what then ſhall the Kingdom of <hi>Glory</hi> be? Then they will Reſt indeed; for all their wants ſhall be fully ſupplied, their deſires perfectly ſatisfied, and their Bleſſedneſs conſummated. In Heaven they will have the cleareſt Knowlege of God, of His Glorious Perfections, and Counſels and Works; particularly, they will have a moſt raviſhing view of the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and myſterious Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in its perfection and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. Then they will reach the Centre of their wiſhes, hopes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and therefore they will Reſt. There will be nothing to hinder them from the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001927_0038_0FBA28FDCDFB3940"/>perfect exerciſe of their Graces. They will act and enjoy in the moſt perfect manner, all their Powers being exerted in the Service of God, and being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly ſatisfied in Him. I might go on, and ſay, They will then be made <hi>Equal to the Angels</hi> in Heaven, and meet Companions for thoſe Glorified Spirits. They will then enjoy the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> in its full beauty and perfection. At preſent there remain much ſin and imperfection in the beſt, which is apt to weaken the Union, and diſturb the Peace of the moſt holy Societies upon Earth. But in Heaven all the hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace will be done away, and the Children of God will be of <hi>one Heart,</hi> and <hi>one Soul.</hi> There will be no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in opinion, no diſtance in affection, their knowlege &amp; love being perfected. There are no miſunderſtandings, no ill humours, no envy, no uncharitable jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies among the <hi>Saints in Light.</hi> 
                  <q>The Millions of Celeſtial Inhabitants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

The Church Catholick ſhall then <hi>be preſented a Glorious Church,</hi> and her Glory ſhall never fade away. Certainly then the Upright ſhall enter into Peace, and enjoy it in the moſt comprehenſive ſenſe.</p>

Certainly it is thy Duty and Intereſt ſo to be. Yea furthermore, if God in His Providence ſhould call you to ſuffer Affliction, it becomes you to bear His Hand with a quiet Submiſſion, neither repining nor fainting when rebuked of Him; For theſe Troubles which are <hi>for the preſent not joyous but grievous, ſhall yield the peaceable fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>

               <p>A Perſon of this Character, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Major-General WINTHROP, was carried to his Sepulchre the laſt Week.

He was a principal Founder of this Town, and of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001927_0045_0FBA2912DBA0B930"/>this Province, where he was for many Years Elected Governour, and Died while inveſted with that Authority.</p>
