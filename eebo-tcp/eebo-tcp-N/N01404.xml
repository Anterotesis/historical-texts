            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Surely can any body be ſo bold as from this Text to ſay that the Apoſtle made a common practice of Preaching for Wages, as our modern Prieſts do now a days? I hope, no Chriſtian will imagin from thoſe words of the Apoſtle that he was a Thief, or a Sacrilegious perſon, but only a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſpeech which he uſed to thoſe

whom he loved, as in v. 11. is plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. It is a familiar way of expreſſion among our gſelves where we know we may be free when any thing is given to us from our Friend. Oh I ſhall Rob thee too muche to put any other conſtruction upon the Apoſtle's words would be to make the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle a Sacrilegious perſon and a Robber which is abſurd. But pray let him ſpeak fairly a little for himſelf and he will wipe of theſe Money loving Prieſts very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly. v. 7. <hi>I have,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Preached to you the Goſpel of God freely.</hi> Oh that curting word <hi>freely</hi> what ſhall we do with it? tho' it was ſo near our legal Miniſter yet he thought fit not to medle with it and in the 9th. verſe (juſt under, as the 7th. juſt above, by which the poor man is hedged in, how he will get out I know not) the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>and when I was preſent with you and wanted I was chorgeable to no men,</hi> And tells them in the ſame verie that he kept himſelf from being burthenſome to them, and that he reſolved to keep himſelf ſo. We dare all thoſe that Preach for hire, and have money for Divining to come to ſuch a reſolution. However if they will

            <p>He goes on, and endeavours to animate and ſtir up the Magiſtrates to Perſecution, by inſinuating that thoſe who for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake cannot give any thing to the Prieſts, are evil, unjuſt and wicked perſons; who notwithſtanding take them in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way and their converſations are as juſt as the brighteſt of their Church Members, as divers of themſelves are forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
            <p>If for this teſtimony to our Innocency, any ſhould imagine we boaſt, it's he, and ſuch as he that are the occaſion of this confident boaſting, and we have our Great Apoſtle even <hi>Paul</hi> for our example.</p>
            <p>Now I hope the Magiſtrates will take care how they Perſecute the juſt and turn the edge of their Swords againſt the evil doers: and then doubtleſs they will not
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001669_0039_0FB4E338C616AF70"/>
bear their Swords in vain, and then let the edge of it be as ſharp and keen as it will, we fear it not: for againſt true men there is no Law which is upon a juſt Baſis or foundation that will harm them.</p>
            <p>Now I tenderly and lovingly, as a Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter of Jeſus Chriſt and true Lover of good Government, exhort and warn all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to be careful to keep within their own Province: for <hi>Conſcience</hi> is none of theirs; it is the peculiar Province of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the Great Territores of the King of Kings and Judge of the Quick and Dead; and he will render unto every man a Recompence.</p>
            <p>Now if Conſcience were only a Cloak for Covetouſneſs it ought to be ſtript off, but it is plain that T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
