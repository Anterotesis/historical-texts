            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                              <p>I was call'd to <hi>Albany</hi> this Winter by a double Obligation, my Duty to His moſt ſacred Majeſty, in diſcharge of that Truſt he has been graciouſly pleaſed to put into my hands, and my Affection to his Subjects of that City, who by Addreſs deſired my Preſence with them.</p>

                              <p>I therefore reſolved to make <hi>Albany</hi> my Winter Quarter, looking upon it not only as a Barrier to this Province, but to other Colonies of his Majeſties Empire in <hi>America.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>My Paſſage met with ſome Difficulties by an early Winter, being twice drove aſhore by the Ice, and at laſt lockt up by it; yet I made the Journey in twelve days, though with ſome extraordinary Expence, being neceſſitated to travel part of the way by Land, with a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my own Company.</p>
                              <p>Coll. <hi>Schuyler,</hi> who commands the Militia in thoſe parts, and ſpeaks the Language, was very active in procuring Waggons and other Aſſiſtance, (as Sleas for bringing up Field Pieces, ſmall Arms, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which could not be done gratis.</p>
                              <p>The Journey had the effect I expected, ſome Families who deſigned to remove, upon the report of my coming, ſtaid, by which the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon was much ſtrengthened.</p>
                              <p>I obſerved in all the Inhabitants, great zeal for his Majeſties ſervice: they were cheerful in the performance of their Duty, watchful and vigilant upon thoſe Guards committed to their care.</p>
                              <p>The Inhabitants are ſome-what ſtraitned by quartering his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Companys; the Houſes are ſmall, fitted only for the conveniency of their own Families; if Barrachs were built (which will be no great Charge) the Inhabitants would be eaſed, Souldiers better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, Deſertion eaſier prevented, and the City better fortified.</p>
                              <p>And as you have hitherto ſhewed great regard for his Majeſties Service, in taking care as well for recruiting, as better ſubſiſting, thoſe Companys, ſo I hope you will continue in the good mind of eaſing the Inhabitants, by accommodating the Souldiers.</p>
                              <p>Your laſt gratuity to them had ſuch influence, that not one man has deſerted ſince.</p>
                              <p>I deſire you'll appoint ſome of your Houſe to look into thoſe Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which you'll ſee, that ſo much Money as could be got upon the Credit of that Act, has been applyed as it directs.

Money, and thoſe two Officers that conducted them were paid One Pound for each man, as a Reward for their Pains and Care, which I hope gave them all Satisfaction.</p>
