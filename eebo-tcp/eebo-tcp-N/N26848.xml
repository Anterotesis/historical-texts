            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Obligation to love and obey GOD which ariſes from the perpetual depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of men, <hi>as intelligent creatures,</hi> upon GOD, conſidered as their CREATOR, is the religion of nature. The relation formed by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence obliges them to be devoted to the ſervice and glory of him who made, preſerves and governs them. In this religion GOD the CREATOR is all and in all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:035738_0004_10064F41D04901A0"/>Revealed religion is that obligation to love and obey GOD, which reſults from the total dependence of men, <hi>as ſinners,</hi> upon GOD conſidered as their REDEEMER. The rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produced by this dependence obliges them to be devoted to the ſervice and glory of him who has atoned for their ſins, and is become the LORD their Righteouſneſs. In this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion GOD the REDEEMER is all and in all.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle adopts this very principle, and confirms it in the text by terms the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive and unequivocal.—"There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Greek nor Jew, circumciſion nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but CHRIST is all and in all."</p>
            <p>Believers are riſen with CHRIST. They are therefore to place their affections upon things above—to mortify their members which are upon earth—to put off the old man—and put on the new.—From theſe duties, no exemption can be pleaded; for the omiſſion of them, no excuſe admitted. The learned and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the civilized and the ſavage, the Greek and the Jew, all who believe, without diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nation, name or condition, are brought into the ſame relation to GOD, renewed into the ſame in age, and bound to univerſal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by the ſame principle—for CHRIST is all and in all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:035738_0005_10064F435A433C70"/>The phraſe expreſſes in a ſummary manner every thing that can be predicated of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. It is applied in the paſſage before us and in Epheſ. i. 23, to the divine REDEEMER, and in 1 Cor. xv. 28, to GOD in the moſt extenſive view, comprehending every relation he ſuſtains to his intelligent creatures.</p>
            <p>CHRIST <hi>is all,</hi> he is every thing eſſential in the ſalvation of ſinners; he is this to all and <hi>in all,</hi> the happy objects of his love. There are no local or perſonal diſcriminations. No exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive privileges or monopoly of benefits. "Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there ſalvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved." He is the ſame LORD, and his power and grace the ſame for all, and to all who call upon him.</p>
            <p>The fulneſs of the REDEEMER is frequently inculcated, in ſimilar comprehenſive ſentences. David ſays of him, "all my ſprings are in thee"<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxxvii. 7.</note>—"the LORD is my rock, and my fortreſs, and my deliverer, my GOD, my ſtrength"<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xviii. 2.</note>"the LORD is my light and my ſalvation—the LORD is the ſtrength of my life."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. xxvii. 1.</note> Paul calls him "the captain of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion"<note n="§" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 10.</note>—"the author and finiſher of our faith."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 2.</note>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:035738_0006_10064F44F648ED48"/>
And the bleſſed Saviour declares concerning himſelf, "I am Alpha and Omega—the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the ending—the firſt and the laſt."<note n="¶" place="bottom">Rev. i. 8, 17.</note> Theſe, and innumerable paſſages which aſcribe to him the glory of pardon and peace, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent comfort and future happineſs, are ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in the emphatical words of the text, CHRIST IS ALL AND IN ALL.</p>
            <p>CHRIST is an official name. It reſpects the exalted offices the REDEEMER ſuſtained, and the vaſt work, which as GOD and man in one perſon he accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>He muſt be man, a perfect man, that the law may be obeyed and ſatisfied, in the ſame nature which had ſinned. He muſt be GOD, the true GOD, becauſe no mere creature poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes a right to lay down his life and aſſign his merits to others—becauſe, it requires infinite wiſdom, love and power, to procure for and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſalvation to the guilty and depraved—and becauſe, redemption conſtitutes a new claim to an excluſive property in, and dominion over the redeemed. But the LORD will not give his glory or alienate his claim to another. "I looked," ſaith he, "and there was none to help—therefore mine own arm brought ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. lxiii. 5.</note>—"I, even I am the LORD, and beſides

            </p>
            <p>So much of the myſterious manner of the divine exiſtence is revealed; ſo much of GOD the Father, of GOD the Son, and of GOD the Holy Ghoſt, the one, the only living and true GOD, as ſuffices, not to gratify unſanctified curioſity, but to inform believers in what manner JEHOVAH can become their RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of the union between the divine nature of the Son of GOD and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature which he aſſumed, his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as GOD manifeſted in the fleſh, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignated by the name of CHRIST. The Apoſtle therefore, in the words before us, adopts and confirms the principle, that in revealed religion, GOD the REDEEMER is all and in all.</p>
            <p>No ſubject can be more acceptable to thoſe who love the LORD JESUS CHRIST. None more ſeaſonable when adverſaries openly blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme that ſacred name. And none more ſuitable to the character in which we now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his houſe and the work in which we profeſs to be engaged.—Father of lights, ſource of every good and every perfect gift, remove

the covering which hides thy glories from our view. Increaſe and ſtrengthen our faith to enter within the vail, that beholding with open face, we may be changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory!</p>
            <p>CHRIST is all and in all. Every thing great, intereſting and neceſſary in ſalvation is juſtly predicated of him.—Of a propoſition ſo general, which comprehends the whole ſyſtem, ſpreads over all the doctrines, and blends with every article of our creed, the details cannot poſſibly be conſidered in the preſent hour. As a ſummary of firſt principles, it muſt ſuffice to ſhew, that CHRIST is all and in all,—in the ſacred ſcriptures—in the religion of ſinners— and in providence.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In the ſacred ſcriptures CHRIST is all and in all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scriptures</hi> teſtify of CHRIST—in the law of Moſes, in the Prophets, and in the Pſalms, it is written concerning him, that he was to come, to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead, and that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—In the Goſpels and Epiſtles the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of theſe predictions is recorded, and the doctrines of his grace explained and confirmed.—The Acts of the Apoſtles exhibit

him in his majeſty riding proſperouſly, ſending the rod of his ſtrength out of Zion, and ruling in the midſt of his enemies.—The laſt book of the ſacred canon is the Revelation of JESUS CHRIST, the LORD, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the ALMIGHTY. It foretels the proſperous and adverſe ſtate of his Church, the riſe and deſtruction of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and his complete and the final triumph. The volume opens with the promiſe of his firſt appearance. It cloſes with an aſſurance of his ſecond coming. The Scriptures are full of CHRIST.—Look at every part of the Sacred Word.</p>
            <p>The HISTORICAL <hi>paſſages</hi> even of the Old Teſtament, refer to Him. The hiſtory of creation—the fall of man—the univerſal deluge —the call of Abraham—and the lives of the patriarchs. The ſeries of events which reſpect that people, of whom as concerning the fleſh CHRIST came, and the mention of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with whoſe fate that people was in ſome meaſure connected, all point to the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. They are all introduced, to demonſtrate the neceſſity of a Saviour, and diſcover the marvellous ſteps by which providence gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prepared for the coming of MESSIAH.</p>
            <p>The PROMISES are all in CHRIST, yea, and in him amen. In him they unite, for his
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035738_0010_10064F4AEB657B58"/>
ſake they were made, and through him they become valid and ſure. What reſpects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the principal promiſe. The repetition, explanation and confirmation of this, engroſs the chief attention of the ſacred writers, and run, as golden threads, through every leaf of the inſpired volume.</p>
            <p>The WORSHIP under the law was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to direct believers to the MESSIAH.—The municipal inſtitutes of a nation in which the Church and State were united, muſt of neceſſity be compriſed in the ſame code with the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, and ultimately refer to the ſame object. For his ſake the theocracy was formed. To ſecure the fulfilment of the promiſes reſpecting him, that people were ſeparated and dwelt alone until Shiloh came. The moral law was eſpecially magnified by his active and paſſive obedience, and proved to be holy, juſt and good. In the whole, he is intended. To him it is calculated to lead loſt ſinners. CHRIST is the end of the law.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The DEVOTIONAL paſſages of Scripture all look to Him by whom alone ſinners find acceſs to the Throne.

from our ſins in his own blood, that now raiſes the voice of rejoicing and ſalvation in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of the righteous.</p>
            <p>The DOCTRINES in Scripture, like ſo many bright lines within the ſame circle, unite in one glorious point. It is in the face of JESUS CHRIST that the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD ſhines moſt illuſtriouſly. Baniſh CHRIST from the doctrines, and a ſyſtem lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, connected and ſimple, becomes dark, perplexed and broken.</p>
            <p>There are detached facts, individual doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, moral precepts, which, in themſelves, are excellent, and independently on CHRIST or his glorious goſpel, cannot fail of claiming approbation and applauſe.—But it will be found, when viewed in their connection, that theſe facts are all combined with others which have an immediate reſpect to the Saviour— that theſe doctrines either appertain to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of nature and are adopted of courſe into the Chriſtian ſyſtem, or they form a part of other doctrines which directly relate to CHRIST. And that theſe moral precepts are calculated to convince of guilt and direct ſinners to ſeek an intereſt in his atonement; or they preſcribe a rule of life, by which his people are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their gratitude for ſaving mercies.—They are all, it is confeſſed, excellent in themſelves;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035738_0012_10064F536351DEC0"/>
but their higheſt excellence, their extenſive and true meaning, can be diſcerned alone, by obſerving the expreſs relation they bear to the divine REDEEMER.</p>
            <p>There are in the Scriptures, "ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and unſtable wreſt unto their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction." (2 Pet. iii. 16.)—The prophecies, antecedent to their accompliſhment, muſt of neceſſity be, in a great meaſure, obſcure.— The doctrines which reſpect the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity—the Word made fleſh—the operation of the Spirit—the ſovereignty of GOD, and a total dependence upon him, are too ſublime and myſterious to be fully comprehended by finite minds. And what relates to the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of human nature, with the inſeparable conſequences of guilt and ſin, are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the pride and prejudices of men. Theſe are ſo many ſources of difficulty. Theſe render ſome things hard to be underſtood, and ſtill harder to be cordially embraced. Yet, theſe notwithſtanding, all who are taught of GOD diſcover a perſpicuity ſufficient to render them wiſe unto ſalvation, and they delight to meditate upon the word. None cavil but the ignorant and profane. None but they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that clouds and darkneſs reſt upon the Scriptures.—Whatever it may be in regard to other matters, it is certainly beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035738_0013_10064F5718A65168"/>
that in CHRIST the hiſtory of the Bible terminates—he is the ſum of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes—the end of the law—the ſpirit of the devotion, and the principal object to which the whole is uniformly directed. He was meant in the types, ſhadowed forth in the rites, and expreſsly intended in all the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. He is the ſum, the ſcope of the Old and of the New Teſtament. In the Sacred Scriptures CHRIST is all and in all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The man, therefore, who reads the Bible without finding the Saviour there, is blind. And the miniſter of the goſpel who, to avoid offence, or recommend himſelf to the wicked, conceals the exalted REDEEMER, is a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; eſpecially as,</p>
            <p n="2">II. CHRIST is all and in all in the religion of ſinners.</p>
            <p>That religion which removes the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſin—permits the guilty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved to worſhip in an acceptable manner— reſtores to the favour and communion of GOD —adminiſters conſolation, and produces in the iſſue, perfection and happineſs, that, and that alone, can be denominated the religion of ſinners. Every thing ſhort of this muſt be inadequate to their exigencies, muſt be inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035738_0014_10064F54F012A018"/>The religion of nature is far from anſwering theſe exalted purpoſes.—From the definitions with which this diſcourſe was introduced, and ſome obſervations that have tranſiently occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you may perhaps already anticipate what appertains to this part of the ſubject. It is however of too great importance to be ſlightly treated. It draws a line of diſtinction, with which many are evidently unacquainted. And it ſuggeſts a principle, of all others the moſt eſſential, in refuting the falſe philoſophy of infidelity.</p>
            <p>No obligation, and conſequently no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, can exiſt without ſome RELATION to conſtitute a baſis or foundation upon which it reſts. The foundation of the religion of nature is the <hi>relation</hi> which ariſes from the depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of men conſidered as intelligent creatures, upon GOD as their CREATOR. This relation will not ſuffice for ſinners.</p>
            <p>The religion of nature is univerſal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. It preſcribes perfect and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obedience, as its only poſſible condition; and it enſures happineſs as long as a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in ſuch obedience is uninterruptedly maintained. But it contemplates no deviation from the divine law. It knows of no remedy for tranſgreſſors. A ſinner is a monſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and unacknowledged in the religion of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035738_0015_10064F58AD7878F0"/>
nature. A Saviour is a gift infinitely beyond its province or prerogative.</p>
            <p>Sin conſtitutes a new character. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces eſſential embarraſſments. It requires help which nothing in the relation between creatures and their CREATOR, as ſuch, can ſuggeſt or ſupply. The new character renders a <hi>new relation</hi> neceſſary. There muſt be a REDEEMER, or the evils produced by ſin can never be removed. He alone who made them can redeem them, form the relation, and bring them into it.</p>
            <p>The religion of nature is neceſſarily and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever binding upon all men as intelligent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The original obligation can never ceaſe or abate. Nothing can infringe, nothing can deſtroy it. The religion of nature, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, is as much the religion of men, after they become ſinners, as it would have been had they continued holy and perfect; and yet by not providing happineſs, is eſſentially deficient in a moſt important article.—If it obliges the ſinner to obedience, while it condemns, and leaves him to all the direful conſequences of his tranſgreſſion—if the <hi>relation</hi> upon which it is founded does not reach the new character— if the only <hi>condition</hi> it preſcribes, of <hi>do this and live,</hi> cannot poſſibly be complied with, and if the <hi>principle</hi> that inveſtigates this obligation,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035738_0016_10064F5D17F70E38"/>
is not competent to the diſcovery of any other, that will obviate the complicated miſeries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſin, then the religion of nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave, then it is not, and cannot be, the religion that will ſuffice for ſinners.</p>
            <p>Two obligations, each demanding the whole heart, ariſing from two diſtinct relations, would interfere and prove inconſiſtent, were they due to diſtinct Beings. No man can ſerve two maſters.—But if both relations originate from the ſame ſource, and terminate in the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; if he who is the CREATOR, be alſo the REDEEMER, no different intereſts, no claſhing of authority, no inconſiſtency can ariſe from the additional obligation. The duties may ſweetly blend, and one harmonious, rational and divine ſervice be the bleſſed reſult.</p>
            <p>All theſe defects are compenſated, all theſe important ends obtained in revealed religion. This fully recognizes and cordially embraces, as of neceſſity it ought, the religion of nature. But it does much more. It meets the new charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It reveals a new relation. It opens a new acceſs to GOD and happineſs. And in this, its eſſential peculiarity conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Revealed religion conſiders men as ſinners, and expreſsly treats with them as ſuch. CHRIST came to call, not the righteous, but ſinners to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035738_0017_10064F5EA4ADF808"/>
repentance. The whole need not a phyſician, but the ſick. This is the religion which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly provides a remedy againſt ſin. The only religion that informs ſinners what they muſt do to be ſaved. That procures accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for their perſons and ſervices—affords comfort in affliction—aſſuages the pangs of an accuſing conſcience—promotes holineſs in heart and life—and opens a proſpect of eternal reſt and glory. This therefore, with propriety, may be called THE RELIGION OF SINNERS.</p>
            <p>Now, in this religion CHRIST is all and in all. With reſpect to the foundation upon which it is built—the benefits derived from it—and the duties to which it binds.</p>
            <p>What is the language of the Prophets in regard to the FOUNDATION of that religion which can ſave ſinners?

            <p>The BENEFITS of the everlaſting covenant are all ratified in him, and beſtowed for his ſake.</p>

And he is the king of ſaints, and head of his Church, in conſequence of a more intimate and ſpecial relation which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts between him and the redeemed family.

Where will be the pomp and power of emperors, kings and republican rulers who now deſolate the world, with wars, revolutions and havock? like their predeceſſors, they will ſoon be crumbled to the duſt, and leave not a wreck behind.—Cities once celebrated for their extent, riches and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, are razed, and the remnant of their ruins ſcarcely exhibit a proof of their former exiſtence.

            <p>The different ſtages through which the Church muſt paſs, the progreſſive manner in which all this will be obtained, are indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly marked in the prophetic viſion which Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel interpreted.<note n="†" place="bottom">Daniel ii. 34, 35, 44.</note>—"A ſtone was cut out without hands, which ſmote the image—and the ſtone which ſmote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth—in the days of theſe kings ſhall the GOD of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſet up a kingdom, which ſhall never be deſtroyed, and the kingdom ſhall not be left to other people, but it ſhall break in pieces and conſume all theſe kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand forever."</p>
            <p>Let it ſuffice to remark upon this celebrated prophecy: that the Church, the viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of CHRIST in the world, is here exhibited as remaining for a ſeries of ages,—ſmall and circumſcribed in its limits—moveable and changing its place—ſuffering and expoſed to buffetings and inſults.

ſeaſon will arrive, when it ſhall triumph over all its adverſaries, extend its boundaries and ſpread throughout the world. Expreſſed in the prophetic emblem, by a great mountain that ſhall fill the whole earth.</p>
            <p>During the firſt period, (by a learned expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor<note n="*" place="bottom">

But, when theſe have waſted their ſtrength, and the gates of hell oppoſed in vain; at the period fixed for the diſplay of the Saviour's grace and glory in the world, his Church will ſuddenly aſſume a new form. Her mourning be turned into joy, her widow's weed exchanged for the garment of ſalvation. The ſtone will rapidly grow into a mountain. The kingdom of CHRIST literally fill the whole earth.—Thus it will be grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged that he adminiſters the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; it will then be ſeen with rapture, that his glory is the <hi>end;</hi> and mankind will hail the divine REDEEMER as alſo, all and in all in providence.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:035738_0035_10064F84D1E5C980"/>AND NOW, my Brethren, what think ye of CHRIST? what think ye of him who is the principal ſubject of the bible, the only baſis of redemption, the adminiſtrator and the end of every diſpenſation? is he not the chief among ten thouſand and altogether lovely? is he not all and in all—in the ſacred ſcriptures —in the religion of ſinners—and in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? and ought he not to be all our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and all our deſire? ſhould not our hearts glow with gratitude while we contemplate the amazing work? Can we look with cold indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference upon what infinite wiſdom has plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, upon what love paſſing knowledge has accompliſhed?—Prejudiced infidelity may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the goſpel folly, and the humble mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the MESSIAH prove a ſtumbling block to his ancient people. But to us the ſcandal of the croſs is more than compenſated by the glory which ſucceeded. We know the man of ſorrows is now exalted "on the right hand of the throne of the majeſty in the heavens."<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. viii. 1.</note> His adverſaries may then blaſpheme, and the impious ſay, "we will not have this man to rule over us." But we with cheerful ſubmiſſion and adoring confidence, reply—"come LORD JESUS—King of kings and Lord of lords— thou art worthy to receive glory and honour and power—rule thou in the midſt of thine

enemies. Reign in our hearts." Let this be our firſt impreſſion, this our firſt ſentiment.</p>
            <p>Diminutive as man appears when compared with the univerſe, and leſs than nothing when likened unto GOD; mean as a creature in the ſcale of beings, and ſtill leſs and unworthy as a ſinner; there is nevertheleſs no ground for cavil againſt the infinite price at which ſalvation is obtained, or the amazing method by which the work is accompliſhed. An immortal ſoul ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving the divine image, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, loving, and ſerving GOD in conſummate bliſs forever, is not a little thing. Millions of ſuch are not beneath the notice and care of the Supreme.—Small and great are comparative terms. No part of the moral creation is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inconſiderable. The harmony which muſt ſubſiſt in the divine government, the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſyſtems, the influence of worlds upon worlds, of every part of the vaſt dominion of GOD upon the whole, of preſent tranſactions upon the ages of eternity, render it abſolutely impoſſible for finite minds to eſtimate what is ſmall or great, or determine upon the queſtion of propriety and right.—If God deſigns to magnify his love and diſplay the riches of his grace, in ſaving even the leaſt, the youngeſt of the family, it may be expected, that in the plan and accompliſhment, it will be worthy of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. No ſtep can be too marvellous, no part

of the work too aſtoniſhing, nor need it offend the higheſt intelligences to find that, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Redeemer, he performs a new work, and aſſumes the very nature he redeems into a perſonal union with himſelf. Nothing is too great for GOD. The ends hereby attained may not only reach the redeemed, but in their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed conſequences extend to the whole creation, and produce moſt glorious and ſalutary effects to all eternity. Whatever it may be, his thoughts are not our thoughts, nor are our ways his ways. Far then from exclaiming, how can theſe things be? or raiſing objections from the character and relative inſignificance of man, it becomes us to believe and adore. The difficulty of reconciling ſuch proceedings in the moral government to our views and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſerves rather to enhance the value of this great ſalvation, confirm its certainty, and prompt us with cheerfulneſs to ſubmit to the glorious goſpel of the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>The angels of GOD worſhipped him.<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. i. 6.</note> At his birth they ſung "glory to GOD in the higheſt;" during his humiliation on earth they attended; and are now, through all their ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hierarchies, ſubjected to his authority and employed by him to miniſter to the heirs of ſalvation. He is their LORD, but he is our REDEEMER. To us the child was born. To

us the Son was given. He took not upon him the nature of angels, but the ſeed of Abraham. He came to ſave ſinners of mankind, the chief of ſinners. Let ſinners then, let the chief of ſinners bow before him, and praiſe GOD their REDEEMER. Praiſe him for his unſpeakable gift. Praiſe him for becoming man and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the juſt for the unjuſt. Praiſe him for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering within the vail, as their forerunner and interceſſor.

rage and take counſel againſt the LORD and his anointed. Nothing, that can be deviſed neceſſary to ſupport the teſtimony of Scripture, is lacking. But the precepts are too ſevere, the doctrines too humbling, and the Saviour too holy, to meet their unſanctified approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

To preſent the ſame objects again to your view, would anſwer no valuable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If you believe indeed that CHRIST is all and in all, your hearts have burned within you while contemplating the glory which ſucceeded his ſufferings, and you are ready to cry out, "Let the heavens rejoice,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035738_0044_10064F9D1415B558"/>
and let the earth be glad—ſay among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the LORD reigneth.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xcvi. 10, 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The maſter whom you ſerve is worthy of every return that obedience and love can dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. Your moſt painful labours, perſevering induſtry, and ſtrenuous exertions to promote his goſpel, are infinitely leſs than is due for his diſtinguiſhing grace.—The ſalvation you ſtrive to promulgate is great and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation. It imparts peace and conſolation here; it enſures perfection and glory hereafter. The ſouls of ſavages are immortal and precious as your own. Their eſſential intereſts the ſame. —Every ſentiment of gratitude to your RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER and of benevolence to men—the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to communicate to others what has been freely beſtowed upon you, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command to "teach all nations," which is ſtill unrepealed, conſpire to confirm the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fix your reſolves, and animate you with courage in this laudable enterpriſe. May your labours be crowned with ſucceſs, and the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, under your cultivation, rejoice and bloſſom as the roſe!</p>
            <p>The promiſe annexed to the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſuggeſts the moſt ample ſupport. The preſence of the LORD, like the cloud by day and pillar of fire by night, will prove a guide,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035738_0045_10064F9EA0FCA038"/>
protection and comfort to his ſervants. If he be "alway with them, even unto the end of the world," they may proceed with confidence and anticipate proſperity. While ſome unite their counſels, others can boldly go forth in his name. The root of Jeſſe will ſtand for an enſign of the people. To it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek, and his reſt ſhall be glorious.<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. xxi. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The diſpenſations of providence in connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſure word of prophecy, juſtly raiſe our expectations, and may be conſidered as unequivocal tokens of ſignal ſucceſs.—What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the period from which the riſe of Antichriſt is to be dated, it is evident his uſurpations and tyranny are drawing to a cloſe. That wicked power which has ſo long reſiſted the progreſs of the goſpel, but which for ſome time has been gradually conſuming, will ſoon be deſtroyed by the brightneſs of the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER's coming. The laſt ſtruggles of the monſter may be violent, and his expiring ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies protracted, but he is certainly dying. The weſtern and eaſtern Antichriſt, which with their combined influence, are perhaps conſidered in ſcripture as one, aroſe nearly at the ſame time and will fall together.</p>
            <p>The vials of wrath now pouring upon thoſe nations which gave their aid and ſupport to the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035738_0046_10064FA08F17B948"/>
man of ſin. The deſolations of war, the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, terrors and convulſions, unrecorded before in hiſtory, announce the approach of ſome period, new and intereſting. The RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER is ſhaking the nations, and his people hope, it is to prepare the way for his coming We preſume not with confidence to aſcertain "the times or the ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power."<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts i. 7.</note> But as we know, that, when the fig-tree putteth forth leaves, the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is nigh; ſo when we ſee all theſe things, we know that the coming of the ſon of man is near, even at the door.<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxiv. 30, 32, 33.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Under the frown of infidelity, and in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that infernal power which, with accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated ſtrength and fury, is making havock of the churches, the ſpirit of the LORD is poured out upon them as waters upon the dry ground, and they unite with a cordiality and come forward with a zeal before unknown. In the Indies, in the iſlands of the Pacific Ocean, and in Africa, the precious name of JESUS is now proclaimed by their heralds. Our feeble efforts, although late, have not been diſowned by our LORD. We have ſucceeded in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining one miſſionary, and he is now on his way to a tribe of ſavages upon our frontiers. The LORD direct the ſteps of his ſervant, and render this beginning of our labours as "the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035738_0047_10064FA221E7DAF8"/>
handful of corn upon the top of the mountain, the fruit whereof ſhall ſhake like Lebanon!"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxii. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Take, my brethren, a deliberate view of all theſe events. Collect them in a point, and feel the encouragement which they are calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to inſpire. Whatever may be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conſequence of your efforts, it will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the LORD, that it was in your hearts to build him an houſe. Whatever may be the iſſue of the individual or joint exertions in this good work; it will not be long before the morning will break, and with its riſing luſtre diſpel the ſhades of night. Another ſeaſon of refreſhing is at hand. Another Pentecoſt will awaken the churches and amaze the world. The cruel conflict which muſt terminate in killing the witneſſes, can afford the adverſary but a ſhort triumph. The ſpirit of life from GOD will again enter into them. (Rev. xi. 11.) Order will ſpeedily ariſe out of confuſion, light ſucceed to darkneſs, and the REDEEMER take to himſelf his great power and reign. His breath will ſhake the ſlain multitudes, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be born in a day. The Jews are ready to hail their own MESSIAH, and all the ends of the earth will ſee the ſalvation of GOD.— Hear the decree which enſures the final ſucceſs of the goſpel and the glory of the REDEEMER: "He muſt reign until he hath put all enemies
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035738_0048_10064FA7B508A518"/>
under his feet—then cometh the end when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to GOD, even the <hi>Father</hi>—THAT GOD MAY BE ALL IN ALL." Amen.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>MY deſign from theſe words is, to take a view of that prophetic viſion, of which they are a part, in itſelf and in its applications.</p>
            <p>The Prophet tells us, that being carried out, in the Spirit of the LORD, he was ſet down in the midſt of a valley full of bones. Having
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035738_0050_10064FAAC98AA850"/>
paſſed by them round about, and taken a particular ſurvey of them, <hi>behold there were very many, in the open valley, and lo, they were very dry.</hi> In theſe circumſtances was the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the text propoſed to him, <hi>Son of man can theſe bones live?</hi> Inſtead of returning a direct anſwer to this query, the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the poſſibility of their living into the purpoſe, and power of GOD; <hi>O</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>thou knoweſt.</hi> Upon this he was commanded to propheſy upon them, and to ſay unto them, <hi>O ye dry bones, hear the word of the</hi> LORD. <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD GOD <hi>unto theſe bones, Behold, I will cauſe breath to enter into you; and ye ſhall live. And I will lay ſinews upon you, and will bring up fleſh upon you, and cover you with ſkin, and put breath in you, and ye ſhall live; and ye ſhall know that I am the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>The Prophet did as he was commanded. And what was the conſequence? <hi>As I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there was a noiſe, and behold a ſhaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And when I beheld, lo, the ſinews and the fleſh came up upon them, and the ſkin covered them above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As yet, however, they were but dead bodies: for he adds, <hi>there was no breath in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:035738_0051_10064FAE17C45DA8"/>He then receives a ſecond commiſſion. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy unto the wind, propheſy, ſon of man, and ſay to the wind, Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon theſe ſlain, that they may live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He did ſo. <hi>I propheſied,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and ſtood upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What an aſtoniſhing ſight was this! A great multitude of dry bones, lying diſperſed in an open valley, firſt, put into motion; then, coming together, bone to his bone; the ſinews and the fleſh afterwards coming up upon them; and the ſkin covering them above; and, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becoming animated, ariſing, and ſtanding upon their feet an exceeding great army.</p>
            <p>The primary object, to which this prophetic viſion referred, was, the recovery of the Jews from their captivity, in Babylon, and their reſtoration to their own land. This is evident from the application, in the eleventh verſe. <hi>Son of man, theſe bones are the whole houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They had been now ſeventy years in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Their preſent circumſtances were very unpromiſing for a reſtoration. Like the bones,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035738_0052_10064FAFA15DCB38"/>
in the valley of viſion, they were diſperſed over the whole face of the country; and, like dry bones, they were hopeleſs, heartleſs, and poſſeſſed of none of the means of their recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Therefore, they ſaid, <hi>Our bones are dried, and our hope is loſt, we are cut off for our part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the time deſtined in the divine purpoſe, and which had been predicted by the prophets, as the period of their captivity, was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. The time of their deliverance was come. And by this prophetic repreſentation GOD would revive and ſtrengthen the faith and hope of his people. He would ſhew them that though their ſituation was as unpromiſing for a reſtoration, as that a multitude of dry bones, diſperſed in a valley, ſhould live; yet, it ſhould be effected: <hi>not by might, nor by power, but by my ſpirit, ſaith the</hi> LORD. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propheſy upon theſe dry bones, and ſay unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>What is here predicted, and emblematically repreſented to the prophet was realized and accompliſhed when, upon the proclamation of Cyrus, who had been propheſied of, by name, for this expreſs purpoſe, upwards of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years before, the Jews returned
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035738_0053_10064FB2468674B8"/>
to their own land, and rebuilt their city and temple.</p>
            <p>Beſides the primary intent of this prophetic repreſentation there are ſeveral other objects to which it may be juſtly referred. Permit me now to direct your attention to theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. This viſion may be conſidered as an emblematical repreſentation of the recovery of the ſinner from a ſtate of ſpiritual death, to ſpiritual life and happineſs, by the means of grace, and through the effectual operations of the Holy Spirit of GOD.</p>
            <p>However ſome may boaſt of the dignity and powers of human nature; or, whatever its natural, intellectual, political or moral abilities may be; yet, how to perform ſpiritual actions, in a holy and ſpiritual manner, whilſt in his natural ſtate, man findeth not. The powers of the ſoul are not leſs deranged, nor its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, for ſpiritual action, leſs deſtroyed by ſin, than thoſe of the body are by natural death. Univerſal experience confirms the truth of thoſe ſcripture declarations; that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is only evil continually; that he is aſleep in ſecurity, and dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; that the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of GOD, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035738_0054_10064FB3F09E7CC8"/>
can he know them becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned; that the carnal mind is enmity againſt GOD: for it is not ſubject to the law of GOD, neither indeed can be; and that the exertion of the ſame Almighty Power which created the world, at firſt, out of nothing, by which JESUS CHRIST was raiſed from the dead, and by which our bodies ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day, is neceſſary to quicken the ſinner to a ſpiritual life, and to make him alive unto GOD.</p>
            <p>If there are any of you who have not found this to be the caſe, be aſſured, you are yet ſtrangers to your condition. You know not the plagues of your own hearts; you are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the glorious perfections and character of GOD, and to the holineſs, ſpirituality, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and power of his law; you are yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out GOD, without CHRIST, and without hope in the world.</p>
            <p>When, therefore, we preach the goſpel to ſinners, and call upon them to repent, to be converted and to believe, we are in preciſely ſimilar circumſtances with the prophet when he propheſied, ſaying, <hi>O ye dry bones, hear the word of the</hi> LORD. Did our ſucceſs depend on human probabilities, or the natural efficacy of even inſtituted means, never, until time
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035738_0055_10064FB5876E8AC8"/>
ſhould give place to eternity, would we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert one ſoul.</p>
            <p>But we know that it is the will of GOD the goſpel ſhould be preached to every creature; and that we ſhould perſuade men by all the terror of the LORD, and by all the allurements of his mercy and grace to be reconciled unto him. We know, that by the preaching of the word, and other gracious inſtitutions GOD is, from time to time, adding to the Church ſuch as ſhall be ſaved. We know that his power has been illuſtriouſly diſplayed in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thouſands and tens of thouſands alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; that it is ſtill equally competent for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the deſigns of his grace; and that his word ſhall not return unto him void, but ſhall accompliſh that which he pleaſes, and proſper in the thing whereto he ſends it. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unpromiſing appearances may be, even though ſinners ſhould increaſe unto more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs under our miniſtrations, ſtill there is ground of encouragement. <hi>Behold, the</hi> LORD's <hi>hand is not ſhortened, that it cannot ſave: neither is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear. Therefore we both labour, and ſuffer reproach, becauſe we truſt in the living</hi> GOD <hi>who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Another object to which this prophetic viſion may be referred is, the recovery of the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035738_0056_10064FB94B437410"/>
Church and people of GOD from a ſtate of deadneſs, degeneracy and declenſion, to a ſtate of livelineſs, vigour, and ſpiritual proſperity. Happy would it be, for the children and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD, were they always progreſſive in the divine life: going from ſtrength to ſtrength, reaching forth unto thoſe things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and preſſing towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of GOD in CHRIST JESUS. What high attainments in grace might they not reach! What abundant peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation might they not enjoy! This, however, is not the caſe. Through the influence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining corruption, and the numerous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to which they are expoſed; by negligence in duty, and not duly improving that proviſion of grace and ſtrength which is made for them in their glorious covenant head, they are liable to awful backſlidings and declenſions. In theſe circumſtances, however, GOD will not leave his children. He has betrothed them unto himſelf in faithfulneſs and forever. They ſhall not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther totally or finally depart from him; nor will he turn away from them to do them good. He will reclaim them by tender mercies, or the rod. Hence the commiſſion to the prophet, <hi>Go and proclaim theſe words towards the north, and ſay, Return thou backſliding Iſrael. Turn, O backſliding children, ſaith the</hi> LORD, <hi>for I am married unto you.</hi> Hence alſo thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious declarations and promiſes, <hi>I will not cauſe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035738_0057_10064FBAD2822CA8"/>
mine anger to fall upon you. I will heal their backſliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. Though ye have lain among the pots, yet ſhall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with ſilver, and her feathers with yellow gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the people of GOD are liable to, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually, may, and often doth befal them in a collective capacity. The Church of GOD has often been confined to a comparatively ſmall number. Through the abounding of iniquity, the love of the righteous may wax cold. There are times when the wiſe virgins ſlumber and ſleep with the fooliſh. There are ſeaſons alſo, when the powers of earth and hell are ſo let looſe and combined together againſt the Church as to threaten its entire deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But to whatever difficulties or dangers the cauſe and intereſt of the REDEEMER may be expoſed in the world, they ſhall ſucceed. <hi>Though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midſt of the ſea; Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof.</hi> GOD <hi>is in the midſt of her: ſhe ſhall not be moved:</hi> GOD <hi>ſhall help her, and that right early.</hi> GOD has founded his Church upon the Rock of ages, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. <hi>When the enemy
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035738_0058_10064FBC5E2EAF40"/>
ſhall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall lift up a ſtandard againſt him.</hi> The time, yea, the ſet time to favour Zion will come. GOD will haſten it in his own good time. Though it tarry, wait for it. He will ariſe: his enemies ſhall be ſcattered; and he will have mercy upon Zion. He will appear in his glory, and build her up. He will beautify her with ſalvation. He will cauſe her to look forth as the morning: fair as the moon, clear as the ſun, and terrible as an army with ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The righteouſneſs thereof ſhall go forth as brightneſs, and the ſalvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</p>
            <p>The Jews were once the peculiar people of GOD. He had choſen them for himſelf, from among all the families of the earth. He had redeemed them from their Egyptian bondage. He had borne them as on the wings of an eagle, and guarded them as the apple of the eye. He had nouriſhed and brought them up as children. He had diſtinguiſhed them by bleſſings, both temporal and ſpiritual, above all the nations of the earth. But having been always a ſtiff-necked and rebellious people; having often provoked the LORD to anger; and having, at length, completed the meaſure of their iniquity by the crucifixion of the Son of GOD, the Prince of life and the Lord of glory, and the rejection of his goſpel, GOD caſt them
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035738_0059_10064FBE5B304420"/>
off. They were given over to a ſpirit of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, impenitency, and unbelief. Their city and temple were deſtroyed. They were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed over the face of the whole earth; and remain to the preſent day a perſecuted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed people.</p>
            <p>As, however, the rejection of the Jews was not total; ſo, neither will it be final. GOD will yet remember them with covenant mercy. Though it is now near eighteen hundred years ſince their rejection and diſperſion, they ſtill remain a diſtinct people, and ſeparated from all others: an inſtance the like to which has never been known in the world; and a ſtrong preſumptive evidence of GOD's ſpecial gracious purpoſes reſpecting them. GOD has mercy in ſtore for them, which ſhall, in due time, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played towards them, in rich abundance.</p>
            <p>This prophetic viſion then may be juſtly conſidered as emblematical, and predictive of their recovery. To me it appears probable, from the tenor of ſcripture prophecy, that they will be reſtored again to their own land; and that, even in a literal ſenſe, Jeruſalem ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a peaceable habitation.</p>
            <p>Be this, however, as it may, certain it is, that the time is coming when that vail of ignorance and prejudice which has for ſo many centuries
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035738_0060_10064FC3CAD75848"/>
been upon their minds, ſhall be rent; and when, as a people, they ſhall be brought to know, and to confeſs that this JESUS, whom we worſhip, whom they took, and with wicked hands crucified and ſlew, on Mount Calvary, without the gates of Jeruſalem, is, indeed, the true and promiſed MESSIAH: that in him there is a full accompliſhment of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and promiſes reſpecting the ſeed of the woman, contained in the Old Teſtament, and that he is the truth and ſubſtance of the whole ceremonial law. And if, as the Apoſtle argues, in the eleventh chapter of his epiſtle to the Romans, through their fall ſalvation came to the Gentiles, and the diminution of them be the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulneſs? <hi>For if the caſting away of them be the reconciling of the world; what ſhall the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of them be, but life from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. This prophetic exhibition juſtly admits of a particular application to the immediate oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of our preſent meeting. We are engaged in an attempt to propagate the goſpel among the Indian tribes upon our frontiers. Realize, for a moment, their ſituation, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſcouragements with which we have to contend. You will find them as unfit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, for the object contemplated, as the dry bones in the valley of viſion to conſtitute an army of living men. Beſides that depravity
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035738_0061_10064FC556721BE8"/>
which is common to human nature; ignorant, uncivilized and ſavage. Roaming abroad in queſt of their prey like the wild beaſts of the foreſt. And, alas! that there is reaſon to add, corrupted, and their prejudices ſtrongly excited againſt Chriſtianity, by the ſtill greater depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and wickedneſs of a large proportion of thoſe, from among ourſelves, with whom they have had intercourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Can theſe dry bones live?</hi> Can theſe ſavages of the wilderneſs become Chriſtians? How ſhall their roving minds be fixed? How ſhall they be brought to realize and lay to heart their miſery and danger? How ſhall they be brought to apprehend, and embrace the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>thou knoweſt.</hi> We believe it our duty to make the attempt. We believe, and are fully perſuaded that thou art able to render it ſucceſsful. Whether thou wilt, or not, belongs not to us to determine. In the name of our GOD would we ſet up our ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Confiding in thy purpoſes, power, and grace, would we proſecute this important un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. Haſt thou not promiſed to give unto JESUS, thy Son, the heathen for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion. Haſt thou not ſaid, <hi>It is a light thing that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſervant to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035738_0062_10064FC701B67DE8"/>
raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto the end of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor, my brethren, are we without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds of encouragement in our preſent undertaking. Several concurring circumſtances tend to excite our exertions, and to animate our hopes. Has not GOD promiſed, <hi>The wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and the ſolitary places ſhall be glad for them: and the deſert ſhall rejoice, and bloſſom as the roſe. It ſhall bloſſom abundantly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice even with joy and ſinging; the glory of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon ſhall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they ſhall ſee the glory of the</hi> LORD, <hi>and the excellency of our</hi> GOD. <hi>The kings of Tarſhiſh and the Iſles ſhall bring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; the kings of Sheba and Seba ſhall offer gifts. Princes ſhall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia ſhall ſoon ſtretch out her hands unto</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>Theſe promiſes are in themſelves, a ſufficient foundation for faith and hope, and for the moſt vigorous exertions. But the providences of GOD, at preſent, in a particular manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with his promiſes, and afford ground to hope that their accompliſhment draws nigh. Amidſt the tumults and confuſions of war, a miſſionary ſpirit has been poured out in the European world, eſpecially in Great-Britain.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035738_0063_10064FC88C751258"/>
Regardleſs of party names and diſtinctions, the friends to the great doctrines of grace have united, as with one heart, and formed ſocieties, in various parts, for propagating the goſpel among the heathen. Nine and twenty miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, ſent out by the ſociety in London, in a veſſel of their own, procured for the purpoſe, have arrived ſafe in the Iſlands of the South Sea. Six others, namely, two from the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, two from the Edinburgh, and two from the Glaſgow ſocieties have been ſent to Sierra Leone, in Africa. Beſides thoſe which have been ſent, or are about to be ſent to the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, and to other parts. Add to this that whilſt a general and vigorous exertion has been made for evangelizing the heathen, a remarkable zeal has diſcovered itſelf, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary meaſures have been adopted for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the intereſts of religion at home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the eſtabliſhment of ſchools, and ſending out itinerant preachers to thoſe parts which were deſtitute of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Societies inſtituted upon the ſame principles, and with the ſame objects in view, have been formed in America. The ſociety, eſtabliſhed in this city, has procured, and ſent out one miſſionary. His deſtination is to the Chickaſaw Indians on the weſtern parts of the ſtate of Georgia. Probably by this time he has nearly arrived at the end of his journey. He has gone
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035738_0064_10064FCB4FCF3208"/>
forth under the moſt promiſing auſpices. Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian liberality has hitherto furniſhed us with pecuniary reſources adequate to our exigencies; and ſhould the undertaking ſucceed, we have no reaſon to doubt but that we ſhall ſtill obtain a ſufficiency to ſerve our purpoſes. Our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt preſent want is, at leaſt, another miſſionary. May the LORD put it into the hearts of ſome to offer themſelves, who ſhall be found quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the work, and whoſe labours he will crown with abundant ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>In the IVth and laſt place. This prophetic viſion may be conſidered as a lively emblema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical repreſentation of the reſurrection of the dead at the laſt day. The doctrine of a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was denied by the Sadducees, and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed by the heathen philoſophers. But it has always been an object of faith and hope to the church and people of God. The difficulties which ſtand in the way of a reſurrection are, in the eye of ſenſe and reaſon, inſuperable. Hence, though the heathen philoſophers had ſome apprehenſions of the immortality of the ſoul, yet they had no idea of the reſurrection of the body. Accordingly, when the apoſtle Paul, in his ſpeech at Athens, made mention of a reſurrection, <hi>ſome mocked, others ſaid, we will hear thee again of this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lift up your eyes upon the congregation of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035738_0065_10064FCDF21C56B0"/>
the dead. Are they not very many, and very dry? Survey the number of Adam's family who, ſince the firſt commencement of time, have fallen under the ſtroke of the King of terrors, and become the prey of corruption and worms. What muſt be the condition of thoſe who have now been in this ſituation for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, nay, for thouſands of years? What is become of the conſtituent parts of thoſe bodies which have, ſo long ſince, returned to their native duſt? Some have been depoſited in ſepulchres, and become incorporated with their mother earth. Some have been conſumed by fire, and their aſhes ſcattered by the winds to the four corners of the earth. Some have been caſt into the ſea, and devoured by the fiſhes, or ſunk down into the depths of the ocean, under the load of mighty waters. And ſome have become the prey of the fowls of the air, and of the beaſts of the field. The rich and the poor, the honoured and the deſpiſed, the learned and the illiterate, the maſter and the ſervant, the tyrant and the ſlave, the king and the beggar, have, long ſince, been blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one promiſcuous heap. <hi>Can theſe bones live?</hi> How ſhall theſe particles be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and again formed into thoſe bodies of which they were once conſtituent parts?</p>
            <p>Reaſoning in the line of analogy, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reſurrections which take place, both in
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035738_0066_10064FCFF4FC8F58"/>
the animal and vegetable world, would ſeem to afford ſome preſumptive evidence of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the human body. Any conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, however, which could be drawn from theſe, would be extremely vague and uncertain. Bleſſed be GOD we have a more ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which our faith and hope of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant article reſts. Life and immortality have been brought to light by the goſpel. The certainty of a reſurrection reſts upon two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, namely, the purpoſe, and the power of GOD. To theſe two is it referred by our LORD in his reply to the Sadducees. <hi>Ye do err, not knowing the ſcriptures, nor the power of</hi> GOD; <hi>the ſcriptures,</hi> which declare that there ſhall be a reſurrection; and <hi>the power of</hi> GOD, which is able to effect it.</p>
            <p>That GOD is able to raiſe the dead cannot be queſtioned: for what cannot Omnipotence do? <hi>He calls thoſe things which are not, as though they were.</hi> He made all things, at firſt, out of nothing. He is the former of the bodies, and the father of the ſpirits of all fleſh. If then GOD made the human body out of the duſt of the earth, and breathed into it the breath of life, ſo that man became a living ſoul; tell me, ye infidels, is he not able to raiſe this body again from the duſt of the earth, and to re-eſtabliſh that union between it and the ſoul which had been deſtroyed by death?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:035738_0067_10064FD18AEA8288"/>That GOD will raiſe the dead is evident from ſcripture teſtimony. I ſhall reſt this on the three following paſſages. The firſt you have Job xix. 25, 26 and 27. <hi>For I know that my</hi> REDEEMER <hi>liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth. And though, after my ſkin, worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee</hi> GOD. <hi>Whom I ſhall ſee for myſelf, and mine eyes ſhall behold, and not another, though my reins be conſumed within me.</hi> The ſecond paſſage you have, Iſaiah xxvi. 19. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe. Awake and ſing, ye that dwell in the duſt: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead.</hi> The third paſſage, to which I referred, is in John v. 28 and 29. <hi>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the grave ſhall hear the voice of the Son of</hi> GOD. <hi>And ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the reſurrection of damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this reſurrection that which was exhibited to the imagination of the Prophet was but a ſmall repreſentation. O the noiſe and the ſhaking when atom ſhall come together to his atom, and bone to his bone of all who ſhall be numbered with the ſilent dead! How vaſt the multitude, how crowded the throng, when the ſea ſhall give up the dead which are in it, and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035738_0068_10064FD5ED823138"/>
death and hell ſhall give up the dead which are in them; and the dead, ſmall and great ſhall ſtand before GOD! There, my brethren, ſhall you and I appear, though, probably, long before that period arrive, we ſhall have gone the way of all fleſh, and our bodies have taken up their reſidence in the grave; the houſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for all the living.</p>
            <p>We can only, briefly, hint at the various things which preſent themſelves in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſubject. It addreſſes itſelf to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of every deſcription and character; and calls for their ſpecial improvement.</p>
            <p>Such as are the ſubjects of a new and divine life, may learn from hence the obligations which they are under to the mercy and grace of GOD. Once you were in a ſtate of ſpiritual death, hopeleſs and helpleſs, as the dry bones in the valley of viſion. When aſleep in ſecurity, and dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, GOD awakened you, and ſaid unto you, live. Through the effectual operations of his ſpirit and grace, you have paſſed from death unto life, and from the power of Satan to ſerve the living GOD. Your lives are bid with CHRIST in GOD, and you are heirs of that eternal life which GOD, who cannot lie, hath promiſed to thoſe that are his. You have abundant matter for the exerciſe of faith and hope, and many powerful excitements
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035738_0069_10064FD774CAEC50"/>
to the duties of thankſgiving and praiſe. GOD will never leave you, nor forſake you. That grace which has been implanted in you ſhall be perfected in glory, and, in due time, you ſhall receive the end of your faith in the ſalvation of your ſouls. Your fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope, and you may cheerfully reſign your bodies to death and the grave in the ſure and certain proſpect of a glorious reſurrection to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſubject ſpeaks encouragement to ſuch as are, in any meaſure, awakened to a ſenſe of their miſery and danger, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what they ſhall do to be ſaved. GOD has cauſed this noiſe and ſhaking. It is a token for good. This is a precious, and, O remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it is a perilous ſeaſon. Take care to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. Your eternal all is at riſk upon it. Reſiſt not the grace which may be exerted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. Provoke not the life-giving ſpirit of GOD to depart from you. Haſten to the Saviour, and to the arms of mercy which are open to receive you. <hi>When thou heareſt the ſound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, then beſtir thyſelf: for then ſhall the</hi> LORD <hi>go out before thee to ſmite thine enemies.</hi> But if this ſeaſon is ſuffered to paſs unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, the like of it may never return, and you may be left to complain, <hi>The harveſt is paſt, the ſummer is ended, and we are not ſaved.
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035738_0070_10064FD901CF41C0"/>
Work out your own ſalvation,</hi> then, <hi>with fear and trembling. For it is</hi> GOD <hi>which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure. Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon theſe ſlain that they may live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. What has been ſaid affords encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diligence in the uſe of thoſe means which GOD has inſtituted for the converſion and ſalvation of ſinners. When we conſider the utterly ruined and helpleſs ſtate of the ſinner in himſelf, and our inſufficiency to do any thing effectual for his recovery, our hearts are ready to ſink under diſcouragements, and our hands to hang down. And when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the many fruitleſs attempts which have been made, we are ready to deſpond, and to deſiſt from any farther endeavours. But when we realize that GOD who has appointed theſe means both can, and will render them effectual for accompliſhing the deſigns of his grace we take hope, and are encouraged to renew our exertions. It becomes not us to cavil; but with the Prophet to obey. He knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the dry bones, to which he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to propheſy, ſhould live or not. This he knew depended entirely upon the purpoſe and power of GOD. But, in obedience to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine command, he propheſied upon them, and called upon them to hear the word of the LORD. And as he propheſied, behold, there
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035738_0071_10064FDADEB4CF30"/>
was a noiſe and a ſhaking; and as he propheſied they lived and ſtood up. GOD has bound us to the uſe of the means; and, bleſſed be his name, he will put an honour on his own inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. What was the meſſage which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was to deliver to theſe dry bones? It was, <hi>Behold, I will cauſe breath to enter into you, and ye ſhall live.</hi> Let us never deſpair then, nor be diſcouraged in the uſe of the means whilſt GOD is mighty to ſave.</p>
            <p>Suffer me then, in the 4th place, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the power and grace of GOD, to render what may be ſaid effectual, to call upon every ſinner in this aſſembly to hear and obey the goſpel meſſage. <hi>Awake, thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſhall give thee light. What meaneſt thou, O ſleeper, ariſe, call upon thy</hi> GOD, <hi>if ſo be that</hi> GOD <hi>will think upon</hi> thee <hi>that</hi> thou <hi>periſh not. Repent, and be converted that your ſins may be blotted out. Believe in the</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit, for why will ye die.</hi> Let no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties nor diſcouragements deter you from making the attempt, and perſiſting in your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions until you ſucceed. Unleſs you ſucceed you are undone for ever. He who called La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus from the tomb, can equally call you from the death of ſin to a life of holineſs. Behold! the grace of the REDEEMER is infinite, and
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035738_0072_10064FDEB8998850"/>
it is freely tendered unto you. Behold! all the horrors of eternal death, on the one hand, to alarm and drive; and all the glory and joys of heaven, on the other, to allure and draw you. Up then, and be doing. Who knows what mercy and grace may be in ſtore for you. <hi>Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician there?</hi> Yes; there is a Phyſician, who is perfectly acquainted with every caſe; and a Balm that is a ſovereign remedy for every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. <hi>Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people reſtored?</hi> It is not owing to any want of power or grace, in the glorious RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER, that any pine away, and die with their treſpaſſes and their ſins upon them. <hi>As I live, ſaith the</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.</hi> But it is owing to their own perverſeneſs and wilful obſtinacy. They hold faſt their iniquities and will not let them go. <hi>And ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</hi> Perhaps the poor ſavage of the wilderneſs may welcome thoſe meſſages of grace which you reject and deſpiſe. Perhaps, alarming and diſtreſſing thought! perhaps, the diſtinguiſhing bleſſings and privileges of the goſpel may be taken away from thoſe who ſo greatly undervalue, and miſimprove them, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:035738_0073_10064FE046CAB560"/>In the 5th and laſt place. I would improve what has been ſaid by exhorting all to the moſt vigorous exertions in promoting the cauſe and intereſt of the REDEEMER in the world. It is a glorious cauſe, and ſhall finally prevail and triumph over all oppoſition. Moſt of you may contribute to its promotion in various ways: by your inſtructions, by your advice, by your contributions, and by your example. But there is one moſt effectual way in which all may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute: I mean, by their prayers. Let all then be excited to frequency, fervency and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in this duty. Ye that fear the LORD, give him no reſt until he eſtabliſh Jeruſalem, and make her a name and a praiſe in the earth. Our LORD ſpake the parable of the unjuſt judge and the importunate widow to teach us that we ought always to pray, and not to faint. <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man, availeth much.</hi> GOD has promiſed to do mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous things in righteouſneſs for his Church and people: But he has declared, I will yet be inquired of, by the houſe of Iſrael to do it for them. Were there many ſtirred up to wreſtle with GOD in prayer, in behalf of his Church, there would be ground to hope that the ſet time to favour Zion was come, and our eyes might yet ſee glorious days of the Son of man.</p>

               <salute>REVEREND AND DEAR BROTHER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE character in which you ſtand before this aſſembly is highly important, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly intereſting, to all who regard the ſouls of men, and the proſperity of the Redeemer's kingdom.—You ſtand here as the firſt meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger employed by the New-York Miſſionary Society, to carry the glad tidings of ſalvation to the heathen on our borders, who are <hi>periſhing for lack of knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:035738_0076_10064FE80D224630"/>You have the honour to be the firſt in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon thoſe labours which the liberality of our Chriſtian brethren has enabled us to commence, and to which we hope others, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the great Lord of the harveſt, will ſoon follow you. Every pious heart within theſe walls feels a tender intereſt in your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and beats high with anxious hope for the reſult of your miſſion!</p>
            <p>You are entering upon a new and untried ſcene of labour. Though you have been for ſome years clothed with the honourable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an ambaſſador of Chriſt, you cannot but be ſenſible, that the field of miniſterial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion to which you are haſtening, is widely different from that to which you have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto accuſtomed. You are going to a region which the joyful ſound of the goſpel has never yet reached—to a howling wilderneſs, where the arts of civilized life are almoſt unknown— to a people covered with the gloom of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſuperſtition and barbariſm. You are about to take upon yourſelf the mighty taſk of proclaiming the good news of ſalvation through a crucified Saviour, to thoſe who never heard of his name, and of carrying the light of the Sun of Righteouſneſs to thoſe who are ſitting in the region and ſhadow of death. Who can tell the conſequences of this ſolemn undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! Who can calculate how deeply the glory
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035738_0077_10064FE995401810"/>
of God—the intereſt of the Redeemer's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom—and the ſalvation of millions yet unborn, may be involved in this miſſion!</p>
            <p>Permit me, therefore, my dear brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we bid you adieu, permit me with all plainneſs and affection, in the name of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to which you are engaged, to offer you a few words of parting counſel, and to commend you by prayer to the great Head of the Church.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, Let me entreat you to maintain an holy jealouſy, and an unremitted watchfulneſs over your own heart. This is of the utmoſt importance, whether you regard your comfort or your uſefulneſs. Irkſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed will the labours of the wilderneſs be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you have grace in lively exerciſe—unleſs you are habitually animated by ardent love to Chriſt, and by a tender concern for precious and immortal ſouls. Nor can it be reaſonably expected, that the duties of your miſſion will be diſcharged with ſuch diligence and zeal, as to promiſe much ſucceſs, unleſs you are careful to keep alive in your own breaſt, a deep ſenſe of the importance of the truſt committed to you; and unleſs an holy ambition to advance your Maſter's kingdom, fire your boſom, and daily ſtir up the energies of your ſoul. And here, let me remind you, dear Sir, that the circumſtance of your being far removed from your brethren
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035738_0087_10065001D7F0D860"/>
in the miniſtry, and from the Chriſtian ſociety which you have hitherto enjoyed, will render peculiar attention to this point neceſſary. You have been accuſtomed to the animating conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and the conſoling intercourſe, of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian friends: But in the diſtant region to which you are going, you will be in a great meaſure cut off from theſe ſources of improvement and conſolation. The moſt you can expect from the objects of your miſſion, will be the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſavage barbariſm, and occaſional mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations to the wants of your body; you can expect to find no ſpiritual helpers among them —no gracious hearts that will anſwer to your own, as <hi>face anſwereth to face in a glaſs.</hi> In this ſituation it will be your intereſt and your duty to be more than ordinarily engaged in communing with God, and with your own heart—See that proper motives animate all your exertions, and direct all your labours —Guard equally againſt that ſelfiſh ambition which may lead you aſtray, and that criminal ſloth which will tempt you to ſhrink from the toils of your important embaſſy. Make it your daily ſtudy to live near to God, and to <hi>endure as ſeeing him who is inviſible. Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation.</hi> Seek after a continual increaſe of that <hi>precious faith</hi> which raiſes the ſoul more and more above the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the difficulties of this world—Study to grow in that holy love which <hi>hopeth all things,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035738_0079_10064FED19421468"/>
believeth all things, and</hi> ENDURETH <hi>all things. Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of your Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus may you expect to perform your arduous labours with comfort to yourſelf, and with uſefulneſs to the ſouls of men.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, While you exerciſe a ſolicitous care over your own heart, ſtudy to deliver to the poor heathen the plain, genuine and unadorned goſpel of Chriſt. We charge you before God, that you <hi>know nothing among them, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer yourſelf to ſubſtitute human devices for the ſimplicity of evangelical truth. Believe it, my brother, if ever you ſucceed in convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heathen from ſin to holineſs, and from Satan to the living God, it muſt be by the <hi>pure goſpel of the Saviour.</hi> This is the <hi>ſharp two-edged ſword, which pierceth even to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow; and which diſcerneth the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> This is <hi>the weapon which is mighty through God to the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of ſtrong holds, and which bringeth every thought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi> Diligently endeavour, then, in your public preaching, and in your private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, to impreſs upon their rude minds, that <hi>all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God—that by the works of the law no fleſh living
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035738_0080_10064FF1C371C660"/>
can be juſtified—that ſinners are juſtified, freely by God's grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>—and that <hi>his blood cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi> Do not waſte your time <hi>in doting about queſtions and ſtrifes of words;</hi> or in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing the ſubtilties of polemic divinity. Do not imagine that you will be able to remove all the objections which the carnal mind may make to evangelical truth; and therefore do not dwell on theſe, but rather imitate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the apoſtles, who inſiſt much on the fall and depravity of man; on the incarnation, the humiliation, the atonement, and the glory of Jeſus Chriſt. Endeavour often to give ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and affecting recitals of his love, his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, his death, his reſurrection and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion to glory; and the obligations we are under to the unſearchable riches of his grace. —Take every opportunity of impreſſing theſe truths on their minds; deliver them with plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with pungency and with affection—<hi>not in the enticing words of man's wiſdom, but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the ſpirit and of power.</hi>—And for this purpoſe, let the ſcriptures of truth be your daily ſtudy, and the great ſtandard of your preaching. This ſacred volume contains at once your commiſſion and your inſtructions— Keeping cloſe to this, as the rule of your mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and living near to the Lord Jeſus, as the Captain of your ſalvation, you may ſafely truſt him for the fruits of all your labours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:035738_0081_10064FF3501E6378"/>Once more, Let your example among the heathen correſpond with your preaching—let your converſation be a living comment on the pure goſpel, which you recommend to them— teſtify to them every day, that the religion which you preach has its proper effect on your own heart and life—and that you are by grace yourſelf what you would perſuade them to be. If they ſee you violating thoſe precepts of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, temperance, purity and univerſal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which you will of courſe deliver to them, it will diſgrace your character and deſtroy your uſefulneſs. An immoral miniſter of the goſpel is every where an odious and a miſchievous character; but an immoral <hi>miſſionary,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy meſſenger of ſalvation to the benighted heathen, is peculiarly odious, and is likely to be an hundred fold more miſchievous: For while the uncultivated ſavage is oftentimes ſhrewd and diſcerning, and is ſoon ſhocked with the inconſiſtency of ſuch a character, he is deprived of thoſe advantages, which, if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, might take away in ſome meaſure the force of ſuch fatal example—and thus he is left to all its deſtructive influence—and is hereby tempted to loathe and ſhun a religion which has ſuch profeſſors. Be careful, then, to walk worthy of your high calling, in all lowlineſs and meekneſs—letting <hi>your light ſo ſhine before the heathen, that they may ſee your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:035738_0082_10064FF4F4A4F590"/>And here I would, in an eſpecial manner, enjoin it upon you, to exhibit to the ſavage tribes among whom you may labour, upon all occaſions, that frank, open and diſintereſted character, that is always impreſſive, even on the minds of barbarians. Never give them cauſe to ſuſpect you of mercenary motives, or of hidden and diſingenuous deſigns. All expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience proves that the moment any thing of this kind is diſcovered, your influence will be at an end. Let your diligence, your zeal, your ſelf-denial and mortification to the world, convince them, that you <hi>ſeek not</hi> THEIRS, <hi>but</hi> THEM— that the governing end of all your labours is to promote their temporal and eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Accommodate yourſelf, as far as the purity of the goſpel will admit, to their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and their prejudices—and let your apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic zeal be tempered with that apoſtolic pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which <hi>became all things to all men, that he might gain ſome. Be wiſe as a ſerpent and harmleſs as a dove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, my dear brother, you have every reaſon to expect that you will meet with many trials, and even formidable difficulties. You will have to contend with the perils of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and with the numerous inconveniencies of barbarous life. You will have to encounter the obſtacles ariſing from the ferocious temper, the roving diſpoſition, the ſuperſtitious preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035738_0083_10064FF690F68B68"/>
and the profound ignorance of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then tribes, to which you are going. In ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the numerous diſcouragements which ordinarily beſet the ambaſſador of Chriſt, you will have many peculiar to your ſituation as a miſſionary among the heathen. Theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which, were there nothing to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance them, would appal the ſtouteſt heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let none of theſe things move you.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the divine commiſſion, <hi>Go ye into all the world and preach the goſpel to every creature.</hi> And remember the gracious promiſe with which it was accompanied—"<hi>Lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world.</hi>" Go in the name and in the ſtrength, therefore, of the mighty God of Jacob! <hi>Endure hardneſs as a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt. Count not even your life dear unto you, that you may finiſh your courſe with joy,</hi> and ſucceſsfully accompliſh the great ends of the miniſtry you have received from the Lord Jeſus. Happy and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed will you be, if God ſhould make you an inſtrument of haſtening on the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous period, when <hi>the deſert ſhall rejoice and bloſſom as the roſe—when thoſe who are afar off ſhall be brought nigh by the blood of Chriſt</hi> —when <hi>the heathen ſhall be given to him for an inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion</hi>—and when <hi>all the ends of
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035738_0084_10064FFB31689710"/>
the earth ſhall ſee the ſalvation of our God.</hi> Go in peace! May you have grace to be faithful unto death! and when <hi>the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, may you receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away!</hi>

            <head>INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE DIRECTORS OF THE NEW-YORK MISSIONARY SOCIETY, TO THEIR MISSIONARIES among the INDIANS.</head>
            <p>IN this early ſtage of the miſſion, very particular inſtructions cannot be expected. You will be furniſhed with them from time to time, according to the circumſtances which ariſe; and ſomething muſt ever be left to your own prudence. There are, however, certain inſtructions which will apply at all times and in all circumſtances, and by which you are, invariably, to guide yourſelves. Theſe reſpect chiefly, I. Your perſonal religion. II. The matter and manner of your teaching. III. Your outward deportment. IV. The formation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious aſſemblies, and the adminiſtration of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. V. The eſtabliſhment of ſchools for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. VI. Obſervations on the language and cuſtoms of the Indians; and on the proſpects of making ſettlements, and extending the goſpel among them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Your perſonal religion.</hi> No words can expreſs the importance of this, and urge it with ſufficient warmth. Your comfort and ſucceſs in your work depend upon it. Without it, the fineſt genius,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035738_0086_10064FFE495747F8"/>
the higheſt literary acquirements and the greateſt eloquence will be unavailing. By this we mean not only that your hope of an intereſt in the Saviour be well founded, but that you conſtantly ſtrive to maintain the power of religion in your hearts; that you live near to God; giving yourſelves much to ſolemn meditation and prayer. As you need in your difficult and perilous ſituation, uncommon love to God, zeal for his glory, and communications of divine wiſdom and ſtrength, ſo you ſhould habitual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek theſe, in the full aſſurance of faith that they will be afforded. Though what is called oſtentation in religion is to be avoided as vile, yet endeavour to live in ſuch a manner as that thoſe who obſerve you may believe you to be holy men, denied to yourſelves, crucified to this world, and whoſe converſation is in heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The matter and manner of your teaching.</hi> As to the <hi>matter,</hi> let it be the great and peculiar doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of divine revelation; ſuch as the ſin and miſery of man by the fall; the eternal counſel of God, revealed in time, to ſave ſinners by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his own Son; the incarnation, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſufferings and death of the Son of God, in the room of ſinners; his reſurrection, aſcenſion, interceſſion in heaven, and the final judgment; the application of the redemption of Chriſt by the Holy Spirit, and the abſolute neceſſity of his agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to change the hearts of men, and bring them to holineſs and happineſs. The confeſſion of faith contained in the conſtitution of the Society, is to be the confeſſion of your faith, and your teaching is to be conformable thereto. We believe that theſe doctrines are appointed by God, and found in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to be the only and effectual means of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035738_0078_10064FEB20E9B478"/>
impreſſing the minds of men, reforming their lives, and turning them to holineſs.</p>
            <p>We warn, yea, we charge you, our beloved brethren, againſt ſetting up your own wiſdom; againſt preaching natural religion diſtinct from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; againſt founding moral conduct on any other principle than the grace of God. We enjoin you to declare, as your hearers are prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, <hi>the whole counſel of God;</hi> and to remember in all your miniſtrations, that <hi>Chriſt crucified is unto them which are called, the power of God, and the wiſdom of God.</hi> We would enforce what we ſay on this particular by quoting part of the inſtructions given to the Miſſionaries to the Iſlands of the South-Sea.<note n="*" place="bottom">Counſels and inſtructions for the regulation of the Miſſion, by the Directors of the London Miſſionary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</note> "The bible, and the experience of the moſt ſucceſsful miſſions, aſſure us, that the great doctrine of the Atonement muſt be the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone. The glory and the humiliation of Jeſus, and every thing relative to the deliverance from ſin and death by him muſt make the ground-work. A ſimple recital of his love, the deſign of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, death, and reſurrection; theſe muſt be the points, chiefly, repeatedly dwelt upon. The obligations of love and duty which we owe him, naturally connect themſelves with theſe views; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with promiſes of his grace, through the agency of his own ſpirit, to enable us to follow him in the regeneration. Affect not ſubtilties and deep points of controverſy, either among yourſelves or with the natives. Wave as much as poſſible what would lead to queſtions, rather than godly edifying.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035738_0088_1006500363B046B8"/>
Attempt not by arguments on the reaſonableneſs, or evidences of the Chriſtian religion, to diſplay your own wiſdom; or ſuppoſe you can anſwer and ſilence all their objections. Adhere to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity which is in Chriſt, truſting to the power of the Holy Ghoſt to take the things of Chriſt, and ſhew them to their conſciences with divine convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and effectual energy."</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>manner</hi> of your teaching, let it be ſuch as is beſt adapted to the comprehenſion of your hearers. It muſt needs be, when to the untutored Indian, and when by an interpreter, very plain, in ſhort ſentences, and frequently interrupted; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking more of the nature of converſation, than of formal and continued diſcourſe. This will demand of you much condeſcenſion, patience, and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. You muſt become children to adapt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to childiſh underſtandings, and patience muſt have her perfect work, in bearing with ignorance, petulance, and ſlowneſs of apprehenſion. Do not deſpond when you ſee no immediate fruits of your labours, but wait in humble dependence on the Spirit of God to give efficacy to his word. As the reading of written diſcourſes will not be neceſſary, ſo we would adviſe againſt it. Great attention will be required in finding proper interpreters, and it will be deſirable, if practicable, that only thoſe be employed who are converts to the Chriſtian faith. You will take pains to acquire as ſoon and as much as you can, a knowledge of the Indian language, that ſo you may not be ſubjected to the inconvenience, and, perhaps to the unſkilfulneſs or unfaithfulneſs of interpreters.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:035738_0089_1006500607F76208"/>III. <hi>Your outward deportment.</hi> This is a matter to which we wiſh you carefully to attend. You muſt be grave, ſober, honeſt, chaſte, meek, and faithful to your word. The Indians are grave in tranſacting all their buſineſs, and they expect the ſame in others. They neither admire nor truſt a light and trifling character. They are ſaid to pay a ſtrict regard to truth. Be not you haſty in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring your intentions, and in making promiſes; but when made, let them be faithfully and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fulfilled. They exhibit on many occaſions acuteneſs and ſagacity. They diſcern deviations from that natural law which is written in their hearts, and, if they find you defective, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their confidence, and prejudice them againſt the goſpel. The ſtricteſt attention to theſe things is the more neceſſary, on account of the intercourſe which has ſubſiſted between the nations of Indians and ſome white people, in which the latter have groſsly deceived and cheated the former, committed crimes not even named among the heathen, and brought an unjuſt reproach upon the Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. If you can make the Indians ſenſible of the difference between nominal and real Chriſtians, and the impropriety of judging of Chriſtianity by the conduct of ſome who never felt its influence, who violate all its precepts, and who are caſt out by real Chriſtians as unworthy of communion, a great point would be gained.</p>
            <p>We farther inſtruct you to abſtain from all traffic, all buying and ſelling of lands, all political diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions, and in one word, from every thing which might excite a ſuſpicion that your errand is for any other purpoſe, or that you have any other object in view, than, ſingly, their ſpiritual and eternal
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035738_0090_10065007A2102760"/>
welfare. It is of the utmoſt importance that you adhere to this line of conduct, and thus impreſs the Indians with a conviction of your love to them being great, and not influenced by ſelfiſh conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Impoſed upon in times paſt, and awakened by the novelty of your miſſion, they will pry into your motives, and diligently mark your actions. <hi>Put no ſtumbling-block, or an occaſion to fall in their way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By denying yourſelves to ſtrong liquors, you may ſave yourſelves both trouble and blame. It is well known how fond the Indians are of rum, and how pernicious it is to them. Should they ſee you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in the uſe, it will whet their deſires, and they will plead your example.</p>
            <p>The Miſſionaries of the United Brethren, uſually called Moravians, have never been in the practice of making preſents to the Indians to gain their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and protection; nor are they to be encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to expect any from you. Beſide that preſents would open the door for an expence which the funds of the Society will not admit, we had rather you ſhould gain their favor by more ſubſtantial acts of kindneſs; and teach them that they owe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs for your own, in foregoing every earthly advantage and comfort to bring them <hi>the unſearchable riches of Chriſt.</hi> The Society will make every exertion in their power to promote their knowledge of, and attention to agriculture and the arts of civilized life; but nothing is to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for gewgaws and tinſel ornaments.</p>
            <p>On whatever regards your external accommodation, we can only ſay, that it may be neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035738_0091_1006500940A8AF98"/>
to the habits of living among the Indians, ſo far as is lawful and decent; and, eſpecially, that you ſubmit to the coarſeſt fare and the hardeſt lodging without diſſatisfaction and complaint. To expect the conveniences of civilized life, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray a want of the miſſionary ſpirit. The great Apoſtle of the Gentiles knew, <hi>both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need;</hi> and his divine Maſter, the Lord and Saviour of us all, when he dwelt upon this earth, <hi>had not where to lay his head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing of great moment in your conduct may be mentioned here, which is, that you ſhun diſſenſions among yourſelves. While you are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to ſpeak of the diviſions which ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prevail in the Chriſtian world, you ſhould exhibit in your own ſociety true love and concord. Never differ about particular modes and ceremonies of worſhip, or things not eſſential; conſidering that your work is to win men to Chriſt, and not to make proſelytes to any ſect or denomination whatever. In caſe of your meeting with Miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries from other denominations, and of a different faith, you are to ſhun public diſputation with them, and to purſue, with mildneſs, firmneſs, and ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, your own ſyſtem. The Miſſionaries of the United Brethren, particularly, are entitled to your eſteem and confidence, the Lord having honored them in their long and indefatigable labours. We think that a mutual confidence and correſpondence might ſubſiſt; and that, without interfering, you ſhould provoke each other <hi>unto love, and to good works</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We cannot better adviſe you on the ſubject of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> in the words of the excellent charge
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035738_0092_1006500D99471D78"/>
addreſſed to the Miſſionaries already mentioned.* "Let me adviſe you not only to guard againſt falling out by the way, (which God prevent!) and to love one another out of a pure heart fervently, but even let the poor ignorant natives <hi>take knowledge</hi> of you, that you do ſo love one another, and that with the love of benevolence you are affectionately attached to <hi>them.</hi> Let them be conſtrained to ſay, 'Behold how theſe new-comers love one another!' And again, in the words of the Inſtructions; "Bear and forbear: holding the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace. Satan's chief device will be to divide you. Form no parties, nor cabals; ever remember the words of the Lord: <hi>He</hi> is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in his kingdom, who is the <hi>ſervant of all.</hi> We requeſt it ſolemnly, we adjure you in the Great Maſter's name, <hi>Love one another out of a pure heart fervently.</hi> Your examples muſt preach as powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as your words. But if ever bitter envyings and ſtrife ariſe, you will put an effectual bar to your own uſefulneſs, and defeat the great purpoſe of your miſſion. Let all your zeal, therefore, be reſerved for your work, and let no ſelfiſh paſſions mingle with it, to corrupt the ſimplicity which is in Chriſt."</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>The formation of religious aſſemblies, and the adminiſtration of ordinances.</hi> It will be proper to have ſixed places in the villages or moſt populous diſtricts where to aſſemble, with the Indians who may attend, on the Lord's day, and occaſionally on other days, for public worſhip; and when circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances admit, to conſtitute regular congregations.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035738_0093_100646DBF165E790"/>
This ſhould not, however prevent the itinerating from place to place, where acceſs can be had for preaching the goſpel.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as a few Indians are brought to embrace the faith, are inſtructed in the great truths of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and give good hope of ſtedfaſtneſs in their profeſſion, they are to be publicly initiated the church by baptiſm, and afterwards their children. As ſoon alſo, as it appears to be for edification, the holy ſupper of our Lord is to be adminiſtered to all the baptized adults. We enjoin, at the ſame time, that none be admitted to theſe ſeals of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, without frequent converſation, and ſufficient ſpace for trial. A haſty admiſſion is injurious to the perſons themſelves, and they may, by their apoſtacy, deeply wound the cauſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When Indian women ſeek inſtruction in private, let one of the women of the miſſion be their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; or, let the converſation be held in the preſence of their huſbands, fathers, or others, ſo as to avoid temptation, and the ſmalleſt cauſe of ſuſpicion to the Indians. We enjoin the utmoſt circumſpection in this matter.</p>
            <p>Happy conſequences will enſue from teaching the Indians the uſefulneſs and ſacredneſs of the Lord's day, from teaching them the nature and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the married ſtate, and, as frequently as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſolemnizing it with exhortation and prayer.</p>
            <p>As the ſinging of pſalms is a neceſſary and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of divine worſhip, we recommend that it be introduced as ſoon as convenient. It will be acceptable to the Indians, and as ſuch you ſhould
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035738_0094_100650122895DCB0"/>
practice it in your private and public devotion, and teach it to them. The tunes which are adopted ſhould be of the ſimpleſt, eaſieſt, and graveſt kind.</p>
            <p>Some of the Indians who give reaſonable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their converſion, and are otherwiſe the beſt qualified, may be profitably employed as interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, inſtructors, or exhorters. Their knowledge of the language, diſpoſitions and manners of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, will give them a powerful advantage, and they will be an unſpeakable ſecurity, ſupport and comfort to you.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>The eſtabliſhment of ſchools for children.</hi> This will require your early and unintermitted attention. By inſtructing children, or rather <hi>youth,</hi> in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh language, the way will be prepared for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel hereafter with ſucceſs, and there will be an opportunity of inſtilling ſound principles, and gradually gaining them over to civilization and religion. Were no other preſent advantage to offer than this, the next generation might ſee the moſt extenſive and beneficial effects. Wherever a ſchool or ſchools can be eſtabliſhed, it will be the duty of the perſons employed to teach, diligently to attend to this buſineſs; and while the children are taught the moſt common branches of learning, to teach them the principles of the Chriſtian religion, and to lead them, morning and evening, in prayer and ſinging praiſes to God.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Obſervations on the language and cuſtoms of the Indians, and on the proſpects of making ſettlements, and extending the goſpel among them.</hi> Every thing which relates to the Indians, is an object not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of curioſity, but of real utility. By their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035738_0095_10065013B31B38B0"/>
and cuſtoms we are moſt likely to arrive at their origin. A vocabulary of Engliſh words, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and already ſent out by a Gentleman engaged in inquiries of this kind, will be put into your hands, and you are deſired to mark the Indian names for theſe things, that ſo the number of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and the different dialects may be aſcertained. The Directors will make inquiry as to the aſſiſtance which is to be expected from the tranſlations which have been made into ſome Indian languages of parts of the holy ſcriptures, and, if found ſerviceable, means will be taken to ſupply you with them.</p>
            <p>On the ſubject of obtaining land, and forming a ſettlement among them, you are to be extremely cautious, as they diſcover jealouſy and oppoſition. We adviſe that you do not ſolicit it, but wait for the propoſal to come from them; and that you ſhow them that you are not actuated by ambition or ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and deſire no farther footing or property among them than is neceſſary in order to your ſerving them in their moſt valuable intereſts. In this delicate affair, and one which may be attended <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

Theſe and every thing proper for the information of the Society, together with the copy of an exact journal which you muſt keep of all your proceedings, you are to tranſmit to the Secretary once every ſix months, and oftener if occaſion requires.

            <head>THE REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS.</head>
            <p>SOON after the laſt report, the Directors adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a plan for ſocial prayer which has been carried into execution, and it is believed, has been attended with beneficial effects. The ſecond wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday in every month, meetings are held for this purpoſe in rotation, in all the churches of which the Miniſters are members of the Society; and, though no contributions are urged, yet whatever are made, are applied for the benefit of the Society.</p>
            <p>The Directors judged it to be their duty to begin a Miſſion as ſoon as poſſible, and accordingly they early appointed a committee to obtain Miſſionaries, and arrange what appeared neceſſary on this head. The committee advertiſed time after time with little apparent ſucceſs. Receiving, however, intimation
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035738_0098_10065019C1A7D7E8"/>
from the Rev. Mr. Joſeph Bullen, of Vermont, that he would be willing to accept an appointment as a Miſſionary, and being aſcertained as to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and qualifications, they recommended him; and the Directors agreed to employ him at the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſalary of three hundred and ſeventy-five dollars, and to defray his expences in travelling to the place of his deſtination. They agreed, at the ſame time, that it would be moſt eligible to attempt the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a Miſſion firſt among the Chickaſaw Indians, a nation on the weſtern borders of the ſtate of Georgia; and Mr. Bullen was requeſted to come on without delay. They alſo advanced him part of his ſalary to aſſiſt in his preparation, and requeſted him to preach on a certain evening in one of the churches, on which occaſion the Preſident of the Society was appointed to give him a charge as to the duties of his miſſion. The above requeſt was complied with on the 21ſt of laſt month, when he preached, received a charge, and was ſet apart to his work by ſolemn prayer. The Directors ſupplied him with a few books and articles which were deemed proper, and advanced him two hundred and fifty dollars to defray the expences incidental to his journey and miſſion. He left this city on the 26th of laſt month, accompanied by his ſon, a lad of about ſeventeen years of age, and who, it is ſuppoſed, will readily acquire the Indian language, and may be uſeful in teaching the Indian children; but he is not, at preſent, in the employ of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors. Certain documents from the Government of the United States were cheerfully granted at Philadelphia to Mr. Bullen, and private directions and letters were given him by Gentlemen who kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and warmly intereſted themſelves in the buſineſs. The laſt account of him is from Lancaſter in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035738_0099_1006501B507CA848"/>
on the firſt of this month, when he wrote that his journey had been ſo far proſperous, and that he had not been without evident tokens of the divine preſence.<note n="*" place="bottom">Since this report was made, a letter has been received from Mr. Bullen, dated Knoxville, in the ſtate of Teneſſee, April 24th. He had arrived, through the goodneſs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, thus far ſafe; and he mentions that, according to his beſt information, he had to travel five hundred miles farther by land before he could reach the Chickaſaw towns. He mentions alſo, that the Cherokees who reſide in the vicinity of the Teneſſee are deſirous of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>The Directors farther report, that on the petition referred by the Society to them, from the Rev. Mr. John Sergeant, a Miſſionary to the Stockbridge In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, they have ſent for his relief one hundred dollars, and they have been happy to learn that the relief was uncommonly ſeaſonable. They have alſo granted ſixty dollars for one year to Paul an Indian preacher who labours among the remains of the Shinnecock, Montack, and Pooſpettuck tribes in Suſſolk county, Long-Iſland.</p>
            <p>Letters have been received by the Secretary from the Glaſgow Miſſionary Society, and from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Baptiſt Miſſionary Society in England, in anſwer to letters written to them.</p>
            <p>The general Inſtructions to Miſſionaries, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Chiefs and Indians of the Chickaſaw nations, and the Charge given to the firſt Miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, accompany this report.</p>

The Society and its benevolent ſupporters will ſee that the Directors have not been inattentive to the important truſt repoſed in them; but that they have proſecuted it, under the ſmiles of heaven, to a degree of ſucceſs. If the proſpects of the Miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary already ſent ſhould prove encouraging, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſtrengthen him by others; nor are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources to be deſpaired of, in this glorious undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Inconſiderable as the beginnings may ſeem, no one can calculate their probable increaſe, and tendency to promote the kingdom of the divine Redeemer. He is King on the holy hill of Zion, and it is the irreverſible decree of God the Father, to give to his Son <hi>the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion.</hi>

               <p>The Society, at their annual meeting in Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber laſt did little more than elect Officers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors for the enſuing year. Such was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement occaſioned by the mortal ſickneſs which had prevailed in the city, that they adjourned to meet on the 23d of April following, then to hear the ſermons, and to tranſact whatever buſineſs ſeemed neceſſary.
